<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Once upon a time, life was perfect for Agatha and Rio Harkness-Vidal. In their early thirties, they both had thriving careers and a home life that was made immaculate with the arrival of their son, Nicholas.</p>
<p>Four months after his birth and after the recruitment of a nanny, Rio arrives home to an empty house and no trace of her son or the nanny.</p>
<p>What first seemed hopeful carries on for twenty-five very long years until suddenly, the unthinkable happens.</p>
<p>In The Big Apple, a mere car ride away from the Harkness-Vidal home in Newark, a twenty-five year old physical therapist who has always wondered about his mother's avoidance about his other parent decides to take an ancestry test. His girlfriend bought it for him for his birthday and, well, if his mother won't provide answers to his questions, he'll get them on his own.</p>
<p>When his sample flags as a match to a two-and-a-half decade old DNA sample from a missing person's case, he gets far more of them than he ever could have imagined.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>

<b> <em>April 18th, 2000</em> </b>
</p><p align="center" dir="ltr">
<u> <b> Rio. </b> </u>
</p><p dir="ltr">She had only been ten minutes late.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio Harkness-Vidal was <em>never</em> late, but her consult with the representatives of a large commercial banking company that <em>her </em>company would be catering a massive event for had run eight minutes over.</p><p dir="ltr">It had taken her two minutes to pee on her way out.</p><p dir="ltr">After washing her hands, Rio took a quick survey in the mirror. She was met by rich amber eyes and tousled dark hair that was poorly maintained in a low bun. There was a soft dusting of freckles that seemed to pop whenever her cheeks went rosy. Well, at least she was just going home. She grabbed her phone and shot a text to the nanny that had been taking care of her son, Nicky. Agatha, her wife, had known days ahead of time that on that day in particular, she was going to be home late.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio had thought that at some point on her way home, she would get a text back from Wanda with some kind of update. Then again...</p><p dir="ltr">Rio grabbed her Blackberry out of the cupholder and did something she knew Agatha would choke her for -- not in the fun way -- and dug through her inbox while she drove. When she pulled up her messages with Wanda, she noticed for the first time that they were rather... empty. Normally the nanny would send her updates on their day or photos of Nicky. If not to her alone, then to the group message the three women occupied for the sake of Nicky's care.</p><p dir="ltr">It had been four months since Agatha had given birth to their son and while going back to a normal work schedule had been hard on the both of them, Rio had told herself time and time again that it was simply a fact of life, something they had to perpetuate as adults. The duty of responsibility could be fickle in that way.</p><p dir="ltr">The search for a nanny had been tricky, to say the least. While Rio tended to make decisions based on observations, Agatha made them on judgements. Agatha took all that she saw at face value and made a decision on the spot.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps therein lie the current issue: Agatha had deemed Wanda Maximoff suitable to care for their son pretty quickly, though she had followed up with a thorough vetting after the fact.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet, Rio was only ten minutes late and the house was empty.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, and Wanda still hadn't answered her text messages.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio checked the time and cursed from her place in the middle of the living room, knowing full well that Agatha was in surgery for at least another hour.</p><p dir="ltr">That gave Rio time to figure out what the fuck was going on.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the fuck was Wanda?</p><p dir="ltr">More importantly, where <em>the fuck</em> was Nicky?</p><p dir="ltr">Even though she had done it once upon arriving, Rio searched the house again. Wanda usually took a cab, so the fact that there was no car was of no consequence. Her pace was unhindered as she sped through the house, checking every room.</p><p dir="ltr">Den: empty.</p><p dir="ltr">Living room: empty.</p><p dir="ltr">Office: empty.</p><p dir="ltr">Bathroom: empty.</p><p dir="ltr">She took the stairs two at a time to check the upper story.</p><p dir="ltr">Nicky's room: empty.</p><p dir="ltr">Hers and Agatha's room: empty.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Where the fuck was Nicky?</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">Rio tried calling Wanda again. This time, it didn't even ring and just went straight to voicemail. She tried again, just for good measure, only to be met with the same result. Now, Rio was beginning to panic.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the fuck could Wanda have possibly gone and why had she not let Rio know? Agatha, that was understandable because she was in an operating room more hours of the day than she was not, but she always could have messaged Rio, or even called. She wasn't always able to pick up right away, but if she ever saw a missed call, <em>especially</em> from Wanda, she called back immediately.</p><p dir="ltr">In her panic, Rio was struggling to figure out the right thing to do. She should sit and wait, maybe Wanda would come back. If she didn't come back, Agatha would surely accost Rio up and down for staying idle and not making more of an effort in the span of an hour. So what the fuck did she do? Where did she even start?</p><p dir="ltr">She would go to Wanda's. It wasn't that far and she could probably get there within ten minutes if she gave little regard to the majority of traffic laws.</p><p dir="ltr">So that was what Rio did.</p><p dir="ltr">When she got there, something akin to dread began to fill her stomach, swirling and churning like she simply <em>knew</em> something was wrong even before she approached the door. The knocking was more of a banging as Rio's fist thudded against the wood.</p><p dir="ltr">"Wanda? Wanda, are you in there? Wanda?!" Rio called, thumping her fist to the door again.</p><p dir="ltr">She waited, but an answer never came.</p><p dir="ltr">With a disregard for Wanda's privacy at that point, Rio tried the door handle.</p><p dir="ltr">It opened.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio pushed it, revealing more of the interior of the house. What she found inside caused her to throw up onto the hardwood.</p><p dir="ltr">Judging by the several missing items and the disheveled state of what was left, Wanda had vacated in a hurry. And it did not look like she planned on coming back.</p><p dir="ltr">No. No, this could <em>not</em> be happening. Wanda had simply absconded with their fucking kid?! What the fuck was actually going on?!</p><p dir="ltr">Rio tried to call her again. And again. And again and again. Still standing in Wanda's kitchen, Rio had called her 25 times. Every time, she only got Wanda's voicemail. 15 of those times, she left scathing messages where she shouted that Wanda needed to call her as soon as she could and explain what the fuck was going on.</p><p dir="ltr">Checking the time once more, Rio's stomach melted into the floor, already void of its contents. Agatha would be finishing work soon and Rio had no idea how to explain this. How did she tell her wife that she had come home to an empty house and Wanda and Nicky were nowhere to be found? How did she explain to Agatha that she had only been ten minutes late, as if that were the reason this had happened in the first place when it clearly was not?</p><p dir="ltr">Where did one even look for someone who had no car and wasn't either of the two places she was supposed to be?</p><p dir="ltr">Rio bit down on her lip, hard enough that she almost immediately tasted the copper on the tip of her tongue. She stared down at her phone, her indecision nearly crippling her. She needed to text Agatha. She needed to at least tell her wife to call her the moment she could, and they could go from there.</p><p dir="ltr">Right?</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p align="center" dir="ltr">
<b> <u>Agatha.</u> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">Microsurgical resections were getting easier. At least, they'd gotten to be that way after the fourth one Agatha Harkness-Vidal had performed. It was something she could do with ease, something that felt almost automatic anymore. Sure, every patient could be different, but those processes stayed all the same.</p><p dir="ltr">As Agatha stripped herself of her outerwear -- including her gown, gloves and scrub cap that had been maintaining that wild light brown mane of hair, one that couldn't be tamed by the bun she'd thrown it in -- she let her thoughts drift homeward, to what would be awaiting her after an impossibly long day. She was tired and wanted nothing more than to make her way home, shower off the day, and curl up on the couch with her wife and their four-month-old to decompress.</p><p dir="ltr">It had been a successful day, but it had been difficult and exhausting in a way that Agatha loved, but still lost energy over. All she needed was leftover stir fry and the love of her family and she would be recharged and ready to take on the following day.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time Agatha had been able to retrieve her phone from her locker, nothing had felt amiss. Not until she checked her messages and had 12 from Rio over the span of an hour.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>I need you to call me when you see this.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>I know you're in surgery right now, but as soon as you see this call me.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Agatha I don't know what to do.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>I searched the whole fucking house.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Wanda is gone.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">What the fuck did <em>that</em> mean? How could Wanda be gone?</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha kept scrolling, watching as Rio's hysteria visibly grew in text.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>She's not at the house.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>She's not at her house.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>She won't answer her phone.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Agatha, I don't know what the fuck to do.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Do I call the police?</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>Agatha I have no fucking clue what to do.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">It was the last message that made every one before it make perfect sense.</p><p dir="ltr">
<em>She has Nicky. She took Nicky with her.</em>
</p><p dir="ltr">SHE WHAT?</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha's first reaction should have been to call Rio, to get a full briefing of what the fuck was actually going on. She should have checked on her wife, tried to comfort her in some way while they got this figured out.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Agatha chose to call Wanda.</p><p dir="ltr">She was fucking furious when her voicemail picked up immediately. The moment that beep sounded, all hell was unleashed and Agatha did not care who in that hospital heard her.</p><p dir="ltr">"Wanda fucking Maximoff, if you do not call one of us back AS SOON AS FUCKING POSSIBLE, I swear to God I will scour this fucking city from top to bottom to find you AND SO HELP ME GOD you will regret whatever the fuck you are thinking by DISAPPEARING WITH MY FUCKING SON! So if you have any GODDAMN SENSE in that fucking head of yours, YOU WILL CALL ONE OF US BACK IMMEDIATELY."</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha nearly broke her phone in the act of disconnecting the call, punching the red phone button with hysteric fury.</p><p dir="ltr">After grabbing her jacket and nearly sprinting through the hospital, Agatha was in her car and flying toward home before she had enough sense fill her to know she needed to call her wife. She dialed out and put the phone on speaker so she could keep driving. When Rio answered, she sounded frenzied and unrestrained.</p><p dir="ltr">"Agatha, I'm --"</p><p dir="ltr">"Where are you?!" Agatha snapped, cutting her off. Her head whipped over her shoulder as she changed lanes abruptly, missing the nose of the car behind her by mere inches.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm at Wanda's. The cops are here. I called them a few minutes after the last message I sent you. I... I didn't know what else to do."</p><p dir="ltr">Rio sounded so fucking upset and while Agatha understood it, she couldn't relate. Agatha was fucking angry, so angry that she was certain her body temperature had raised at least five degrees.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm on my way there now. It should only be a couple of minutes." Agatha's voice was sharp and cold like the blade of a pristine and new hunting knife, slicing right through the line and consequently, right through her wife.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry, Agatha... I... I was only ten minutes late." Rio's voice started to break over her words and something in Agatha aligned with reality.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though it still came out cold, Agatha meant what she had to say. "Rio, she was gone longer than ten minutes. You being on time wouldn't have made a difference."</p><p dir="ltr">"I... I know, I just..."</p><p dir="ltr">This was what happened when major crises occurred. Rio panicked. Agatha got angry.</p><p dir="ltr">In those moments, speeding through the streets of Newark, Agatha was more than just angry. The rage she was feeling that was only amplified by her anxiety and it was overwhelming her. She couldn't break down behind the wheel of a car and she could not wreck it before she got to Wanda's house, but Agatha wanted to <em>scream.</em> She wanted to throw something and hit something and come undone in her fury. She couldn't do that if she died before meeting solid ground again.</p><p dir="ltr">How the fuck had this happened? How had she been so convinced that they had found someone trustworthy enough to care for their son and let this unfold as a result? Agatha had been fooled, which was quite a difficult feat to manage, but it left her wondering: How long had this been the plan? Did Wanda just wake up that morning and decide to kidnap a child? <em>Their</em> child?</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps therein lie the root of why this had enraged her: She had pushed for Wanda. She had been so confident that those judgements she'd made were fair and safe. There had been a genuine sense of trust there, and she felt like a fucking idiot. Never could she imagined that the woman would be capable of such insane levels of duplicity and yet, there Agatha sat in that car fighting to not stomp the gas pedal to the floor.</p><p dir="ltr">She took a breath at the sound of Rio sniffling on the other end of the line.</p><p dir="ltr">"Rio," Agatha voiced, glancing down at her phone where it sat on her knee for the briefest moment before looking back to the road. "This isn't your fault. If anything, it's mind for trusting that stupid bitch."</p><p dir="ltr">Rio sniffled again.</p><p dir="ltr">"Are you almost here?" Rio asked in a squeak right as Agatha turned the corner onto Wanda's street.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm pulling up now."</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p align="center" dir="ltr">
<b> <em>May 5th, 2000</em></b>
</p><p align="center" dir="ltr">
<b> <u>Rio.</u> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">It had been seventeen days since Rio and Agatha had last seen their son the morning they each kissed him on the forehead and bid him a well behaved day for the nanny.</p><p dir="ltr">It had been seventeen days since said nanny had disappeared. With him.</p><p dir="ltr">If Agatha found Wanda before the cops did, she was surely going to prison because she was going to <em>kill</em> her.</p><p dir="ltr">Neither of them had been sleeping, spending hours hunched over laptops and on phone calls with too many detectives to count. It was an all-hands-on-deck affair until Nicky was back in their arms.</p><p dir="ltr">What had made it almost impossible was that Wanda had no known vehicle. She had no car to track, no way to visibly gauge where she might be going without having to see her in person. It was frustrating to no end and while Rio did not shed those exasperated tears in front of Agatha, she let them loose in the quiet moments alone, tucked in their downstairs bathroom. She let go of them after Agatha exhausted herself to sleep. Those were the only times Rio could cry those tears.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha on the other hand only cried when she was pissed. It wasn't even that she was crying, it was just that she was so angry and her body temperature had grown feverish to a point that it simply made her eyes water. Her face had been red for weeks and every single moment of her day was spent doing whatever she could to locate their son.</p><p dir="ltr">Neither of them had worked a minute in those seventeen days and had devoted every bit of the time they had into the search. It was all that could have occupied their time while their son was somewhere out there without them.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio had been afraid. Even though Agatha had made it clear time and time again that it was not Rio's fault, she still felt as though Agatha were just looking for the best reason to blow up on her, to somehow use this as a reason to tear apart everything they had built up to that point. Agatha was angry and she could be irrational in that emotion.</p><p dir="ltr">It had yet to come. That was shocking in and of itself, but Rio knew better than to question small miracles. Instead, they had come together to cover every lead they could, track down every small clue they had been given.</p><p dir="ltr">It just hadn't been enough.</p><p dir="ltr">The police were still doing their due diligence, but Rio could see what was starting to happen.</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone else was beginning to give up.</p><p dir="ltr">Their friends were still showing up, and Rio's mother Lilia was still losing sleep in her efforts to scour hotels and motels with the hopes that she might be able to at least convince <em>someone</em> to agree that they had spotted someone matching Wanda's description. She had come up empty each and every time.</p><p dir="ltr">The people that mattered, they weren't giving up.</p><p dir="ltr">The police were slowly losing hope. It had started two days after, but creeping up on three weeks it seemed as though their reserves for giving a shit had been depleted.</p><p dir="ltr">That made Rio even angrier than the entire situation did in the first place, which was saying something. It also pissed Agatha off to no end the last two days when every single one of her calls with the cops ended up with her slamming her phone down and screaming out in unending frustration.</p><p dir="ltr">This time, on that particular night seventeen nights in, when Agatha was mid-shout at whoever was on the other line and they hung up on her, the cellphone shattered when she smashed it against the desk, the Blackberry falling to too many pieces to count.</p><p dir="ltr">"Fucking useless pigs! All of them!" she screamed, swiping the pieces of the phone off of the desk and onto the floor below. The moment that task was completed, Agatha slammed both fists down in a move that Rio heard and was certain had to hurt.</p><p dir="ltr">Timidly, Rio paced to the doorway and leaned against the frame, her concerned gaze falling on her wife though she already knew what was happening without being told.</p><p dir="ltr">"They're diluting the task force, aren't they?" Rio asked softly.</p><p dir="ltr">When Agatha looked up at her from her place behind that desk, those angry tears were burning molten rivers down her bright red cheeks.</p><p dir="ltr">"Fuck them. Tax dollars hard at work as they sit on their fucking asses drinking their sludge coffee and finger-fuck their own assholes," Agatha snapped.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio didn't take it personally. Honestly, she felt the exact same way but she was a little more reserved in her wording because of the two of them, she tried to be that voice of reason.</p><p dir="ltr">There was no reason. Not for what Wanda had done.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's getting late," Rio offered, her voice low and quiet. It was nearing on eleven pm and neither of them had slept more than an hour or two per night the last two weeks. "We really should get some sleep. We can pick it up in the morning."</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha leaned back in her chair, raising both palms so that she could use the heels to dry her eyes and then her cheeks. Rio was the only person in the world who wasn't afraid of seeing Agatha cry. It was because she <em>knew</em> what it meant. It meant hurt and uncertainty. Agatha didn't get sappy or sad or dejected when she cried. No, it was just pure fury time and time again.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm not ready to give up, not like they are," Agatha argued back, though there was a notable tightness to her tone that felt like a lead weight in Rio's middle.</p><p dir="ltr">Slowly, Rio paced into the room to place herself behind Agatha, tender fingertips sinking into the meat of her trap muscles, kneading and pressing lovingly despite the fact that the stress they had been dealing with had made those muscles hard as steel.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're never going to give up, my love," Rio assured her, leaning just enough to place a light kiss to the top of Agatha's head. "But we won't have a choice if we die from exhaustion in the process," she added in a soft murmur against her scalp.</p><p dir="ltr">"I just don't understand why they don't give a fuck," Agatha voiced through an exhaled sigh. "Now that the hubbub from the breaking news and headlines has died down, it's as if they just don't feel like it's worthy of their time. And I..." Agatha cut herself off, head dropping in defeat as it slipped out from beneath Rio's lips. "Nicky is fucking worth it. He's always been worth it."</p><p dir="ltr">"I know, Agatha," Rio soothed, working a little harder at trying to ease some of her tension. "And that's exactly why we're never giving up. Because he <em>is</em> worth it, and we <em>will</em> bring him home."</p><p dir="ltr">Rio had meant that statement with every ounce of will in her body.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, it didn't matter, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Life could be cruel that way.</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p align="center" dir="ltr">
<b> <em>December 18th, 2000</em> </b>
</p><p align="center" dir="ltr">
<b> <u>Agatha.</u> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">It had been seven months to the day since Nicky had gone missing.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha had never stopped searching.</p><p dir="ltr">Both herself and Rio had done everything they could. They checked hospitals and hotels, even ventured into New York to post flyers in hopes that someone might see Wanda and call the number in bold at the bottom of the page.</p><p dir="ltr">No call ever came.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha had even hired a private investigator two months in and even that had not brought forth results. Wherever Wanda was, and wherever she had taken their son, she was untraceable. The more the days passed, the more Agatha realized that Wanda was slipping further and further from their reach and as a result, so was Nicky.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the insanity of what the other woman had chosen to do, something in Agatha knew that even if no one knew where she was, Nicky was still okay. Wanda wouldn't have hurt him; if she was going to do that, she wouldn't have taken him and disappeared. Maybe it would have been beneficial to dig deeper, to press on the nearly imperceptible reaction Wanda had when Rio had asked if she had children. She'd said no, but there had been this strange look in her eyes, one that Agatha had mistakenly let go.</p><p dir="ltr">Somewhere out there, she now had their little boy and Agatha had no idea what that meant.</p><p dir="ltr">It kept her up most nights, even still. She and Rio had fallen into this strange routine where they would lay in bed and talk softly about next plans, about what more they could do, and then they would lie there and both pretend they were asleep when they really weren't. They had started getting a little more sleep when they'd had to return to work, but only due to the sleeping pills Agatha had procured for them and <em>only</em> because they needed to be coherent in their duties.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha, more than Rio, had a duty of care to her patients, to every person who came through her OR that she do what she could to improve their lives. She could not be capable of that if she was depriving her body of what it needed to function. It was why she had taken a little longer in returning; Rio could run on two hours of sleep and four cups of coffee. Agatha could not, not safely anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">On that night, seven months without their son, Agatha came home to something unexpected.</p><p dir="ltr">When she had opened the front door, she was surprised to see that the majority of the furniture had been pushed aside and in the middle of the living room, Rio had spread out a quilt across the floor. Atop it, she had placed the low table and set up a dinner for them of homemade tamales, along with several different salsas that she had likely prepared herself as well. Between the two plates sat a bottle of red wine with the cork already popped and two awaiting glasses.</p><p dir="ltr">"Rio?" she called into the house as she shed her coat and hung it in the foyer closet.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm in the kitchen, just finishing the rice. It took a little longer than I meant," she responded, her voice carrying from her place at the stove. A moment later, she appeared with two small bowls of the rice that she had perfected over the years, the warm orange color depicting just how robust with flavor it was.</p><p dir="ltr">"Well hi," Agatha greeted, clearly spent from the day behind her. She met Rio on the quilt at the edge of that low table to take a soft kiss. "What is all this for?"</p><p dir="ltr">Rio took the kiss happily, but she was not immediate in her response. Instead, when she pulled back, her bright amber eyes simply tracing over the features of Agatha's face as she sought out her answer.</p><p dir="ltr">"I decided that we've been punishing ourselves... and each other far more than we mean to. Not in that we treat each other like shit, but that we haven't much made time for ourselves or our marriage since..." For just a moment, Rio wavered. Her throat trembled noticeably at the forefront of her neck and her lips quivered just barely. Quickly, she cleared her throat and threaded some composure back into her form. "Since everything happened. And I just... I know you know it because you believe me when I say it, but I love you. And I... I know that our lives aren't going to be the same ever again, but I don't ever want to lose what we have in the process."</p><p dir="ltr">The longer she spoke, the more Agatha could feel her walls coming down. Sure, she had never once blamed Rio for what had happened. She had been angry, yes, and there were even times that she took it out on Rio because she was the only one within shouting distance (though Rio had gotten her back on a few occasions, mostly as it pertained to the police), but Agatha had never once stopped loving her.</p><p dir="ltr">It was in the early morning hours as they sat fully clothed, crying in a bathtub full of cold water as they clung to one another. It was in the weekend afternoons when Rio couldn't stop herself from looking inside the nursery which, more often than not, left her in a heap of tears on the hallway floor before Agatha came along to pick her up. It was in the late evenings when she would close Rio's laptop and request that she come to bed, even if she couldn't sleep.</p><p dir="ltr">For as unfair as life had been, Agatha wasn't the only one suffering. She wasn't the only one who was missing Nicky more than words could say, Rio just had a different way of showing it.</p><p dir="ltr">She showed it by doing things like this. In the throes of missing Nicky and fighting to find a way to bring him home, Rio had started to separate herself and apparently, it was something she had recognized. This was Rio looking Agatha in the eyes and saying what she was saying with her words, but also saying something more with that look in her eyes: <em>I can't lose you, too.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Both of Agatha's palms raised and cradled Rio's jaw between them. She leaned in, not for a direct kiss, but to place them in several spots over Rio’s face from her cheeks to her forehead and even down to her chin. She could feel the muscles shift, tugging up on the corners of Rio's mouth at the attention Agatha was giving her.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha felt that smile when she finally kissed her wife across those soft lips, too.</p><p dir="ltr">"I love you," Agatha whispered, pulling back only to kiss the tip of Rio's nose. "And dinner smells delicious. Let's eat."</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p align="center" dir="ltr">

<b> <u>Rio.</u> </b>
</p><p dir="ltr">In over a thousand days, there had not been a single one where Rio had not thought about her son.</p><p dir="ltr">He would be walking now. Talking. She wondered how many words he would know at that age, and how smart he might be. As much as she hated considering it, there was some part of Rio that hoped, somehow, if Wanda still had him that she'd been good to him through the years. He had been nothing more than a baby and deserved no evil to befall him. He deserved love, and if she had taken that right away from Rio and Agatha, she damn well better have been supplementing with what she could.</p><p dir="ltr">Nicky deserved that much.</p><p dir="ltr">Something in the passing weeks had changed, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha still brought him up a couple of times a week, just to have a quiet or short conversation about him. The way Rio saw it, it was the one thing Agatha could do to make sure they would never forget about him, as if they ever could. In the last two, though, the frequency had lowered. More than that, she seemed a little more discombobulated and scattered. She was forgetting little things, like where she put her wallet or what time Rio would be coming home at night (even though it had been the same for the last year and a half).</p><p dir="ltr">They were minimal, really, but something in Rio recognized it as abnormal. She let it play out, though, knowing that if it got too bad and Agatha still hadn't wanted to discuss it, she would take any necessary action.</p><p dir="ltr">On a sticky fall evening, they had been out back as Rio worked in the vegetable troughs, clearing them of any of the foliage that had since died after harvest. Agatha had kept her plied with iced tea and a bowl of watermelon while she'd perched in a lawn chair and read. She had been contentedly munching on the fruit, but suddenly, she began to gag.</p><p dir="ltr">Rio snapped up, glancing over as Agatha ripped herself from the chair and bolted inside. Taking off her gloves, Rio was quick to follow her straight to the bathroom where she found Agatha kneeling at the toilet, the watermelon coming back up as a smoothie this time.</p><p dir="ltr">"My love," Rio voiced softly as she knelt next to Agatha, a hand gently rubbing over her back. Agatha straightened and wiped at her mouth before turning to look at Rio, her eyes wet from the vomiting. "I have been willfully neglecting to bring this up, but something's going on. Are you alright?"</p><p dir="ltr">Agatha's lip quivered for a moment and her eyes developed a new shine, one that radiated... fear?</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't know," she admitted, her lips twisting while those beautiful blue eyes searched Rio's face in a panic. "I... I've felt like this before but..."</p><p dir="ltr">She trailed a little too long and Rio suddenly felt overwhelmed with nerves at the way Agatha was looking at her.</p><p dir="ltr">"But?" Rio probed lightly, reaching up to cup Agatha's cheek, brushing it lightly with her thumb.</p><p dir="ltr">"But I was hoping it was just a bug... It's just been going on for too long and... And I... I..."</p><p dir="ltr">This time, when Agatha's eyes filled with tears, it wasn't because she was angry. It was because she was scared.</p><p dir="ltr">"Rio," she whispered, "I think I'm pregnant again."</p><p dir="ltr">Hearing those words, Rio wasn't sure if she was going to <em>im</em>plode or <em>ex</em>plode, but either way she was not certain that her atoms were going to maintain corporeal form.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't something they had talked about, wasn't something they had planned for and while Rio trusted Agatha's instincts, they had to know for certain. Rio's hand had not stopped tending to its pacing up and down Agatha's back as they stared at each other like frightened animals, trapped and unsure where to go.</p><p dir="ltr">After a beat too long, Rio finally found the wherewithal to move, leaning toward her wife to brush their lips softly together. She didn't know if Agatha's hunch was right, or even what it meant if it was. What she did know was that there was really only one way to know for sure.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm going to go grab a test, yeah?" she whispered before tilting her head back so that she could place a gentle kiss between Agatha's eyebrows. "Do you want me to grab anything else while I'm at the store?"</p><p dir="ltr">A sardonic chuckle passed through Agatha's lips as she leaned back so that she could wipe at her wet cheeks. She sniffled and nodded her head before she formed her answer. "One of those big boxes of caramel truffles for if it's positive and a bottle of Jack Honey if it's negative."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the plethora of emotions that were violently coursing their way through Rio's entire being, she somehow found herself smiling and even breathing a soft laugh at Agatha's request.</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course, my love."</p><p dir="ltr">That night, they sat in bed eating caramel truffles and amassing a pile of wrappers that was far bigger than it needed to be.</p><p dir="ltr">The following Monday, the appointment they attended confirmed that they were, indeed, going to be having a second child.</p><p dir="ltr">That brought with it its own twisted and warped set of feelings. They had laid in bed with mostly untouched pasta set aside on their nightstands, wrapped in one another while they went through every inch of track on the rollercoaster of things they were trying to feel and understand.</p><p dir="ltr">They were happy, of course. It was another child, another opportunity to pour their love into a being they had created.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, they were devastated. It was a replacement of the one they never got to raise, even almost four years later.</p><p dir="ltr">No, that wasn't fair.</p><p dir="ltr">What happened to Nicky had not been their fault. All of this had happened for a reason.</p><p dir="ltr">Next, they were afraid. It had been a lengthy conversation, but Rio had ultimately decided that during Agatha's last trimester, she would either sell or dismantle her catering business and be a stay-at-home mom. She loved what she did and she had poured every drop of blood, sweat or tears into cultivating her own little empire, but this was more important. Having her family would always be the most important thing to Rio and no matter what she had to do to protect it, she absolutely would.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, they were excited.</p><p dir="ltr">It had been long enough that while the shadow of what had happened to Nicky would always hang over them with the unanswered question of whether or not he was even still alive being dragged along with it, they had to move forward. A second child was likely the only thing that would have ever been capable of giving them the push they needed.</p><p>Rio was not foolish enough to think it would be easy, at least at first. Seeing a new baby and still being able to recall so easily what Nicky had looked like on that last morning, it was going to be emotional and it was going to be something that took effort to work through. Rio knew there would be other hurdles to overcome and she and Agatha had both decided that this new child would absolutely <em>never</em> be left in the care of someone who wasn't one of the two of them.</p><p>The talk had ended on a good note, but ten minutes later Agatha began to tremble against Rio's chest, her tears wetting the soft cotton on Rio's torso. </p><p>Rio knew she was scared. Hell, Rio was too. Yes, it had been three years, but that fear had never left them. They both carried a piece of Nicky with them every single day in hopes that he might come back to them. The days that passed never did a thing to crack their resolve that someday, their son would come home.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b> <em>April 18, 2004</em> </b>
</p><p align="center">
<b> <u>Agatha.</u> </b>
</p><p>Being eight and a half months pregnant was a feat in and of itself. Being eight and a half months pregnant at thirty-six years old was Olympic sport material. </p><p>Agatha was tired. All of the time. </p><p>Since she had stepped away from her duties as a neurosurgeon by way of maternity leave, Agatha's favorite way to pass the time was to nap. She could nap in the late morning, could nap in the early afternoon. Hell, sometimes she even took a nap at 5pm because she wanted to.</p><p>With Rio around more as well, -- as she had done as she'd promised and sold off her business for a hefty chunk of change due to the reputation that came with the name -- quite a few of those naps had consisted of cuddles and the lightest kisses as Rio whispered silly musings or quoted movie lines at her until she dozed off.</p><p>The exhaustion brought with it other consequences. It had been at least a week since Agatha had been able to muster the energy to leave the house. It wasn't that she didn't <em>want </em>to, but most of the time she wasn't sure how she'd be able to function in a public setting. </p><p>Rio had noticed -- of course she had -- and had instructed Agatha to spend the majority of the afternoon napping so that they could go out for a very low key and low effort meal and stop by Agatha's favorite ice cream spot on the way home. For as tired as Agatha had been as of late, the suggestion actually sounded pretty tantalizing. </p><p>They still had date nights every so often, but they had become fewer and farther between the further along Agatha got in her pregnancy. Rio still made more than enough effort by making copycat versions of Agatha's favorites, bringing home flowers any time she went out, and always drawing a hot bath at the end of the day for Agatha to soak in and alleviate the stress in her muscles.</p><p>So Agatha had done as she was told. She had climbed into that big bed and taken a kiss from Rio as she declared that she had a few things left to grab for the nursery's final touches.</p><p>Rio had been the one to tackle that project. They could have put the nursery for their baby girl in another room in the house, but Rio had been insistent that it was meant to be <em>that</em> room. It had taken her a couple of days to sort through things and clean out old clothes that Nicky never even got to really wear, but she had done it all the same. Agatha could see that it was getting to her, but she soldiered on and never let Agatha see her shed a tear.</p><p>Agatha knew she still shed them anyway.</p><p>When she had awoken from her nap, she took a few minutes to fully wake up, noting immediately that Rio had not joined her to rest or if she had, she'd gotten up before Agatha had come-to. When she sat up, she saw the purple lace and fabric maternity dress that Rio had laid out for her and an appreciative smile crossed her lips.</p><p>She and Rio had been married for nearly nine years and there really had yet to be a day where Agatha had not felt loved fully and appreciated wholly by her wife. They had been through hell and back together and while it had seemed, even for a moment, that they might not make it through, Rio had stepped up and did every single thing she needed do to ensure that they saw the light of day again. Rio pulled every string she could to prove that they would find happiness once more, and that they would live full lives when they'd resigned to only living half ones.</p><p>In the process of getting dressed, Agatha heard the blow dryer turn on in the adjoining bathroom; ah, Rio had been in the shower. </p><p>Agatha had been in the midst of brushing her own wild and sleep-disturbed hair when Rio emerged, drawing Agatha's delighted blue gaze.</p><p>With her hair curled slightly in a way that bounced, there stood Rio in a long sleeved, dark green vintage dress that had a black belt with a gold buckle cinched snugly around her middle. There was a pin of the same tint of gold in her hair, keeping the left side clipped over her ear.</p><p>Rio was beautiful. Agatha had always known that, but in those moments, it was more than just her looks.</p><p>It was the fact that she had gotten dolled up, had let Agatha get dolled up. It was the fact that she had planned this dinner for them that, if Agatha had to guess, was probably a little less casual than she had initially let on -- or so Agatha had thought.</p><p>There had been a moment, one where Agatha almost asked if they could just order in. Something felt... off. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but it felt to her as though her body was trying to tell her something, something she dismissed to embrace the prospect of spending a night out with her wife.</p><p>During their drive, the closer Rio got to Arlington Diner, the more suspicious Agatha grew. She did not say anything, at least not until Rio made the turn into the parking lot.</p><p>Agatha simply laughed.</p><p>Of course Rio had dressed them up to get a sandwich and some fries. <em>Of course she had.</em></p><p>It was the million and eighth reason Agatha found to love her.</p><p>Rio got her usual of the portabella wrap and Agatha had opted for the pesto chicken panini, which she had been thoroughly enjoying until she felt the baby shift and press on her bladder.</p><p>"I'll be right back," she informed Rio. There had been every intention of just running to the restroom and coming right back to finish their meal, but when Agatha stood up and took only a step, she suddenly found a puddle of water at her feet and Rio staring up at her with impossibly wide and shocked eyes.</p><p>"Erm..." Agatha managed, not able to glance down at the proof her water had broken, but not needing it with the look Rio had slapped to her face.</p><p>"Maybe we should get you to the hospital... like now?" Rio asked, quickly pushing out of the booth so that she could rush to the counter and pay for their food. The server had been polite enough to ask if they wanted boxes, but Rio had kindly dismissed her with a 'thank you, though' before she turned her attention back to Agatha and getting her out to the car.</p><p>"Are you taking me to Clara Maass?" Agatha asked her as Rio carefully helped her slide into the car. When Rio reached down without being told and helped Agatha lower the seat backing to be more comfortable, Agatha could have kissed her. She was always so fucking thoughtful and always knew what to do, even in the face of panic.</p><p>"Yeah, it's the closest and... I know they were good to us last time," Rio answered. Before she shut the door to scramble to the driver's side, she leaned in to give Agatha a supportive and encouraging kiss.</p><p>And then, they were off.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b> <u>Rio.</u> </b>
</p><p>She had been there before.</p><p>Rio had existed in a delivery room that had looked almost exactly the same. She had stood dutifully by Agatha's bedside, holding her hand and letting Agatha squeeze the ever-loving fuck out of her knuckles, feeling as they bumped and rubbed against one another inside her skin. She had heard that cry, so similar yet so different.</p><p>Laying eyes on their little girl for the first time had also been a  familiar feeling and still somehow was so brand new. </p><p>With a weak nod from Agatha who's grip slackened around Rio's fingers, Rio departed her station beside her wife to observe as the nurses cleaned her off, those little tiny wails sounding the entire time. She was beautiful with her dark hair and little ball-tipped nose. She was remarkable with those fat little cheeks and her wrinkled skin.</p><p>She was <em>theirs</em> and they would do <em>whatever</em> it took to see to it that she led a good life, one where they loved her every single day of it.</p><p>"Do you want to take her to momma for skin-to-skin?" the nurse asked Rio gently as she finished cleaning the newborn. She had finally stopped wailing and was instead making little frustrated coos and grunts.</p><p>"I would like that," came Rio's soft response.</p><p>As the nurse lifted the baby up and turned to Rio, she said something so innocent. It was <em>so </em>well-intentioned, but it felt like a lance through the heart.</p><p>"Just remember to support her head. New parents sometimes need to be reminded."</p><p>Rio smiled at her, but she could feel the threat of tears as they pricked at the backs of her eyes and for a moment, she almost stayed quiet. But, something took over her; it was a desire to assert Nicky's memory and remind herself that if he could be there to meet his little sister, he would have been.</p><p>"She's our second, but I do appreciate the reminder," Rio voiced, her tone a little pained as she held her hands out to receive all five pounds of their daughter. She cradled her easily as she made the short trek to Agatha's bed, her chest bare and skin ready to flush with the warm and new skin of their little girl.</p><p>"I proudly present Miss Danica Inez Harkness-Vidal," Rio announced in a voice that could have barely been constituted as a whisper.</p><p>"Hi, my Dani," Agatha greeted as Rio gently laid their daughter on her chest. Agatha's hand raised immediately, the tips of her fingers gracing that ridiculous amount of hair on Dani's head. A quiet chuckle passed through her lips as those tired but bright blue eyes lifted to Rio, the smallest smile on her lips. "All of the heartburn was worth it for this much hair."</p><p>Rio couldn't help but laugh. She leaned forward, her forearm steadying her as it pressed to the hospital bed above Agatha's head, her hand landing so that she could gently brush Agatha's hair back away from her still slightly-sweaty face. Her lips pressed softly to her wife's warm forehead and then her eyes dropped to their sweet little baby girl.</p><p>She was there. She was healthy. She was <em>perfect.</em></p><p>And every god be damned, Rio would do absolutely anything in the world to ensure that the life Dani got to live was one more in their control than Nicky's had been.</p><p>No matter what needed to be done, Rio would do it, even if she died trying.</p><p>Perhaps such a sentiment could have seemed overdramatic. </p><p>Not to Rio.</p><p>History would <em>not</em> repeat itself. </p><p>Not again.</p><p> </p>

<b> <u>Rio.</u> </b>
</p><p>It was their very first Christmas as a family.</p><p>Nicky had been born on New Year's Day and so, he had just missed Christmas by a week. And then, well... That was something that still got thought about quite often, both for Rio as well as Agatha.</p><p>In those first few months with Dani, it was almost <em>impossible</em> not to think about Nicky. It was an unimaginable feat to try and not see the very obvious fact that they had the same tiny dimple in their chins, one that came from Agatha. It was physically not something Rio could do to not recognize that tiny little line in Dani's forehead and immediately picture Nicky's face to match it up.</p><p>Part of Nicky was with Dani, and always would be. It didn't matter where he was, he was going to help them take care of her one way or another, even if it was just his memory that would do the guiding. </p><p>Being eight months old, there wasn't a lot to do by ways of gifts; Dani would never remember it anyway. What they <em>could</em> and had decided to do was dress in a matching set of pajamas and take photos. The pants were black, but one could hardly tell with the layers of red stripes and bigger ones of white polar bears that covered the length, the black filling the voids in between. The shirts had one singular polar bear wearing a Santa hat. Dani's, of course, was just a little baby bear onesie that Rio had wiggled the tiny pants over.</p><p>They sat on the couch as Agatha grumbled through the entire duration of 'It's A Wonderful Life' while sipping occasionally at her hot chocolate. It was one of Rio's favorite Christmas films, something she insisted on every year, though they had skipped it for the last four because life had not, in fact, been wonderful. Rio knew that this year, Agatha understood why she had pushed for it.</p><p>It hadn't been a wonderful life without Nicky.</p><p>Maybe it could be one as wonderful as humanly possible with Dani.</p><p>Agatha had been sunk back into the cushions of the couch with Dani positioned belly-down on her chest. When Rio went to ask Agatha if she wanted an additional hot chocolate even though it was eleven at night, she turned to see them both fast asleep, Dani's chest moving a little quicker than Agatha's due to her size.</p><p>For a moment, on a Christmas Day that Rio had never assumed could come, she felt like things might be okay. As she sat there and traced them both with her gaze, just outlining them in a sketch she could keep in her mind forever, Rio knew that despite the misery that had been brought into their lives, this was the reward they got for not sundering. This was the one thing they could have that would remind them that it <em>was</em> possible to rebuild after disaster.</p><p>They would keep building, day after day, for the rest of Dani's life until they were no longer around to do so.</p><p>Rio decided to let them sleep and got up to make herself another hot chocolate. Once she returned to the couch, she put on her second favorite Christmas movie, A Muppet Christmas Carol. They had already watched it once that day, but Rio would more than willingly indulge in an extra helping of the sheer chaos that was Rizzo the Rat.</p><p>Partway through the movie, when Gonzo caught Rizzo's tail on fire and the rat consequently screamed out "Light the lamp, not the rat! Light the lamp, not the rat!" Rio dissolved into giggles she tried to keep hushed. It didn't matter how many times she'd seen the movie or how old she got, that part was funny every single time without fail.</p><p>Unknowingly, she had woken her wife beside her who took a moment to rouse. She nearly scared Rio shitless when she spoke a couple minutes later.</p><p>"Seriously?" Agatha grunted sleepily, though she didn't move otherwise. "Again?"</p><p>"Oh, let me have my Christmas fun," came Rio's soft murmur. She leaned toward Agatha, placing the lightest kiss to her cheek. When she spoke again, it was both a whisper and warm against Agatha's skin. "Merry Christmas, my love. The best gift has been spending it with the two of you."</p><p>Rio could feel immediately the way Agatha's cheeks shifted with her tired smile. Her eyes were still closed but her head lulled to the side, a quiet beckoning for Rio to bring her lips closer and Rio was more than happy to respond in kind. Their mouths were gentle through such a connection, the lightest caress of a kiss before it broke.</p><p>"Why don't we head for bed? I think we have gotten the most out of the day that we could manage, hm?" Rio pulled away and shifted forward on the couch to collect their dishes and any wrappers or shreds of giftwrap from the gifts the two of them had exchanged earlier in the evening.</p><p>Agatha had gifted Rio with a Polaroid camera for one reason and one reason only: Rio loved to have physical copies of photos but she did not have the patience to go through the process of taking them to be developed. Agatha had decided to cut out the middleman, <em>and</em> it was just an additional bonus that it was an answer to a years long request that had begun before Nicky was even born.</p><p>Rio had gone a bit more sentimental. She knew Agatha's penchant for mildly flashy jewelry, as was evident by the ring Rio had placed on her finger those years ago when they'd said their vows, but she also knew that Agatha was a little old world and could appreciate a vintage piece a little more than the next person. When Rio had laid eyes on that locket, she had just... known.</p><p>It was a work of art, oval shaped and encircled in a frame of threaded gold, the tiniest loops like little arches all the way around. The small hinge was almost unnoticeable, overshadowed by the purple bubble and the etchings of three muses in white atop it. </p><p>Charm, beauty, creativity. </p><p>They were everything Rio knew Agatha to be capable of and more.</p><p>"It's beautiful," Agatha had breathed, her fingertips tracing over the little carvings.</p><p>"Open it," Rio urged her, shifting Dani around in her arms a bit.</p><p>Agatha listened, gently cracking the locket open. On the left side, there was a photo of Nicky that had been taken minutes after his birth. On the right, there was one in the same vein of Dani. Seeing them side by side was actually insane, almost. They looked so similar in their fresh newness, clearly siblings. Maybe that would change as they both grew -- because gods be damned, Rio knew Nicky was out there growing -- but in those photos that were stowed safely in that locket, they looked just the same.</p><p>Those hours later, they put Dani to bed and shuffled to their own room, arms wrapped around waists throughout their trek down the hall. When they split off to venture toward their respective sides of the bed, Rio was a little surprised to watch as Agatha pulled the locket from her pocket and clutched it tightly as she crawled between the sheets.</p><p>The moment they landed on their backs next to one another, Rio's head turned to take in the scape of Agatha's profile as she held the locket up to behold it.</p><p>"Do you like it?" came Rio's low and quiet question.</p><p>Agatha's cheek dropped to the pillow and those vibrant but emotional eyes landed directly into Rio's. </p><p>"I love it, truly," Agatha breathed back at her, scooting over enough that she could steal a soft kiss. "I love <em>you."</em></p><p>"And I love you, Agatha. We'll get past next week and have an entire new year in front of us to make the most of."</p><p>Rio meant that with every fiber of her being, and Agatha knew it, too.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b> <em>May 8th, 2008</em> </b>
</p><p align="center">
<b> <u>Agatha.</u> </b>
</p><p>The years that had rolled on in their lives had, in fact, been bountiful in the experiences and emotions it had brought to the Harkness-Vidal family. They were afforded every single day they had hoped for with their daughter, watching her grow, watching her become the person they hoped for her to be.</p><p>Even at four years old, there was absolutely <em>no</em> denying that Dani was Agatha's daughter through and through. She might have favored Rio more in resemblance, but that spitfire attitude and constant need to argue? That was embedded into fifty percent of her DNA, the half that belonged to Agatha.</p><p>Dani's expression were Agatha's favorite. She was so positively animated that it was quite hard to understand how a child developed that kind of control over their face, but she never questioned it. That slightly tanned skin was a perfect offset to her beautiful blue eyes. Agatha knew that most babies had blue eyes when they were born and as such, they had expected Dani's to change, but they never had.</p><p>No. Dani might have looked so much like Rio in her features and stature, but those blue eyes came straight from Agatha, no questions asked.</p><p>On a warm spring afternoon, Agatha was relaxed in a lounger on the back patio, the sun high and bright in the sky as it warmed the occupants of the yard. Not only was that inclusive of Agatha, but Rio and Dani as well. </p><p>The two of them were hunched over, preening off dead leaves from the fruits and vegetables that were beginning to grow. They were clearly having a conversation judging by the grin Rio was wearing as Dani's head bobbed emphatically with whatever she was saying, but Agatha could not hear what they were talking about.</p><p>The loudest thing she heard was Rio as she cried out into the air.</p><p>"No! It's mine! You better give it back!" She was clearly amused and was still donning that grin, but Dani immediately took off, cradling the smallest strawberry in her palms, one that had not meant to be picked so soon.</p><p>Her giggles were wild and bright, but Rio gave her about a four foot head start before taking off after her, chasing her lazily around the yard. Rio's legs were about as tall as Dani was in her entirety, and she could have easily closed the space between them, but she was clearly having the time of her life chasing Dani around trying to get a strawberry that was no good to begin with.</p><p>It was silly, but their laughter rang exuberantly in the air of the May afternoon and it made Agatha realize just how lucky she was.</p><p>Was the following day another Mother's Day where she wished they could be four instead of three? Of course. That was something she wished for on any momentous day. She wished for it every New Year's Day on Nicky's birthday. She wished for it on Easter when she would pull out the photo of his tiny head sporting the smallest bunny ears. She wished for it on Dani's birthday. She ached for it on Mother's Day and even Father's Day, too. She longed to have him with them in their family costumes on Halloween and in their matching pajamas on Christmas. Never would a single day or occasion pass where Agatha did not wish her son was there to share it with them.</p><p>Right then, though, as Agatha watched her wife and their daughter scampered around the yard in the silliest game of chase, she knew she was blessed to have what she did, even if it wasn't all that she yearned for.</p><p>Maybe some day, she'd find the ability to stop imaging scenarios that included Nicky, too.</p><p>That day was not going to be the one.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

<b> <u>Rio.</u> </b>
</p><p>Walking in the side door with a hand full of grocery bags that evening, Rio had not been expecting to arrive in the midst of a warzone. Surprisingly, she hadn't heard the shouting from out in the garage, but it was at full volume by the time she made it into the house.</p><p>"Danica Inez, I swear to <em>God, </em>if you step outside that front door with those keys in your hand, I will absolutely ground you into oblivion and you will not see the light of day until you graduate!"</p><p>Oh, shit. Agatha was <em>pissed.</em></p><p>"I have my license now! Why would you buy me a car if I can't drive it?!" Dani shrieked back.</p><p>As Rio paced further into the house, she could spot them from the kitchen. Agatha was closer to her in her place on one side of the living room and Dani was dangerously close to the front door on the opposite side. Rio couldn't see Agatha's face, but she could see Dani's and it was bright red in a direct contrast to how blue her eyes were in their emotion.</p><p>"Just because you have a car does absolutely <em>not</em> mean that you can just come and go as you please. I understand the need for independence, but you at least owe us an explanation of where you're going," Agatha  reminded her, though it was clear she was forcing her energy into the act of not shouting those words across the room.</p><p>"If you're that worried, just get that tracking app or whatever," Dani snapped back, and what Rio knew that Dani did not was that she had just unwittingly given Agatha everything she wanted.</p><p>The thing was, Rio and Agatha had already discussed that very idea. They had decided to give it time, to let Dani have a bit more freedom as she grew. They had been a little... well, clingy for the majority of her life up to that point for obvious reason, but it was apparent that they couldn't continue to suffocate her the older she got.</p><p>For her first ten years of life, there had not been a single day where she had been out of one of their sights. In the house, yes, but never anywhere else. She was not allowed to go to sleepovers, though her friends had always been welcomed with open arms in their home instead. She was not allowed to go on day trip outings with her friends' families unless one of the two of them could tag along as well. Even until she got into middle school, they had chosen to homeschool her.</p><p>That had been a prime choice and in many ways, it had helped Dani develop more skills and talents that could only enrich her life moving forward. They had given her the basement as a studio and as such, it was where she could continue to teach herself the many instruments she had sunk her time into -- including violin, cello, guitar and drums -- and on the other side, they'd curated a little lounge area that she could spend time in when her friends would come over.</p><p>Isolation, while ideal, had never really been an option. They still found ways to help her socialize and groups for ger to join that would be stimulating and encourage growth and development on a personal level. So while school had not been an explored area of Dani's life, they still wanted her to be a kid and to live life as one.</p><p>By eleven, they had allowed her into public school. With the addition of sports, Dani was absolutely thriving and continued to do so in such a vast social setting.</p><p>Even when they had resigned to letting her go out during day time hours without them when she turned fourteen, it had been mandated that an adult they met, conversed with, and trusted would be there as well. By fifteen, they had finally budged on letting her stay the night somewhere else, but only because she had a phone and could shoot them a singular emoji to tell them that something was wrong.</p><p>The truth was, Dani was an <em>incredible </em>kid. Not only did she have her hobbies and her sports, but when she had time, she indulged in extra curriculars like quiz bowl. It had quickly helped her to develop a strong rapport with different cliques. She had friends in sports, ones in chess club and quiz bowl, and she had the ones that loved music in the way she did.</p><p>Excelling in academics had been another of her many feats, something Agatha had told her time and time again that she could relate to. Agatha had graduated high school shortly after her seventeenth birthday and had already taken electives that attributed toward her college courses. When they had gotten the call that Dani was being skipped up a grade -- completely bypassing her sophomore year -- they had celebrated by taking her out to the restaurant of her choice and letting her have whatever it was she wanted.</p><p>They were always proud of her accomplishments, but Rio could tell Agatha took that one to heart a little more.</p><p>Now that Dani had approached the crisp age of sixteen, she had developed this sense of entitlement that pissed Agatha off to no end. It irritated Rio, sure, but it made Agatha <em>so so </em>mad. Rio was fully aware of the reasoning: Dani acted as stubborn and iron willed over the things she wanted and believed in just as much as Agatha did. They were cut from the same cloth and as such, they butted heads to no avail.</p><p>Right then as she tried to square off with her mother, Dani had just handed Agatha every bit of ammunition she would need in the war waged on worrying about her every second of every day that she was not with them.</p><p>"Fine," Agatha stated simply. She shifted her weight to her left foot and crossed her arms over her middle. Rio couldn't see it, but the knew the expression Agatha was wearing right then was <em>smug as fuck.</em></p><p>Dani's eyes widened and her jaw hinged. She was always so beautiful with her plump cheeks and lush lips that so clearly came from Rio, but right then she looked the <em>spitting image</em> of her in her state of being truly aghast at what had just happened, and that it had been by her own suggestion.</p><p>"That's not what I meant!" she tried to backtrack, but it was too late. Agatha got the permission and hadn't even needed to ask for it.</p><p>"Nope. You suggested it, and mom and I have talked about it already but wanted to try and give you some breathing room, so you can have it your way." Rio was just watching Agatha's back, trying her best to imagine what her face looked right then, so rooted in her justified righteousness. "If you wanna come and go, we're always going to know where you are. Period."</p><p>"Momma, that's a l --"</p><p>"I think she's right," Rio voiced from her place in the kitchen as she stowed boxes of cereal in the cabinet. "You want freedom, and we get that, but it comes with conditions and you know why."</p><p>Of course Dani knew why. They all shared in a cupcake to wish Nicky a good year and a happy birthday every single New Year's since Dani was four. She <em>knew</em> that was the reason.</p><p>"But --"</p><p>Rio had already started to close the gap between where she had been in the kitchen and where Agatha was poised and steeled in her sense of resolve.</p><p>"No buts, Danica," Rio cut in softly with a shake of her head. "You can have space, but we will always worry. You're a teenager and for the next year until you graduate and maybe get accepted in Julliard like you hope, you're going to abide by the rules we have. We try to be fair, but there are still hard no's for right now. You running around the city unmonitored is one of them."</p><p>"And for this little..." Agatha waved her hand dramatically in a circling gesture to indicate what had just transpired, "tantrum, you're definitely not leaving tonight. We'll discuss if that lasts any longer. But this whole 'I think I'm a big girl now because I have a license' thing you've got going on isn't cutting it. So knock it off."</p><p>To anyone else, maybe it might have seemed like Agatha was being too hard on Dani. Rio knew better than anyone else ever could have that it was out of fear. Dani had grown, yes, and she was fit and limber, but she was still a kid. She was still <em>their</em> kid and until she was an adult -- or until she submitted to a very adult undertaking like college -- they simply couldn't loosen their hold on her too much for fear that if she slipped away, they might never get her back.</p><p>"Basement and your room are your options for the night. I think you need some time to consider the way you've been acting lately. We've been letting it slide because you're otherwise composed, but not anymore." Agatha's voice was stern, but Rio could still hear the affection and the need to protect that was woven through her tone.</p><p>"Momma, that's not --" she tried to argue, but Rio interjected to stop her.</p><p>"Danica," she cut, though she wasn't sharp. "Tonight, it's best to let it be. We can talk again in the morning and maybe find a different solution, but just... let it go. Go downstairs, play your video games or your instruments and work it out. We'll check in later."</p><p>Although Rio was being gentle in the tone of her voice, there was a clear instruction in those words, one that Dani knew best to heed. </p><p>"Okay," she grumbled, head hanging as she dropped her keys on the designated hook and trudged her way to the basement stairs before disappearing down them.</p><p>"Well," Rio started, stepping directly next to Agatha, a palm landing flat on her back. "That was quite an event to come home to with boxes of cereal and cartons of ice cream."</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha agreed with a discouraged sigh. She hadn't turned her head, eyes still fixed on some distant mark across the room. Rio's hand shifted, a light back and forth of support and love.</p><p>"She's just... being a sixteen-year-old, unfortunately. We've done our best to respect her for the young adult she is, but she's got a little ways to go in understanding that such respect needs to go both ways," came Rio's musings. She leaned in closer, her lips brushing Agatha's cheek. "We're working on it, all of us. All the time."</p><p>"You're right. I know you're right," Agatha finally resigned, her shoulders slumping slightly as her face finally swung around to land before Rio's, their eyes locking.</p><p>"Even if she's a miniature version of you, hellfire anger included, she's still a pretty great kid and we <em>did</em> get lucky considering half of her classmates are being suspended for fucking in the bathroom," Rio reminded her with a dry chuckle.</p><p>They were thankful that while relationships and the like were on the backburner in regard to Dani's priorities, even if they weren't, they'd long since had the talk that boys were of no interest to her.</p><p>Rio had been the one to take the lead there, making her request that if it changed and her attractions shifted elsewhere, they needed to be notified and another talk entirely could be had.</p><p>"Can you stop that?" Agatha grumbled, her face scrunching.</p><p>"Stop what?" Rio asked back, swiping another quick kiss.</p><p>"Being right all the time."</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center">
<b> <u>Danica.</u> </b>
</p><p>Every day for the last two weeks, around the same time of day, Dani found herself pacing a rut in the floor of the foyer. She was waiting for that stupid little flap on the door to rattle and for the day's mail to spill onto the floor.</p><p>In the throes of her back and forth, her cheeks had grown pink and she'd even tied her hair up to keep from getting any warmer than she needed to be. That was almost impossible right then; she'd been waiting for the letter from Julliard that would tell her what her life was going to be like. She had also applied to NYU, but she absolutely had her heart set on Julliard. </p><p>When she had made the suggestion that she wanted to apply to Berklee, she could tell that while it was still on the same side of the country, the idea of being any further away than New York was not something her parents were going to allow without a fight. Yes, she was attending college a year early, but by all technicalities, she was still not an adult yet and she could understand their caution.</p><p>Truthfully, her parents were the living, breathing definition of 'helicopter moms.' She could comprehend what they had been through in their lives that had made them that way, but the older she got, it began to feel a lot like being smothered.</p><p>Danica loved her moms with everything she had, and she was grateful for all they had given her. She knew that sometimes, she could be a handful. She was aware that she could make poor choices and do the wrong thing every now and again, but they had never once buckled in their mission to love her. Even when they were angry or upset, they never walked away without expressing that they loved her, even if they didn't know how to handle whatever issue they had encountered.</p><p>What that letter meant, if it was an acceptance over a denial, was that she got to have a sliver of independence. She would get to venture into the city every day. Maybe her parents would let her explore so long as she was with someone. Sure, she wouldn't get to live on campus until after she turned eighteen, but even getting to go at all would open her up to an entirely new world. She would meet new people, learn new things. It was the first door to pass through that led her toward the rest of her life, but not the last one by any measure.</p><p>Maybe she had just turned seventeen, and there was still an endless list of lessons that life was sure to teach her, but anyone who had ever met Danica Harkness-Vidal would have announced her to be quite the entity. She was pragmatic and funny, but her beauty could have been a weapon. Instead, she used it as a soft and comforting expression that safety could be found in friendship with her.</p><p>She'd dated, more in the last year than the previous ones, but she'd been too nervous to bring any of the girls home. It wasn't that she expected Rio or Agatha to be a <em>complete</em> terror, but something about the idea of waving a giant flag in front of their faces that reminded them just how much she had grown up didn't seem like the best course of action, at least not yet.</p><p>The thought that they would dismiss her could never be the reasoning; they had raised her to love the way they did. They had raised her to protect her big heart and share it with only those that were worthy. It was simply that it was a forward trajectory in her life that would cause them to realize that by natural progression, she was stepping a little further from them and a little closer to the life she wanted to be living.</p><p>Dani had been deep in thought as she continued her back and forth, her brow furrowed in her effort. She had delved so far into her own mind that the sound of another voice caused her to skip a step in a startled jump.</p><p>"Still nothing?" Rio asked although she already knew the answer. She came off of the last step, a empty glass in her hand as she made her way to the kitchen to drop it in the sink.</p><p>"Mail must be running late," Dani grumbled, her lips twisting nervously, but she had not stopped pacing.</p><p>"You know momma's going to make you refinish the hardwood if you don't stop it," came Rio's soft teasing in return. She rinsed the glass out and paced toward the foyer, stilling Dani by wrapping her up in her strong arms. "You gotta stop worrying, Dani girl."</p><p>Dani's arms raised and secured snugly around her mom, squeezing her tight as she laid her head atop Rio's shoulder.</p><p>"I'm not worried... I just... I want to know," Dani tried to explain, but she knew that it fell short.</p><p>"I know, baby. But... It'll be here soon. And we will know for certain one way or another. If the answer is yes, then that's fantastic. If the answer is no, then we wait for the letter from NYU and we can make a plan then." Rio was always so even, so calm in times when Dani felt like she could shake right out of her skin. She'd always had this way about her, this authoritative gentleness that helped guide Dani through any struggle she faced.</p><p>Agatha had taught Dani to never take 'no' for an answer.</p><p>Rio had taught her that when there was no other answer than 'no,' it was okay to find other avenues to keep progressing.</p><p>Almost on cue, the outside flap of the mail slot clanged. Then, the inside one pressed open and about six envelopes spilled through, dropping with the curse of gravity to the floor before the time Dani could untangle herself from Rio and bolt over. She scooped them up and began to feverishly flip through them.</p><p>By the time she had moved to tuck the third envelope behind the others, her shockingly blue eyes widened and she dropped the envelope between her fingers to pick up the one she had been waiting for. Rio approached to take the other mail from her, but she dropped it too so that she could immediately rip into the envelope from Julliard.</p><p>"Agatha!" Rio shouted over her shoulder, loud enough for Agatha to hear her from her place upstairs. "It's here!"</p><p>The sound of heavy footfalls rang overhead as Agatha moved reasonably fast for her age, booking it down the hall and then down the stairs, her hair blowing wildly as she all but ran to where they were in the foyer.</p><p>"It's here?! What does it say!?" she questioned a bit breathlessly, skidding to a halt behind Dani, to her left.</p><p>The letter was in Dani's hands, still folded into three sections. She took in a deep breath and moved to lift the top portion up, though all she saw was her name and the Julliard letterhead in the opposite corner. She then tucked down the lower portion, her nervous gaze dropping to the text.</p><p>"Ms. Danica Harkness-Vidal, it is with great PLEASURE WE INFORM YOU THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED INTO JULLIARD'S BACHELORS OF MUSIC PROGRAM FOR THE CLASS OF 2025!" she was shouting, but her voice was undeniably trembling the longer she went on. She tried to keep it together, but the tears had begun to spill even before she felt the embraces of both her parents as they sandwiched her between them tightly.</p><p>They were kissing her cheeks, her temples, her hair at the same time and she was torn between wanting laugh at them or completely sob because she had managed to get into Julliard at the age of seventeen. She knew there had been younger students, but for her, it still felt like an accomplishment.</p><p>"Danica," her mom voiced into her hair, placing a couple more kisses there.</p><p>On the other side, Agatha had buried her face in Dani's shoulder and her voice sounded immediately after Rio's.</p><p>"We are so proud of you."</p><p>Dani reached up to the best of her abilities, wiping at her wet cheeks. </p><p>"Thanks, guys. I'm... pretty proud of myself, too."</p><p> </p><p align="center">

<b> <u>Agatha.</u> </b>
</p><p>
<em>Ding!</em>
</p><p>Agatha was not typically the most popular person after hours, but if there was a text coming in at ten at night, she had an inkling who it would be coming from. When she swiped her phone off of her nightstand and leaned back into the pillows, she couldn't fight the smile at the photo of Dani that popped up alongside the contact name 'Boog.'</p><p>There had been about three months when she was thirteen when she had really detested the nickname she'd had since she was a toddler, but she'd found a way to get over it. She knew that it was because she menacingly would pick her nose and chase them around screaming 'BOOG BOOG!' even if there was nothing on her finger.</p><p>She was currently in her last year of her Bachelors of Music at Julliard, but she had already been accepted into the Masters program, furthering her education another two years. She had declined a few orchestral offers to do so, but she had been determined to get that elevated degree and Agatha had never been shy about telling her just how proud of her they were.</p><p>Dani had moved to the city during her second year in college and while it had been hard to let her go, they knew they would lose that fight with her having turned eighteen. She legally was an adult and no matter how much they wanted to cling to her to be the ones to ensure her safety, they'd found that they needed to trust the lessons they had taught her, the skills she had learned. </p><p>When she had been in her first year, Rio would drive into the city every day to meet Dani at an MMA gym. They both took the lessons and while for Dani, it had been about protection, Agatha certainly hadn't minded the muscle building that had occurred in Rio's form. It had been a way for the two of them to bond and as Rio had disclosed in whispers through the stillness of early morning hours, it made her feel really good to be able to help Dani learn to protect herself.</p><p>Right then, Dani needed protecting <em>from</em> herself. </p><p>Not actually, but the little bit of the message Agatha could see before she unlocked her phone read 'Quick, I'm at Pioneer and need the recipe for...'</p><p>Agatha chuckled as the text window popped up in its entirety.</p><p><b>Boog: </b>Quick! I'm at Pioneer and need the<br/>
recipe for your Creme Brulée. It's an<br/>
emergency.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>It's ten at night, why are you at<br/>

have expected nothing less.</p><p><b>Boog:</b> I'm 21 momma. If the worst <br/>
thing I'm doing as a senior in<br/>
college is smoking weed and<br/>
making Creme Brulée at 11pm,<br/>
I'd say I'm doing okay.</p><p>Agatha had to laugh at that one. </p><p>It was fair, and Dani had a point: If the worst thing she was doing was getting high and cooking in her own kitchen in the middle of the night, perhaps they'd done a rather decent job in handling her upbringing.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>What do you already have?</p><p><b>Boog: </b>Heavy cream and sugar.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>Okay, so vanilla bean, salt, and <br/>
4 eggs should be all you need.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>1) Heat oven to 375. 4 ramekins in <br/>
a baking dish. (Put on a kettle about <br/>
this time)<br/>
2) Heat 2 cups heavy cream + scraped<br/>
vanilla bean to hot but not simmering<br/>
3) Whisk 4 yolks and 1/2 cups sugar<br/>
for 30 seconds<br/>
4) (this is the slightly tricky part) temper<br/>
the eggs by slowly adding the hot cream<br/>
5) Strain through a mesh strainer or <br/>
sieve so you don't have any scrambled<br/>
eggs<br/>
6) Divide the mixture into the ramekins<br/>
evenly and then fill the baking dish <br/>
with the hot water until it touches<br/>
the halfway point on the ramekins<br/>
7) Bake 30-40 min until jiggly<br/>
8) Remove the baking dish and then <br/>
VERY CAREFULLY (do NOT burn yourself)<br/>
remove the ramekins and put them on a<br/>
cooling surface until room temp. Then...<br/>

Chill them in the refrigerator for<br/>

(aka maybe save it for tomorrow)<br/>

sugar and using your probably too-<br/>
fancy blowtorch to caramelize the<br/>
top.<br/>
10) Crack and eat. (:</p><p>The entire time she had been typing out the recipe, she had watched as the bubble that indicated Dani was typing appeared and disappeared about six times. Agatha knew damn well she was going to give her a hard time about the length of the message, but she would then remember what she had asked for in the first place.</p><p>Her attention span could be a little limited in that manner.</p><p><b>Boog: </b>...you are insane and I love<br/>

said she thought she had enough <br/>
time to water her plants. Also, of<br/>
course I did. And then when I couldn't<br/>
I went and got us bread bowls from<br/>
Panera.</p><p><b>Boog: </b>Sounds like mom alright. Okay<br/>

back to the apartment. I'll text you <br/>

do. Please be safe. I love you too, booger<br/>
butt. </p><p>Agatha lowered the phone and started to lock it, but she stopped herself as a devious little smirk curled her lips.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>Oh, and have fun with your friend!</p><p>Agatha waited for just a moment, no longer than ten seconds before that indicative little bubble appeared again.</p><p><b>Boog: </b>I'm muting this convo til morning.<br/>
GOODNIGHT, YOU MENACE.</p><p>With a soft chuckle, Agatha closed out of the conversation and brought up her one with Rio. </p><p align="right"><b>Me:</b> You almost done, beautiful?</p><p>She locked the phone and set it on her lap so that she could grab the remote to turn the volume on the television up a bit. As she was setting it back down, her phone dinged in her lap again.</p><p><b>Wife: </b>Yeah I am a block away and <br/>

Rio had lightly dug a thumb into Agatha's ribs when they got to the bit about Rio burning the pasta sauce, playfully acting like she was biting Agatha's head as she did so.</p><p>"You are both absolute terrors," Rio had breathed with a laugh, her arm tightening in its grip around Agatha.</p><p>"You would have it no other way, my love."</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b> <u>Nikolai Malikov.</u> </b>
</p><p>The only thing Nik Malikov already wanted to do when he got off later on in the day was get home, shower, order something in and enjoy a quiet evening in with his girlfriend, Gabriela. Work hadn't been hard as of late, but on that day of all days, he hadn't wanted to go in. It was his birthday. His twenty-fifth birthday, to be exact. He had woken up to a 'Happy Birthday' text from his mother and an empty bed that had left him confused.</p><p>After a few slow early morning breaths, he could smell coffee. And... Bacon? It was six in the morning.</p><p>He pulled himself out of bed and slipped into a pair of boxers, shuffling down the hallway to the bathroom to begin his morning routine.</p><p>Flipping on the light, he found himself staring at his reflection, those eyes so dark green they were almost brown studious as they scoped out his own face, looking for any flaw or blemish that might have appeared since the day before. </p><p>His dark brown and slightly wavy hair was a tousled mess atop his head, but nothing a comb couldn't fix. His jawline was as strong as ever, chiseled and angled perfectly. Gabi had been trying to convince him for weeks to let her pluck his unruly eyebrows, but he had yet to cave to that request. So far.</p><p>After brushing his teeth and combing his hair, he made his way back to their bedroom to change into his scrubs, suited in his armor for another day in the oh-so-glamorous life of a physical therapist. Nik loved his job, but he had been feeling a bit stagnant as of late. He had been trying to pull himself out of it and he and Gabi had spent too many hours in early mornings looking at ridiculous career paths he could change to. It never went anywhere but it was fun to imagine. </p><p>Once he finished dressing himself, Nik headed for the kitchen, finding Gabi at the stove as she fried up a couple of eggs. There was a toasted bagel sitting in the popped toaster and an untoasted one sitting on the counter next to it. </p><p>"Good morning, gorgeous," he greeted warmly as he slid up behind her so that he could crane his head over her shoulder to press a kiss to her cheek. She jumped slightly as his hands found her hips, but hummed softly at the feeling of his lips just beneath her eye.</p><p>"Happy birthday, handsome," she responded. She reached forward and shut off the burner before she turned around in his grasp, hands landing easily on his chest as she peered up at him, that bright grin on her face.</p><p>Gabriela Mendoza was, without a doubt, the most beautiful person that Nik had ever laid eyes on in his entire life. It wasn't just the thin and pointed slope of her nose, or the perfectly sculpted cheekbones. It wasn't only that dazzling smile, her silky black hair, or the way those dark eyes shimmered when she was truly pleased or thrilled with something. Gabi was beautiful because her heart was pure, she spent time volunteering for different causes, and she loved Nik with everything she had. She'd loved him like that since they met his freshman year at NYU.</p><p>He dropped his head, gracing his lips softly against hers in a show of appreciation.</p><p>"Thank you. And I see you have been hard at work on birthday breakfast. Bacon, egg, and cheese bagels?" he questioned with a soft chuckle, glancing over her shoulder to inspect her work. </p><p>"Your favorite. Of course. But I know you have to get going, so I poured you a mug of coffee already and I'll build and wrap this for you so you can be off."</p><p><em>That</em> was why Nik loved his girlfriend and why he had been heavily considering the possibility of proposing, but he knew he needed to put a little more thought into it before he made any big plans.</p><p>They had been together since they were eighteen and Gabi had been the first person that Nik had ever felt truly comfortable enough with to even consider talking about his mother.</p><p>Alisa Malikov was... a sort-of good person. She always looked disheveled with her blonde hair and bright green eyes, constantly seeming like she needed to be looking over her shoulder. It had been a lot worse when he had been younger; she had moved them almost like clockwork once a year. He'd lived in a few southern states, the Midwest, even as far as C'ouer D'Alene. Sometimes, he wondered if she would have moved them out of the country if she could.</p><p>Being steady and planted was not something he had ever known, just as he had never known what it was like to have two parents like so many of the kids he grew up with. What was more was that for almost fifteen years, his mother had deflected almost every single he had hurled at her in relation to who the other half of him actually was.</p><p>She had never been bad to him, but it wasn't like she had been striving to win any Mom-of-the-Year awards. She took care of him, she <em>did</em> love him, but Nik had felt quite often like maybe there were more important things on her mind the majority of the time. </p><p>When he had informed her that he was applying for NYU his senior year of high school in Chicago, she had been <em>furious.</em> She had told him that he couldn't leave, that he couldn't go that far. She had been even more upset when he had applied anyway and got in on a full baseball scholarship. </p><p>Perhaps something in him should have found it strange that once he had informed her that he was leaving, with no chance for her to sway him, she had found a house in Upstate New York to replant her roots for the 900th time in his life. He had wanted to argue, beg her to give him a bit of breathing room, but he knew it would have collapsed their relationship in that house-of-cards stability it had been maintaining since he had announced his departure.</p><p>Nevertheless, his life had gone on, he had met someone he was convinced was the love of his life, and he had a career he was thriving in, even if he was growing a bit bored in the process.</p><p>Nik released Gabi's hips and gave her another peck before he slid over to the toaster and changed out the bagels, setting his on the wax paper so that he could side it over to her. </p><p>After she had assembled and wrapped his sandwich, he had left her with one more kiss before he departed for the day, leaving her to her homebound day filled with ad building for her own job. She worked in advertising for a world-renowned technolgical supplier and she, too, loved what she did. As far as Nik was aware, though, Gabi stayed enthralled with her work load.</p><p>His day at work had been abnormally long; he had an inkling that it was solely because it was his birthday. The other employees at the rehabilitation facility he had worked for had gotten him a cake, one that had a picture of Old Gregg screened to the top of it, something that he'd gotten a good chuckle over.</p><p>They had even supplied him with lunch from his favorite deli a few blocks over, both of which he had taken photos of to send to Gabi who had gushed that he had the sweetest coworkers. She hadn't been wrong. When he informed her the cake was almond, she had asserted immediately that any leftovers should get to come home with him -- almond cake was her favorite.</p><p>So, he had left the facility a few minutes early and made his way back to their apartment. When he walked in, there were candles lit around the main and dining areas even though there was still an hour or so left of daylight. On the dining room table sat a bag from his favorite Indian restaurant and in front of it was a small wrapped box. </p><p>Slipping out from under the nylon strap of his messenger bag, Nik hung it on the door and lifted his head to scan the apartment again.</p><p>"Babe?" he called, moving further into the apartment.</p><p>"In the bedroom!" she called back, causing a small smile to tug on the corners of his lips.</p><p>When he discovered her where she said she would be, she was an absolute vision. Her tanned, warm skin was visible on her arms, shoulders and chest with the velvet black dress she had pulled onto her form. Around her neck was a thin silver chain that sported the diamond necklace he had gotten her a couple of Christmases ago.</p><p>"Babe, you look..." Nik managed, though his mouth felt dry as he surveyed the wonder she was. "You got this dressed up to eat Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken in our dining room?"</p><p>Her expression softened and she closed the rest of the space between them, bringing her hands up to cradle either side of his face.</p><p>"Of course I did, handsome. It's your birthday. And just because you didn't want to be out and about doesn't mean we can't still celebrate appropriately." Her low tones were so convincing, so able to talk him out of the idea that it would be silly to put on a button-down and pair of slacks to sit in his own apartment.</p><p>So, he had chosen to do just that without giving it further thought.</p><p>After they had enjoyed their meals and drained their wine glasses, Gabi had pushed the little wrapped present across the table to him.</p><p>"Go on," she urged, those dark eyes flickering down to it before lifting back toward his face. "Open it."</p><p>He eyed her for just a moment but the smile he wore in the next second said that he knew he needn't be skeptical of her.</p><p>His fingers were precise as they worked the paper free, tearing it only when he had to. Once finished, he flipped the box over in his palms so that he could properly survey it.</p><p>On it, in very clean letters that were fashioned into the very familiar logo read:</p><p>Ancestry.com</p><p>His eyes widened and then lifted to his grinning, gorgeous girlfriend as she sat across the table from him looking thrilled with the thought she had put into such a gift. When she realized he was looking at her and not the box anymore, she knew she should probably offer some kind of explanation.</p><p>"I just thought... I guess I just thought that if your mom is never going to give you answers, you have a right to get them for yourself. And... in the seven years I've known you, she's evaded the topic damn near every time. So... let us get them for you instead." The explanation was stout, pointed and very, very clear. Gabi loved him enough that if she could help him know more about who he was, she was going to without skipping a beat.</p><p>Nik scooted his chair back from the table a bit, leaving the box on the table as he cocked his head to beckon her over. She was still grinning as she got to her feet and padded over to him, placing herself in his lap as her arms draped around his neck and she beamed down at him.</p><p>"No matter what that test says you are," she began softly, clearly needing to inform him of something very important as she leaned in to press their foreheads together, "I will love you always. There will only ever be one Nikolai Malikov. And he's mine."</p><p>That giggle that escaped her right as she gave him a soft kiss sent his heart soaring cleanly into outer space. Their lips parted and he found himself grinning, the gentlest whisper leaving his lips.</p><p>"Always yours."</p><p> </p>

<b> <em>Present Day, Early April, 2025</em> </b>
</p><p align="center">
<b> <u>Danica.</u> </b>
</p><p>Walking out of March and into April, Dani felt like she was stepping off the safety of solid ground and onto a rocket that was going to shoot through the next couple of months with ferocity. There was an endless list of things that would need attending or celebrating, including both her birthday and her graduation.</p><p>Maybe two days after her birthday, she could use the excuse of the 'holiday' to convince her parents to smoke weed with her. It was a long shot, but they would likely crave a distraction and what better one could there be than getting high, eating excessive amounts of popcorn and potato chips, and watching over-the-top comedies?</p><p>In the grand scheme of things, she knew this year was likely going to be harder for her moms than the previous ones. She knew that because it had been twenty five very long years since they had last seen Nicky; a quarter of their lives. So much had gone on and the way time had passed had brought them so much in life, but they'd never forgotten about him. Not any of them, even Dani. She might not have ever gotten the chance to meet him, but she still remembered the idea of what he could have been.</p><p>She still had the idea of what he was to her.</p><p>Other kids had imaginary friends. Dani had her imaginary Nicky. </p><p>He trounced through creek waters with her, digging up hidden treasures and crawdads. He built a dirt and plywood ramp with her when she was twelve. When she broke her arm launching her bike off it, she insisted she'd done it alone. She even drew him in chalk on the brick wall in the backyard, throwing a softball at his poorly drawn gloved hand.</p><p>Dani had never met Nicky, but he had always been there, real or not.</p><p>That night, a Friday at the beginning of April, the Harkness-Vidals were set to attend an award ceremony at the hospital Agatha had been working at for the last twenty-seven years. There were a variety of categories and recognitions to be handed out to a plethora of medical professionals, but the one Agatha was set to receive was a career recognition award. It was to honor the countless hours she had poured into her work and into that hospital, to boast about her passion and her unyielding ferocity. It was the biggest 'thank you' they knew they could offer. </p><p>A gala meant that Dani got to take the train to Newark and turn up on the doorstep of their family home with a bag over her shoulder after her classes ended in the early afternoon. It meant that when she opened the door, she was immediately hit with the smell of sugar cookies that were in the oven.</p><p>A grin filled her face, pushing up those still somehow cherubic cheeks as she dropped her bag, shed her shoes and all but sprinted to the kitchen where she found Rio, trading one sheet pan of baked cookies for a pan of raw ones.</p><p>"Mom!" she chirped, waiting until the moment the oven door was shut to bound up behind Rio, her arms wrapping firmly around her middle.</p><p>"Well hello, my daughter!" came Rio's delighted greeting, broken by her laughter.</p><p>"I missed you," Dani informed her, cheek still pressed to Rio's shoulder as she hugged her from behind. She gave Rio another hearty squeeze before she continued. "And don't give me 'It's only been two weeks' because I don't wanna hear it."</p><p>A pleased chuckle passed through Rio's lips as she gave Dani's arm a soft pat.</p><p>"I missed you too, boog. You ready to get dressed up all fancy and drink pricey champagne?" Rio questioned. She already knew Dani wasn't drinking; she'd agreed to drive so the two of them could celebrate accordingly, but Dani felt it wasn't worth it to remind her. Instead, Rio gave Dani's arms a light squeeze to request that she loosen her hold and she obliged easily, letting her mom go so that she could turn around to face her. The moment she did, RIo's warm palms found her cheeks with ease and she smushed them together.</p><p>"Ack, mom! Stop it!" Dani squealed, reaching up for Rio's wrists while she simultaneously ducked her head away from the touch. "You're gonna get cookie gunk in my hair an I already showered today," she tried to scold, but the grin that was on her lips extended to sparkle in her eyes as she regarded her mother. </p><p>Yes, it had been two weeks since she had been home for a visit, but it felt like so much longer than that. Each time Dani saw her parents, she could see as the days were beginning to wear on them. </p><p>Time was the very reason for their convening that evening. The award Agatha was receiving was a way to honor the time she had spent in the hospital's walls, but it was likely also the last of its kind in the span of Agatha's career. </p><p>Agatha was nearing retirement and while Dani was of the opinion that she would <em>have</em> to find some kind of job to busy herself and not go insane, she also realized that after the life she had lived to that point, Agatha deserved a bit of a break to just spend weeks or months at home with her wife and make occasional trips into the city to go shopping or grab a bite with her not-so-little girl.</p><p>"But yes, I actually brought my royal blue dress, the one with the corset bodice and the leg slit. Classy and not slutty enough to shame the family," Dani offered, her mischievous grin wide and bright at the slight widening of Rio's eyes. Before she could speak or give protest, Dani was posing an inquiry to change the subject. "What are you both wearing?" </p><p>Rio's eyes narrowed slightly, as if to call Dani out for being downright rotten without having to say a word, but then relaxed as she considered her daughter's question.</p><p>"I, myself, am wearing my black dress with the studded sleeves. As of this morning before she left for work, momma hasn't made a decision on whether or not she's wearing a suit or a dress. She has selected one of each but can't choose between the two." Rio took a step back and leaned against the counter, regarding Dani as those blue eyes flickered with the sparks of an idea.</p><p>"So what if I pick for her?" she suggested with a grin. "If <em>someone</em> doesn't make a decision, she's going to come home and spent an hour going over fifty reasons why each one would be right for this specific occasion. I can guess almost all of them, so I'll just choose for her." The way Dani said it, it was like it was the most obvious option available. It was as if nothing else could have ever worked.</p><p>She could tell by the look on her mom's face that she might have been onto something. </p><p>Rio jaw shifted and her tongue pressed to the inside of her cheek as a smirk bloomed on her lips. "I think that's actually a great idea. And would mean the world to her, honestly."</p><p>"Go on then, she'll be home in about a half an hour depending on traffic," Rio urged her with a light shooing gesture. </p><p>To Dani, it felt close to impossible to wipe that grin off of her face, even as she leaned in to place a kiss to Rio's cheek before she skipped up the stairs and down the hall to her parents' bedroom. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, it was tidy and well kept; the bed was made as though it were some high-class hotel room, only missing the chocolates on the pillows. Atop the duvet, two very different outfits were laid out in Agatha's indecision, shoes included on the floor at the foot of the bed. </p><p>The dress on the left was black, likely to match Rio's. It had a tilted neckline that looped around the outside of the shoulder. It was a sleek piece, one that Dani had seen her wear plenty of times before to schmoozy and uppity events.</p><p>Next to it was a black suit that had larger-than-normal pinstripes that were almost white, but had the softest tinge of pink. It was classic, in Dani's personal opinion, and she knew Agatha would look phenomenal in it. </p><p>Truthfully, Dani got the dilemma. She understood why Agatha couldn't choose.</p><p>Thankfully, Dani was not Agatha.</p><p>She picked the dress up and walked back into the closet, sliding it onto a hanger to place it back where it belonged. Once finished, she tossed the shoes in as well and wound her way back down the stairs to join Rio in the kitchen.</p><p>Pulling the door to the refrigerator open for something to drink, Dani grimaced. "La Croix? God, you guys are really showing your age. Drinking that stuff is like sipping on television static while someone shouts the name of a fruit from another room."</p><p>Rio's laughter from in front of the oven happened in the next breath and was bright and amused, nearly folding her.</p><p>"Where the fuck do you come up with this stuff?" Rio asked her, lifting her head to take in that insanely imaginative young woman she had raised. </p><p>"I think," Dani replied as she tucked a bottle of water under her arm before reaching back inside for something else, "that it might be," she continued, pulling her hand back with something clearly clutched in it. She bumped the door shut with her shoulder and used her empty hand to snatch a cheese cube from the other one, tossing it in her mouth. "The unmedicated ADHD. Maybe. Probably."</p><p>Rio knew she was right. They had tried the medication dance, but Dani hated it. It had helped in some regard when it came to studying and trying to actually take in information, but she had been very vocal about the part where it had stunted her creative process. She had the relief when she needed it, but by choice, she preferred to let the chaos reign and ride the waves as they rolled in. </p><p>"Didn't your parents ever teach you it's rude to talk with your mouth full?" Rio asked her, glancing into the oven again to check on the last batch of cookies.</p><p>"They might have, but I enjoy being a wild heathen instead," Dani replied sarcastically with a grin before tossing another cheese cube into her mouth.</p><p>"Oh, right. Your mother did say you've been smoking the electric lettuce," Rio teased, knowing it would draw a reaction out of Dani, and it did in the form of her howled laughter.</p><p>"You said it like that on purpose!" Dani gasped between bursts of her humored wailing. "You do not fucking think of weed like that! You're not ancient!"</p><p>Her entire jovial demeanor and the way the joke tickled her just so was something that clearly pleased Rio; there had once been a time where she had considered the idea that she would never know the joys of a visit from an adult child, but right then, she couldn't have been more thankful that it was an ever-present facet of her life.</p><p>"You're right, but this was totally worth saying it like I'm ninety," Rio assured her. She straightened and backed up, lowering the oven door so that she could remove the pan of cookies before placing it on the cooling rack and returning to the oven to shut it off. "And it goes without saying, but leave the cookies for after the awards?"</p><p>Dani's grin was toothy and ornery, the lights of mischief dancing in those beautiful blue eyes that looked so much like her mother's.</p><p>"Did you count them? Because if you did, whatever the total was, it's actually less. I can tell just by looking at them," the younger woman informed Rio with a self-assured tip of her head. Dani's humor had always been a beautiful thing and she was fully aware that both of her parents were happy with the fact that it was not something she had grown out of.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, her delight with Dani's antics still clear on her face. "I counted them. Twice. It's a treat to celebrate. When we come home drunk, we can make ice cream sandwiches with them," she explained as she began to clean up the few odds and ends that had been left out from her little cookie foray. "So I mean it, Danica, there has to be an even number."</p><p>Rotten as she was, Dani's smirk was Cheshire in appearance. "So what I'm hearing is: eat two cookies."</p><p>Rio took the couple of steps needed to close the space between them and lifted a hand, palming Dani's face. "What you are now hearing is: Go get ready for the gala, your momma should be home any minute."</p><p>"Bbt thn shldnt ah waitta shay 'ello?" Dani blubbered, stifled by Rio's hand against her face. Rio's fingers shifted and split so Dani's eye was visible, scowling as she spoke again.</p><p>"I'm kind of mad that I understood exactly what that meant," Rio informed her, detaching her grip from her daughter's face. </p><p>"Am I not correct?" Dani challenged in jest, the giggles working their way up her throat.</p><p>"You are, you're just really annoying ab --" Rio had started, but the sound of the front door opening cut her off as Agatha came striding in, still clad in those navy blue scrubs with her hair pinned tight at the base of her skull.</p><p>"Momma?!" Dani called excitedly from the kitchen as she hurried around the island to greet Agatha.</p><p>"Is that my little gremlin?!" Agatha snickered as she slid off her shoes, meeting Dani in the dining room with a tight and warm hug, one that seemed to communicate just how much Agatha had missed her in her absence. </p><p>Maybe Dani's teenage years had been a little bumpy in regard to how clingy and concerned her parents had always been, but now that she had grown and learned various ways to protect herself, they had gotten the chance to witness the kind of woman she could become on her own. Her romantic life was one flaming hot disaster after another, but she had yet to call it quits. Plus, the sex was mostly good, but that was not something that needed to be common knowledge.</p><p>"How did your Creme Brulée turn out?" Agatha questioned as she placed a kiss to the side of Dani's head and pulled back to gauge her expression for an answer.</p><p>"It was..." Dani started, though the smirk that was fighting its way onto her lips was difficult to ignore. "Pretty good." The smirk won out and Agatha's natural response was to roll those eyes that were almost a mirror image of her daughter's.</p><p>Dani stepped aside as Agatha released her so that Rio could step up as the next in line for a greeting from her wife after a day apart.</p><p>Rio went through these periods where she would pick up odd jobs for short periods of time to keep herself busy once Dani had left the house, but overall, she seemed to enjoy the role of keeping the fort held down. She cooked and cleaned, sunk time into crafts and hobbies she enjoyed like gardening and kayaking when the weather was right. Being able to work when she wanted was a nice facet to the dynamic of their marriage, one Dani actually found admiration in.</p><p>Her parents were powerhouses in their own rights, but as the couple they had become, she looked at them and saw a relationship that would likely never crack under time or pressure. What they had was the epitome of true love and Dani would have insisted so until she was blue in the face.</p><p>"Hi, my love," Rio greeted as she stepped into Agatha's waiting arm, planting a gentle kiss of hello to her lips. "Happy awards day."</p><p>"They made me work for it, today," Agatha murmured before she took another kiss. Despite breaking their lips apart, she did not let Rio go. He deduction came gently, her delight apparent by the light curl of her lips. "Smells like you've been up to trouble." Her eyes lifted to Dani, smile widening. "Were you a co-conspirator?"</p><p>Dani's hands flew up, palms out to prove her innocence. "Hey! I just got here. I was actually trying to convince her she can't count and that she's saying there are two more cookies there than there actually are."</p><p>That softened but knowing look as it crossed Agatha's face warmed something in Dani's chest. It was that silent acknowledgement that she knew one of the cookies would have been for her and that Dani bore more of Agatha's cunning and humor than most people saw. When she was home, when she was comfortable, it truly came out and she could tell both of her parents enjoyed seeing it.</p><p>"Well," Rio stated, hands raising to rub lovingly at Agatha's biceps as she stole one last kiss. "I am going to put the cookies away. You should both go get ready and I will be up to join."</p><p>Dani tauntingly snapped her ankles together and whipped a flattened hand to her eyebrow. "Sir, yes sir!" she barked, though the last word hitched right before she began to laugh.</p><p>"You're so annoying," Rio sighed, feigning exasperation.</p><p>"She gets that from you!" Agatha informed her quickly, ducking in to place a kiss to Rio's cheek before untangling herself to follow Dani up the stairs. "Do hurry, my love!" Agatha called behind her.</p><p>From higher up, Dani's own shout echoed down the hall and stairs. </p><p>"We're on a time crunch! No banging in the shower!"</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b> <u>Nikolai.</u> </b>
</p><p>"Just text them and tell them we're running a little late!" Nik called toward the bedroom as his girlfriend tore through it in a search for her wallet. The hunt had started about twenty minutes prior and thus far had been entirely unsuccessful. Every five minutes that passed without Gabi locating it, her frustration seemed to grow. "I'm almost finished shaving. Give me two more minutes and I will help you."</p><p>"I just don't understand where it could have gone!" Gabi griped, clearly aggravated. "I don't even remember taking it out of my bag!"</p><p>Nik considered for a moment, making one final swipe of the razor along his jaw. As he dropped it to rinse it in the sink, his brow pinched in consideration. "Do you think you might have left it in the center console in the car?" he asked. Fingers grasped tightly onto a hand towel as he pulled it from the rack and paced into their bedroom, drying his jaw and neck. </p><p>"I mean..." she started as her feet planted to search her recollection for any instance where that might be a possibility. "I can always check. Are the keys --"</p><p>Before Gabi could complete her question, there was a sharp rapping on the front door, heavy and commanding in its call for attention. Nik watched her expression tighten as she glanced over his shoulder in the direction of the front door. </p><p>"You get dressed, I'll get it." She looked a vision as she headed toward him in that white blouse and high-waisted navy trousers, kissing him on the cheek as she passed. They were just meeting friends for dinner, but Gabi never missed an opportunity to knock the breath right out of him with how stunning she could be, even dressed so simply and cleanly.</p><p>He had heeded her request, disappearing into the closet to find a button-down and slacks of his own. From where he was tucked inside the walk-in, he could not hear who their guest might have been. In fact, he hadn't heard a thing until Gabi blew back into the room.</p><p>"Hey, um, the police are here," she informed him with no other courtesy to break the tension. His confused frown pinched tight, lips turning down heavily at the corners. What the hell were the police doing there? Before he could ask as much, she took it upon herself to inform him. "They won't tell me why they're here. They said it has to be you."</p><p>He finished buttoning up his shirt, still not understanding what was happening.  "I haven't done anything," he tried to reason. "I've gone to work and come home and gone out with you. That's it."</p><p>"Hey," she tried to soothe, reaching to place a firm hand on his shoulder despite the fact that he was more than a couple inches taller than her. "They did say you aren't in trouble, but that there's something they need to discuss with you."</p><p>Nik's lips worried against one another and an uncertain huff of a sigh left his nostrils in a gesture that did nothing to soothe the sudden anxiety was sparking its way through his nervous system. What could this possibly be about? Why were the cops turning up at his door on a random Friday when he knew for a fact that he had done nothing wrong?</p><p>His eyes dropped, watching as Gabi held out an encouraging hand, one he would always take without a second thought. He followed her into the living room, taking in the sight of the two detectives standing by the door. One of them was considerably older, dark eyebrows that did not match the white beard on his jawline or the decent amount of white hair atop his head. His skin had started to sag in places, like this was a job that had been wearing on him for some time.</p><p>The detective next to him was younger by at least a decade, bright and eager blue eyes that were in direct opposition to the mildly somber expression on his chiseled face. </p><p>"Good evening, gentlemen," Nik offered, stepping further into the living room but still cautious enough to keep space between them. "How may I help you?"</p><p>The older detective stepped forward, close enough that Nik could see the badge that he had to offer. </p><p>DET. GREGORY STRAUSS.</p><p>There was something peculiar about his actual credentials, though.</p><p>CITY OF NEWARK POLICE DEPARTMENT.</p><p>"This is my partner Detective Kingston. We just have a few questions."</p><p>Why were police from New Jersey in the city, in his apartment?</p><p>"Perhaps you might like to sit," the detective suggested, gesturing to the couch behind them. </p><p>"No, we're alright," Nik assured him. "What's this about?" As he surveyed them further, he realized that the younger detective was clutching a folder with something of relevance obviously inside. His gaze snapped back to Detective Strauss.  </p><p>The older man's expression softened, as if he were trying to be convincing. He seemed to know that whatever can of worms he was about to open would likely call for a sitting position, but Nik could not begin to fathom what could possibly be so serious.</p><p>"Before we go any further, may I ask you to confirm that you submitted a DNA sample to the testing site Ancestry.com a little less than two weeks ago?" the gentleman asked.</p><p>Both Nik and Gabi glanced at one another, a mirrored confusion happening in the same knitting of their brows before they turned their attention to the detectives.</p><p>"I did. Is there... Did I do something wrong?" he asked. He could feel Gabi shift at his side, her arm lacing through his so she could fasten her hand into his, squeezing it tightly.</p><p>"You didn't, no," Detective Strauss assured him. He glanced over at the couch again, seeming a little more insistent that Nik sit. This time, that slight shift in the man's expression sent a painful chill racing up Nik's spine. </p><p>He swallowed down the lump in his throat and tugged Gabi toward the bigger sofa, waving a hand toward the smaller loveseat as he tucked his chin over his shoulder toward the detectives before he spun to sit.</p><p>"Please, sit," he indicated. Immediately, he was on the edge of the couch, Gabi's hand still clutched tightly in his larger one.</p><p>"The reason we are here is because we received an alert from Ancestry that your sample raised a flag in the system," Detective Strauss began. Before either of them could supplement that they had no idea what it could be about, he held his hand out for the folder Detective Kingston had been holding onto. "It matched to a sample that was collected twenty five years ago, back in Newark, in relation to a missing persons case."</p><p>Nik was listening, or at least he was trying to. His DNA had.. flagged? What did that even mean? When the detective had continued, Nik balked, his jaw dropping open.</p><p>"Missing persons?" he parroted back stupidly, gripping tightly at Gabi's hand in his stupor.</p><p>"Yes, we..." Detective Strauss began, glancing toward his person. "We would like for you to join us at the station in Newark for an official sample."</p><p>"Newark? I've never been to Newark in my entire life and I am clearly not missing," he argued back, not capable of deducing what was going on without them providing him with more information.</p><p>Detective Strauss opened the folder and picked up something that looked like a very old news clipping. He stared at it for a long few moments before his gaze lifted to land right in Nik's, his mouth in a tight line before he began to speak. The moment the words fell from his lips, he looked like he wanted to be saying anything else, if at all humanly possible.</p><p>"We have reason to believe that in April of 2000, you were taken from your home and away from your parents when you were four months old. Your birth name, if that truly was your DNA sample, is Nicholas Harkness-Vidal." There was something about the expression the detective was wearing that was shouting his need to say more, to keep going, but he stopped himself. Soundlessly, he lowered the news clipping to the coffee table and pushed it toward Nik.</p><p>Nik didn't move, not at first. His eyes dropped, barely scanning the paper before they landed on the men again, probing, daring them to admit this was nothing more than a prank someone had paid them to pull on him.</p><p>"You're trying to tell me that my mother... Isn't my mother?" he asked, the incredulity and disbelief in his words heavy and thick.</p><p>His mother was a lot of things, but she wasn't a fucking <em>criminal.</em> She didn't just run around stealing children. It had always just been the two of them, no matter how unsettled they had always been. </p><p>Detective Strauss just glanced at the clipping on the table. </p><p>Finally, Nik picked it up with the hand that wasn't clutching at Gabi's. The headline was bold and unmissable.</p><p>
<b>NANNY KIDNAPS INFANT: HARKNESS-VIDAL FAMILY SEEKING ANSWERS.</b>
</p><p>His gaze dropped, scanning over the few paragraphs of information. The women, Agatha and Rio Harkness-Vidal, had arrived home to their son and nanny missing. The article itself was dated a week and a half into the search but in that time there had been no leads. They had even posted a reward of five thousand dollars for any credible information in relation to the kidnapping.</p><p>He read over it again, and one more time for good measure.</p><p>"But..." he voiced, tone strangled in the swell of emotions that were threatening to overwhelm him. "This says it happened in April and that the baby was four months old. I... I was born a <em>week before</em> April. I couldn't have been four months old. I... I've seen my birth certificate," he argued back, doing all he could to poke holes in such a ridiculous story.</p><p>"There are explanations for things like that, but I don't feel as though we should be offering them until we know for certain that this is all true. Which..." The man's stubbled lips twisted for a moment before the gentle pleading that followed. "Which is why we would greatly appreciate it if you would join us in Newark. Once we confirm the DNA, we will be able to answer more of your questions and act accordingly."</p><p>Nik was just staring, eyes flicking from one detective to the other, as if waiting for one of them to admit that this was all a mistake, that they had gotten the samples confused. This could <em>not</em> be happening to him of all people. Maybe it had been annoying to have to move cities every year and maybe there were certain things his mother had done through the years that had felt abnormal or off, but he had simply written them off as quirks. Alisa was harmless, if not just a bit strange.</p><p>There they sat, doing their damnedest to convince him that she was a kidnapper. More than that, they were trying to hell him that she wasn't even his <em>mother.</em> That couldn't be true. He... kind of looked like her, didn't he? Maybe his hair wasn't the same color, and even though his eyes held a semblance of green in the right light, they were far darker than hers. His cheekbones were far sharper and his jaw was more angled, but it was why he'd had questions about the other portion of his paternity, questions she would never answer.</p><p>Could this really be why?</p><p>"Nik, baby," Gabi urged beside him, gripping tighter at his hand in an attempt to bring him back into the moment. </p><p>Very slowly, his head turned and he was able to tear his eyes away from the detectives. Somehow, he was hoping he might be able to find an answer in her beautiful brown eyes. All he saw there were pools of nerves that she was trying to bury beneath encouragement.</p><p>"I think we should go," she told him in a quiet murmur, those dark eyes searching his expression for a response before it actually hit.</p><p>"But... Gabs, this is insane. This... It... It can't be true," he returned lowly, waving the newspaper clipping that was still in his grasp around in the air. "I mean... It's sad they lost their kid... But that's not me. It can't be me." The panic was sleeping into his tone more and more as he tried to rationalize the information that had been given to him, his eyes glassing over the longer he talked.</p><p>Soothingly, Gabi's palm landed on his cheek, her thumb brushing below his eye in nothing more than pure comfort.</p><p>"I know, Nik. But if we go, they swab your cheek, we wait around, and then we know for sure one way or another. After that... Well, after that you and I will figure out where we go depending on what we find out. Either way, we do it together." Her voice was still quiet in a way that left the two other men mumbling between themselves to try and offer a moment of privacy when they could not realistically leave the room.</p><p>Nik heard her, though. He knew that she was right. They had to know. It wasn't like the cops would have shown up on just a hunch, but the theory they were floating to him was going to completely crumble his entire life if it was true. His agreement only came because deep within himself, he was certain they were wrong. His mother might have been many things, and she might have been capable of some unhinged behavior when it came to protecting him, but this? Kidnapping and keeping him away from any biological family he might have had for his entire life? It just seemed insane.</p><p>Finally, his attention turned back to the policemen. </p><p>"Okay, we'll go."</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b> <u>Rio.</u> </b>
</p><p>A couple of times a year, events like this rolled around where Rio felt truly proud of the woman she had fallen in love with over thirty years ago. She loved that the three of them were given an excuse to put on extravagant outfits and do their makeup. She loved that they got to venture out into the world as a unit, boastful over Agatha's accomplishments.</p><p>Watching the way Dani regarded Agatha in her suit with her hair tamed but still slightly unkempt as it flowed down her back stole Rio's breath away before she could even consider an actual reaction. </p><p>That look in Dani's eyes as she watched her mother slide on a few decorative rings was everything; Dani looked at Agatha like she was the only person in the world who had ever been capable of placing the moon and the stars in the night sky. Dani looked at Agatha like she could very well be the sun, herself, if she got any brighter.</p><p>They had been nothing but a cacophony of giggles as they emerged from the house and loaded into the Escalade that frequently hauled them around, as well as any company they might have kept at other times. Dani plugged in the address Agatha had given her into the GPS and departed, headed right toward what was sure to be an evening they would never forget.</p><p>Oh, how impossibly true that had been and how impossible for any one of them in that car to have had any idea.</p><p>Rio felt light, almost like she could have floated away as the three of them walked into the banquet hall of the hotel where the ceremony was being held. They looked like a million dollars, a pure showing up absolute class as Agatha, the incredible neurosurgeon she was, marched in with her wife and daughter, sandwiched between them in a chain of clasped hands.</p><p>It was not their first event of that nature, but Rio was all too aware that it was likely one of their last. Agatha knew it, too, but she had been dismissive of actually acknowledging it as fact. She was happy to reach the end of her career and spend the rest of her time relaxing on a beach somewhere warm with her wife, but she had also spent nearly three decades learning and growing and serving and teaching in that hospital. </p><p>That hospital had been a second home to Agatha over the years and ultimately, it was going to be hard to walk out those doors and know she was not going to be walking back into them. She had not officially set a date, but knowing that it was on the horizon clearly had her feeling certain things that she was not ready to discuss. Right then, sitting at that table as they shared in the meal provided and drank their champagne, she was happy.</p><p>Rio was <em>proud.</em> This was an accomplishment, something that an entire room for of people were going to understand. Agatha's dedication knew no limits; she had lost sleep, hours with her family, days of her life to the walls of those operating rooms but she had saved more lives than she had been able to count. There had been losses a long the way, but that number was far, far lower than that of her successes. </p><p>With the dinner plates collected, the evening rolled on into the awards portion. There were a couple of different presenters that cycled through the different categories with Agatha's being the very last. There had been a couple of instances where Rio had caught, out of the corner of her eye, as Agatha's phone lit up on the table below her, just out of Agatha's eyeline. </p><p>After the fourth time, Rio casually reached over and flipped the phone, leaving the screen pressed to the top of the table right as the current presenter called Agatha's name. The room erupted into applause as Agatha got to her feet, not hesitating to kiss her wife and squeeze her daughter's shoulder before making her way to the stage to accept the honor and say a few words.</p><p>Rio had tried to pay attention, but something else was drawing it away. She could hear the faint buzzing of Agatha's phone from its place on the table as it rang. It stopped for all of twenty seconds and started vibrating again, ringing over and over.</p><p>Who the fuck was calling Agatha so insistently?</p><p>Not only was it after nine in the evening but it was clear that she was indisposed and not able to answer. Rio's phone was stowed in her clutch and as such, she didn't consider the idea of checking it, too. </p><p>Instead, she tuned in for the last bit of Agatha's speech before she sealed it with her gratitude and departed the stage to Rio and Dani who were whooping and hollering in their endless pride. </p><p>With hers being the last award given, the ceremony was set to wrap the moment she sat back down and had started the process when Rio leaned in, first to kiss her cheek and then to whisper in her ear. </p><p>"Someone is desperately trying to get in touch with you. I haven't checked to see who it is," Rio informed her. She leaned back into her own seat, lifting a hand to grab her champagne flute so she could drain it of its contents. At the same time, Agatha was quick to grab her phone up, checking her calls and messages.</p><p>"Hey," she voiced suddenly, her empty hand flying out to land on Rio's forearm.</p><p>Rio and Dani both pinned Agatha with confused glances, having noted the panic that was constricting her tone. </p><p>"We should go," she said, not even having looked up from her phone. She was still clutching at Rio's arm and for the first time, Rio realized that not only was Agatha's hand trembling in her grasp, but her throat was quaking with emotion.</p><p>Rio's gaze shifted, landing on their daughter. For the briefest moment, a silent conversation was had where they both decided it was best to get outside, away from prying ears and eyes, and talk out there. </p><p>"Okay," Rio agreed easily, though it was so quiet that surely only Agatha could hear. </p><p>After collecting their things, the three of them spilled into the night air, Agatha's attention still nearly locked in on that phone screen. </p><p>"Who's been trying to call you, Agatha?" Rio questioned, an arm sliding around the small of Agatha's back as they began the trek toward the parking lot. </p><p>"Detective Strauss..." she answered, punching in the command for her voicemail. "I haven't heard from him in a few years..."</p><p>After putting it on speaker, the phone rang once before the automated system kicked on and voiced that it was going to play the message. The man's voice was familiar in some ways, but Rio had hoped she might never have to hear it again. </p><p>"Dr. Harkness-Vidal, this is Detective Strauss. If you could please get in touch with me at your earliest convenience, that would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to call this number back at any time."</p><p>The automatron kicked on again, but Agatha disconnected the call so that she could locate the phone number in her call log to immediately call it back, though they had not stopped walking in the direction of the car. Dani was silent, Rio was silent, both understanding what that message could possibly mean.</p><p>Sure, he had been vague. But... There was something there. Something more.</p><p>On speaker again, the phone rang three times, then the line clicked before the man's familiar voice picked up.</p><p>"Dr. Harkness-Vidal, thank you so much for calling me back. I did not mean to disrupt anything," he apologized sincerely. The had reached the edge of the parking lot by the time he continued on. "If you're available, I know it's late, but... Do you think that you and your wife might be able to come into the station?"</p><p>They were twenty feet from the car, but Agatha halted in place, staring down at the phone in her hand. </p><p>"Gregory," Agatha clipped coldly. "You tell me right now that you've found him."</p><p>Maybe it shouldn't have made sense, but as Rio took in the sight of her wife, still as a statue as she stared at that phone -- silence on the other end of the line for a little too long -- Rio knew it, too. </p><p>Dani stepped up to Rio's side, grabbing her hand tightly as they both stared at Agatha who was still zeroed in on the source of that phone call.</p><p>"We found him," Detective Strauss affirmed.</p><p>It was a good thing that for Rio, she didn't actually understand what it was he was agreeing to. Agatha did, though, and before she would let herself revel in the fact, she needed another answer first.</p><p>"Tell me the next part. Is he..." she hesitated. This time, Rio knew the reason she wasn't looking up at the two of them was because she was going to find them with nervous tears streaking their cheeks. That would be a sight she couldn't handle if the man offered an unsatisfactory answer.</p><p>Then, Detective Strauss said the words Rio and Agatha had been waiting twenty-five years to hear.</p><p>"He's alive."</p><p> </p>

<u>Nikolai.</u>
</b>
</p><p>"It shouldn't be taking this long," Nik grunted as he paced the length of the steel table that was located in the center of the room they were currently occupying. </p><p>Gabi had been the one to drive them to Newark and for that, Nik had been infinitely thankful. The truth was, his hands had not stopped shaking since the moment he had touched that newspaper clipping. Even more, he was pretty sure that he nothing in his body had stopped shaking since that moment. </p><p>For every bit of resolve and sense that had been seeping out of him, Gabriela seemed to be absorbing it, taking it in, holding it until he was ready to take it on once more. She was fortified in her mission to see it all out and get it handled, which Nik surely would have appreciated with a deeper sense of gratitude if his head had not been spinning as he watched the lights of the city grow fewer and fewer until the transition was made and they found themselves in New Jersey.</p><p>All he could do was think.</p><p>This couldn't be real. Even if the two of them truly were about to step into a police station in a state he had never been to for him to have his cheek swabbed and his DNA tested, there was no way that it could possibly come back as a match to some missing persons case that had gone cold decades ago. There was no act of the universe that would let Detective Strauss or some other office of the law walk into that room and tell him that his mother was not his mother and his whole life was a life.</p><p>At least, that was what he was trying to convince himself. </p><p>It was the only thing he could do to keep himself sane, to keep his head on straight when all he wanted to do was simply disappear. </p><p>With his prolonged silence throughout the entire drive, Gabi had not be willing to let him venture inside without saying her own peace, even if he was not ready to hear it, which he was not. In fact, all he wanted to do was cry and plead and beg that she just pull away and they never think about it so long as they continued to live.</p><p>"Baby," she voice soothingly, removing her hand from the steering wheel to reach for Nik's, squeezing it lightly in a silent beguiling for him to look at her. It took him several long moments, but he finally picked up his chin and turned his attention to her, though the expression that found him was woeful and forlorn. </p><p>"I know this is... insane, and that you're probably thinking and feeling a lot, but we're going to take this one step at a time. We get out, we go in, we let them take their swab, we wait." Gabi shifted in her seat, able to turn more toward him with the way she folded her leg in front of her. The hand that wasn't clutching at his raised and cupped his cheek, her thumb brushing lovingly beneath his eye. "Whatever answer they bring back to us, we take it home with us and we play it by ear from there."</p><p>Nik could hear it, how sure she sounded. It was like Gabi knew that what she was saying was fact and really, at the root of it, it was. Nothing that she said said to him was wrong or even incorrect. All of those things would happen, yes, but he was not certain that he could guarantee how it was going to feel to work through the process.</p><p>"Gabi, I..." he attempted, but it fell flat as sand flooded his mouth, drying it out beyond the point of being able to articulate clearly. His lips pressed together and he fought to compose himself, to find the words he so desperately needed to say. "This is a television plot," he finally said. It wasn't a revelation of his feelings or a direct path forward in their conversation, but he was somehow hoping that it would attest to his disbelief.</p><p>"I know, it's hard to fathom. And for right now, we can stay suspended in the disbelief until we have concrete proof," she soothed, not having stopped the motions of caressing his cheek. "The only way we get that proof is to go inside and let them do what they need to."</p><p>He knew she was right. He knew that there was no way out of this; taking off and heading back home wasn't an option. Nik had to face this whether he wanted to or not, and he certainly did not <em>want</em> to.</p><p>He considered, only once on the drive, texting his mother. She was in the city, she would meet him and could explain, but he remembered the detective's request that he not alert her until they were absolutely certain of the circumstances. The man had stressed how important it was that she remain in the dark without solid proof that she was who they suspected her to be.</p><p>"I... I don't know..." he squeaked, his eyes darting over her face. "I don't know what I'll do if --"</p><p>"Shhh," she coaxed softly, her thumb dropping to press softly over his lips. "We don't know until we know. So... let's go know, yeah?"</p><p>As he gazed into those deep, dark eyes, something in Nik felt safe for a fleeting moment. In that car, all was right with the world. The very moment they stepped foot outside of it, everything changed.</p><p>They had done as she had said they would, following the map she had laid out almost to a T. That left them in that cold, empty room as Nik paced back and forth, his chest growing tighter and tighter by the minute. He understood it took time, that they had to go through certain processes and run the tests, but it was taking far too long for him to be comfortable with.</p><p>"You should sit, Nikolai, you're working yourself up," Gabi told him softly from her seat at the table. He knew she was trying to be helpful, that she was trying to keep him calm, but it was having the exact opposite effect, especially when she used his full name.</p><p>"I just don't understand what could be taking them so long. I get that they have to test it and everything, but we've been here for almost three hours," he shot back, though about midway, he realized that his tone had developed an unnecessary sharpness that she did not deserve. He took a breath and stilled his feet, allowing his eyes to slide shut for a moment as he attempted to center himself. Another breath slowed his heart just barely, granting him the clarity to finally sit down.</p><p>"I know," Gabi returned, her hand finding his back as she turned ninety degrees in her seat to face him. "And I know the longer it takes, the more anxious you get. At this point, nothing I say it going to change that and that's okay. But... You have to keep breathing and keep focusing on this, on me, on us. We're right here, together," she reminded him, her low voice still sweet in its delivery.</p><p>His dark hazel gaze lifted to her, his lips parking to speak. Before he could manage a sound, the door to the room they were waiting in opened and Detective Strauss strode in, though the expression on his face was unreadable. When the door clicked shut behind him, his gaze lifted to the couple and the sole offering he could provide was a tight smile. </p><p>The legs of the chair scraping against the floor as he pulled it away from the table made something in Nik's stomach churn, heavy and violent. It was just a sound, an innocuous sound that should have had no context or connotation and yet, Nik felt as though he was going to vomit.</p><p>"Thank you for your patience," the detective began, placing his folder on the table. He wasn't looking at either of them as he opened it and turned it around so that they could clearly see the contents. He pointed to the graph on the top, his eyes finally lifting to Nikolai. "The top here is the sample that was coded and logged in 2000 from the kidnapping case. Below," he continued, his finger sliding down the page to indicate a second graph, one that looked identical to the first, "is the sample we collected from you when you arrived. They are..."</p><p>Detective Strauss hesitated just long enough that Nik felt everywhere in his body as every vital organ blipped out of existence and ceased to function. His heart wasn't beating. His lungs were not inflating or deflating. His stomach had morphed immediately into a black hole in deep space. His brain? Not a single neuron was firing, not a synapse to be filled. No spark of biological electricity could be found within him for at least thirty seconds.</p><p>The one thing that jump-started him back to life was the feeling of Gabi's hand grasping onto his like it was an absolutely lifeline. It wasn't one she needed, but she knew it was one he would need.</p><p>"Identical."</p><p>Nik blinked at the man, as if to clearly state that he could not believe it. That detective really thought he could just point to some images on a page and convince him without question that he was not Nikolai Malikov, son to Alisa Malikov? He really thought that Nik would be so stupid as to just take his word for it?</p><p>"That doesn't mean anything," Nik scoffed, his tone filled with anger, but Gabi squeezed his hand again. She knew he was in shock, she knew he was saying the first thing that was coming to mind, but he didn't need to square up with an officer of the law.</p><p>"It does, I'm afraid. And as hard as I know it is to hear, I have to officially inform you that according to an exact genetic match, you are in fact Nicholas Harkness-Vidal and you were taken from your home April 20th of 2000 by the nanny the Harkness-Vidals had hired, Wanda Maximoff." Nik could hear some of the words the man was saying, but only intermittent ones that somehow popped through the bubble of static that was nearly deafening in his ears.</p><p>"We believe that you may know her current location, and I..." The detective stopped and shifted in his chair, leaning back as a more empathetic look filled his features. "I know this is a lot. I know it's earth-shattering. But if you know where she is, we <em>need</em> to know."</p><p>The man wanted an answer, but nothing under the son was going to see to it that it came from Nik's lips. He was trying, he was doing what he could to speak or make some kind of noise that would indicate he did not know if he could help, but nothing hit the air. There was no squeak, no gasp, no choking breath that left him. </p><p>So Gabi filled the silence instead.</p><p>Her grip on his right hand and arm were so tight they would surely leave bruises, but he didn't care. The pain was the <em>only</em> thing managing to keep him from passing out and while he would have appreciated the black-out period, it wouldn't have suited anyone. When she spoke, though, something in him plummeted to the far reaches of the earth's core, burning so hot he thought he might disintegrate.</p><p>"She came to visit this week. She's staying at the 1080 in Brooklyn. I don't know the room number."</p><p>No! No, Gabi! What the fuck?!</p><p>He wanted to shout, he wanted to spin on her and ask her what the hell she thought she was doing, but moving even a solitary muscle felt like an impossibility. How did he stop her when he couldn't even bring himself to speak? All he was doing was sitting at that table, feeling as she dug into his muscles in her own terror, and staring at that detective as if he might actually concede and admit that this was nothing more than a bad joke.</p><p>This wasn't a joke, and now, they were going to head into the city to arrest his mother.</p><p>His not-mother.</p><p>His nanny?</p><p>Wanda?</p><p>That was what he had said her name was, right? Wanda Maximoff?</p><p>No, her name was Alisa Malikov.</p><p>And she was his mother.</p><p>But she wasn't.</p><p>Detective Strauss was speaking again, surely informing them what this was all going to have to look like, but Nik couldn't hear him. All Nik could hear was thunder as it rolled and cracked in his head, drowning out every other sound. All Nik could feel was the tightening in his chest as it grew worse with each passing second. All Nik could taste was his own fear, his own sense of terror at knowing that he knew... absolutely nothing. And that was wreaking havoc on him from head to toe.</p><p>He began to tremble, his body rocking through it as his chest started to heave and his breathing became strangled and labored. His eyes were darting, though he felt like he could not see anything other than blackness with white spots of light, blinding as they came and went.</p><p>Nik was having a panic attack.</p><p>One of Gabi's hands released from his arm and moved to his back, smoothing up and down as she leaned in to be as close as she could, needing him to hear her.</p><p>"Baby, I need you to breathe," she whispered. Somehow, he heard it, but it sounded as if she were speaking to him underwater, muffled and warped. "If you breathe with me, I can take you home and we can deal with it there, in private, okay?" </p><p>She sounded so calm despite the fact that she was on the verge of a nervous breakdown herself, but it was what Nik needed. He gave a weak nod, his attempt at letting her know he had heard her and he was going to try to listen. It wasn't the easiest task, but as she drew in a slow and even breath, he tried to match it. <em>Tried</em> was the operative word there.</p><p>It took several minutes for her to calm him enough that he didn't look like he was going to fall out of his chair and start convulsing, but he was still in pretty terrible shape.</p><p>"I need to take him home," Gabi voiced, forcing herself to look across the table at the detective, a pleading look in her eyes. "Do you think that we can have a day or two and we will get in touch?"</p><p>The man considered for a moment, his pitiful gaze falling to Nik.</p><p>"A day or two is fine. But... I'm afraid I need to inform the Harkness-Vidals as soon as possible. This is something they... They have been waiting twenty-five years for this day, and in good conscience, I cannot prolong it any further now that we know." The man's voice had tempered quite a bit and it was clear that the entire situation was not settling well with him. The fact that it was happening in his career at all was astounding, but he was seeing first-hand the heartbreaking implications of what one woman's selfish choice had done to several different lives.</p><p>"I -- I'm not.... I'm not ready," came Nik's panicked garbling, the fear in his eyes lighting them up for the first time since Detective Strauss had sat down across from them.</p><p>"I understand," the man returned calmly. "You're not under any obligation to meet with them immediately, but they deserve to know and as a respect to you, I wanted you to be made aware that I have to tell them."</p><p>A weak nod was all Nik could offer in response.</p><p>"The two of you should go home, be kind to yourselves and each other. This is a life-changing revelation and the gravity of it is enormous. Don't push yourselves to handle this all at once, just take it piece by piece. Get some rest and we will be in touch soon, alright?" the detective offered. It was obvious by the look on his fact that he got it, to the best of his abilities. He understood that this grown man was being told that everything he had ever known was nothing more than a lie, and that who he actually was was someone who never had the chance to be.</p><p>Gabi was the one who took up handling any conversation with the officer, thankfully leaving Nik with an ability to remain silent. It was good simply for the fact that speaking was not a cognitive function he felt himself capable of at that point.</p><p>In fact, even as they somehow migrated to the car, Nik was not entirely sure how they'd gotten there, just that they were suddenly moving and Gabi was murmuring to him over and over again that she loved him as she gripped his hand so tightly her knuckles turned white. </p><p>Getting into the house was another feat entirely. In the forty minutes it had taken them to get home, Nik felt as though he had forgotten how to walk. It took every bit of effort Gabi had to support him enough to get him into the apartment and down the hall to their bedroom. The moment she had poured him into bed and crawled in behind him, she could not have known that he was only thinking about one thing, and it was what she had said to him the night of his birthday.</p><p>
<em>There will only ever be one Nikolai Malikov.</em>
</p><p>Nikolai Malikov was a figment of someone else's imagination.</p><p>So who the fuck was laying in that bed, dissolving to tears while a woman who did not know him held him?</p><p>
<em>Who the fuck was he?</em>

</p><p>The air was already cool, but as the three Harkness-Vidal women stood in the middle of that parking lot, a mere twenty feet from their vehicle, it was as if the temperatures had plummeted to subzero. Every bit of moisture in the air was crystalized around them, rooting them to their spots, heels cemented to the blacktop below.</p><p>He'd said those words. That detective on the phone with her momma, he'd said something they had all three convinced themselves they would never hear in their lifetime. </p><p>Nicholas was alive.</p><p>Nicky was out there somewhere, and now, the police knew where.</p><p>They were frozen, immobilized by a statement that had been deemed nothing more than a too-wild hope, a dream that could never be achieved. He had said those words and not a one of them knew how to react.</p><p>Agatha was still burning a hold in the phone in her hand, Rio was gripping Dani's forearm so tightly that Dani knew full well it would bruise, and Dani was simply stuck, stunned to stillness including bated breath that hardly stirred movement in her chest. Someone needed to say something, or do something, but it felt impossible. It felt like moving a mountain with one hand tied backside. </p><p>What could possibly be done?</p><p>Dani made the initial sound, clearing her throat as she seemed to find her footing first. </p><p>"Momma," she croaked at the exact same time the detective spoke on the other line.</p><p>"Dr. Harkness-Vidal?" he questioned, attempting to nudge her into a response.</p><p>"Y-You --" Agatha managed back, though it sounded as if there was a deathlike grip around her throat as the sound emerged. "Al-alive?"</p><p>Dani wanted to move. She wanted to pull her mom over, wrap her momma up and get them both to the car so that they could get to the precinct as quick as humanly possible. Dani knew that from where they were, she could have them there in ten minutes or less and with it being later at night, she was willing to hedge her bets on the latter. In those moments, she wasn't sure how to find the capabilities needed to execute such actions.</p><p>"Yes ma'am," the detective returned firmly. "I will be more than happy to provide all the details, but it would be best suited for an in-person conversation."</p><p>"O-Okay," Agatha forced out, nodding her head although he could not see her doing so. "Okay, Detective, we... We will be right over. Thank you."</p><p>She was stringing together words a little more coherently, but Dani could still see and hear that Agatha was verging on completely collapsing. She had to get both of them into the car, that was the first step in making progress toward getting the answers she knew both women were desperate to have now that they knew they were there for the taking.</p><p>"You and yours be safe, Dr. Harkness," he offered before the line clicked and such a life-changing phone call was over just like that.</p><p>The silence was thick as wool, chilled and weighted but still charged with the spark of possibility.</p><p>"We need to go."</p><p>Dani's voice was so soft, but there was an underlying urgency there that could not be missed. She let go of Rio's hand to press forward, wrapping an arm around Agatha's shoulders as she ushered her to the car, Rio right beside them. At Dani's behest, they both occupied the back so that they could indulge in the physical comfort they could provide to one another on the way to the police department. </p><p>Truthfully, Dani knew she was the only one of sound enough mind to be behind the wheel of a car. Yes, this might have been a massive revelation, but she was technically an external party, someone who was looking in from the outside, even if the window was open enough that she could gauge the scent and the warmth of what was inside.</p><p>Dani had been on the other side of an anguish that she had not existed for and now, she could see as the door was slowly swinging open, offering her a chance to understand.</p><p>She ignored it, but a couple of minutes in, Dani swore she heard her parents crying in the back seat. She braved a quick glance in the mirror to see them folded into one another, clinging tight. Her heart squeezed at the sight, a pang of realization striking her in the chest.</p><p>They had spent twenty-five years not knowing. They could have guessed, and they had been told to give up hope more than once, but now they knew.</p><p>Now, everything they had believed for thousands of days on end had turned out to be true.</p><p>Their son was alive.</p><p>The silence carried with them as they made their way into the station, informed the clerk who they were there to see, and were escorted to a room in the back. They only had to wait a couple of minutes before the door pushed open and a haggard looking older man surged through, his tired eyes falling to her parents on her right. Agatha was next to her, holding her hand under the table, and Rio was on Agatha's other side, clutching that hand, too.</p><p>"Good evening, ladies. I am sorry for the late hour of the call, but as you know it was a necessity," he voiced as he took the seat across from them. In a move that was familiar to him that night but new to the three women, he laid out a folder on the steel table and opened it so that he could turn it around to show them.</p><p>"This is a DNA test. The top portion is the sample you provided us in 2000. The bottom is one that we collected this evening from a subject that had previously sent in a sample to an ancestry site. As you can see, they are an exact match."</p><p>Agatha's grip relinquished its hold on Dani's hand and flew up, covering her mouth as she processed the proof in front of them. On her other side, Rio let out a choked sob, cracking under the weight of what it was they were being shown.</p><p>"Fortunately for us, he lives in Brooklyn. We made the trip and convinced him to come in to provide the sample. After the results, he was understandably in shock and we released him to return home with his girlfriend." Three pairs of eyes snapped to him at this information. He had a partner, was living a normal life. Before anyone could raise any questions, the detective spoke again. </p><p>"I understand that this is going to be difficult to work through and understand, but there are a lot of moving parts and pieces. There is no legal obligation that he has to contact you, and if any of you excessively try to reach out, he would still be able to file a no-contact order. It's... Obviously very fragile. I am not able to offer much, but I do want to impart the advice that... As cliche as it may sound, time will heal all wounds. How much of it remains to be seen, but rushing into this might only hurt all parties involved."</p><p>It was a lot of information, and Dani knew he was trying to be helpful, but if she could hear her parents' thoughts, she would have known that they only had a few select questions before they dared to bolt in a direction where this could have a happy ending.</p><p>"What... What is his name? What does he go by?" Agatha croaked out, lowering her hand from her mouth to land atop Dani's once more.</p><p>"The name he has known his entire life is Nikolai Malikov. Wanda moved him nineteen times before he turned eighteen. She --"</p><p>"Where the fuck is she?" Agatha cut in, her voice having grown in strength exponentially at the mere mention of Wanda's name. </p><p>The detective paused, pulling back slightly at Agatha's sudden shift in demeanor. He had been building his response, but Rio was the one to speak up that time, her voice timid and quiet.</p><p>"Do you have her in custody?"</p><p>Detective Strauss gave a light nod. "A couple of my officers apprehended her in a hotel room in Brooklyn a little over an hour ago. She's being held and questioned while we decide how to formally charge her."</p><p>"I want to talk to her," Agatha announced, the rage beginning to leak into her tone. In turn, her cheeks began to flush and her grips tightened on the hands she was holding. "I deserve the chance to talk to her."</p><p>"You do," the man acknowledged, though his tone betrayed that what he was going to say next was not going to benefit anyone. "But that will have to wait until she's been booked and processed. I will be sure to get you the number to lock-up so that you may check visiting hours for tomorrow."</p><p>Dani was quiet as a mouse, just watching, just listening. She did not have the investment that her parents did, but she still comprehended the gravity of what was unfolding around them. She could feel Agatha's anger in her grip and she could hear Rio's in her soft sniffles as she tried to fortify her emotions while they were still in a public setting. And there Dani sat, having no idea what she could possibly try to do to make this better in any minute way.</p><p>"So she... She's just been running with him this entire time?" Rio asked, her voice a little harder and void of the sounds of her tears.</p><p>Detective Strauss gave a solemn nod. "She had documents forged for the both of them and rarely spent longer than a year in a given place. It appears as though she tried to keep it aligned with school years as to not relocate him mid-year. When he gradtuated high school, he moved to the city for college and has been there since."</p><p>At this, all three women blinked at him.</p><p>"You're saying..." Agatha started as she continued to assemble the full picture in her mind. "You're saying that he's been an hour away for... <em>years?!</em>" Her incredulity was thick, but it was also sharp. That realization was landing on them like a ten ton anvil that had been dropped from a cargo plane.</p><p>Detective Strauss' lips turned down at the corners in a deep frown as he nodded his answer. </p><p>Dani felt sick. If she felt sick, she could not even begin to imagine how they were feeling as they sat there next to her, listening to information that they were almost certainly struggling to make sense of.</p><p>The moment Agatha suddenly got to her feet, yanking her hands free from the holds of her loved ones, Dani knew she could say for the first time in her entire life that she had no idea what her mother was about to do.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>
<u>Agatha.</u>
</b>
</p><p>It was hot. It was swelterlingly hot and Agatha could feel acutely where every single drop of sweat had started to bead on her skin. </p><p>Having this conversation was something she and Rio had been convinced they had wanted, no matter how long it took to have it. Experiencing it, and hearing these things that felt like knife after knife and dagger after dagger in her chest? Agatha wanted it to stop. She wanted to stop thinking about it, stop listening to this growing list of facts the detective was providing that were making it feel so much worse than it already had.</p><p>The numbness had come a couple of years after Dani had been born. It had been a despondency that had grown from lack of answers or leads. While Agatha hated copping to the idea that Dani had allowed them to 'forget' about Nicky in any way, she <em>would</em> admit that Dani had helped them process their grief. At the same time, she had made living with the uncertainty a little more bearable. </p><p>There she stood, shaking from head to toe in the all-consuming rage that had swallowed her whole at the detective's latest revelation, feeling like she were miles from the woman she had grown to be after twenty years. Right then, all Agatha saw was red. All she felt was fury and pain and unimaginable heartache.</p><p>"What I'm gathering," Agatha tried, her palm sealing to her forehead in some silly attempt to quell her temper, "is that she ran him all over this fucking country to hide him from us and then... What? He became an adult and got to make his own <em>fucking decisions?!</em>" It was a miracle, really, that the glass window did not shatter with how shrill her voice became on those last two words.</p><p>"My love," Rio beseeched, giving the hip of Agatha's dress a light tug. Without words, Agatha knew what she wanted. Rio wanted her to sit down, to take a breath and to think this through as logically as they could manage given their heightened emotional states. Those wild blue eyes snapped down to her wife, lips pressed in a tight line. They had he loudest conversation without speaking, one where Rio reminded her they had to get through <em>this</em> -- the interaction with the detective -- to start getting through it as a whole.</p><p>Agatha released an unhappy sigh of resignation as she sat back down, her jaw clenching as she drew in a slow breath.</p><p>"Your emotions in this regard are all very valid, Dr. Harkness-Vidal. I understand the anger, the frustration. I know that you have your questions, and I promise you that we will get you those answers, but we need time." He was being kind, sweet even, but in her agitated state, it wasn't good enough.</p><p>"Yeah, that's all everyone fucking needs, isn't it? Everybody needs fucking time," she shot back, eyes dropping to the table as a scowl filled her face. </p><p>"Dr. Harkness-Vidal, I do understand the frustration, truly I do. But I am going to be keeping the lines of communication as open as possible with you. What I know, you will know right after. And here's the number to county so you can call, as well," he reiterated, scribbling down a phone number on the back of his business card before he pushed it over to her.</p><p>Her eyes were fixed on him and she remained completely still, unmoving. For a moment, Agatha could have resembled a perched gargoyle waiting to strike. It was a rare moment where she had to be objective. This was not his fault. In fact, he was being exceedingly cordial in how he was handling it, and thus did not deserve her ire. Rio and Dani had done nothing wrong. Hell, even a son that was not ready to see her was not in the wrong.</p><p>The only person who had egregiously fucked up here was Wanda.</p><p>She had shattered the life of someone she had claimed to be her son. At the same time, she had shattered several others as well. Anyone who had ever gotten a chance to love Nicky -- even the idea of him, in Dani's case -- had suffered at her hand, and she needed to pay for that. </p><p>Agatha would see to it.</p><p>"We should head home. We've got a lot to discuss," Rio voiced from her side, reaching over to give Agatha's knee a light squeeze.</p><p>Agatha knew she was right, but she wasn't done. She still had more questions, the important ones that they had initially been too stunned to ask.</p><p>"Wait," she offered, looking across the table to Strauss again. "You... You saw him? Spoke with him?" </p><p>He nodded, but did not speak.</p><p>"Does he... Did he... I mean -- fuck." Agatha stopped herself, drawing in a steadying breath to try and clear some of the jumbled mess from her mind. "Is he healthy? Does he look... Does he look alright?"</p><p>This time, the man's face softened and he offered another nod. "He appears in good health, physically. The news is very hard on him, for obvious reasons. I cannot get into it much more than that, but... As shitty as it is, it truly is just going to need time and personal work. But... The young woman that brought him in seems to be a good support for him."</p><p>Agatha was listening, but she was also <em>listening.</em> There were the things that he was saying, but she was listening a little deeper. She was hearing the parts where her twenty-five year old son was a functioning member of society and he had someone in his life that cared deeply enough to support him through a very devastating new experience that no one could have ever envisioned. Agatha could hear that for every single night she had lost sleep hoping he was okay, he had been a hop, skip, and a jump away living a rather normal life.</p><p>She didn't know if she could find comfort in that or if it made her want to do a swan dive off of a dock into the endless abyss of ocean.</p><p>"There's hope here for you all, yet. It's a very complex situation, but I have full faith that there's a way forward where you reunite with your son again. It just might require excessive patience. And if it might make you feel better to hate me for saying it, by all means," he encouraged with a sad curl of his lips.</p><p>Agatha <em>did</em> appreciate the offer, even if she was mature enough to know that it wasn't his fault, even if she didn't want to hear it. </p><p>The four of them rose simultaneously and Detective Strauss held his hand out over the table.</p><p>"I am aware that this is far from over, but I want to offer any emotion you might deem appropriate toward this scenario. As a parent, you have my support. As a detective, I will do everything in my power to deliver you the answers to every question you have ever had. You have my word." </p><p>Agatha's jaw was tight as she shook his head, giving a curt nod of understanding. When he shifted to shake Rio's, she found words a little easier than Agatha.</p><p>"We appreciate what you have done for us, Greg. Truly. And yeah, it's not over, but... None of it's gone unnoticed thus far." Her words were rich and sincere, but Agatha could also hear Rio's pain, her sadness.</p><p>They had their answers, now, and yet, as they all shuffled in the front door of their dark house, it almost felt as though they had no answers at all.</p><p>"You're staying tonight, right?" Agatha asked Dani, sounding as exhausted as she felt.</p><p>"I'll do you one better," Dani answered, sliding up to Rio's side to fit under her arm, hugging herself to her mama. "I wanna sleep in bed with you guys tonight. I think we all need it."</p><p>Dani the intuitive.</p><p>Dani the intelligent.</p><p>Dani the wise.</p><p>Their Dani.</p><p>Agatha had always missed her son, but in her twenty-one years of existence, Dani had always provided answered to questions that Agatha had never known how to ask. </p><p>It had been an easy agreement from both herself and Rio, the three of them dispersing to change out of their formal wear and into pajamas. Agatha had climbed into bed first as Rio finished washing her face. There needed to be conversations and yet, all Agatha wanted to do was curl up with her loves and simply sleep, perhaps finding herself in a dream world where Nicky wanted to run back to them with no reserves and their family was whole once more without a fight to get there.</p><p>As Rio emerged from the ensuite, Dani came gliding in from the hall, so casually and playfully bumping right into her mom. Rio looked startled at first, but when she caught sight of the smile on their daugher's lips, her own lips sprouted one just the same.</p><p>"You're so mean to me," Rio pouted, placing a forceful peck to the back of Dani's head as she ventured to the other side of the bed to climb in. </p><p>After only another moment, Dani had settled into Agatha's side and Rio had sealed her in between them by placing herself on Dani's other side, The moment everyone was comfortable, it was an instant tangle of embraces as their twenty-one year old daughter began to process of trying to hold them together.</p><p>There was no telling how long it might take, or how close to breaking they might come, but right then there was one thing that Agatha was absolutely certain of:</p><p>Whatever happened, they would take it on together.</p><p>Eventually, maybe 'together' would include Nicky, too.</p><p> </p>

<u>
<b>Rio.</b>
</u>
</p><p>What was a stronger word than empty?</p><p>What could possibly convey how it felt to know that after a quarter of her life spent wondering and hoping and praying to some deity Rio never believed in, their son was alive and less than a couple of hours away? </p><p>There was not a linguistic syntax in <em>any</em> language that could compact that feeling and deliver it in all of its weight. There was not a single sensible way for that type of emotion to be expressed. Any choice she tried to make, it wouldn't have been accurate. It wouldn't have described the way their family had somehow floated back home like ghosts, silent and not disturbing anyone or anything on their way.</p><p>While trying to keep her finger on her own pulse, Rio was also trying to gauge the reactions of her loved ones, too. She was trying to figure out a way to soothe Agatha's seething rage, and trying to locate some course of action to make sure that Dani understood they loved her and anything she was feeling about all of this was more than valid, even if they didn't know how to field it until they could sort through the turmoil in their own heads.</p><p>This was a mess.</p><p>Rio was hardly sure what to feel herself; she was panicking without question, but there was this warped sense of relief that was fighting so desperately to take root in the very base of her brain. </p><p>Nicky was alive.</p><p>
<em>Alive.</em>
</p><p>He had lived for twenty five years and now he was residing in a large city where he was just another face. </p><p>Something struck Rio.</p><p>Dani lived in the city, too. Dani spent a lot of time in different parts of the city. She hung out with her friends, she went on dates. She ventured to new spots all of the time. Rio knew for a fact that she had spent plenty of time in Brooklyn. </p><p>What if she had somehow occupied the same space as Nicky and had simply never known? </p><p>She never could have. None of them could have. Hell, he could have been sitting next to the three of them when herself and Agatha would meet Dani for brunch somewhere and not a one of them would have had a single clue.</p><p>They knew Nicky as a baby and nothing more. Maybe they would have been able to see it. Maybe they would have seen him and been drawn to his striking and sharp features. Or maybe they would have seen it in the color of his eyes. Maybe they would have known if he just smiled at them.</p><p>There was no use wondering because even with the news that the search had drawn to a close, the battle was nowhere close to being over. They still did not even know what he looked like. At least, they hadn't when they walked out of the station that night.</p><p>In the early hours of the morning, the three of them were bunched up in the bed, all in sitting positions as Dani led the charge on scrolling through the various Google results and social medias that they could locate based on the name the detective had given them.</p><p>They had tried to rest, to sleep, but as Rio had curled into one side of Dani with Agatha on the other, their heads touching as they rested on their daughter's chest, she'd known it was never going to happen.</p><p>How could they sleep knowing what they knew?</p><p>How could they possibly find respite while thinking about what their son, Dani's brother, was doing in his home that they could drive to in less time than it took to watch some films? All they could do was lay and whisper and sniffle and shed tears that had surely soaked Dani's shirt. So, at 3:58, Dani had urged them to move and climbed out of bed to get her laptop. </p><p>At 4:11, they found a page for a therapy clinic with his name, but no photo. He had a DPT and had been at that clinic for two years.</p><p>By 4:13, they had found a Google result for an Instagram that they were a little more confident about than the others. </p><p>Dani clicked it.</p><p>Three things happened at one time.</p><p>A choked sob escaped Agatha.</p><p>Dani's hand flew to her mouth to suppress a gasp.</p><p>And Rio?</p><p>Rio just cried, the hot and emotionally torn tears ripping rivers down her cheeks.</p><p>They <em>knew</em> it was him. Just by looking at him, they could <em>tell.</em></p><p>He <em>did</em> have impossibly pointed features, ones that were so very similar to Agatha's. His cheeks were high and sharp, his jaw angled. His nose was more in the vein of Rio's, but where she could really see herself in him was in his eyes. They were the most beautiful color, but also two colors at once. In some photos, they looked a very dark green and in others, they were a light brown. His smile belonged to neither of them, but both instead.</p><p>He was handsome. He looked healthy. In the photos with his girlfriend especially, he looked <em>happy.</em> </p><p>Rio had noticed something: in the 45 minutes they spent scrolling through his Instagram, they had not found a single photo of Wanda, or even one of them together. They had only reached the tail end of 2023, but there was no trace of her, not even a mention of her in any caption or comment. </p><p>Clearly she was close, too, and it was how the police had apprehended her, so why was she absent in his presentation of his life to the world? Why did he not want to share his relationship with her to his friends and people interested in who he was? Had she been bad to him? Was their relationship strained? Had she not loved him enough?</p><p>Rio could have chased her tail for hours, asking herself questions that she knew she might never have the answers to. </p><p>That was the scariest part.</p><p>Even knowing the truth, he could still choose to keep away. He was a grown man who had spent a huge portion of his life buried beneath lies and misconceptions. Wanda had taken off with him and she had never stopped running, but she had still raised him. His entire life was something she had constructed, a world that she had created to deceive him and for what purpose, they still did not know.</p><p>Maybe Agatha might get more answers if she was granted permission to go to the jail where Wanda was being held and speak with her. After that long, there was little chance that Wanda would be too forthcoming. They could be hopeful, but Rio was not stupid. This had been calculated and Wanda had spent over two decades running with the ruse, spilling every bean was likely not going to be on her agenda.</p><p>The only thing she had done was hurt the man she had raised.</p><p>At least, that was what Rio assumed. Truthfully, they had no real way to even <em>assume</em> what it was he was feeling and they wouldn't until he made the decision to reach out. Knowing that they might have to go the rest of their lives without answers was a panic and a pain that Rio had only experienced one other time in her life in her life when he had gone missing so long ago. It was the same anxiety of knowing he was gone and the same pain of knowing they might never see him again.</p><p>But they were seeing him. He was right there, grinning and posing and kissing his girlfriend on Dani's laptop screen. Even so, they couldn't hear the laughter from him when his mouth was open and his head tipped back in his joy. They couldn't hear the conversation he was having as he was so focused that he looked <em>just like</em> Agatha. </p><p>They had crumbs, only a couple of pieces to a massive puzzle. They needed more, needed to see more of the picture and that constant longing was going to rip Rio apart. She knew that she needed to find a distraction, but there they sat until almost eight in the morning, just looking through his Instagram, his Facebook, even his fucking LinkedIn.</p><p>From what they had found, Rio could see a good man. </p><p>He had a career that was sensible and contributed to the betterment of others. He had a healthy and loving relationship with a woman that looked at him like he was the very reason the sun rose in the sky every day. He had friends, he went out and had fun. He enjoyed true crime documentaries -- per the several photos of title screens he had posted to his Instagram -- and the two of them spent a weekend a month volunteering at their local animal shelter. </p><p>Perhaps it could have been considered stalking, but between the three of them, they had needed <em>something.</em></p><p>Their chatter had been hushed and soft as they absorbed everything they were seeing and learning, and while Dani was clearly working to compartmentalize, Rio's hand had not loosened its grip on Agatha's where they had joined early on behind Dani's back. It was their way of speaking the things they couldn't say in front of their daughter. It was in those little hand squeezes when they saw a photo that had him looking the spitting image of the two of them. It could be found in the way thumbs would brush over knuckles in an attempt to soothe a wordless ache.</p><p>They had the ultimate answer now. Everything else was absolutely what they needed, but they knew that this was all entirely out of their hands. They couldn't message him; it would surely cause a uprising of unpleasant emotions. They couldn't track him down and try to force his hand. It wouldn't serve a one of them in any way and would probably crumble the already shattered pieces of the situation further.</p><p>By 8:30, Dani had climbed out of bed to shower, saying she needed it more to calm her nerves than anything else. </p><p>The moment she disappeared and they heard the bathroom door shut down the hall, the space that had previously been filled by their little girl was instantly gone as they both scooted toward the other, meeting in the middle. They were a tangle of arms and legs, wrapping up so tightly that Rio was certain Agatha's hold on her could cut off circulation in some parts of her body. Then again, Agatha probably felt the same way about how Rio was locked around her, too.</p><p>Rio wasn't sure what struck her and pushed her to speak, but her voice didn't sound like her voice when the words tumbled out. It was a sentiment they had been sick of for twenty five years, but she knew nothing else to say.</p><p>
<em>"It's going to be okay."</em>
</p><p>It could have easily been deemed foolish. Anyone in the world could have called Rio an idiot and they would have been right, solely because that was what she had chosen to say, but she <em>had</em> to have the faith. She <em>had </em>to believe that in a month, or even a year, their son would understand that for his entire life, all they had ever truly wanted was the opportunity to love him and would find a way to reach out. </p><p>She could be giving herself false hope, but it didn't feel like there was much else to hold onto. Rio needed something to keep her going when it felt like they'd been <em>so fucking close</em> to him only to have the reality snatch him away, instilling a painful distance between them, but this one was solely rooted in choice.</p><p>Even before Agatha drew in the breath she needed to speak, Rio had somehow known she was not going to like what Rio had said.<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<u>
<b>Agatha.</b>
</u>
</p><p>"Is it?" </p><p>Agatha's clipped return was quiet, but it was sharp and filled with the anxiety and pain such a thought caused her. She knew that Rio was trying to be soothing, that she was trying to find a way to calm every wiry emotion that was straying over what was happening. There was just so much to pick apart and try to process that it felt too overwhelming.</p><p>"What has even changed other than just knowing he's alive and Wanda's in custody? He's still lost to us, Rio," Agatha tried to explain in a broken whisper, though she did not feel like she was doing a decent enough job of framing it in words. She sighed softly, burrowing her face into Rio's neck as she tried to search, tried to find the best way to phrase what she needed to say. It took her a couple of moments, but she finally got there. "He has to make the choice to be ours. Yes, <em>we</em> will always know he's ours, but when it comes to how we relate to him... We are strangers until he doesn't want us to be anymore. And that... That could very well never happen."</p><p>Agatha hated that she had to say it out loud. She knew they were both thinking it, and maybe even Dani too, but they needed to hear it. Even she needed to hear someone say it, even if it was coming from her own lips. It was the shitty, fucked up, awful truth and they needed to be real with themselves about it. </p><p>The moment Rio began to tremble in Agatha's arms, she knew she'd said the wrong thing, even if it was the necessary thing. </p><p>She got it; Rio was the softer of the two of them. She reverted to a problem-solving mode when any issues came up and now that there was nothing she could do to solve their biggest problem, she was beginning to flounder. She was beginning to lose sight of the blind hope they had been clinging to for so long because now, there was <em>nothing</em> they could do to hurry this along or make it any better.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Agatha whispered, squeezing her eyes shut as she pressed her face more firmly to Rio's neck.</p><p>Rio did not say it was okay, because it wasn't. All Rio did was cling tighter.</p><p>That vice grip they held one another in was enough of a comfort to allow them to doze, falling asleep tangled and safe, although the inner turmoil they were both experiencing was enough to completely sink them. </p><p>They even slept through Dani coming in to check on them after her shower, covering them up with a sympathetic care that neither of them had known her quite so capable of. Dani was an understanding and kind person, but this was hitting her in a different way than it was the two of them and it might be some time before they could pull themselves out of the thick of it to understand that.</p><p>When Agatha had stirred several hours later, it was late afternoon and Rio was still sound asleep in her arms. When she gently untangled herself from their embrace, thankful Rio stayed dormant, Agatha's head turned to see a piece of paper laying on her nightstand, folded into a small tent so that it did not get missed. </p><p>With a slowness instilled by grogginess, Agatha reached over and plucked it from its place, flipping it open to read what was scrawled inside in Danica's neat penmanship.</p><p>               <em>I ran home to pack a few things. I've already emailed my professors and have asked to sit in on the online lessons instead of being in person due to a family emergency and they're okay with it. I'll film my sessions and practice will go on without me, so don't text me telling me to stay. I should be back by dinner time. I know none of us probably want to eat, but if you want me to bring anything, just let me know.</em></p><p>
<em>              I love you guys. See you in a bit.</em>
</p><p>Nothing Dani said in that note was indicative that she was struggling and yet, Agatha knew it anyway. She knew that Dani was having to sit sideline while Rio and Agatha attempted to wrestle the emotional havoc that was trying to completely shred them to pieces. Agatha was fully aware that there was no way they could mask it, not even to protect the one child they <em>had</em> gotten the chance to raise. </p><p>That had to be remedied. Dani didn't deserve to feel their pain as well as her own.</p><p>But where in the fucking world were either of them going to be able to find that kind of perspective? All Agatha could feel right then, reading that note over a couple more times, was that she was letting down her daughter by diving straight into her own anger. If Agatha knew her wife at all, she knew Rio felt a similar way about her own anxiety, and they were less than 24 hours into this fresh version of their nightmare.</p><p>Picking up her phone, Agatha could see that it was almost 4pm and that they had accomplished nothing she had been hoping they might. She had wanted to be productive, to find some semblance of a solution. She had wanted to remind her wife and daughter that she loved them, even if she wasn't the best at showing it. She'd wanted to call that number to County and march in there and give Wanda fucking Maximoff a piece of her mind after twenty five years of sheer torture.</p><p>And still, it wasn't over.</p><p>No one knew when the end was going to come.</p><p>No one could look them in the eye and say "This is the day it will all be over."</p><p>Maybe it would never be over. That was something that they had to give a spot in the list of possible outcomes they could be facing. It was hard, but Agatha knew that it was realistic.</p><p>She was not sure how she would ever find the ability to be truly happy when she knew her son was alive, that he was out there, and wouldn't choose them. It was the most unsettling feeling to not have that answer, to not know anything about him that might help her build a theory. They had nothing to go on, not even a sliver, and as a result, it felt like staring a black hole down without even knowing what to look for.</p><p>Agatha's head lulled to the side, Rio's expression serene only due to the fact that she was unconscious and her face was half smashed into the pillow. She was resting, escaping from what a nightmare this had become in the matter of a phone call and an hour long visit to the police station. Their lives had found ways to settle over the years, but everything was upended and destroyed and in many ways, Agatha felt like she was 30 all over again, suffering from the same heartache she'd had then.</p><p>Watching her wife sleep, Agatha knew she could not lay in that bed another moment. She wasn't ready to face the outside world yet, but she needed to get up and move around, needed to make herself a cup of coffee or perhaps something a little stronger.</p><p>Despite the fact that her limbs felt as though they had ten ton anvils tied to them, she managed to push herself up and to place her feet on the carpet. It was the same carpet in the same house they'd been living in for almost thirty years and yet, it still felt different. In that moment, a new brand of panic swept through Agatha. </p><p>Was everything in her world going to feel different now that they knew the truth? The walls looked the same, but the house had shifted. There was a room that held an office that should have been one their son could sleep in when he had a bad day at college or work. It should have been a place he could find refuge and yet, he had never even known it had once been his.</p><p>Agatha passed it when she dragged herself from their room, feet feeling heavy as they moved. She did not push the door open, did not look inside, but she still felt the weight of unexplored potential as it sat in that room. </p><p>Somehow, she found herself in the kitchen, and while there was a pot of coffee brewing, Agatha had a sizeable handle of Evan Williams in front of her, calling to her. It wasn't even 5 yet and drinking alone was pathetic no matter the circumstances, but right then she needed to mute some of the raucous and invasive thoughts that were plaguing her.</p><p>She reached down and lifted the bottle, unscrewing the cap with an utter lack of finesse. Slapping it down on the counter, Agatha wrapped her thin fingers around the neck of the bottle and lifted, taking a long pull from it. Somewhere along the second swallow, the deadbolt to the front door jiggled and flipped, the door swinging open a second later as Dani walked through it.</p><p>Agatha severed her draw from the bottle, a couple of drops of the liquor rolling down her chin as a result of her startled adjustment.</p><p>"Take another one, fuck," Dani voiced when she came into the kitchen to see Agatha wiping at her chin. "Actually, don't," she amended, stepping forward to take the bottle from Agatha's grasp. She wasted no time at all as she brought it to her lips and tipped her head back, swallowing several gulps. The look on her face as she pulled the glass away was almost comical; it was enough to make Agatha breathe the softest chuckle.</p><p>"You're a heathen," Agatha voiced, but her volume was low and the edge she had been carrying around with her since they had walked into that police station seemed to have softened.</p><p>"We are collectively in Depression, USA, so I think one tug of three shots is more than reasonable," Dani returned, handing the bottle back over to her mother with a soft smile. "Is mom still sleeping?"</p><p>Agatha took the bottle and placed the cap back where it belonged, nodding her head gently. "I didn't want to wake her. She needs the rest while she can get it."</p><p>"For sure," came Dani's easy agreement as she paced to the refrigerator. She stood with the door open for a moment, face scrunching in her assessment of the contents. "When are you guys going to actually keep stuff to drink that isn't gross?" she asked, leaning enough that she could peer at Agatha around the corner of the door.</p><p>"Yes, Danica, you hate La Croix, I know," Agatha offered back, her voice intentionally condescending, though it wasn't pointed and instead came out in jest.</p><p>"Okay, but cranberry and grapefruit juice? Not even apple? Or grape? You haven't even hit sixty!"</p><p>Agatha laughed. It was an actual, real laugh that was genuine as it escaped her unexpectedly. The look that flashed across her face was brief, but it was shocked. It felt like a foreign act, like she was somehow betraying the main missive here, which was that they were realizing once more that they were helpless to put their worlds back on their axes. </p><p>"Mom drank the last of the orange juice yesterday morning. And she buys the extra pulp anyway because she's a freak," Agatha voiced, though an affectionate smile had found her lips.</p><p>Dani bent at the waist, surveying deeper in on the lower shelves, a triumphant 'aha!' sounding as she reached inside, toward the back. A second later, she snapped up, clutching a can of cherry 7up and wearing a bright grin.</p><p>"Better than nothing!" she announced, cracking the can open. </p><p>As Agatha surveyed her daughter, her beautiful little girl, a familiar warmth began to find her chest. It was in part due to the alcohol, but it was also the undeniable and endless love she felt for the brilliant and bright young woman in front of her. </p><p>Maybe in her younger years they had been a little more on the neurotic side, but it had stemmed from a place of wanting to keep her safe. It had been hard when Dani started getting a little older simply because Agatha had worked so much that they hadn't gotten much time together. </p><p>Rio had found a quick remedy to that. </p><p>Every Saturday had been Dani and Agatha's day. They would sometimes go out to a film or go shopping. Other times, they would camp out in the living room and watch movies or play card games. All of that time was exclusively theirs; if they stayed in, Rio would busy herself with errands or tuck away in the bedroom. If they went out, Rio would grocery shop and tend to things around the house. The majority of the day was focused solely on Agatha and Dani spending quality time together. Sundays were family days, the days they all spent together, but Satudays had been a treasure until the time Dani had moved out.</p><p>That Saturday, the two of them standing in their kitchen, it was still a treasure. Not necessarily the day itself. No, that had never really been the treasure.</p><p>The important thing had become remembering what was, even in the face of more time and more uncertainty.</p><p>Dani was the true treasure. </p><p>Dani had helped carry them through a life that might have otherwise been empty. She had given them that sense of responsibility back, had made sure that they knew they were destined to be parents. Dani had been the light in what had seemed like an endless dark and as such, Agatha knew that she would <em>never</em> to be able to tell Dani verbally just how much she truly was loved by the both of them.</p><p>Agatha's lips twisted for a moment as she considered a thought before she spoke. "Can I ask you something?" she posted gently as her eyes landed into ones that were nearly an identical reflection of her own.</p><p>Dani crossed over to where she was, leaning her hip against the counter as she looked at Agatha straight-on. "Ask away, momma."</p><p>A soft sigh passed through Agatha's nose, her gaze darting over Dani's features as she tried to establish some nerve. "Are you okay?" she questioned quietly, though she was quick to add on. "And don't lie to me. I know when you're lying. Just... Tell me the truth."</p><p>Dani's expression softened and that look in her eyes was gentle, vulnerable almost. She set her soda can on the counter and laid her hand overtop Agatha's, not breaking her focus on Agatha as she did so.</p><p>"Momma, listen," Dani voiced, giving her hand a light squeeze. "I want to tell you first and foremost that I am okay. So do not waste even a second of your time or an ounce of your energy on trying to cater to me and make me feel like I'm not being forgotten. I am a grown woman and I fully understand the gravity of what it happening, and what it means to both of you."</p><p>She paused, finally tearing her eyes away to glance down at their hands before she let go and stepped forward, wrapping her arms around Agatha's waist, hugging her tightly. There was zero hesitation from Agatha as she returned the hug, but Dani had not been done offering her unofficial therapy sesson.</p><p>"I can't promise that it's going to be okay. But... I <em>can</em> promise that we're going to get through it, whatever happens. Because that's what we do. We soldier forward and never stop. So, whatever you need... Just ask me. I'm here for a week at least. Finals are mid-May so, if needed I'm sure I can figure something out." She took a breath and Agatha could feel her hold constrict a little more. "I know this is hard. I know it hurts. But we have each other."</p><p>In that moment, her face buried in her daughter's hair, Agatha knew something for absolute certain:</p><p>There was nothing of greater value in all of existence than the love the three of them had for one another, and everything else be damned, it was going to carry them through.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>
<u>Nikolai.</u>
</b>
</p><p>It had been three days.</p><p>Every single second of every minute that it had taken Nik and Gabi to leave the police station and get him home and in bed, they blurred together in a smattering of city lights and Gabi's soft voice as she surely tried to offer gentle affirmation and displays of her love, but he hadn't been listening. He could <em>hear</em> her, he simply hadn't been able to understand her. Maybe that was significant solely because he suddenly felt like she didn't understand <em>him, </em>at all.</p><p>The evidence for such a hypothesis lay in the fact that he did not know himself. If that fact held true, how could anyone else? He had been presenting this genuine image of who he thought he was. He had been a gentle boy, feeling estranged and isolated very frequently due to the way he was constantly moved around. He had been a dedicated and driven teenager, playing baseball and football on opposing seasons. He had been a smart student, a good friend when he could make them. </p><p>Even as an adult, Nik had struggled, but he had still found his way. He had spent his senior year of high school and the beginning of his freshman year at NYU sleeping with anyone who would pay him attention. He would wake up tangled in some man he'd met after too much to drink, or a woman that had apparently come home with him after a night out. And then, he'd gotten closer to Gabi and everything changed.</p><p>He had told everyone that he was an only child with just his mother. He had spent so long dodging the 'other parent' questions because he had never had any answers to provide. His mother -- No, Wanda -- had deprived him of those answers. Now, he knew why.</p><p>In three days, he had consumed chicken broth and crackers two times and had otherwise asked to be left alone. A couple of sips of water occasionally passed through his lips when his mouth was unbearably dry, both otherwise he simply laid in bed oscillating between crying and trying to string together nonsensical pieces that would never fit together.</p><p>In any other circumstance, he would have been worried about Gabi's feelings before his own, but his entire world had been shattered and he cared for nothing other than trying to sleep as much as possible to prevent the tearing ache from sinking him to an unreachable depth. She would hold him, but he would not move. She would tell him she loved him, time and time again, but he never spoke.</p><p>Not until evening time on the third day. He had somehow dragged himself from the safety of their comforter and had showered, propping himself up in bed once he was done.</p><p>The shower had given him time to think.</p><p>Everything Alisa -- Wanda -- had done had been fake, a construction of what she wanted him to see. </p><p>So what was it that she had been trying to keep him from?</p><p>Nik leaned over the edge of the bed and picked up his laptop, opening it as Gabi appeared in the doorway. His eyes flickered to her for just a moment and he could see that hope there in her soft smile, a small joy that he was at least moving around enough to have showered and be sitting up in bed.</p><p>"Can I make you some cheese toast?" she asked him from he place directly over the threshold. "You need to eat something with at least a little protein."</p><p>As he finished typing in his password, his head lifted and his gaze found her again.</p><p>Nik knew she was trying to help. He knew that she loved him and only wanted to make this easier and while he still did not feel as though he could stomach much, he gave a gentle nod. He didn't want it, but that wasn't the question she asked. She asked if she <em>could</em>. And yes, she could. He just couldn't guarantee that he would actually eat it.</p><p>"Thank you," she said softly. She started to depart, but she stopped and cast her gaze upon him again. "I love you, Nik."</p><p>A tight smile found him as a reaction, but he tempered it to be softer as he spoke. "I love you too, Gabi."</p><p>The moment she was gone, his focus was back on the laptop. He knew what he was looking for. He knew their names, knew where they lived. Without reserves, he began to type.</p><p>There were several old news articles, photos of them at press conferences and during interviews. There were also videos, but he could not even fathom the idea of  opening a single one. He wasn't ready to hear their voices, or see them in motion. In the text, he had found another name.</p><p>Danica Harkness-Vidal.</p><p>That was his next search inquiry. The results that appeared were varied, extending from accomlishments with orchestras or events were she had performed to her social media. He glanced through a couple of the articles, but they weren't inclusive of photos. What he had learned was that at twenty-one years old, she was already and accomplished musician and she had yet to even graduate Julliard. She played the violin and had traveled quite a bit to display her talent.</p><p>Without putting a face to the accomplishments, he doubled back and headed for the safest bet: Instagram.</p><p>Immediately, he felt like he had been struck by lightning. They didn't look identical, but he could instantly locate a few features in her that he could see so clearly when he looked at his own reflection. She had a bright smile, a sweet disposition, and the brightest blue eyes Nik was certain he had ever seen in his life.</p><p>So he scrolled. He saw photos of her at bars he had been to, walking through alleys he had passed too many times to count. He saw photos of her with her parents -- <em>hers, not theirs </em>-- and the light they held in their faces when they looked at her. They looked like a picture-perfect family, a complete family.</p><p>They looked like a family where he would never belong.</p><p>Despite the sudden overwhelming tidal wave of alienation that felt like it was going to drown him, somehow, Nikolai found the will to keep scrolling. Judging by other photos, he had reached winter of that year, earlier on. There were photos of snow, and of her ice skating. And then, there was a different kind of photo.</p><p>It was a photo of Danica with a cupcake. </p><p>Nik wasn't sure what drove him to do it, but he clicked on the thumbnail and opened the photo. It was bigger now, her holding it in the palm of her head as she beheld it like it were special, like it was something more than just a celebration for her.</p><p>When he read the caption below it, he understood why. And, quite frankly, it made him want to puke.</p><p>             <em>For the last 19 years, you've always gotten a cupcake. Even when I'm not at home, I still pick one up and video call the moms so we can wish you another good year. </em></p><p>
<em>            Happy birthday, Nicky. May this new year bring you all you need.</em>
</p><p>He hadn't even finished reading it and his eyes had already started to fill with hot and emotionally distraught tears. They fell even harder when he realized she had posted nine other photos from the last nine years. He had tried to look, as if he felt he deserved to be punished, but the moment he came across the first one of the three of them together, something came over him that he did not know how to explain. </p><p>Both hands launched for the top of the laptop screen, slamming it down in his panic. Without a thought, he lifted the laptop in one hand and with a fervored might, he flung it like a frisbee across the room. It hit the wall next to the door, leaving a massive dent in the drywall, before it hit the ground and broke into several pieces.</p><p>Even before he buried his face in his hands, Nik was nowhere near ready to have the conversation he knew Gabi was going to want to have at the sound of such a disturbance.</p><p>"Baby?" came her worried call as she surged into the room.</p><p>Nik was already in the process of rolling to his side and pulling the comforter up over his shoulders.</p><p>"I just want to go back to sleep."</p><p>She might have offered opposition, but as he was getting so good at doing, he tuned her out and closed his eyes, wanting nothing more than to forget what he had seen.</p><p>Trying to sleep while realizing that he had a little sister who had been celebrating his birthday for almost her entire life felt like it might actually prove to be pointless.</p><p>It took him little time to realize that he was right.</p><p> </p>

<b> <u>Gabi Mendoza.</u> </b>
</p><p>When Gabi had been a little girl, she'd had a fixation on princess movies and in them, there was the typical guard walls trope.  It wasn't until she had gotten older that she realized it was a metaphor, and how it could be applied to certain people.</p><p>Since they had started dating halfway through freshman year at NYU, Nikolai had made her feel like a princess. It had taken them some time to reach that point; by the time he had broken up with his boyfriend, she had still been in a relationship. When the woman moved across the country, it felt a little serendipitous in the sense that it felt like life had intentionally given them gentle nudges toward one another.</p><p>Embracing them had been the best thing she had ever done. She had fallen in love with him easily, if not a little recklessly, and they had fallen into an complex but meaningful love, something Gabi had never really had a chance to experience before. She had still been young, sure, but what Nik made her feel? She wasn't sure if another person was capable of such a feat, even all this time later.</p><p>Nik was special.</p><p>Right then, as she stood in the doorway and watched him curl into himself for what felt like the hundredth time in the last three days, Gabi had no idea how she could convince him of such a truth. He had extricated her, placing the princess on the outside of those guard walls. They were high and impenetrable, meant to shut himself inside.</p><p>She had no scope, here. Because of that, she was floundering in trying to figure out what it was she could do to help him. He was detaching, pulling away. He was retreating into himself because he had nowhere else to go. Every choice he had made had been unknowingly dictated by an incident that had occurred at the very beginning of his life. She knew that left him wondering who he could have been if it had never happened.</p><p>Would he have stayed in one place? Would he have actually had friends for longer than eight or nine months before he was leaving again? </p><p>There was something else that Gabi was all too aware he had to be feeling. </p><p>She had done her own research in the hours he slept and if he came to the realization that he had a little sister that was not too much younger than the two of them were, she knew it was going to crush him.</p><p>Nik had told her on more than one occasion that he had always wanted a sibling. He didn't care if it would have been a brother or a sister, but he had always just... wanted someone he didn't have to leave behind. Gabi understood it. He also was going to shatter the first time he saw what his sister looked like, judging by her own unhindered reaction when she had found the girl on Facebook.</p><p>What she did not realize was that the time had come and the evidence lie in the broken pieces of the laptop on the floor and the massive dent in the wall above it, but she had no context to be absolute certain of that. Whatever it had been, it was enough to pull him back under, leaving the plate of half-assembled cheese toast abandoned on the counter.</p><p>She wanted to crawl into bed with him, to get in behind him and just wrap him up in her arms and whisper to him that she loved him until she didn't have a voice left to do so. The first two times she had tried, he had almost been angry. It seemed like he didn't want her to touch him, did want to accept her comfort and it was difficult to not take it personally, even with everything going on.</p><p>This was an impossible situation; it felt like the options were limited and nothing she chose was ever going to be the right thing. The only thing she wanted in all of it was to love him through it. She could ease his strain if he would just choose to buckle a little and let her in. All he had to do was drop those walls long enough for her to step in and he could throw them right back up.</p><p>As much as she had wished it would happen, she had known it wouldn't.</p><p>The next eight days were nearly unbearable. Nik was emotional, aggravated. He seemed to find fault in everything she did, even when she was just trying to help him. He became snappier and a little more stern with his word choices. </p><p>Gabi knew what he was doing.</p><p>He was trying to push her away. He was trying to provide her with a list of reasons why she needed to run for the hills and avoid the mess his life was becoming. </p><p>She was not going to let that happen. She loved him too much for that and she was not going to give in to such behavior. It was warranted, to an extent, and she was going to continue to give him time, but she wouldn't have been able to say honestly that she hadn't started to hurt, too, and more than just it being on his behalf.</p><p>There was a sense of understanding, an intelligible comprehension that his world was almost completely collapsing around him. She wasn't, though. Gabi was fighting through this hellacious storm to stay steady and present for him, even if everything he was doing was telling her he didn't want it. </p><p>Not even being able to touch him without upsetting him was crushing, a new kind of pain that Gabi had never experienced in the confines of their relationship. They had been together far too long and loved each other way too much to be reduced to this and it was killing her. </p><p>Nevertheless, Gabi's persistence did not waver in the slightest, even if Nik's irritation didn't either. She had stopped trying to coax him into any kind of conversation and had instead opted to make him a bowl of soup or a grilled cheese sandwich that she would leave on his nightstand. When she would return a couple of hours later, there were at least a couple of bites missing. She'd refill his glass, replace it where it belonged and then spend about ten seconds fighting her urge to lean over and kiss his temple or cheek.</p><p>Nik had been explicit in his requests to be left alone and so, she had listened.</p><p>For an entire week after the laptop incident, she listened. </p><p>It was the hardest feat to accomplish; she was living in that apartment like she was the only one there. She came and went as she needed for work and to do things like grocery shop. She declined texts asking her to come out, unable to explain the situation and not ready to leave him longer than she had to.</p><p>There had been only a couple of instances when Gabi had been almost concerned enough to make a phone call, to have him admitted into a hospital. She knew if she chose that route, he would likely never forgive her. Realistically, he needed the help, but she wondered if isolating him from herself would be the right move, even if he had done a pretty good job of doing it himself.</p><p>For a week, Gabi fell asleep on the couch with some Netflix show playing in the background. She would wake up in the middle of the night and not rest until she at least checked on him and made sure he was drinking some of the water that was being left.</p><p>On two of those seven nights, she did not accomplish such a mission. She would get up and hear the sounds of his sobs faintly as they carried down the hall and stop, silent. Gabi knew what he felt and what it was he had asked of her, but she knew on those nights that if she made it into the bedroom, it was going to be next to impossible for her to not crawl into bed with him and completely drown him in her embrace.</p><p>By the time they were tiptoeing closer to two weeks of his endless moping and isolation, Gabi was at her wits' end. She had to do <em>something</em> because so far, nothing else was working. As much as she wanted to claim that it had everything to do with his misery, it was more than that.</p><p>She felt absolutely fucking useless.</p><p>Gabi was his girlfriend, his partner in crime, his whole world for the last seven years. There was not a single thing in the world that she would not have done to make his life easier. She would have traveled to the farthest reaches of the planet if it meant finding a way to ease his broken heart. </p><p>The fact that he was not letting her was driving her to the brink of madness. She loved him, more than she had ever known was humanly possible, and so... Gabi pulled out her tablet and began an avalanche of morally ambiguous decisions. </p><p>First, she dug right back into the news articles and interviews that had been uploaded in terrible quality from when everything had first happened. The photos from the newspapers seemed a little clearer than the images on the videos, but she found exactly what she needed 20 minutes in.</p><p>One of the interviews she had watched had stated that the family lived in North Ironbound. In one of the paper scans, she could see the house number '8805' lined vertically down a front white post.</p><p>Next, she searched for houses in North Ironbound with such a house number. There were two.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Wait! Street view!</p><p>She tapped a couple more times, bringing up the view for the first one, her breath catching the moment it displayed across the screen. That was it. It was that one.</p><p>8805 Townstall Drive.</p><p>Something took over her; she tapped on the arrow that displayed the exact time and route that would take them directly to his parents. </p><p>
<em>It was forty-five fucking minutes away. </em>
</p><p>
<em>They were so fucking close.</em>
</p><p>The only reason Gabi realized she had started to cry was because it had suddenly become impossible to see her screen with the blurriness that came with the tears. He was so fucking close to a family that had likely been waiting his entire fucking life to know he was okay. </p><p>And he wanted nothing to do with it.</p><p>All he wanted to do was lay in bed and avoid the world at large, her included. Some part of her understood that it wasn't personal and yet, it wounded her with vigor all the same.</p><p>Something had to change. There had to be some kind of give <em>somewhere.</em></p><p>Gabi realized, after another forty minutes of watching the interviews again, that she herself was going to have to be the give.</p><p>After pulling down a notebook and grabbing a pen, she perched at the dining room table and stared down at the blank page. She knew that she could have been writing to both of them, but there had been something that pulled her attention more one way than the other.</p><p>Of his parents, Agatha had clearly been the one leading the charge. Every single time she was on camera, her shoulders were square and she held her chin high. She was defiant and demanding of his return, declaring that there would be rewards for those who helped and condemnation for the perpetrator. </p><p>And then, there was Rio.</p><p>She looked just as determined and just as hopeful, but there was a softness to her that her wife did not care to utilize. Where Agatha used force, Rio used emotion. She would look out to whatever small crowd was before them, her eyes hollow as they searched for a familiar face, one she never found. She would glance at the camera and manage the tightest, most painful smile as if she needed the world to understand what it was she was feeling. She held silent conversations with everyone present as well as everyone that took the time to watch. Rio ached to have her son back, all those years ago, and something about that struck Gabi.</p><p>With a few more moments of contemplation, Gabi got to her feet and peered into the bedroom, not at all surprised to find Nik buried under the covers. She couldn't see if he was actually awake, but she supposed whether or not he was happened to be neither here nor there. He still didn't want to speak to her, or at all, and so Gabi made her way right back to the dining room table.</p><p>And then, she began to write.</p><p>            <em>Dear Rio,</em></p><p>
<em>            I know that the last thing you're expecting on a random afternoon is to be opening an actual hand-written letter, but I was not certain what other avenue would be appropriate to reach out, given the circumstances. And... Who writes letters anymore anyway? Well, for the first time in years, I guess I do.</em>
</p><p>
<em>           I'm sorry. I have forgotten my manners. My name is Gabriela Mendoza. I have been dating Nikolai Malikov -- or, as we have recently found out, your son Nicholas -- for almost seven years. We met at NYU and have lived very full lives since then. </em>
</p><p>
<em>         I am writing this letter to you knowing that I shouldn't. I know that if he were to finally get out of bed for the first time in nearly two weeks and see this, he might be very upset with me, but I am just so... lost, I guess is the right word. We have been through some trials throughout the duration of our relationship, things that don't need great detail, and yet I have <u>never</u> witnessed this side of him.</em>
</p><p>
<em>         In my deepest of dreams, he will simply wake up one morning and just know that he wants to change what he's been doing and find a way forward. In this world, in our reality, I do not even know that I can pinpoint when he will even shower next, let alone when he may brave to speak more than a handful of words.</em>
</p><p>
<em>        I understand he is suffering. I understand that his entire identity has been taken from him, but I also know that the further he slips from me, the more I worry he may never come back. And I also have thought a lot about that. And how it relates to you and your family. Your wife, your daughter. His mother, his sister. </em>
</p><p>
<em>       I shouldn't be offering this because I have never kept secrets from him the entire time we have been together, but I'm going to leave my number below. If you think that you might be willing to meet up for coffee sometime, please shoot me a text message and we will figure something out. I know that he isn't ready to know you, but that should not prolong your ability to at least have some idea of the incredible man he is. </em>
</p><p>
<em>      If you're comfortable, please do reach out and we can set something up. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Sincerely,<br/>Gabi Mendoza<br/>973-899-1384</em>
</p><p>Gabi read over the letter, realizing that she should probably scrap it and start over, but it said exactly what she needed it to say, even if there was a little bit of rambling thrown in the mix. She was trying to convey just what it was that she was watching while not alarming the other woman if she could avoid it. </p><p>It was likely as good as it was going to get and so, she folded it up, shoved it into an envelope and licked the seal, pressing it shut. Despite her still-shaking hand, she scrawled a neat 'Mrs. Rio Harkness-Vidal' and printed the address below it clearly. For a moment, her dark gaze flickered to the corner of the envelope and her lower lip tucked between her teeth, the enamel sinking roughly into the pad of flesh.</p><p>Ultimately, she decided that writing a return address was a terrible idea. In the event that he ended up pissed off at her for having reached out to people he was not ready to accept as part of him and his life, he would have been downright furious if she had so carelessly forked their address over to them without even speaking to him about it first.</p><p>After pressing on a stamp, Gabi had paced her way to their bedroom doorway, her voice soft as she called to him despite not knowing if he was even awake.</p><p>"I'm running to the bodega. I'll be back soon. I love you."</p><p>He didn't say it back. It made her hope beyond anything that it was because he was asleep.</p><p>To make her lie into a half-truth, Gabi <em>had </em>stopped at the bodega first and picked up a bag of chips and a pint of ice cream for herself and a bottle of Sprite for Nik. He might not touch it, but she figured it would be a nice change of pace from water. On second thought, she scooped up a packet of fruit snacks that tasted like Arizona beverages. Again, he might not touch them, but if he could put even a few on his stomach, he would be better off.</p><p>After the quick stop, she ventured to the post office and stood in front of the express mail receptacle, staring at it long and hard. Once she dropped the letter inside, that was it. There was no going back once she lifted the steel flap and let it fall amongst the other mail and postage.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Gabi pulled down the handle and slid the envelope inside, shutting it with a loud SNAP of metal on metal.</p><p>With that, Gabi climbed back into her car and drove home to another night where she would fall asleep alone on her couch.</p><p>It would be another night that the man she loved lay still in his misery, unwilling to let her in.</p><p>Maybe the letter would work, maybe it wouldn't.</p><p>At least when she fell asleep that night, Gabi could lay claim to the fact that she had done <em>something, </em>at bare minimum.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b> <u>Rio.</u> </b>
</p><p>Although Agatha had made the decision to return to work, claiming that she needed to focus her attention elsewhere, Dani was still posted up in the office on the second story for several hours a day, tending to her lectures and prepping for her final exams. It had been two weeks to the day since they had found out about Nicky's very close yet very distant existence.</p><p>Rio knew the truth, though.</p><p>She knew it was killing Agatha to sit around the house and just hope that one of their phones would ring. Rio knew that when Agatha was home and unoccupied, her mind spun circles about the things they could not have, and it was tearing her apart.</p><p>Agatha had always found comfort in her career and if it could offer her some sort of solace in a time when they all felt as though they were talking on pins and needles, then Rio thought she should take it.</p><p>Rio also realized that Agatha's returning to work had been the likely catalyst for Dani's decision to stay longer. </p><p>There were two people in the world that Rio knew like the back of her hand, and one of them was Dani. In turn, Dani knew her just as well. Rio never would have admitted it, but the thought of being alone when Agatha was at work and Dani had gone to finish out the year at school was damn near debilitating. </p><p>Keeping busy had been easier when she had distractions in the form of her loved ones. Managing to find a place to put her mind that did not sink deeper and deeper into the pits of just wishing Nicky would call had been difficult, but when Dani wanted to play Wii Bowling, or when Agatha was spending money on things they didn't need, it happened with a little less resistance from her subconscious. </p><p>It was nice sometimes just to hear Dani's voice down the hall when she was answering questions or asking them. It was nice when she would come downstairs for lunch and they would whip something up together and eat on the back patio to enjoy the weather. It was even nice when Dani would whip into the room, frantic about something in relation to school until they talked it out and Rio helped her form a plan.</p><p>Midday on a Friday, Rio found herself baking a batch of cookies to keep her mind centered on a task and not the length of time that had passed since their lives had irrevocably changed for the second time. When she heard the mail flap rattle and the soft <em>woosh</em> as a couple of envelopes dropped through and hit the ground.</p><p>It was not of utter importance; they were not expecting anything of significance and so, Rio kept her attention on the bowl of dough she was mixing. In fact, she had been in the middle of popping the sheet pan into the oven when Dani came down the stairs. Before she ventured toward the kitchen, she must have caught sight of the mail and went to collect it, flipping through it as she paced to meet Rio where she was closing the oven door.</p><p>"Bills, bills, bi -- Wait. What's this?" Dani questioned, picking up the envelope that had caught her attention. She stared at it for a moment before she flipped it around in her grasp, showing it to Rio.</p><p>In a very tidy script, it was her name, hand-written as 'Mrs. Rio Harkness-Vidal.'</p><p>Also obvious was the fact that there was no return address. </p><p>Something dangerous in Rio's stomach began to twist and clench. It made no sense. She didn't know what that letter was and she didn't know who such handwriting belonged to, but something in her felt the dread regardless.</p><p>Her lips pressed as she gingerly plucked it from Dani's hold, bringing it closer for inspection. It didn't give her anything else, and she was sure she would find nothing until she opened it and revealed the contents.</p><p>"Mom?" Dani questioned softly.</p><p>At the sound of her voice, Rio realized she had been holding her breath for some reason she didn't understand. She exhaled and lifted her gaze to Dani first and then the timer on the oven; she had eleven minutes until the cookies would be done. </p><p>Rio did not speak as she carried herself to the dining room table and sat, flipping the envelope over in her hands. With a steadying intake of a large breath, she ripped open the envelope and removed the piece of paper that had been cradled inside. </p><p>When she unfolded it, Rio was not sure what she was expecting to find written on it. As she started to read, she was still confused throughout the first paragraph. And then came the second.</p><p>One of Rio's hands launched away from the paper, fingertips grazing the skin of her face as her hand raised to her mouth in nothing but pure shock.</p><p>"Mom? Mom, what is it?" Dani questioned, having taken the seat at the end of the table next to her. It kept her from being able to see what Rio was reading.</p><p>Rio did not answer. Instead, she kept reading. The tears had started and she was worried that at this rate, they were never going to stop. She kept trying to read, kept wiping them away so that could see clearer.</p><p>Dani, a foot away from her, was about to completely short-circuit. She was impossibly worried and concern had etched itself into every inch of her beautiful features. She wanted to keep pressing, clearly, but she had likely deduced that Rio was not going to immediately provide any kind of a response. She just kept reading.</p><p>As she got closer to the end, a choked and stifled sob escaped Rio, filtering out from between her fingers as her hand remained close to her mouth.</p><p>The secrecy landed somewhere uncomfortable in Rio's stomach, but there was something larger that was overshadowing it. What was bigger was the fact that this woman had been in a serious relationship with Nicky for seven long years and she had made it very clear that secrets were not a currency they chose to use. For her to be going behind his back to send that letter, it didn't show that she disrespect him and his wishes. It showed how much she loved him and how she wanted to find action in the throes of eviscerating inaction.</p><p>What Rio saw in that letter, and the two little spots at the bottom that had since dried, was a woman who was lost, who knew no answer to how to help the person she loved. What Rio saw in those words was a cry for help, and it hit her directly in the chest like a brass-knuckled punch, cracking ribs that poked and prodded her heart and lungs. </p><p>When Dani spoke again, the only reason she garnered Rio's attention was because she touched her, fastening a palm over her arm. "Mom? Hey, look at me please?"</p><p>Rio's jaw swelled as it clenched and she raised her hand from her mouth to wipe at her soaked cheeks, covered in every bit of emotion that had spilled from her at the weight of what she was holding. After a moment of trying to collect herself, her eyes lifted and finally met Dani's, her lips twisting in her hurt and anguish.</p><p>"What is that?" her daughter asked calmly, her thumb brushing over Rio's arm in comfort.</p><p>"It's..." Rio attempted, but it could hardly be called a noise, let alone an entire word. She sniffled and drew in a full, long breath as she searched for any ability to be somewhat articulate in the face of such heavy and weighted emotions. "It's from... From Nicky -- Nikolai's girlfriend, the... The girl from the photos, I'm guessing..." she finally managed to stammer, her voice crackling and breaking despite her best efforts.</p><p>"Wait... She wrote you a letter? Not... Not him?" Dani asked back, her brow knitting as a sign of her confusion. Rio could hear that tiny little tremble in her words, the way she was as disbelieving as Rio had been when she understood what it was that she was reading.</p><p>"It sounds like..." Rio's gaze dropped to the letter and then lifted again, an uncertainty washing through those dark irises as she considered. "It doesn't sound like he's okay. He... Is struggling and she... She wants to meet with me..."</p><p>Rio had paused, but Dani chomped at the bit of silence she had been offered so that she could interject.</p><p>"Mom! She wants to meet you?!" </p><p>The excitement in Dani's voice was almost soul shattering. She hadn't read the entire letter the way Rio had and she didn't know that this wasn't happy, it wasn't exciting. This seemed to be something that had been done out of necessity. Someone in his world recognized that while he was hurting, he was not the only one.</p><p>Rio realized that it didn't just apply to her, or just to Agatha and Dani. Clearly, Gabi was hurting, too. It was why she had made a very big and very brave decision to extend some kind of olive branch to a family who had spent so long knowing absolutely nothing. It was why she was willing to go behind her boyfriend's back because she was not certain that he would ever recover and if he didn't, the people missing him didn't deserve to be shut into the dark for the remainder of their lives.</p><p>For as much as Gabi saw their pain, Rio could see Gabi's, too.</p><p>Maybe she didn't have anyone she could talk to about the situation.  Maybe she was isolated in her knowledge and clearly, it didn't seem as though they had an open line of communication about his thoughts and feelings. Whatever it was she was feeling, it had pushed her to the point of reaching out. Maybe Rio should have been a bit more concerned over the fact that the woman had obtained her address, but with what had been poured onto that paper? She never could have been upset or even felt a drop of worry. The fact that she had sent a letter via snail mail was a very blatant display of that.</p><p>"I..." Once more, Rio's dark eyes fell to the paper that was now wrinkled from her grip on the left side. "I don't... Know what to do."</p><p>Dani could see it, the way Rio was beginning to panic. She could see every single thought, all one thousand and eight of them, as they whipped through her head and across her dark eyes.</p><p>"Mom, look at me," she commanded quietly, giving Rio's arm a firm squeeze. "It's okay. What we're going to do right now is we're going to fold it up and put it back in the envelopes. Then, when momma comes home, you're going to get it out and the two of you are going to talk about it." She sounded so fucking calm and Rio simply couldn't understand. Instead, she chose to pull from that serenity, trying to absorb as much of it as she could possibly manage. </p><p>"But I --"</p><p>Another squeeze, another silent request for attention the moment Rio had started to lose her focus. Very carefully, Dani raised her other hand and pinched the paper between her fingers, lightly tugging it in an attempt to get Rio to release her hold.</p><p>"It's going to hurt you more than it's going to help you to read it over and over again until momma gets home. We need to put it away until there's an availability for both of you to handle it how you see fit."</p><p>Rio was over fifty years old and yet, right then, her barely alcohol-legal daughter was somehow stitching her together enough to keep her whole. She was supplying logic and pointing out the obvious things Rio could not see. Dani had a clearer perspective; her hopes were of course to meet her brother, but not having done so, she could be unequivocally objective.</p><p>Watching helplessly as Dani folded the paper back up without intruding on its contents by reading it, Rio felt a despair that almost seemed surreal. How could it hurt this bad to know that answers could be <em>right there</em>, but there were heavy considerations that needed to be taken? How could it be this fucking painful to know that if she said no, it was very possible they might not get them any other way?</p><p>Tucking it back into the envelope, Dani laid it down on the table and pushed it away from the both of them. She turned her attention back to Rio, picking up her hand to give it a tight squeeze of comfort.</p><p>"I have another class, but when I'm done, I'm going to run to the market and pick up some things to make enchiladas. Can I take the car so I don't have to pay for an Uber?" Dani was keeping her engaged intentionally, asking question that required Rio to think about anything other than that letter, currently burning a hold in their dining room table.</p><p>Rio tore her eyes away from it, landing into Dani's sweet blues. "Y-Yeah, of course. You know where the keys are. I think... It's probably best if I lay down for --"</p><p>Committed to the idea of trying to rest when she was absolutely buzzing, the way the timer rang shrill and loud to indicate that the cookies were finished sank a pit of disappointment to the bottom of her stomach. Before she could push to her feet to tend to the still screaming timer and the cookies in the oven, Dani stood and kissed the side of her head, departing to do it for her.</p><p>"Go lay down, mom," she offered from her place in front of the oven, turning her head over her shoulder a beat to ensure that Rio had heard her.</p><p>Rio did not nod, did not verbally agree, but she did stand and make her way toward her daughter. The moment the pan was out of Dani's hands and Rio was free to do so, she pulled her little girl into a strong hug, grappling her tightly with a forlorn sense of guilt that somehow, she was letting Dani down.</p><p>"Do you know that momma and I sometimes talk about how we do not know what on earth we did to deserve you?" Rio murmured at her, clinging a little tighter.</p><p>"I can tell you, if you'd like," Dani whispered back, her arms wrapping a little more around her mom. She did not give Rio the time to decline the offer before she started anyway. "You have always loved me, probably before I was even born. You have always taken care of me and have always given me what I have needed. You have always encouraged me to chase my passions and my talents. You have taught me countless lessons in what it means to be a good person and to make choices with the knowledge that sometimes I'm not always the only one effected."</p><p>Rio could feel that welling of emotion rise, threatening to spill the longer Dani went on, but Rio couldn't bring herself to cut her off.</p><p>"You have looked me in the eyes when I broke off an engagement that I had no business agreeing to in the first place and you told me it was okay, even when it didn't feel that way. You have <em>always</em> been there for me, both of you, and that's what you've done to deserve me. I am who I am because you and momma raised me and helped me to become this person. So..." Dani hesitated, her eyes flicking unwillingly to the dining room table before they landed back on Rio. "When you start feeling as though any of this is your fault, please remember that you've loved us both every day of our lives, and you have <em>always</em> done what you could to protect us. Both of us." </p><p>She pulled away and Rio could feel the tears falling before Dani even reached up to cup her cheeks in both palms.</p><p>"This is a baby step. It's one you and momma get to decide how to take. But... We're not completely stalling anymore," Dani offered. Her thumbs were so gentle and tender as she brushed at Rio's cheeks lovingly.</p><p>"You're right," Rio agreed in a sniffle. She took an even and deep breath, letting it go just as slowly. "I'm going to go lay down. But wake me up when you come home from the store please?"</p><p>"How about I wake you when dinner's done? Or momma might get to it first depending on when she gets home," Dani bartered. It was her underhanded way of urging Rio to take a little more time for herself, even if she wouldn't state it outright.</p><p>Rio found herself lost in those eyes, so moved by just how solid Dani was being in the face of nothing but pure chaos. As Dani let her go, Rio took her own turn to cup Dani's cheek in her palm, tilting her head a little in her reverence.</p><p>"I love you, Boog. Me and momma both."</p><p>Dani knew it, but seeing the look on her face at hearing Rio reiterate it <em>finally</em> stoked the smallest flame in Rio's chest.</p><p>"I love you too, now get some rest."</p><p>"Aye aye, Doctor Dani."</p><p>Dani didn't speak again, but the way she rolled her eyes and gave Rio a light push seemed to say enough, and Rio disappeared up the stairs to try and find some stillness in sleep.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b> <u>Agatha.</u> </b>
</p><p>As Agatha walked through the front door to their home, she should have been drained. She should have been upset that she was almost a half an hour late because her last surgery had run over due to unexpected complications. She should have been frazzled, but the only thing she could find purchase in was the anxiety that had overwhelmed her at the text she'd gotten from Dani when she'd finally been able to check her phone.</p><p><b>Boog: </b>I'm at the store. Is there<br/>anything you need me to pick<br/>up? Mom's sleeping, but make<br/>sure you wait for me to come<br/>home before you wake her up.<br/>There's something I need to<br/>tell you.</p><p>Agatha's lips had twisted and pressed, so firm and tight that she was almost chewing on the insides of them. Sitting in her car after such a shift had given her only a moment of respite before she was winding her way home, able to feel every single pulse point in her body as they pounded with her anxiety and cluelessness.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>I'm heading home now. My<br/>last surgery ran over. Are you <br/>home now?</p><p><b>Boog: </b>Yeah. Starting dinner.<br/>See you when you get here. I<br/>love you, momma.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>I love you too, boog. See <br/>you soon.</p><p>Agatha slipped her phone into its holder and headed home, walking in that door a short while later to a plethora of delicious smells as they filled the house.</p><p>After shedding anything she did not need -- including her scrub top that left her in a tight white tank top -- Agatha made her way into the kitchen. The first thing she saw was Dani hard at work at the stove, though it looked like she had just gotten into the thick of it.</p><p>"Hi my little chef," Agatha crooned, stepping up behind Dani to place a hand on her back and a kiss to the side of her head.</p><p>"Hi, momma," she greeted, turning to toss a light smile Agatha's way.</p><p>"Is mom okay?" Agatha questioned softly, her palm rubbing mindlessly at Dani's back.</p><p>"She will be. But..." Dani set down the tongs that she had been using to tend to the chicken before she looked up at Agatha, her gaze vulnerable. "She received a letter today. A letter from... From Nicky's -- Nikolai's -- Whatever we're calling him until we know for sure, but it was from his girlfriend..."</p><p>Agatha felt like someone had launched a spear of ice directly through her chest.</p><p>Rio had gotten a letter? A hand-written letter? From their son's girlfriend? She was trying to answer those questions with the information she had just been provided, but it didn't seem like it could be a possibility in any reality.</p><p>"You... What did it say?" Agatha stumbled, her eyes wide as she stared her daughter down, assuming she had all of the answers.</p><p>"I don't know, I didn't read it," Dani admitted. </p><p>Something about the admission caused Agatha's brows to pinch above the bridge of her nose. She could have. Dani could have read it if she had wanted to, but she still had made the decision not to. Agatha didn't <em>need</em> to know why, but she couldn't stop herself from asking.</p><p>"Why not?" </p><p>"Because, momma, I saw what it did to mom and I realized that it's something you both should see and discuss first. If you want to show it to me after that discussion is over, I'm okay with that. But... You guys need to talk about it first." Her voice was so steady, even as she turned back to the task of tending to dinner.</p><p>"You're an insane kid, you know that right?" Agatha asked her, leaning in to place another loving kiss to the side of Dani's head.</p><p>"Yeah, I get it pretty honestly," she shot back, managing a smile that touched her eyes as she glanced to her mother. "But she's been sleeping a while. If you go now, dinner will be ready when you're finished."</p><p>Agatha knew she was right, and she had every intention of listening, but there was something she had to say first.</p><p>"There's not a day that goes by where momma and I don't realize how lucky we are to have you. I hope you know that." </p><p>In a reaction that surprised Agatha, Dani laughed. Agatha's eyebrows shot up, stunned by the sound and her eyes were curious, wondering. She didn't have to wonder too long; Dani answered with a grin.</p><p>"Mom and I had a very similar conversation before she went to rest. So... It's just funny how you two have a hive mind after all this time." Dani had diverted her attention back to the skillet in front of her, but the only thing she was missing was the utter adoration and affection that was broadcasting from Agatha's expression.</p><p>Agatha stepped away and pulled a bottle of water from the refrigerator before glancing back at Dani, softening at the sight of her cooking away in front of the stove.</p><p>"I love you, booger butt," Agatha called, heading upstairs to wake her slumbering wife.</p><p>The first thing that Agatha noticed when she entered their bedroom was that Rio had turned on the fan, and that it was all the way up. It wasn't pointed at her, but Agatha quickly realized it had been to help her sleep. Dani's voice had likely been keeping her away and so, she'd tried to make it a little less prominent. </p><p>Casting her eyes toward the bed, she was genuinely surprised to see Rio fully on the wrong side -- Agatha's side -- of the bed, the comforter shoved back and the sheets twisted around her torso, legs fully exposed. </p><p>It wasn't necessarily an indication that anything was wrong, per say, but Agatha could see with an internal illumination that Rio had missed her while she was gone. They had been married a very long time and while they weren't exactly clingy, there were some days when the forced absence of responsibility was a little harder to shoulder. Going back to work had been for the betterment of Agatha's mental well-being, but with recent events, she admittedly had been a bit selfish in that she hadn't really stopped to consider how Rio was feeling about it, too.</p><p>Instead, Agatha had focused on her own feelings, on the anger she tried not to stew in at being told time and time again to call back to the county jail and they <em>might</em> have an available time where she could go and speak with Wanda. 'Speak' was probably an impossibly loose term there, but Agatha deserved face time with the woman who had ruined so many lives and she was not going to rest until someone granted it to her.</p><p>Until then, work had been enough to keep her distracted.</p><p>At least, it had been. Now, Agatha had the corner of that envelope pinched tight in her grasp as she moved silently about the room, wanting to allow Rio just a few more minutes. Moreover, she wanted to give herself some time to discover what had been sent to her wife and why it had her daughter being vaguely supportive in the best way. </p><p>The bottle of water landed on the night stand and she let the envelope fall to the bed so that she could shed her scrub pants and climb onto the bed, covering her legs with a small portion of the comforter her wife had discarded. In her settling, she glanced to her left, watching her sleeping wife with her face buried in Agatha's pillow, searching for comfort even in her slumber.</p><p>Finally, Agatha grabbed the envelope off of the bed and did not waste a single second before she was removing the letter, discarding the vessel that had been holding it, and unfolding it before her so that she could reveal what it was that had everyone she loved out of sorts.</p><p>Agatha had been lacking that anticipatory anxiety despite seeing the impact it had delivered, but the moment she began to read enough that she understood, something in her swelled and pressed on every single nerve she had.</p><p>Someone that knew their son -- very, very well as it seemed -- was reaching out. Someone that loved him and cared about him was too scared of what could happen if he did not find some form of recover and so, she was trying to offer what remedy she could as a concerned third party.</p><p>The other woman's guilt was clear in her words, an overt display that it was not her goal to betray her boyfriend, but to try to bridge a gap that he was not willing to acknowledge.</p><p>Agatha read it three more times and was in the middle of a fourth one when she jumped at the feeling of Rio's hand landing lightly against her hip. She sucked in a sharp breath and dropped her gaze to the woman next to her, the exhaustion still visible on her face, esepcially with how her eyes were still closed. </p><p>"Hi, my love," Agatha cooed at her, lifting her right hand to brush her knuckle along Rio's cheek. "I think you got a little turned around. You ended up on the wrong side of the bed." The joke fell flat, but it was only due to the fact that Agatha's voice was shaking too badly to make her sound confident in the delivery.</p><p>"I didn't. You couldn't hug me, but I could still lose myself in you when you weren't here," Rio muttered, causing Agatha's already crumbling heart to crack further. She had rushed so quickly to try and find a sense of normal and it was clearly impacting the woman she loved, maybe even more than she was seeing in those moments.</p><p>Agatha reached down for Rio's hand, lifting it so that she could press her lips to her wife's knuckles. When she lowered it, she did not let go and instead formed a tight grip over Rio's fingers.</p><p>"I know. But... Dani left me the source of your discord and I have read it... A few times..." Agatha looked back toward the paper for just a moment before looking down at Rio again. This time, she had opened her eyes. Agatha's lips worried together for a moment as she tried to map out how this conversation might play out best. She had options but something in her felt as though she needed to charge forward, taking to it head-on.</p><p>"What are you thinking? Do you... Do you want to message her?" Agatha questioned softly, her thumb brushing automatically over Rio's fingers.</p><p>Rio was quiet, taking the time she needed to find the right answer to that question. Before she dispelled it and broke through any selfless facade she had been trying to maintain, she sat up and pushed the covers aside so that she could move to sit perpendicular to Agatha, Rio's knees bumping Agatha's hip and she side of her leg. Rio picked up her hand again.</p><p>"I do. And I've thought a lot about it. It... It unsettled me, the secrecy, but... Then I saw the desperation and the love. I saw that she is out of options and so, she wanted to help somehow, even if she cannot help him right now." Rio was so fucking earnest in her delivery, so hopeful that they had been offered some sort of life vest when it felt like they'd started to drown all over again.</p><p>Rio drew in a shallow breath before she continued.</p><p>"I want to because selfishly, I feel like we deserve it. I feel like having some answers is... It's better than not having any at all." There was a beat of silence as Rio stared straight into Agatha's eyes, not blinking, not wavering. Agatha felt her grip tighten as she started to speak again, posing her question in something barely louder than a whisper. "What do you think I should do?"</p><p>The question was so small, so scared, as if Rio actually thought Agatha might tell her it was a bad idea. Truthfully, Agatha wasn't certain whether or not it was good or bad, but she didn't care. They had been starved of their son's presence for two and a half decades. Turning down even the smallest crumb of who he had become simply was not an available option.</p><p>"I think you should text her. And I think maybe you should offer Sunday at the cafe near the edge of town. Just the two of you. As much as I want to go... She wrote to you for a reason and I won't tread on that." Agatha's honesty was there, but it was clear that her reasoning was something she clearly held conviction in. Yes, she wanted to be there, but something in her gut told her that Rio might be able to get a bit more in return than she herself could.</p><p>Agatha could be... A little much, especially in high tension situations. The likelihood that she could grow frantic that they weren't getting enough, even though it was more than they had, it was high and she was firm in her belief that neither of them wanted to spook this poor woman.</p><p>"You're sure?" Rio asked quietly, playing with Agatha's fingers absentmindedly in her lap. </p><p>"I am. Why don't you go ahead and do it now, that way we can go eat the enchiladas our daughter is making us for supper and watch a movie with her?" Agatha knew she didn't need to be convincing, but she wanted to offer a short list of distractions that might make the night ahead of them a little easier to get through as they tried not to focus on waiting for a text back.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b> <u>Rio.</u> </b>
</p><p>Languidly, Rio leaned back and stretched out to grab her phone off of Agatha's nightstand as she pulled it toward her and sat back up.</p><p>Agatha read the number off to her as she typed it into her phone and saved it under 'Gabi' and proceeded to pull up a message window. Before she even started to type, Agatha's hand landed on her knee and gave a gentle squeeze, as if to say 'You can do this.'</p><p>A deep breath helped to calm her as she typed out the message.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>Hi, Gabi.

<p align="center"><b><u>Gabi.</u></b></p><p>When a soft ping sounded from Gabi's lap as she lounged on their couch with the television muted in the background, the sight of an unsaved number caused her stomach to leap into her throat. She couldn't see what it said right away, but something in her knew.</p><p>She <em>knew</em> it wasn't just a random number.</p><p>She was right.</p><p><b>862-978-0499: </b>Hi, Gabi. This is Rio. I got<br/>your letter and... I was wondering<br/>if you might be able to meet me<br/>at the Blueprint Cafe on Sunday<br/>morning. Whatever time would<br/>work best for you. Please let me<br/>know. Thank you.</p><p>Holy fucking shit. </p><p>When she penned the letter, Gabi wasn't entirely sure what it was she was hoping for. She wanted to say that she hoped Rio would engage and reach out -- like she was obviously doing -- but some part of her also hoped she would ignore it. It was the part of her that felt like she was betraying the man she loved in this roundabout way. </p><p>He was clearly of no mind to be able to entertain the idea of conversing with his biological family, but Gabi had a unique perspective.</p><p>The more she watched Nik struggle and suffer, the more she found herself slipping into the shoes of what must have been an opposing party. She did her research, learned what she needed to know, and it tasked her with the comprehension they were probably suffering, too.</p><p>Maybe what she was doing would be considered a betrayal to him, but at this point... She didn't really have a whole lot of him left to hold onto.</p><p>He was slipping further and further away with every hour that passed and was clearly never going to be the one to reach out without extensive therapy and a deconstruction of his entire life. Understandably, it was going to take him a while to get there. That face alone, however, did not mean that the parents who had already been missing him for twenty-five years deserved to stay in the dark.</p><p>They should get to know who he was, even if they couldn't meet him.</p><p>Her head lifted, dark locks falling out of her face as she glanced toward their bedroom, not a sound coming from it. Nik was probably sleeping, and if not, he was wallowing in his misery and unwilling to let her help him. Stormy eyes stayed locked on the doorway for a moment longer before they dropped again to the phone in her lap, reading the message for a fifth time.</p><p>She shouldn't.</p><p>Gabi <em>knew </em>she she shouldn't.</p><p>But she <em>wanted</em> to, almost felt like she <em>needed</em> to.</p><p>So, she typed her response.</p><p align="right"><b>Me:</b> I can do Sunday morning. Is<br/>9:30 okay? I should be able to <br/>make it over there by then,<br/>if it's alright with you. I just<br/>need to figure out the best <br/>way to do it.</p><p>When she sent the message, Gabi also did something beyond her own comprehension: </p><p>She held her breath.</p><p>She only realized she was doing so about twenty seven seconds later when her phone pinged again and she released it in a massive exhale, the tension in her body unlocking instantaneously.</p><p><b>862-978-0499: </b>That would be perfect.<br/>I will see you then. And I will be coming<br/>alone. <br/><br/><b>862-978-0499: </b>Also... Thank you. For <br/>reaching out. You... There's hope now.<br/>Thank you.</p><p>The moment the second text came through, Gabi's eyes filled and overflowed with silent tears. She wanted to sob, to cry, to completely throw herself to the ground in a tantrum of feeling utterly overwhelmed, but she didn't. All she did was sniffle softly, wiping at her cheeks with the back of her sweatshirt sleeve. </p><p>If Nik heard her, she would have to explain.</p><p>She wasn't ready to do as much quite yet.</p><p align="right"><b>Me:</b> No problem. Happy I could<br/>help.</p><p>It was nonchalant but entirely feigned. Gabi could have spilled her guts then and there in a text message, but it wasn't the right way to go about it. She needed to physically see with her own eyes the kind of effect the entire ordeal was having on other people, the people who never stopped loving him, looking for him. She needed to meet these women he seemed to be so afraid of. Hell, she <em>still</em> hadn't been able to pry out of him why he'd smashed his laptop and that said something. It said he'd done his own research and did not like what he found.</p><p>Gabi told Rio in her letter that she and Nik didn't keep secrets. She meant it, but it was beginning to feel like the tides of change were coming in. Now, he was hiding his emotions and his thoughts from her. He was cocooning inside himself and shutting her out entirely and she could no longer take it. If she had to find his roots before he was able, she could no longer sit on her hands and do nothing. </p><p>Gabi loved Nikolai and she meant what she'd said to him the night she placed that stupid fucking DNA test in his hands.</p><p>No matter who he was or where he came from, she was still going to love him. And she did. She loved him so much that she could feel herself aching with him, hurting with him, losing themselves to the darkness. She could feel his pain and she fucking hated it. Maybe it wasn't going to change after her coffee with Rio, but at least she would find some peace in knowing she made a slight difference, even if not for him. The misery was simply too much for everyone involved. Finding a way to taper it felt necessary, so she would do what she had to.</p><p>Gabi stowed her phone and made them both soup and grilled cheese for dinner. When she returned an hour later for his plate, he was wrapped back up in the comforter and did not move a muscle upon her entry. </p><p>Despite the lack of... well, everything, Gabi was at least thankful that one side of the grilled cheese had maybe four bites taken out of it.</p><p>At least he was trying to eat.</p><p>"I love you," she voiced softly before slipping out of the room to clean up and try to sleep.</p><p>Saturday was more of the same dull ache and silence, but Gabi found herself hinging her hope on her meeting the next morning. When it finally came around, she hardly knew how to handle herself.</p><p>She woke at 6:13, which wasn't entirely unusual for her but still <em>felt</em> different due to the way her skin was buzzing with an emotion she knew not how to identify. She took a shower, pulled on a camisole, a cardigan, and a pair of dark wash jeans and dusted her face with a light layer of make-up, just enough to hide the bags beneath her eyes and the constant rosiness of her cheeks.</p><p>The last thing she needed was to show up looking like she'd been crying for weeks. That most certainly would not make the best first impression.</p><p>After leaving Nik with a soft kiss to his still cheek, a quick train ride, and an even quicker cab ride, Gabi found herself wrapped tightly in her cardigan, arms fastened over her middle as though she were trying to protect herself from a non-existent chill in the air.</p><p>She was really trying to ward off the immersive waves of guilt that crashed into her with every step she took toward the cafe. </p><p>The moment she started to pass the windows, her eyes fell to look through them, scanning the inside of the business. Illogically, they landed on the near corner and landed on the sight of a lone woman, hair dark and chin tucked as she looked at whatever was on her phone. Gabi couldn't see the whole of her face, but she saw enough to match the nose and profile to one of the women she'd found in her research.</p><p>It was Rio.</p><p>She really had shown up. </p><p>Gabi wasn't exactly surprised, but something in her churned and twisted, making her feel sick.</p><p>No.</p><p>She had to do this.</p><p>She <em>had</em> to walk into that cafe, question the woman gently to know for certain it was who she was there to meet, and sit down across from her to try and hold some form of conversation about the man she loved and the crisis he was in.</p><p>With the deepest breath she found herself capable of, Gabi pressed onward and entered the cafe.</p><p>The older woman's head did not lift and the bell above the door didn't seem to pull at her attention. She was fixated on her phone, leaving Gabi to do most of the work. That was fine, if not a little unnerving.</p><p>Slowly, she shuffled to the table, careful to keep her distance in case she'd approached the wrong person.</p><p>"Mrs. Harkness-Vidal?" she managed. She <em>tried</em> to make it sound strong, but instead she just sounded like a church mouse, barely a squeak to be heard.</p><p>Immediately, the woman's head snapped up and a kind smile warmed her face.</p><p>"You must be Gabi."</p><p> </p><p align="center"><b><u>Rio.</u></b></p><p>The moment her dark eyes landed on the woman near the corner of the table, Rio wanted to melt. She'd been convincing herself it was all a fluke, that the woman who wrote her that letter would feel too guilty to actually show up. It was poured into every word she wrote; Rio could see just how much she loved their son and how badly it was hurting her to go behind his back. </p><p>Yet somehow, Rio understood it without ever having to experience it. She understood that this young woman had loved their son for years and was now watching as a life-shattering revelation was completely tearing him apart. She understood how Gabi felt like this was the only thing she could do to try and find peace in the chaos. Maybe it would prove to be foolish, but admittedly, Rio just wanted to hear someone tell her their little boy was okay, no matter how big he'd grown.</p><p>"I am," the young woman replied as she tucked her hair behind her ear. The same hand jutted out, as if to offer a handshake uncertainly. Rio glanced at it for a moment and looked back up to the woman before her. </p><p>"May I hug you instead?" she asked softly. When Gabi nodded, Rio pushed up from her chair and wrapped her in a firm embrace, holding her tightly. It made no sense to hug this complete stranger, but Rio was already so thankful for her that she didn't know what to do with herself. She was offering them the smallest glimpse of what they'd been missing for twenty-five years and as a result, it was simply... a lot. She felt the need to at least <em>try</em> to convey just what it meant to her.</p><p>Neither of them cried, thank God, but when Rio pulled away, she could see the faint shimmer of tears sitting on the younger woman's lids.</p><p>"Thank you, Gabi," Rio voiced softly, giving her shoulders a light squeeze before placing herself at the table and indicating for her to do the same. Once, seated, Rio couldn't help but to take a second and just... study.</p><p>She knew what Gabi looked like before she reached out because of the night her, Agatha, and Dani stayed up scouring the corners of the internet for any search of Nicky, but seeing her in person was far different.</p><p>She looked tired. She looked like beneath her thin layer of make-up, she'd done quite a bit of crying. She looked confused and worried, like she felt what she was doing by sitting there was somehow wrong. The way her hands shook on the table top made Rio ache; all she wanted was to reach out and place her own over them to try and calm her, but the hug had been enough as it was. </p><p>The fact of the matter was that Rio did not know this woman. She knew only what she saw online, and what she had derived from the letter. She and Agatha spoke about it frequently and after Dani read it, she offered in her own perspective.</p><p>Clearly this woman loved their son. She loved him before all of this for seven long years. Who his parents were or what he was going through would never change that.</p><p>It was why they were there, wasn't it?</p><p>She wanted to see what he was not allowing himself to have for herself. to see what he could truly obtain if he would get out of his own way. The likelihood that she would disclose their meeting together was slim, but at least it might help <em>her</em> find some peace when he could not.</p><p>"It's... Really nice to meet you," Rio ventured softly, her soft honey gaze carefully tracing the features before her. "I know it isn't the ideal circumstances... And I can tell you half want to bolt out of here, but... It would me a lot to me -- all of us, our family -- if you would stay. Even if it's only a few minutes."</p><p>Under her studious watch, Gabi seemed to melt the tiniest bit. Her eyes glassed over again, but she did not cry; still, the mere sight made Rio's own prick with the threat of tears.</p><p>"I'm staying," the young woman returned. She was clearly trying to sound certain, but her voice cracked and her lip quivered just barely. </p><p>"Okay," Rio soothed. "I didn't know what to order you, obviously. So... Maybe some tea first and we can talk once you've had a moment?" When Gabi gave a solemn nod, Rio raised a hand to flag the attention of the waitress, calling her over to collect Gabi's order. Once she disappeared, it seemed as though the other woman didn't so much care about having the tea first.</p><p>"I... I just want to say that I realize the conflict of morality here, but I feel..." She paused, her lips rubbing together as she fought back tears.</p><p>God, seeing her so emotional was not helping Rio keep her own composure in the least.</p><p>"I feel like there's not really an end in sight with him. This is... the worst I've ever seen him. He's supposed to go back to work at the beginning of the month, but I don't know how. He doesn't leave bed, rarely eats and rarely showers. His whole life... It's a lie to him and I think he just..." Gabi's voice trembled again and Rio made a choice. Maybe it was the wrong choice, but she made it all the same.</p><p>Gently, she reached across the small table between them and set both of her hands atop Gabi's, giving them a small squeeze. </p><p>"I just think he doesn't know who he is. And it's killing him. If I thought I could get him out of bed, I'd help him get into therapy, or get back into running. But... He wants nothing to do with me."</p><p>Gabi's head dropped and she closed her eyes, leaving Rio pained to watch the fat tears as they rolled down her cheeks. </p><p>This was fucking awful.</p><p>Sure, the three of them had been aching at the idea that their son might not want to know them, but Rio never stopped to think about what it was he had to be experiencing. Sure, it was easy to think about being told nothing you knew was actually right and how to handle it, but the harsh reality was that there was no knowing what it actually felt like without being having to go through it firsthand.</p><p>Nicholas was suffering and Gabi was doing what she possibly could to somehow make it better. Maybe it would only end up making it worse when she inevitably told him the truth, but for now, this was her way of doing <em>something</em> as opposed to doing <em>nothing.</em> </p><p>"I don't think that's true," Rio tried to offer. Sure, she didn't know the first thing about them as individuals but the duration of their relationship spoke for itself. They'd been together since college. That was loud, that was important. "This is... For us, it's a potential happy ending. For him... I imagine it's like having every mirror smashed into pieces to a point where he doesn't know who is supposed to be looking back at him."</p><p>Rio paused, gingerly brushing her thumbs over the backs of Gabi's hands.</p><p>"The only person that can be the mirror of his true self, that can show him who is really is, is you. And you coming here to talk with me is a step in the right direction. I know you came here with the intention of telling me who he is, but even if you don't, I still think this is... It's a good start. It's good to just... see how you care about him. It tells me he has someone in his corner that won't tap out." Rio's tone was measured and soft, cognizant of how fragile the situation before he was, and the woman herself.</p><p>"I love him," Gabi admitted, her lip jutting out as she tried to stifle another sob. She pulled her hands from beneath Rio's wiping furiously at her face; it clearly wasn't the touch but rather the embarrassment of nearly sobbing in the middle of a cafe at 10 in the morning. "And I have zero clue how to help him."</p><p>"I know. And I'm afraid I don't have much advice in that regard because I... I don't actually know him. But it's so very apparent how much you love him, and that you would do anything to help him. So... Just know how much I, my wife, and our daughter appreciate you agreeing to this, let alone being the one to suggest it."</p><p>Rio's words were sincere but they were so impossibly heavy, something they were both aware of.</p><p>"I... I did my research, obviously," Gabi offered, wiping at her face once more in an attempt to dry it. "And from what I could see... You three just <em>look</em> like the family he deserved, the one that deserved him."</p><p>Something in Gabi's tone shot a chill right up Rio's spine. She wasn't being spiteful or mean about Wanda, but it made Rio think that maybe Nicky's life had not been as perfect as they were hoping it was.</p><p>"Was she... Was Wanda good to him?" Rio managed, licking her suddenly dry lips out of nervousness. </p><p>Gabi just blinked at her, almost as if she'd forgotten who Wanda even was. It settled a moment later, action slipping back into her form.</p><p>"Alisa was... She wasn't <em>bad</em> to him."</p><p><em>Okay,</em> Rio thought, <em>but that's not implying she was good to him, either.</em></p><p>"But when she moved them around so much... It was really hard on him. He never got to have real friends or build long term relationships until college. She hovers always... Even right before all of this happened. It was for his birthday, but she picked a place to live close enough that she could have a good idea of what was going on with him."</p><p>Oh. So she was out of her mind <em>and</em> controlling? Good to know. Heartbreaking, and causing an ulcer in the pits of Rio's stomach, but still good to know.</p><p>"She was worried," Rio theorized aloud, not actually meaning to speak. </p><p>"I think he sees that now. She... Never wanted him to be found."</p><p>The words smacked into Rio individually, one after another in the center of her chest. They hurt more and more with each impact, leaving her feeling as if she were choking on nothing. It had been Wanda's intent to hide him for the rest of their lives, to keep it all a secret from him. He was <em>hers</em> and she hadn't wanted to let him go.</p><p>Now, he was free.</p><p>And he was drowning without much to keep him afloat.</p><p>When the waitress arrived with Gabi's tea, both women thanked her softly before turning their attention upon one another once more.</p><p>"Okay, so," Gabi voiced after a slow sip of the hot liquid. In an instant, the warmth both filled and relaxed her, allowing to slump in her chair the slightest bit. "We did not come here for a tear fest, I am sure."</p><p>Oh. Rio liked her already.</p><p>"Better we got it out of the way first then, hm?" Rio offered as she lifted her mug of coffee for a drink of her own.</p><p>Gabi's expression was soft, her eyes tender as she became the one to truly <em>look</em> at Rio. What she said next almost shattered Rio to millions of very, very tiny pieces.</p><p>"He has your eyes. And your smile."</p><p>That hurt. It was meant to help, Rio knew, but it fucking <em>hurt.</em></p><p>This woman who had looked at her son for the better part of a decade was telling her he looked like her. Surely, he looked like Agatha, too, as they knew, but hearing her voice such a thought out loud was almost enough to sink Rio herself.</p><p>Nicky was free.</p><p>Yet everyone seemed to be drowning.</p><p>"Admittedly, we did our own research. And... I'm of the opinion that he looks a lot like Agatha, but she said the same things you just did. So I can't really argue with you both."</p><p>The joint but soft laughter provided an air of warmth around the two of them, if only for a moment before they were staring back at one another.</p><p>Alright. It was time to put up or shut up. Gabi hadn't up and scrambled out, and the way she was talking insinuated she wanted to stay, so Rio slowly and cautiously trudged forward, offering the softest question.</p><p>"What does he like for breakfast?"</p><p>It could have seemed weird that of all the things in the world she could have asked, but the flash of tenderness in Gabi's eyes attested to her understanding. Rio wanted to take baby steps. She could ask things like his favorite breakfast or wha kind of music he listened to. She didn't want to push, didn't want to make Gabi feel as though she was violating his trust.</p><p>She just wanted to know who, after twenty-five years, her son had grown into.</p><p>"On the weekends, he likes when I make papas con chorizo y huevo. It's --"</p><p>Rio was grinning before she spoke. "I know what it is. It's one of <em>my</em> favorites. Agatha burned out on it ten years ago."</p><p>For a moment, there was quiet. The dull chatter of other occupants and the distant clinging of dishes could be heard, but the two women just watched one another, trying to figure out who was going to be brave enough to say something else.</p><p>Gabi beat Rio to the punch.</p><p>"You both... You really love each other, don't you?" she questioned gently, arm resting on the table as she fiddled with the handle of her mug. "I mean... You stayed together, he has a sister... You... You really held out hope this whole time?"</p><p>The question itself was loaded; there had been many nights when Agatha had shouted at her because she was so improbably angry and there had been just as many where Rio fell asleep on the floor because she was mad at Agatha but not enough to want to sleep in another room. They faced many, many struggles over the years but never once had Rio ever considered leaving. </p><p>For every minute of raised blood pressure and every second of spit-fire anger, Rio still loved Agatha and always would.</p><p>So yes, Gabi was right.</p><p>"We do, and we have. I think..." Rio paused, her eyes finally tearing away from the young woman before her to stare into her coffee, the color of burnt caramel. "I think we've always known he was somewhere. We didn't know where, and we didn't know if we would <em>ever</em> know. But... You've been so close this whole time; Dani lives <em>twenty</em> minutes away on foot. And we <em>never </em> would have known if it hadn't been for the DNA test."</p><p>There was the smallest ripple in Gabi's expression; guilt. The detective had loosely detailed how they obtained the sample, but as Rio looked into Gabi's eyes again, she saw nothing but self flagellation. She wasn't speaking, but her eyes had welled up and started to dart over Rio's face. </p><p>"Hey, it's okay," she tried to soothe, though she knew better than to reach out again. "I take it you got it for him." It was a reasonable deduction, but the way Gabi's face folded even more while still not shedding another tear tore at something inside her.</p><p>"He just wanted to know about his second parent. She would never tell him. I..." Gabi drew in a slow breath through her nose, clearly trying to keep herself calm. "I thought he had a right to those answers. I just had no clue those answers would be... this. And... I'm still caught up on how I feel about it."</p><p>Rio knew she needed to be sensitive, to be gentle, and so she tried.</p><p>"Sometimes the answers we get are the ones we need, even if they aren't the ones we like. I just hate that it has to feel this way."</p><p> </p><p align="center"><b><u>Agatha.</u></b></p><p>Kissing her wife and watching her slip out the front door, Agatha knew she needed to busy herself. She needed to find something to do to occupy her mind, mostly because the only thoughts that seemed to be in abundance were the ones demanding answers.</p><p>By ten-thirty that morning, she managed to clean both the living room and kitchen before making a mess of it again with far too many pancakes to count. When Dani turned up shortly before eleven looking like she hadn't slept a wink, she was more than happy to put a small dent in Agatha's hard work.</p><p>When she started deep cleaning ten minutes later by pulling out the stove, Dani called her out.</p><p>"What's wrong?" she asked flatly from her spot at the counter before shoving a bite of pancake in her mouth.</p><p>"Nothing," Agatha dismissed, waving her off.</p><p>"You're lying. You only deep clean when you're angry."</p><p>Sometimes, Agatha really hated how one of the traits Dani seemed to inherit from her was her perception level.</p><p>"I'm not angry," Agatha informed her though she did not bother lifting her head to look at her daughter.</p><p>"You're stewing, then," Dani corrected smugly.</p><p>"You're being annoying, Danica," Agatha clipped in warning.</p><p>With a soft huff from the counter, Dani finished the last bit of her breakfast and slid off the stool to rinse her plate off in the sink. Before she departed, she sidled up to her mother and placed a kiss to her cheek.</p><p>"It's going to be okay."</p><p>Dani sounded so fucking sure, but how? How could she be sure when Rio was at a cafe a half an hour away meeting with the only link in the world they had to their son? There were so many things she needed to know, so many questions that demanded answers. </p><p>So how could Dani say it would be okay?</p><p>Weeks had passed and their son wasn't ready to enter their orbit. Maybe he never would be. Maybe he was his own man, with his own life, and would never want to know the love they still harbored for him.</p><p>Her Nicky.</p><p>Her sweet boy.</p><p>He was Nik.</p><p>And she didn't know the first thing about him.</p><p>But she still loved him, and so did Rio. Dani, for that matter.</p><p>"Say it enough times and I might start to believe you," Agatha murmured back, leaning into Dani's shoulders. In a flash, she felt her daughter's arm hook around her shoulders, pulling her closer. </p><p>"It's going to be okay. I love you." She stole another rough peck to the side of Agatha's head and released, making her way to the stairs. "I'm gonna shower. We should go to the park later!"</p><p>Agatha didn't even want to dignify that with an answer so she offered a light laugh instead. </p><p>Her mind was somewhere else entirely; she started thinking about questions and answers. Rio was surely going to get some, to gain <em>some</em> knowledge about their boy, but she wasn't going to get the right answers, not the ones to the tough questions.</p><p>No, there was only one way to get those.</p><p>Quickly and quietly, Agatha climbed the stairs to their bedroom and changed into daywear; a black blouse rolled at the sleeves and black trousers clung to her form, leaving her a shadow meant to darken any space she occupied, or at least the one she had in mind. After shaking her hair out and giving herself a look-over in the mirror, she collected her keys and phone and made her exit, climbing into her car a moment later.</p><p>She pulled up the GPS and typed in her destination with precision.</p><p>ESSEX COUNTY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.</p><p>She would get her fucking answers one way or another.</p><p> </p>

<p align="center"><u><b>Rio.</b></u></p><p>Only twenty minutes passed and somehow, Rio felt as though she'd known Gabi for years. The way they conversed was easy, natural, and took little will to make it happen. It was soft-spoken and easy, a gentle balm to an intense situation.</p><p>Rio learned quite a few things over the course of those twenty minutes.</p><p>     1) Nicky's favorite color was hunter green. No other shade of green. Just that one.<br/>     2) Nicky, like Agatha, had a terrible habit of picking at his fingernails.<br/>     3) His favorite kind of music was pop-punk, but they loved going to raves together.<br/>     4) Whenever it stormed, he sat in their picture window and watched it roll through (something Dani had done since she was little).<br/>     5) His comfort food was noodles with butter and garlic.</p><p>The most painful one, though, was one Rio never anticipated.<br/><br/>     6) He had told Gabi many times throughout their time together that more than anything as a kid, he wanted to be a big brother.</p><p>He <em>was</em> a big brother. He had a beautiful little sister that thought of him all the time, that wished him a happy birthday and a good new year every single January 1st of every single year since she'd been old enough to understand the importance of the day.</p><p>"She thinks about him all of the time, even before this," Rio disclosed softly. "Sometimes, she'll see a silly t-shirt or hat and ask me if I think he'd wear something like that."</p><p>Before Rio could continue, Gabi cut her off with a soft laugh.</p><p>"Not out in public, but he has a mini-collection of terrible t-shirts. He has one he thinks is hilarious. It's got a cup of noodles on it and says 'Send Noods.' I'm still waiting for the teenage humor to wear off a little more." Gabi's voice was so soft, so tender as she disclosed Nicky's penchant for bad humor. Rio didn't say anything aloud, but she felt a kinship to the ability to laugh at the sillier things. </p><p>Rio's humor was something she clung to for over twenty long years, something she used to protect herself when the world was so impossibly cruel. It was how she laughed off the bad nights, the long ones, and the ones where she wondered what life even actually meant anymore.</p><p>"He sounds like the type that reminds the world it's a better place when you can laugh."</p><p>Gabi's shoulders fell slightly and that gentle look returned to her eyes.</p><p>"You sound just like him, actually."</p><p>Rio marched into that cafe earlier that morning as a woman on a mission. As she sat before Gabi in those moments, she was simply a mother longing to know the amazing man she was being told about. Maybe he didn't know who he was right then, but the one person who did was trying to make his life easier, better, in any way she could. </p><p>It was so painfully clear that Gabi loved him. Maybe they weren't married, maybe he had no plans of proposing, but that didn't seem to matter to the woman sitting at that table, battling her nerves and her morality for the sake of trying to soothe what and who was capable of being soothed. If it wasn't him, it could be Rio instead.</p><p>Her plan in writing that letter, it was working.</p><p>It wasn't as good as what it could be to have <em>him</em> be the one to pen her and show up, but it was the next best thing. Maybe, Rio thought, it was even better because she was not getting his own -- possibly misguided -- view of himself. She was getting the view of him from the person who saw him day in and day out, who had fallen head over heels in love with him. Sure, maybe Gabi wasn't telling her pivotal things, but Rio didn't expect her to. They'd just met and while she was being entirely forthcoming, Gabi was still treating it cautiously, gauging where to steer the conversation.</p><p>Gabi was young, yes, but the handle she seemed to have on life and on the rather jarring situation they all found themselves in impressed Rio beyond measure. Sure, she shed her tears, but they were both guilty of that. Overall, it was simply <em>good</em> to see how supportive she was of Nicky -- Nik as she called him -- and comforting in its own right.</p><p>That time, the tears welled in Rio's eyes at the comparison, but she was quick to blink them back.</p><p>"I..." Gabi began, clearly catching the blunder. "I can stop doing that. Comparing him to you, I mean... If it upsets you."</p><p><em>God,</em> Rio thought, <em>this woman is too fucking sweet for her own good.</em></p><p>She shook her head in a gentle dismissal, a sad smile tugging on her lips.</p><p>"No, no. Please don't actually. It's just... Really strange to hear that we can be similar when we... We've never really known each other." It was her truth, something she had come to realize in their time at that table, but that was changing. Maybe she didn't know <em>him, </em>exactly, but she knew what the person who knew him best thought of him.</p><p>Still, there were more questions to be asked.</p><p>"If you're sure," Gabi offered softly to which Rio only nodded. </p><p>She <em>liked</em> hearing it, even if it hurt.</p><p>"Can I ask you more things about him? Am I keeping you from anything?" </p><p>In the same way the young woman before her was showing endless compassion, Rio was just the same. She was infinitely thankful that Gabi was willing to give her so much, but she also did not want to cause any strain on her life otherwise.</p><p>"No, not keeping me. I plan to grab groceries on the way home, but I..." She faltered for just a moment, very obviously stopping herself from saying something that might have come across as a little cold. She cleared her throat and rephrased before she finally voiced it aloud. "I don't think he will be out of bed enough to tell how long I've been gone."</p><p>It was a sad reality, but one Rio hoped they could change soon. Somehow, someway, it needed to change.</p><p>"What was he like in college?"</p><p>Gabi considered for a moment, an affectionate gleam flashing across dark eyes. The smallest smile curled her lips before she answered.</p><p>"Silly. Charming. We... We tried to be friends first, just because we had a lot on our plates with our course loads. But he... He would show up when I was awake at midnight studying with my favorite take out to help me power through. He'd stay on the phone with me when he couldn't be there in person. Even the first time he kissed me, we were just supposed to be enjoying a friendly walk but he couldn't keep it in. He offered me the chance to forget it and apologized profusely. The only way I could get him to stop was to kiss him again."</p><p>Her eyes sparkled and the smile on her face grew at recalling the memory, almost as if she was reliving it all over again.</p><p>The two of them had been young, still in their first year of college, and it was clear even back then, Nicky had a soft heart. He was chivalrous and caring, kind but also smart enough to go after the things he wanted in life.</p><p>"You said it about Agatha and I, but... I'd like to return the favor. I can tell that you really love him just by the way you speak about him. And... I can tell he loves you, too, even if he's not great at showing it with everything going on."</p><p>"I do know that," Gabi conceded, tipping her head to look into her tea. "And that's why I won't leave. It's why I won't give up on him. Because yes, a lot of his world has been turned upside-down and he doesn't know what's real and what's not. But I am. And I don't want him to lose the one thing he can be certain of."</p><p>Rio gave a nod of understanding, thin fingers pressing into the ceramic of her coffee cup. For a moment, her lips twisted slightly and she braved another question.</p><p>"Does his work make him happy?"</p><p>The way Gabi softened each time Rio asked a genuine question that was not a baseline of 'how-to-get-to-know-someone-101,' it struck something within her. Maybe Gabi had built expectations of this meeting in her head prior to showing up, but it appeared as though Rio was countering every possible scenario she'd cooked up with finesse and ease.</p><p>"It does. Which... I'm hoping we can get him to the point where he's ready to go back. I think it will be good for him. He's... A social butterfly. He feeds off of learning and growing, and he says the best way to do that is to listen to what other people have to say."</p><p>The more Gabi disclosed, the more Rio could feel her heart squeezing in her chest. Her boy, her sweet boy who chose the path of a healer and loved speaking with others. Her kind young man who gave a shit about the world and how it operated and only wanted to fill it with compassion and laughter.</p><p>Maybe she and Agatha had not been given the privilege of raising him, but it still seemed as though he'd found his way anyway.</p><p>"Can I ask something... A little more loaded?" Rio questioned, her gaze dropping to the table. She knew she shouldn't press any harder, but there was something she <em>needed</em> to know.</p><p>Gabi studied her long and hard, trying to gauge whether or not it was going to be a question she was capable of answering. After what felt like an eternity, she nodded her head.</p><p>"Did he... Did he love her? As his mom, did he love Wanda?"</p><p>It was irrational and Rio <em>knew better</em>, but she couldn't stop herself. There had been countless days where <em>they</em> had loved <em>him</em> without him ever knowing who they were. Something in Rio simply needed to know whether or not Wanda had been good enough to him to earn that type of emotion.</p><p>Gabi shifted slightly in her seat, leaning forward with her elbows on the table as a call for Rio's attention. When their gazes locked, she offered a kind smile, one that soothed Rio far more than it should have.</p><p>"I think he felt obligated to love her. But she... She made his life very hard. And... He resented her for it, even if he continued to entertain her after he moved away. All Nik ever needed was... support. Companionship. And she ensured he never got it until he was an adult."</p><p>Even though it shouldn't have, it felt like a small victory. She took a steadying breath, doing what she could to not let it show on her face. Wanda took him, deprived him of having the love Agatha and Rio both wanted to pour into him and instead of being some super-parent or someone who gave 'their' child everything they needed, Wanda had failed him.</p><p>It felt wrong to be happy about that, especially given what Nicky was currently going through, but Rio couldn't help it.</p><p>They would have been better for him. There was no questioning it.</p><p>There was also no changing it.</p><p>"Can I ask you one last thing?" Rio beguiled quietly, nibbling on the inside of her lower lip immediately.</p><p>Gabi again nodded, clearly willing to answer anything at that point.</p><p>"Do you think there's hope for us?"</p><p>For a split second, Gabi froze in place. Her chest stopped moving, her eyes locked onto Rio and not even a strand of hair was rustled by the vent over her head. She thought it over, clearly gave it consideration and after a breath, relaxed and offered her answer.</p><p>"I do," she returned in earnest. "But I can't promise a day. I can't say 'Oh, on this Tuesday in June, he's suddenly going to be okay enough to meet." While it was blunt, Rio understood it. There was no timeline on the grief and devastation he had to be feeling and putting him on one was absolutely unfair. Still, hearing there was <em>some</em> hope as opposed to none, that meant something. "But I think... I think once the pain starts to fade, he will find enough objectivity to understand what he's missing out on."</p><p>Rio's lips parted to speak, but Gabi wasn't finished.</p><p>"Because from what I can tell... He <em>is</em> missing out. You haven't talked so much about yourself or Agatha, but... I see that look in your eyes every time you learn something new about him. You love him. Never stopped since he was a baby, even if you don't know who he is now." That time, Gabi was the one to reach across the table, covering Rio's hands with her own. </p><p>"He is a good man. And once he can work through some of this trauma, I know he will prove that to you."</p><p>She was being so sincere that it almost hurt Rio to hear the blind hope in her voice. She told Rio it was there, but she seemed to convinced. </p><p>Softly, Rio's thumbs rubbed at the backs of her hands.</p><p>"He already has."</p><p> </p><p align="center"><b><u>Agatha.</u></b></p><p><em>Breathe, idiot.</em></p><p>Breathing was important, yes, and it would likely help temper the crimson blush that formed on Agatha's cheeks in the twenty minutes it took her to reach the county jail. The truth was, the closer she got, the more angry she became. Maybe she <em>had</em> been stewing before, but the longer she was alone with her thoughts and the idea of being mere feet from the woman who had robbed them of a lifetime with their son, the more enraged she became.</p><p>She could ask herself all the questions she wanted -- who did Wanda think she was? What the fuck was wrong with her? How could she do this to them when they had only shown her kindness -- but it didn't matter. </p><p>Agatha would never have those answers until she could ask Wanda herself.</p><p>As she was pulling into a spot in the visitor's lot, her phone dinged from its holder on the dashboard.</p><p><em>Incoming Message From: Boog.</em></p><p>Alright, perhaps she should have left some kind of note. That became more apparent when she opened the message itself.</p><p><b>Boog:</b> Momma? Where did you go? Are<br/>you okay? What happened? Is mom<br/>okay?</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Agatha had been too caught up in her own thoughts to think clearly in the moment; she snuck out to avoid Dani's interrogation, but she forgot to shoot a text to let her know nothing was on fire.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>Everything is fine, Danica. I just<br/>ran an errand. Mom is still having <br/>coffee with Gabi as far as I know. I<br/>will be back ASAP. Promise. I love <br/>you.</p><p>Was it a shit move to lie to your kid when such heavy things were going on? Probably, but Agatha didn't have the time to sit in that parking lot and argue with her daughter about the questionable decisions she was choosing to make.</p><p>In her defense, she'd done nothing but wait. It had been a topic of conversation between herself and Rio and they agreed she deserved to go and say what she had to say, but they hadn't settled on a right time. </p><p>Agatha was tired of waiting to settle.</p><p>She wanted action.</p><p>As she climbed out of the car, her phone dinged in her hand again and she glanced down to read Dani's response.</p><p><b>Boog:</b><em> </em>Okay. I love you too.</p><p>Agatha knew she was upset; Dani didn't like being left in the dark and she was smart enough to recognize when it was happening. She had long since picked up on the tells her mothers had, the things that gave them away, and she knew if Agatha had slipped out without a word, it was for a reason.</p><p>But this was something Agatha needed to do and she did not need anyone, her daughter included, trying to stop her.</p><p>Once inside, she went through the process of checking in, declaring who she was there to see, and being told where to sit as she waited. As she crossed her legs at the knee to bide her time, she began to subconsciously pick at her cuticles, not even noticing when the one on her ring finger pinched and stung, a thin line of blood cracking through pale skin.</p><p>When she glanced down a moment later, the blood had seeped into her nailbed. </p><p>Ah, who cared. She didn't feel it anyway.</p><p>Checking her phone one last time, Agatha's head whipped up as she was called.</p><p>"Harkness-Vidal for Maximoff," the security officer voiced, his bright green eyes scanning the room. His hair was dark, jaw chiseled and strong. In a way, he almost looked like Nicky, but Agatha knew that was her anxiety-ridden mind looking for traces of her son anywhere she could find them.</p><p>She gave a nod and pushed to her feet, quiet and boiling as she followed along behind him, her eyes scanning over her surroundings and the cubicles they passed by until he indicated the one she would be occupying. When she took her seat upon the cold metal chair, there was about three solid inches of plexiglass before her and a phone wired into the wall on her right.</p><p>Agatha hadn't ever been in a prison, not to visit or for any other reason, but it didn't feel like a prison for her right then.</p><p>It felt like a fighting cage.</p><p>Maybe she wasn't going to physically be able to get her hands on Wanda, but she was almost certain she had enough to say that would make her feel even worse. Agatha's tongue was sharp, and her mind was vast and filled with too many pointed thoughts to not use them as weapons against the woman who ruined her life and the lives of her family.</p><p>Everyone under their roof had mostly kept their cool. Rio cried sometimes and Dani asked to be left alone, but over all, they came together to push forward. Agatha, most of all, wore a placid exterior around her loved ones, but she never stopped thinking.</p><p>She always thought of what Wanda could have been doing for two and a half decades with their son. She thought about him, his relationship, how he had someone who loved him enough to reach out to a family he was probably terrified of. She thought about Wanda's motives, her reasoning. She thought about how unfair it was how it all played out.</p><p>Wanda could have talked to them, could have asked for help. Sure, she had still been new to their world, but they would have still tried to help improve her life in any way they could. They trusted her enough to leave her alone with their son.</p><p>And she hadn't just broken that trust, she'd used every shard to stab them for twenty-five excruciating years.</p><p>Agatha merely <em>heard</em> a door on the other side of the room click open and in she shuffled, guided by a security guard a good foot taller than she was.</p><p>Wanda Fucking Maximoff.</p><p>He placed her carefully in the seat and leaned over her, clicking her cuffs into place on a metal loop in front of her. Once secure, he unlocked the one on her left side so she would have access to the phone. The only thing was, when he walked away, she didn't reach for it.</p><p>No, those piercing green eyes just stared right back at Agatha.</p><p>Wanda looked defiant, like she did <em>not</em> want to be sitting there, even entertaining the idea of picking up that phone to let Agatha say her peace.</p><p>But that was her right.</p><p>Wanda seemed to know it as Agatha stared right back at her, teeth grinding as she clenched her jaw. </p><p>Slowly, Wanda raised a thin and bony hand, plucking the phone from its cradle on the wall. Following suit, Agatha did the same, though she used a little more force. Once both phones were pressed to an ear, the staring match resumed.</p><p>Agatha had given this moment <em>a lot</em> of thought. She thought about screaming, about yelling, about telling Wanda to fuck all the way off the face of the planet. Every single thought possible about that moment had crossed her mind and yet, she did none of those things. Instead, she calmly pressed her lips together, never once diverting her blue gaze as it burned hot with her ire.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>It was the only word that left her lips, but it barely phased the woman on the other side of the glass. Wanda merely blinked at her, almost as if she did not understand the question. She wasn't under sedation, didn't have to be dulled by drugs and yet, she looked completely dumbstruck at such a question.</p><p>The longer the silence wore on over the line, the more Agatha's blood started to boil.</p><p>She was there!</p><p>She was right fucking there!</p><p>And somehow, she <em>still</em> couldn't get the answers she <em>ached</em> for.</p><p>"Tell me, Wanda. Tell me why you fucking did it." It was gruff and low, a snarl in the shape of a demand.</p><p>Again, silence.</p><p>Again, Agatha's blood was boiling so hot it showed in the flush of every visible inch of skin.</p><p>"Fucking tell me!" she roared, leaning forward so quickly she almost slammed her face against the glass but stopped an inch short. She was tired of the bullshit, tired of the hiding and silence and not knowing.</p><p>"What do you want to hear, Agatha?" Wanda asked coldly, her Slavic accent a little heavier than Agatha remembered from all those years ago. It was probably something she used for cover that she was not immediately able to slip out of. </p><p>"The fucking truth, you bitch," Agatha clipped back in a growl. "I want to hear why you ruined our fucking <em>lives</em>, the life of <em>our son</em> for twenty-five fucking years."</p><p>At such a statement, Wanda actually looked <em>offended.</em></p><p>What fucking right did she have to be <em>OFFENDED?</em></p><p>Agatha was ready to launch the phone in her hand right through the plexiglass in front of her.</p><p>"I did not <em>ruin his life,</em>" Wanda countered sharply, her brow knitting tightly. "I gave him the best life I c--"</p><p>"You did! You ruined any fucking chance he had at knowing the two people who loved him more than you ever could! You deprived him of any chance he had to know us, to know his sister. <em>We</em> are his parents, no matter how long you hid him from us!" The side of the room around her had grown quiet, the other occupants all stilling enough to let the conversation she was having with Wanda have the air it needed to breathe.</p><p>Agatha should have been embarrassed.</p><p>She was too fucking pissed off for that.</p><p>"Just fucking give me an answer, Wanda!"</p><p>The primary emotion Agatha was aiming for was rage, but the way her voice cracked betrayed her as desperate for the reality and not what she could concoct in her own head.</p><p>As she watched, steeled and seething, Wanda leaned back as much as she was able with one wrist cuffed to the table and considered her reply. When they had first interviewed her, she never once came across as cold or calculating, but what she'd done could have been considered little else.</p><p>All Agatha wanted to know was why.</p><p>"Two months before you hired me," Wanda voiced through the phone, her chilling demeanor never fading, "I found out I could not have children. I thought it would be enough to be around them, to help me get over it. But... Nicky... He deserved better than two mothers who left their son at home with a stranger and worked countless hours. He deserved... He deserved attention and love and --"</p><p>"Fuck you," Agatha hissed into the mouthpiece, though it was a threat. "Fuck you, Wanda. We hired you because we thought you wanted to help us, not steal our fucking baby."</p><p>Agatha wanted to put her fucking chair through the glass and vault over that counter <em>so damn bad</em> it physically hurt. She wanted to punch Wanda, to choke her within and inch of her life and force her to make it right.</p><p>But it wouldn't have accomplished anything.</p><p>"He's a good b--"</p><p>"I don't care! I don't give a shit what <em>you</em> think about <em>my</em> son, Wanda. Because whoever he became, I highly doubt it was because of anything good you did for him. And now --"</p><p>"Aga --"</p><p>"No! You listen!" Agatha nearly shouter over her. "And now, he's suffering. He has to be. He won't speak to us, which is fine. But did you ever, for <em>one fucking second</em> think about what this would do to him once he found out the truth!? No! Because you're <em>selfish!</em> You don't actually give a single <em>fuck</em> about him, or you would have told him long before now and let the choice be his."</p><p>Agatha drew in a sharp breath, her anger inducing a mild light-headedness that she fought to push away. She had to remain upright; she wasn't done giving Wanda hell just yet.</p><p>"You know what? It's clear you're not going to be forthcoming or explain what the fuck's been going through that empty head of yours for a quarter of a lifetime, so you <em>will</em> hear me."</p><p>For just a moment, Agatha thought Wanda was going to hang up the phone. It was the tiniest twitch in her arm that was about to ignite Agatha's last fuse, but she did not follow through and instead held it in place.</p><p>"I cannot stop him from ever coming here to see you because I am a stranger to him. But so help me god, if he turns up here and you aren't fucking honest with him and you don't tell him that we have missed him every <em>fucking</em> day since he's been gone, I will do absolutely <em>anything and everything</em> in my power to see that your existence is every bit as miserable as you've made ours for far too fucking long. That is not threat. That's a goddamn guarantee."</p><p>Agatha was not screaming, she was not spitting the words into the phone. No, her voice was measured and cold, like a blade. She was offering a warning, one that Wanda would be wise to heed.</p><p>"You have caused him enough pain. You need to let him go."</p><p>Wanda did not speak, did not offer any kind of return. For the longest time, the two of them simply stared one another down, lips twitching on both sides of the glass in a fight to say something but neither woman found their words.</p><p>Instead, Wanda simply gave a nod and hung up the phone, leaning back to snag the attention of the security guard.</p><p>"No! I'm not finished!" Agatha shouted, but no one on the other side of the glass was listening. "Wanda! Wanda, no! Pick up the fucking phone! NO!" To punctuate her last word, a heavy hand smack loudly and cleanly to the glass, trying to bring her back but it was of no use. The security guard unlocked her cuffs from the table and lifted her to her feet, walking her away without another word spoken.</p><p>"FUCK!"</p><p>It was the loudest she'd said the word within the walls of the jail, but it wasn't the last time she said it that day.</p><p> </p><p align="center"><b><u>Nikolai.</u></b></p><p>In all honesty, Nik had lost track of the days. He knew it was the weekend, given Gabi hadn't gone to work two days in a row, but he had no clue just how many had passed since his world had been turned on its head.</p><p>What he <em>did</em> know was that he was getting nowhere by just lying in bed.</p><p>It <em>felt</em> good, <em>felt</em> like the right thing to do, mostly because he could not think of how to function otherwise, but he knew that somehow, he had to move on.</p><p>How could he when he didn't know who he actually was?</p><p>Everything Alisa instilled in him, everything she'd taught him over the years was a projection of her fear and uncertainty. She'd driven home a strong sense of paranoia for much of his childhood, and finally understanding why felt like an absolute gut-punch. She'd only ever been looking out for herself; that much had become painfully clear.</p><p>So where did it leave him?</p><p>Right then, it left him wrapped up in blankets in a bed his long term girlfriend had not slept in in weeks because he couldn't bear the thought of being close to her.</p><p>He'd barely eaten and the last time he showered was probably the week before.</p><p>It would be so fucking easy to do more of the same, more of just laying around and ruminating on his own misery, but nothing worthwhile was ever fucking easy, was it?</p><p>By 11am when Gabi was still out and about, Nik had come to a conclusion.</p><p>His life was never going to be the same. That was a fact. But, if he could maybe understand <em>why</em>, it might help him rebuild with what he had left. It wasn't a promise he could make to himself, but he knew where he had to start, even if the thought made him want to vomit.</p><p>He had to talk to Wanda.</p><p>So, by 12:30 with Gabi still absent, Nik had managed to dress himself -- terribly in joggers and a too-large sweatshirt -- and shove down a few crackers in an attempt to settle his stomach. Feeling a small pool of resolve beginning to well within him, he caught the first train to Newark and drowned most of the trip out with heavy metal in his headphones as he travelled.</p><p>Climbing out of the Uber that rolled to a stop in front of the Essex County Jail, he had no idea what awaited him within those walls, but he was tired of waiting to find out.</p><p>He climbed the stairs and passed through the front doors, knowing he needed to check in first. As he headed through the lobby, his eyes lifted to take in the sight of a woman storming out from the back, her cheeks pure scarlet and her outfit black from head to toe. Her wild sandy brown hair with grey roots blew haphazardly behind her and she was clearly angry with whatever had just transpired.</p><p>And then Nik saw her eyes.</p><p>They connected with his as the woman went to blow by him and something in him <em>knew</em> who she was. He'd seen her photos on google, had read up on her prestigious career in neuroscience. </p><p>He was staring into the eyes of Agatha Harkness-Vidal, his mother.</p><p>And he chose not to say a word.</p><p>If she recognized him, she did too.</p><p>As she exited the lobby and made her way outside, Nik was almost too fucking thankful for it.</p><p>Before she made it, he heard the soft <em>"Fuck"</em> as it fell from her lips.</p><p> </p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Agatha.</u></b></p><p>Fuck. <em>Fuck. FUCK. FUCK!</em></p><p>The moment Agatha pushed her way through the glass front doors of the jail, something in her completely snapped. There was not a singular thought racing through her brain outside of her need to get to her car.</p><p>In a dead sprint, she tore across the lot and spotted her destination, but as she reached it, she bypassed the car completely to throw up just on the other side of the trunk, vomit splattering haphazardly on the pavement at her feet.</p><p>No. No no no no no. No fucking way.</p><p>When Agatha first arrived, she'd sworn to herself that she was just <em>looking</em> for Nicky in other people. When she was leaving, she hadn't been looking, but she spotted him anyway. It wasn't just picking out some of his features on the young man that looked like he hadn't slept in days, it was <em>him.</em></p><p>Agatha spent <em>hours</em> pouring over those online photos, even though she knew she shouldn't. Fixating would never solve their problems, but just seeing his face on a screen was enough to offer her some modicum of hope to hold onto. It was something that tethered her to the reality where he was still alive, even if she might never get to know him. Him being alive, even after all that time, was the most important thing.</p><p>Seeing him in the flesh hit her in every way imaginable, pain ripping throughout every inch of her being. It was an ache, a pull, and absolute burning need to simply reach out to him and wrap him in her arms.</p><p>But they were strangers.</p><p>He didn't know her.</p><p>And she didn't know him.</p><p>Breaching his sense of safety in those moments was simply not an option.</p><p>For as selfish as Agatha wanted to be in those fleeting seconds, she couldn't do it. She couldn't put her own needs above her son's no matter how severe the pain was upon seeing him. She <em>wanted</em> him in her life.</p><p>The way to get him there was not to assert herself into his.</p><p>By the time her retching stopped, Agatha knew she needed to get home. She had zero fucking clue how she was going to manage as much with her hands shaking so violently, but she needed to. She needed to get in the car, drink some of the water in the cupholder, drive herself to the house, paint on the best damn facade she could manage to stave off any unwanted inquiries from Dani, and collapse into her big bed until her wife inevitably came home.</p><p>She needed to do all of things, and she did start the process, but as she recapped the water bottle, Agatha could do none of them as her eyes began to fill and overflow with tears. They were hot and fast as they poured down her cheeks and both hands raised to slam against the steering wheel.</p><p>How had this happened?</p><p>How had her life gotten this far away from her?</p><p>The answer, in her mind, was simple, really.</p><p>She'd been stupid enough to trust someone.</p><p>Not leaving Dani alone throughout her child only asserted such a fact to her, a proof that <em>they</em> and <em>they alone</em> were the only people who could protect their child. Being stupid enough to think anyone in the world had good intentions burned them once; neither herself nor Rio would ever let it happen again. Sure, Dani was grown now and the rules were different, but the mission remained the same.</p><p>Protect at all costs.</p><p>But with Nicky <em>right fucking there</em> Agatha could not protect him in the least. She could not save him, could not take away his pain, could not tell him everything would be okay.</p><p>It wasn't her place.</p><p>But, with him walking in to most likely see Wanda, Agatha realized that he actually had <em>no one</em> in that place in his life.</p><p>The only person that <em>might</em> have been able to do those things was currently sitting with Agatha's wife in a cafe a good twenty minutes away. Considering, it seemed as though she reached out because he was not allowing even that.</p><p>It was fucked, to put it plainly.</p><p>Every single bit of what had happened to them was t-totally fucked and there was never going to be any repairing it without extensive amounts of time. But Agatha didn't want time. She wanted her son. </p><p>She wanted to march back into that jail, hand over a business card, and march right back out.</p><p>But she couldn't.</p><p>No matter how deeply she yearned for it to be her reality, her muscles knew better. She was immobile, stuck in her car in the parking lot while sad sobs squeaked out of her and tears streamed helplessly down her cheeks. She knew, in those long and excruciating moments, that she loved her son more than could ever possibly make sense. Because of that, she was not going to make his life any harder.</p><p>With several steadying breaths, Agatha pressed the button on the dash and started the car, taking her time in making it back to the house by slinking around backroads until she found herself ready enough to face the scrutiny of her daughter. </p><p>As predicted, Dani was seated in the lounger in the front room, head head snapping to attention as Agatha breezed through the door and closed it behind her. Before she even finished slipping her shoes off, her daughter was on the offensive, leaping to her feet and meeting her where she stood.</p><p>"Is everything okay?" It was the same thing she asked in the text, and it was the second time Agatha was going to have to lie to her.</p><p>She wanted to scream it, to sob it: <em>I saw your brother!</em></p><p>What good would it have done? What would it have accomplished?</p><p>"Everything's fine. Just had to run to the hospital to sign something I forgot about."</p><p>God.</p><p>Even as it left her lips, Agatha fucking <em>hated</em> lying to Dani. It was necessary, she told herself, simply because things were so fragile. It hurt <em>her</em> to experience it; she couldn't fathom the idea of telling her daughter and watching whatever emotions wrote themselves on her face as she imagined what it must have felt like. Things were a fucking struggle as it was; adding more onto Dani's plate when she seemed to be the only one truly holding it together just felt cruel.</p><p>"Momma," Dani deadpanned, staring down at Agatha with a blank expression on her face.</p><p>Fuck if Agatha didn't want to crack.</p><p>She couldn't. She just couldn't. Not until Rio came home with hopefully better news than what she had dragged in with her.</p><p>"Danica, baby," Agatha soothed, reaching up to cup one of Dani's cheeks in her palm. "I'm okay. I promise. But I'm pretty tired, so I think I'm going to lay down for a bit. Tell mom it's okay to wake me up when she gets back. I want to hear all about it."</p><p>The look in Dani's eyes all but shouted her doubt. She knew, looking right into Agatha, she was being lied to. She knew Agatha was hiding something from her and for the briefest moment, Agatha was almost <em>convinced</em> she would keep fighting her on it.</p><p>Thankfully, she did not.</p><p>Instead, she slipped out of the light hold and stepped forward, wrapping her arms tightly around Agatha's neck. For the tenth time that day, Agatha almost shattered. </p><p>Her little spat with Wanda hadn't gone anywhere, really, other than a promise that she was thankful she'd made, even retroactively. With her saying as much and Nicky walking in right as she was walking out? Hopefully, the sound of her hard and cutting voice was still fresh in Wanda's mind enough to make her heed the warning.</p><p>But Agatha wouldn't know. She might never know. </p><p>All she knew was Nicky had walked in there to sit across from Wanda and that conversation was something she would never be privy to. And somehow, uselessly, she stood in the foyer of her own home wrapped in the arms of her beautiful and emotionally intelligent twenty-one year old who kept promising everything was going to be alright. </p><p>Agatha <em>wanted</em> to believe her.</p><p>But wanting something and being able to do it were two completely different things.</p><p>"I love you, kiddo," Agatha murmured softly, nuzzling a little into the side of Dani's head as she clung a little tighter than she meant to.</p><p>"I know," Dani managed in a croak. "But if you squeeze me any harder, you're gonna break a rib."</p><p>With a soft chuckle, Agatha's hold loosened and she took a step back, holding her daughter at arm's length to get a good look at her.</p><p>Dani was... She was the best of them.</p><p>She was the resolute one, the one who seemed to be soldiering on and shouldering the weight of everyone else's grief. It wasn't a fair position for her to be in by any means, but Agatha was trying to find recovery enough to lift some of her burden. She was being so strong, being so steadfast, and she was the youngest of the three of them.</p><p>Agatha understood it, in some ways; for Dani, she'd never had the chance to meet her brother. She hadn't touched him or held him or heard his soft giggle, not the way Agatha and Rio once did. She knew who he was, knew what he symbolized, and knew that what happened to him had ripped holes in her parents, ones likely to never heal.</p><p>Then, the hope peeked over the horizon. </p><p>He wasn't just some story to Dani, not anymore. He was a real, grown man who had been living scarily close to her own apartment in the city, a mere cab ride away. He was someone that looked like her, someone she had always tried to picture but always fell short.</p><p>It might have <em>seemed</em> so easy for her to take it all as it came, but Agatha knew the truth about her daughter and how she worked. Dani would take it all on and do so out of the pureness of her own heart for as long as she could.</p><p>When she inevitably returned home, that was when she would fall apart.</p><p>Agatha hated Dani's way of dealing with things, mostly because she knew she actively hid her anguish sometimes, but she also respected it. She had to, didn't she?</p><p>It was <em>exactly</em> what she was doing right then.</p><p>"You are my sunshine," Agatha told her.</p><p>In response, a warm and genuine smile filled Dani's face, even if it did not quite touch her eyes.</p><p>"My only sunshine, momma. Go, take your nap. I'll be in the basement."</p><p>It was a concession, but Agatha read it for what it was. As much as she needed the time to process her time out of the house, Dani needed her alone time, too. It was clear she knew there was more going on than Agatha dared to tell her, but -- much like Agatha had with Nicky -- seemed to understand the time for pushing on those sore spots hadn't quite arrived.</p><p>"Will do. Wake me up if you need anything. I love you." She placed a kiss to Dani's cheek and gave her arm a soft squeeze before heading up the stairs and down the hall to the bedroom. Once inside, she closed the door most of the way and stripped out of her blouse and jeans, trading them in for a pair of boxer shorts and a loose t-shirt, though she paid no mind to what shirt it actually was.</p><p>Although she was aware it would likely not be much longer, Agatha had <em>really</em> been hoping for the sight of her wife when she walked in the door. She could have texted Rio to see where she was, but the thought completely slipped her mind upon seeing their boy. It was something she likely <em>would</em> have done, had that not happened.</p><p>So instead of bothering her while presumably still out with Gabi, Agatha crawled into bed and grabbed for one of Rio's pillows, hugging it tightly to her chest as she buried her face into it.</p><p>And then, she let herself <em>really</em> cry.</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><b><u>Rio.</u></b></p><p>When Rio illuminated her phone to check the time and for any messages she might have missed in her attention to all Gabi had to tell her, the last thing she expected was for it to be almost one in the afternoon.</p><p>They'd been posted at that cafe for almost three and a half hours, just... talking.</p><p>Although she received far more than she could have ever hoped for about Nicky, realizing their meeting needed to come to an end hit Rio like a stack of bricks being swung around in a pillowcase, right in the stomach.</p><p>"I didn't realize how late it was," she voiced, lifting her head to take a look at the woman across from her, checking her phone as well. </p><p>"Oh shit. I really should go --"</p><p>"No, no. I know. it's okay. I guess we just... Lost track of time." It was an honest sentiment, but Rio bit back the part where she wanted to ask for more of it. She wanted to ask if they could meet again, if they could talk more but she realized what she had in her hands now, it was still a gift. It was <em>way</em> more than she had when she walked through those doors and posted herself at that little corner both.</p><p>"I..." Gabi started, her eyes dropping into her empty mug. "I can't promise that I can do this again. And I can't say that I think keeping in active contact would be the best idea, but..."</p><p>Rio knew she was right, even if she hated it.</p><p>However, there was a very obvious 'but' tacked onto the end of her words.</p><p>"But?" she parroted quietly, hopeful.</p><p>"But if anything changes, or things get worse... I promise I will let you know. I..." Gabi stopped, her lips worrying against one another for a moment in thought. "It's not my goal to betray him, and I don't ever want him to get that idea. I just... You clearly love him. You deserved to have <em>something</em> of him to hold onto, even if it's just my perception of the amazing man he is."</p><p>Of course Rio wished it could be more, but Gabi had given her a gift. Hell, she'd given all three of them a gift. They could theorize and hypothesize all day long about what his life was like, who he had become in the years of his absence, but <em>nothing</em> they could have concocted would have been anywhere close to the truth.</p><p>The truth was, he was a gentle soul. He chatted up strangers for fun because he liked it when they smiled. He donated hundreds of dollars worth of toys at Christmastime. He volunteered twice a month at the local shelter serving meals. He loved his girlfriend when his life wasn't falling apart. He had a good life, was a good person.</p><p>Now, he was just hurting.</p><p>"I can't tell you what it means to all three of us, truly," Rio offered as she pushed off the table and onto her feet. "If it's okay, I'd like to hug you again before we leave."</p><p>The look on Gabi's face went from resolved to broken in the blink of an eye.</p><p>It was clear she hadn't been entirely sure of what their meeting would bring, but she was now staring at the reality of what it did for Rio. It <em>did </em>give her hope. It <em>did</em> make her feel like there could come a day when their son decided he wanted them to be a part of his life. There was no definitive date, no way of actually knowing, but the possibility still dangled in front of her like a victory just out of reach.</p><p>Without a word, the younger woman stepped forward and wrapped Rio in her arms, hugging her tightly. In some ways, it almost felt like the kind of strong and warming hug Dani would give, but in others, Rio could feel as Gabi clung to her for those last few seconds just how desperate for a resolution she truly was.</p><p>They all wanted a happy ending, an ending where Nicholas -- Nikolai, whatever name he chose -- was able to accept his past and embrace what future they could give him.</p><p>Nicky had four women who loved him impossibly so, even if he'd never met three of them. The one he knew, she was doing everything she could to facilitate something better, something more than what they were all currently stuck with solely because she <em>loved</em> him and could see what he would not allow himself to have with an objective perspective.</p><p>As Rio pulled back, she pulled her bag over her shoulder and turned to the woman before her, offering the kindest smile she could muster.</p><p>"Thank you, Gabi. Seriously. What you did... It took guts. But... You've offered me so, so much of him. And I..." Her lip quivered and her eyes stung with tears she did not cry and instead wiped off her lids with a quick thumb. "Anything you need, please do reach out. We are always here for you, whatever you need."</p><p>Maybe it was stupid; Rio knew she shouldn't make such promises, but how could she not? How could she not at least <em>try </em>to give something back to someone who had given her so much?</p><p>"Thank you, too. I... I think I needed this to remind myself that everything's going to be alright, some day."</p><p>The way she said those last two words, Rio felt them very acutely in her chest. It was sharp and it stung, but she knew Gabi was right.</p><p>All their lives were, at that point, was one giant waiting game.</p><p>Every single one of them had no choice but to play it.</p><p>"Some day," she echoed sadly, though the ghost of a smile played at her lips. "Until that day, you have my number. Have a good rest of your day, sweetheart." Rio gave her one last soft pat to the shoulder before Gabi offered a nod and made her exit. For the longest moment, Rio simply stood in place with one hand clutching at the strap of her bag as she watched her disappear into the throngs of foot traffic on the busy city sidewalk.</p><p>After a beat too long, she finally remembered where she was and where she had to go; home. She needed to see Agatha, to hold her as she relayed every bit of information Gabi had bestowed upon her.</p><p>It was a blessing, one she couldn't wait to share.</p><p>When she arrived home, then, to the sound of violin coming from the basement and neither her wife nor daughter present, something didn't feel right.</p><p>It wasn't so much that Rio cared whether or not anyone was there to welcome her home, but to know Dani was diving into music and Agatha was like hiding in their bedroom, that felt...</p><p>Ominous.</p><p>Shedding her shoes before taking the stairs slowly two at a time, Rio was a little uneasy as she nudged the bedroom door open to find Agatha lying on the bed, her back to the door, and a pillow clutched to her chest.</p><p>And she was shaking.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>What could have happened in four hours to leave Agatha Harkness-Vidal -- of all people -- in a crying heap in the middle of the day?</p><p>Without a word, Rio shed her shirt and jeans, climbing easily beneath the comforter atop the bed to slide in behind her wife, a strong arm hooking around her from behind in a tight embrace.</p><p>"My love," Rio breathed softly in alarm, her forehead creased with her worry. "What's going on?"</p><p>When Agatha did nothing but start to cry harder, what was concern slowly began to twist into panic.</p><p>What the fuck had done this to her?</p><p>With a careful hand, Rio reached up to move some of Agatha's hair away from her face, leaning over her to kiss at wet cheeks. This had happened very seldom throughout the course of their relationship and as such, Rio knew something had happened, something severe that pushed her to this point.</p><p>"Breathe, baby," Rio requested, kissing more of the wet skin on Agatha's face. "I need you to breathe and tell me what's gotten you so upset." She knew with the state Agatha was in, it was a big ask, but she couldn't help if she had no clue where to begin.</p><p>God damnit. Everyone was falling apart left and right.</p><p>How were any of them going to stay afloat at this rate?</p><p>It took a few additional minutes of coaxing and another good twenty light kisses, but eventually Agatha's breathing slowed and her sniffling decreased as a partial sense of calm settled into her. Rio never let go, never stopped showering her in gentle and quiet love to help her get to the other side of her struggle.</p><p>"Can you tell me what happened, Agatha?" Rio requested in a whisper into the back of Agatha's neck as she settled on the pillow beneath her.</p><p>"Rio, I..." she began, but her voice broke and shattered, leaving her sniffling again.</p><p>"You can tell me, Agatha. It's okay. I love you."</p><p>Rio meant it, but Agatha seemed to disintegrate again, crumbling in her hold.</p><p>"I saw him!" she cried, shoving her face into the pillow below them, her sobs buried in Egyptian cotton and down feathers.</p><p>She saw him?</p><p>She saw who?</p><p>Rio's lips parted and just as she started to ask, she realized exactly who Agatha was referring to.</p><p>"You saw Nicky?" </p><p>Her head whipped off the pillow and she pushed herself up, looking over Agatha's shoulder despite the way Agatha was still hiding her face. When she continued to sob but nodded her head, Rio felt as though a hot coal had been dropped down her throat.</p><p>"Agatha, what do you <em>mean</em>? <em>Where</em> did you see him?!"</p><p>Getting immediate answers was unlikely, especially given the way Agatha's body continued to rack with her stifled crying. When she settled a few moments later and finally rolled to her back to look her wife in the eyes, Rio understood why.</p><p>"At the jail. When I went to see Wanda."</p><p>WHEN SHE WENT TO DO <em>WHAT?</em></p><p>Rio loved her wife. More than anything in the entire fucking world, Rio loved her wife.</p><p>That, however, did not mean that her wife was not capable of making poorly-thought-out choices, as she had seemingly committed to that morning. Rio wanted to be angry, wanted to ask what the fuck she was thinking but...</p><p>She already knew the truth.</p><p>That truth coupled with the painstaking look on Agatha's face told her she couldn't.</p><p>Although she was certain her cheeks had surely flushed with emotion, Rio took in a slow breath as she tried to calm herself and lower her blood pressure. </p><p>"And why, my love, did you do that without talking to me first?" It wasn't harsh or demanding; it was merely a request for knowledge, for understanding. Rio just wanted to <em>understand</em> what on earth could possibly compel her wife to make such a reckless choice. Clearly, there had been more than one repercussion that reared its head already.</p><p>Agatha's silence spoke for her.</p><p>She didn't actually know, and Rio understood that much. They were all floundering, doing what they could to grasp onto anything that would keep their heads above water, but seeing Wanda alone was a choice they <em>both</em> knew would only hurt her.</p><p>"I was ti-tired of waiting," Agatha finally returned, her voice laced with shame.</p><p>That, Rio could understand, maybe even more after her morning spent with Gabi. Rio was out and about getting some form of answers while Agatha had been left at home to sit on her hands and wait to hear from her. Somewhere deep down, Rio had been banking on Dani's presence keeping her distracted, but it seemed as though it hadn't worked as she hoped it might.</p><p>"I know, baby," Rio breathed at her, leaning in to place the softest kiss to her cheek. A hand raised, her thumb brushing at Agatha's cheek tenderly as she considered her next question carefully. "Do you... Do you want to tell me about it first? And then we can save the good parts for after?"</p><p>With watery eyes and a strong down-turn of her lips, Agatha gave the most pathetic nod Rio was sure she'd ever witnessed from her.</p><p>Before Rio moved to position herself curled against Agatha's side, the hand brushing her cheek moved to cup it lovingly as she placed a soft kiss to her lips. Once settled with her head on Agatha's chest, Rio picked up her hand and threaded their fingers together.</p><p>"Tell me, my love."</p><p> </p><p align="center"><u><b>Dani.</b></u></p><p>If there was one thing Danica Harkness-Vidal had learned how to do early on in her life, it was listen for the front door, no matter where she was. Even over the sound of her un-amped violin, she knew what it sounded like.</p><p>When she heard it click overhead no more than half an hour after Agatha came home, she knew Rio was home too.</p><p>Hoping to catch her before she headed up the stairs, Dani stowed her violin and climbed the stairs from the basement, hopeful she could get at least a nibble or two out of her mom about how her morning went. </p><p>When she reached the ground floor and there was no Rio to be found, something in Dani's middle sank. It wasn't illogical for her mom to have gone upstairs, especially with no one else out in the open up on her arrival, but something about it gnawed at the deepest parts of her. It was this dull burn, an ache that ate away more and more of her stability and mental fortitude.</p><p>Realistically, Dani knew they were living a nightmare. </p><p>They were living a reality where consequences of actions long since past finally surfaced. </p><p>That was where the true struggle was, Dani believed.</p><p>This woman had committed an atrocity against her mothers, had wounded them irreparably for life, and with her behind bars the theory was that everything should just be... good again.</p><p>But that was a fairy tale. It was a myth where no party was phased and everyone lived happily ever after. In real life, that was <em>never</em> how things would work out, and it was especially true for everyone involved in the mess they found themselves in. That woman's actions didn't have consequences that effected only her. The consequences of the choice she'd made to kidnap Nicky were hitting them all at full force. </p><p>They hit her moms because they were now aware their son was within driving distance and yet, they still could not go to him.</p><p>They were hitting Gabi, clearly, who apparently felt so desolate and hopeless that she chose to go against Nicky's wishes and contact his real parents.</p><p>They were hitting him -- probably the most -- to a point where he was isolating those that loved him, let alone people he didn't know that loved him as well. While not in his shoes, Dani had always grown up in the shadow of what he could have been. </p><p>Maybe, she wondered, there had even been a time or two she'd walked in it while living in the city and had no idea.</p><p>Lastly, while the wouldn't admit it for the world, those consequences were impacting her, too.</p><p>Dani was always the dependable soldier, the steadfast pillar everyone could always lean against. In some aspects, she knew feeling such a way in regards to her parents was not the healthiest, but she also understood what they'd gone through before she was even born, and what they were going through now. If she could be the one to hold them together and tell them it was going to all be okay while they were staring down the face of adversity, then it was what she needed to do.</p><p>Quietly, Dani climbed the stairs and turned down the hall, her frown deepening at the sight of the shut door that led to her parents' room.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>That couldn't be good.</p><p>For a moment, she hesitated in her indecision.</p><p>She should go back downstairs, pick up her violin again and just play.</p><p>Or...</p><p>She could resort to immature and childish behavior because she was so tired of showing up to be shut out. She knew it was what her moms thought was the right thing to do, but she was tired of it. Wherever Agatha had gone earlier in the day, it wasn't to sign some stupid papers at the hospital. Dani was more convinced of that right then than ever.</p><p>So if her only way to get answers was to listen through the door?</p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>And so for the first ten minutes, she stood with her ear pressed to the corner where the door met the frame, straining as Agatha recounted the truth; it was every -- slightly muffled but -- unpleasant detail about her encounter with Wanda.</p><p>That hurt Dani's feelings, but she stayed planted to the floor. After an additional five minutes, she sat down.</p><p>Eavesdropping was bad. Sure, whatever.</p><p>But hearing Rio talk ten minutes later about the things she learned about Nicky?</p><p>That was fucking worth it.</p><p>That conversation wore on a little longer and Dani was certain there were parts of it she missed, but by the time she was no longer able to hear the voices inside the bedroom, she lifted herself to her feet and pulled out her phone.</p><p>Dani was the rock, always tried to be. But what happened when she was the one who needed a shore to crash upon?</p><p>She pulled up her contacts and scrolled down halfway, stopping on the name she was looking for.</p><p><em><b>Curious George.</b></em></p><p>Or, Georgina Diavallo; Dani's best friend, her next-door neighbor, and her ex-fiancée.</p><p>Although she stared at the text box for a beat too long, Dani finally managed to type out a message. </p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>Hey George. Any chance you<br/>would want to come to Newark<br/>for dinner? I could really use a friend.</p><p>By the time Dani reached her room, her phone dinged softly in her hand.</p><p><b>Curious George:</b><em> </em>Anything for you,<br/>Dan the Man. Should I bring anything?</p><p>Dani chuckled softly, punching in her reply.</p><p align="right"><b>Me:</b> As much weed as you can get<br/>your hands on, please and thanks.</p><p><b>Curious George:</b> You got it, dude. See<br/>you in a few hours. I'll text when I'm<br/>close.</p><p>Dani smiled softly to herself, not hesitating to type her response.</p><p align="right"><b>Me:</b> Thank you, ily.</p><p><b>Curious George:</b> Ilyt, Dan. Be there ASAP.</p><p>Flopping onto her bed, Dani stared at the ceiling overhead as she tried to find some way to take an emotional inventory before George showed up and she completely lost her shit. No one needed that to happen.</p><p>Yet, all Dani could really think about was the fact that her brother was, again, twenty minutes away. Only this time, he was taking on the woman who had ruined his life and the lives of many others.</p><p>And for some insane reason, the only thing she truly wanted in that moment was to be sitting next to him as he did so.</p><p> </p>

<p align="center"><u><b>Nikolai.</b></u></p><p>Not ten seconds after setting foot into the county jail, Nik knew he'd made a mistake. Seeing Agatha -- seeing one of his <em>birth</em> mothers -- felt like a haymaker straight to the chest. It was breathtaking in the worst, most excruciating ways, and while part of him knew he should have run right back out and tucked himself away in the dark reprieve of his bedroom, the other part knew he'd come too far.</p><p>When he was told he would have to wait an hour before Wanda was able to have another visitor, it would have been all too easy to just pack it up and go home.</p><p>But he couldn't.</p><p>For the first time in weeks, he was half-clean and out of bed. Even more, he was out of his apartment. Sure, he probably should have texted Gabi and let her know where he was but the idea she was out enjoying a brunch with friends or shopping with her step-sister stopped him from doing so.</p><p>She deserved to keep living, even when his world came to a screeching halt.</p><p>As much as Nik loved her, they were still two separate entities. And... Truth be told, Gabi deserved more than he was able to give her. If she could get that through spending time with the people who loved her, the thought eased some of his woes. </p><p>In some ways, in the easiest ones he could find for himself, Nik felt as though he was tied to a dock post by his wrist as an angry, fierce tide tried to pull him out to sea. The post itself was the life up to the point of no return. The sea was no return. It was uncertain and churning, chaotic and lawless. He had no map to follow, no stars to guide him through it. In his fear of being lost in the endless, he needed the tether to what he once had to hold fast.</p><p>How could it when he wasn't sure what of it was real?</p><p>In the lobby of that jail, he tried to remember what in his life was.</p><p>Gabi was real. She was the realest thing he had and he knew he needed to start showing her as much. Pushing her away, refusing to speak, it was going to pile up into every reason she could leave. Maybe, at one point in his despair, he wanted her to, but that time had long since passed. Gabi was the only thing keeping his head above water. She was <em>real.</em></p><p>His job was real. The job that was impossibly understanding in regards to his circumstances. It wasn't as though this happened on the regular; his employer understood it as a major life change and told him to take what time he needed. Without it, he felt a little aimless, but again it was something he'd done by his own choice.</p><p>His home was real. It had been his cocoon while his life fell to shambles around him and offered him somewhere to find respite. It was something he and Gabi owned together, something they'd done as a couple because it was what they wanted for their futures. It wasn't something his mother had gifted him or bestowed upon him.</p><p>His integrity was real. Nick was a good man, if not a little more in tune with his emotions than most. It was what allowed him to be the man he was, the man who cared for others and always tried to do what was right in any given situation. He had a good heart and a good head on his shoulders. That was <em>his</em> doing, not his -- not Wanda's.</p><p>His degree, his accomplishments, they were all <em>his</em>, even if the initial impact of reality left him feeling as though they were all due to her.</p><p>The life she'd given him had let him down those paths, but ultimately, Nik was the one who made the choices. </p><p>"Malikov for Maximoff?" </p><p>A quick hand swept up and plucked the pair of headphones off his head as he met the gaze of the security guard from across the room, giving a not of confirmation. He stuffed them into his hoodie pocket as he got to his feet and followed along being the guard throughout the facility.</p><p>By the time he found himself seated in a cold steel chair facing a thick wall of glass, the sense finally smacked right into him.</p><p><em>What the fuck am I doing here?</em></p><p>It seemed like a good idea to come for answers in the throes of his depression, but with all that had crossed his mind in the past hour, he suddenly realized he didn't know exactly what he wanted to say.</p><p>He'd just have to wing it.</p><p>When the door on the other side of the room clicked open and Wanda shuffled into view, something in his squeezed most painfully. It was a constraint around his heart; this woman he'd called 'mother' for so long, who he'd loved unconditionally due to that title, she was not a mother at all. She was just a woman who made a terrible choice, one that caused him to question who he even was in the world. Maybe to her, it was what it was. To him, it was every fucking waking moment.</p><p>He watched, completely stilled and slouched in his chair, as she was fastened to the table and allowed the use of one hand. The moment the security guard walked away, she used it to swipe up the phone with an undeniably bright look in her green eyes, even if it didn't touch the rest of her face.</p><p>Nik was not exactly <em>apathetic</em>, but her eagness caused his stomach to turn. He did not doubt that if his phone had been on, she would have been trying to call, but seeing it written on her face made him feel sick.</p><p>Didn't she understand what she'd done? Didn't she see, just by looking at him, what the choices she'd made had turned him into? He was but a shell of the man he was mere weeks ago, caught between wanting to cling to what he knew and wanting to get lost in the sea of everything he'd been deprived of his entire life.</p><p>He not only had a mother, but he had two. Even more, he had a <em>sister.</em> He was a big brother.</p><p>She took that from him.</p><p>Because she took him.</p><p>He stared at her, critical and silent as her eyes flickered toward the phone, encouraging him to pick it up. He wanted to, knew he needed to, but action did not immediately find him. He was trying to fortify, trying to prepare himself for anything and everything she might have to say when he knew it would likely hurt. When she glanced at it again, he finally caved and picked it up, placing it to his ear.</p><p>He knew he should have taken more time, especially since he could have predicted exactly what she would open with.</p><p>"Hi, my b--"</p><p>"Absolutely not," he barked gruffly into the phone. "That illusion is shattered. I have <em>never</em> been your boy. And you don't get to call me as much, <em>especially</em> now." His words were a low rattle through the phone, but they hit Wanda with precision.</p><p>Her back stiffened and her posture straightened a bit, wide eyes simply blinking at him.</p><p>In all of their years shared, Nik had never dared to speak to her with such malice laced in his tone. He had never dared to defy her, to challenge her, to truly stand up to her. Now, he had the right. Now, she'd given him a reason.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Nikolai, I --"</p><p>"No!" </p><p>That one was a little louder, a little more forceful. He did not follow it up, but he also did not break eye-contact with her as he stared at her through the glass.</p><p>"Then what am I to call you?" she asked lowly, though he could still hear the panic in her voice no matter how hard she tried to hide it. "The name they chose for you?"</p><p>He knew she was genuinely looking for an answer, but hearing it asked aloud felt like a battering ram against his ribcage, knocking every bit of wind right out of him. </p><p>That <em>wasn't</em> what he wanted. The problem was... He didn't know <em>what</em> he wanted.</p><p>Nikolai wasn't his name but... Neither was Nicky.</p><p>So who was he?</p><p>"You call me Nick. It doesn't matter how it's spelled. It's... That's what you can call me."</p><p>Part of him wanted to elaborate primarily for himself, to talk out why that felt like the best fit for the time being, but doing so would have allowed her to be privy to his thought process and that was something he wasn't ready for. In fact, he wasn't sure he ever would be again. Wanda had taken so much from him; he did not owe her anything more.</p><p>"Okay," she agreed quietly, scooting forward in her seat the most minute amount. There was a heavy pause between them, thick and wrought with tension, but she was brave enough to try and be the first one to speak. "How have you been?"</p><p>Her shallow question earned her a dry snip of a laugh, thin lips pulling back to show bared and sharp teeth. Was she serious? She wasn't <em>looking</em> at him enough to glean an answer to that question? He <em>knew</em> he looked like shit. Sure, his hair was clean and he had fresh clothes on, but the deep wells beneath his eyes and the gaunt arches of his cheeks spoke well enough as to how he was feeling.</p><p>"What do you think, <em>Wanda?</em>" he clipped, not missing the way she winced at the use of her real name. "I've barely gotten out of bed. My girlfriend probably thinks I hate her and she should leave me. I suddenly have three people who want to meet me and I know <em>nothing</em> about them. I --" Nick's jaw clamped shut and he sat back in her chair, eyeing her with contempt. No. She didn't get to know what he knew. She didn't get to know that he was <em>well aware</em> she'd spoken with his mother earlier in the day. </p><p>He wanted to see if she would tell him herself.</p><p>He knew she wouldn't.</p><p>"I'm miserable," he told her, using it more as an insult than something that would cause her to show him pity. "And it's because of you. Because of what you did."</p><p>The more he went on, the more Wanda seemed to tense. It was clear that she'd asserted herself into a delusion where she could talk him down, but it was not the reality of the situation. The reality was there was no talking him down; she ruined his life by being selfish twenty-five years prior. There was no way around it.</p><p>He let another silence befall them, hoping for at least an apology, but she offered not a word. Instead, he took up the mantle of driving the conversation forward, driven on by his need to know the truth.</p><p>"Can I ask you something?" He didn't actually wait for her to agree before he continued. "Why didn't you tell me when I was an adult? I mean..." He took a breath, his jaw tightening as the words seemed to ball up and catch in his throat. He was angry, irate, even, but he knew her. He knew how to handle her. If he started screaming and demanding she give him what he was asking for, it would get him nowhere. He had to be reserved, had to play his hand right.</p><p>"I get why you kept it from me as a kid. But when I moved to New York, when I became an adult... Why didn't you tell me?" </p><p>His demand was not harsh; it was a plea.</p><p>Wanda simply blinked at him, as if she hadn't understood the question.</p><p>But she did.</p><p>He knew she did.</p><p>"Seven fucking years. For seven years, you took <em>my</em> choice away. You took away <em>my</em> right to be the one to make the decision. I had a right to know, Wanda! I had a right to make the choice myself, whether or not I reached out. I... I would have. But now... Now it's like..." Oh God. Oh no. The longer he tried to talk, the more his voice started to break. He was reaching panic, he knew, but he <em>needed</em> to reign it in.</p><p>"Now, there are expectations of me. Expectations that I don't know how to meet because I can barely even figure out what my own fucking name is. And that's what <em>you</em> did to me. You took me from them, you changed my name, and you gave me the life <em>you</em> thought I should have, not the one I would have if you'd never been in the picture. <em>God,</em> I wish you'd never been in the picture."</p><p>It was harsh, but the way he was trying to ramble his way through an explanation was far from. The words themselves were not intended as weapons, even if they were anyway as they struck the woman across from him, piercing right into her.</p><p>"You don't mean that --"</p><p>"I do!" he cut in, not allowing her to speak. This was <em>his</em> time. "I don't know who I'd be if they'd been the ones to raise me, and that's the fucking problem, isn't it? I don't know what school I would have gone to, or how many friends I would have had. I don't know what teachers I would have liked, or how excited my little sister would have been at each of my graduations. I don't know any of it because <em>you</em> never let it happen. And why?! For what?! What do you have to show for it, right now, in this moment?!"</p><p>His intent was loud, but his voice had grown louder. </p><p>"Can't you just tell me?! Can't you just tell <em>me,</em> of all fucking people?!"</p><p>His cry was pained and broken, his eyes filling with confused and angry tears. He doubted she would tell him the truth, but of everyone involved, didn't he deserve it the most?</p><p>"P-please. Just... just tell me why."</p><p>The display before her was raw and emotional, obvious in the way Wanda slinked into her chair as she tried to shrink herself down, to try and shirk off the weight of what Nick was thrusting upon her.</p><p>She was silent but he could not understand why. Was she cooking up another lie? Was she going to say she had to leave? Was she going to run away like the coward he was realizing she was?</p><p>Whatever it was she was trying to do, he'd had enough. If she wasn't going to give <em>him</em> the answers he was seeking, there was no point in staying. He sat up, glancing toward the cradle on the wall as he started to lower the phone. Somehow, he knew it was exactly what might get her to speak, if she was ever going to.</p><p>"I didn't want to be alone."</p><p>It was so small, probably the smallest Nick ever heard her be.</p><p>"And so I took you to make sure I wouldn't be."</p><p>Somehow, he wasn't sure if it was better than not knowing the truth at all.</p><p>She was a selfish creature. She was someone who had committed an atrocity to serve herself, everyone else be completely damned. They were all paying for it now, in their own ways, and Nick wasn't entirely sure what to do with that. It was a known fact; he'd been aware the entire time that he was not the only one hurting throughout it all, even if his pain felt the most obvious to him.</p><p>"And how's that working out for you now?" he asked back, his voice tired and ragged. "Thanks for at least telling me the truth."</p><p>With that, he plucked the phone away from his ear and started to set it down, but the way Wanda jerked to attention caused him to hesitate. A hand flew up, a lone finger raised as if to ask him for just one more moment of his time. He shouldn't oblige her, but something in him willed it to happen anyway as he lifted the phone back to his ear.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I..." she started, clearly fumbling for the right way to say what was on her mind. "Agatha... She was here earlier."</p><p><em>Holy shit</em>, he thought, <em>she's actually being fucking honest.</em></p><p>"And?"</p><p>"And she..." Wanda sighed, seeming to stare her own resignation in the face of the man she'd stolen away all those years ago. "They never stopped looking for you. And... And I don't think they ever stopped missing you."</p><p>The sting behind his eyes was immediate and overwhelming but Nick did not let himself cry. Not again, not in front of her. It still hurt, in some bittersweet way, that the people who lost him so long ago never gave up hope that they would find him. They never stopped wishing for him.</p><p>They never stopped celebrating him every year on January 1st, his <em>real</em> birthday.</p><p>Somehow, even though he learned as much from stalking his sister on social media, hearing Wanda admit it hurt ten times more, only this time he did not have a laptop to fling across the room or a bed to burrow into. All he could do in those moments was blink at the lie of a mother before him as two hefty tears streaked down his cheeks and he hung up the phone.</p><p>She didn't get a single goodbye, not even a wave, as he rose to his feet and made his exit to call a ride and go home to his girlfriend.</p><p align="center"><b><u>Dani.</u></b></p><p><b>Curious George:</b><em> </em>I'm outside.</p><p>When Dani poked her head out into the hallway, the door to her parents' room was still shut and as she approached it, the interior still carried heavy silence. The likely scenario was as such: After the emotionally guelling and taxing conversation her moms shared it, they probably both fell asleep.</p><p>Honestly, that was fine with her.</p><p>She needed space of her own and while she loved them impossibly, she wasn't sure she could answer a 'where are you going?' without having a breakdown of her own.</p><p>Dani knew she shouldn't have sat outside their door, shouldn't have eavesdropped on their private conversation, but she needed to know. She needed to be in the loop just as much as everyone else and she was still fighting with her indignancy over the fact that Agatha had chosen to run off to the jail without her. It wasn't so much that her momma had gone alone, but rather that she lied several times throughout the process.</p><p>On the other hand, hearing her mom recount all of the incredible things she'd learned about Nicky at coffee that morning wounded her in a different way. From what she could make out, he was a smart guy, had a good job, and his girlfriend thought the world of him.  He liked music and went to raves -- <em>God,</em> what were the chances they'd been to some of the same ones? -- and liked going for runs when he needed to clear his head (which honestly left him sounding a lot like mom).</p><p>All of that information and Dani wasn't supposed to know any of it. Because <em>they </em>hadn't decided to tell her. </p><p>She'd been stubborn and invasive and while she wanted to feel bad, she couldn't.</p><p>So, she grabbed her phone and threw on a coat, quietly making her way out of the house and to the awaiting Honda Accord in front of the family home. When she climbed inside, tired blue eyes fell onto the other occupant; Dani's light, her savior, her safe place.</p><p>George was... Well, to the naked eye, she was beautiful, that much was painfully obvious. Her features were chiseled and pointed, high cheekbones and a slim nose, but there was a softness always found in her dark grey eyes that sometimes looked blue and sometimes looked green. Her lips were thick and full and often times, Dani still woke up from dreams where she got to kiss them.</p><p>The only reason she did not, in reality, was by her own choice.</p><p>Dani and George -- who majored in Music Theology -- met sophomore year and became fast friends. They quickly found a lot of common ground, shared in music taste and film taste and often went on day-long shopping trips because they could. It had been Dani's first year of real freedom even if it was her second year in college and she could not have had a better partner in crime to do it with.</p><p>By the end of sophomore year, any and all charades where they were trying to maintain neutrality were tossed to the wind and the two of them began dating.</p><p>A year later, as Junior year drew to a close, George proposed. </p><p>Surprisingly, Dani had known it was coming. Even more surprisingly, she agreed with ease. It seemed like the right thing to do at the time, the right path for her life to take but as school work and personal responsibilities came into the picture, they both knew they'd made a mistake.</p><p>It had been a hard conversation for Dani to broach, but when she discovered they both equally felt as though they'd jumped the gun?</p><p>Well, it made her believe even more that George was the woman she was meant to spend the rest of her life with. At the same time, she needed to establish priorities, which left them where they were:</p><p>Not dating, but best friends who were still in love, just smart enough to wait for graduation before venturing on a life where they were meant to be together. It also was rather convenient that they shared an apartment wall and had constant access to one another most of the time. </p><p>Well, at least until... all of <em>this</em> shit started.</p><p>They'd been in contact, of course, but George understood Dani's need to time and space to try and process everything that was so rapidly changing in her life. Now, Dani needed someone to talk to, someone who could listen and understand that while this was all about the discovery of a missing piece of their family, she was beginning to lose herself.</p><p>She was accepting her parents' lies with an indifferent smile on her face and sneaking around to get the actual truth.</p><p>That wasn't her. It wasn't who they were as a family. And yet, it was where they'd come to exist.</p><p>There, in the dim light of the setting sun, that blonde hair and those grey eyes felt like salvation.</p><p>With a quick hug over the center console, Dani pulled back to behold her best friend for the longest moment, a twinkle of appreciation flickering in her eyes.</p><p>"Thank you," she voiced softly, leaning in to place a light kiss to the other woman's cheek. "I know I haven't been party central lately, but... I really appreciate you dropping everything to be here for me. I... Well, you know."</p><p>George's smile was instant, but it did not touch her eyes.</p><p>"I do. And <em>you</em> know I'll do it again and again. Let's get something to eat."</p><p>So, she drove them into town and they did just that, grabbing a couple of burgers and fries before George took them toward greener pastures and a spot they'd spent too many nights at to count.</p><p>It was an overlook on the outside of the city, a place to behold the speckles of light both below and above when the sun disappeared and the night sky was left in its wake. They spent too many summer hours there, both romantic and not, and it was somewhere Dani often found peace.  </p><p>As they ate with only the dull sound of the radio humming on in the background, she could actually feel it find her again.</p><p>As if it were a normal Sunday night, she and George were sitting at a favorite summertime spot -- albeit in the spring -- eating their cheeseburgers and taking time to just exist together. There was no expectation, no demand. Dani asked her to be a friend and it was exactly what she chose to do. Maybe it was hard, sometimes, to act like those things didn't make her fall even harder for the woman behind the steering wheel, but Dani knew they were closing in on the finish line. In weeks, they would graduate and then, they could figure life out from there.</p><p>Until then, they could just share space while Dani built her courage to leap and George was waiting to catch her.</p><p>As they finished, the air in the car shifted and George turned in her seat. The look on her face was gentle in the light of the moon, but it tugged on Dani's heartstrings.</p><p>"You know I'm not one to ask questions when it comes to you," George started, reaching up to tuck a strand of hair behind her own ear, "but are you okay?"</p><p>That was a loaded question. An <em>incredibly</em> loaded question.</p><p>Physically, Dani was fine. None of this had actually harmed her and yet, inside that little racetrack of a mind she possessed?</p><p>She was a storm, a whipping and whirling hurricane that never seemed to lose speed. There were so many thoughts, so many feelings, so many things she simply did not know how to say out loud. If she never found a way to, though, it was going to tear her apart.</p><p>"I want to be," she answered quietly, looking out the windshield to the night sky above. "But... How do you even know what okay is when the cautionary tale you always heard as a kid actually has a face? And a fucking apartment four blocks away from ours?" Her voice wavered and broke the tiniest bit toward the end, causing George to reach for her hand.</p><p>"Babes, it sounds to me like you've been holding a lot of this in."</p><p>Ha. What a fucking understatement.</p><p>Against her wishes, Dani could feel her tears as they gathered atop her lower lids, fighting to fall.</p><p>George loved her, Dani knew that much. It was why she'd abandoned her plans to be there for Dani, why she bought dinner and drove them to a place of comfort. Because of that love, Dani knew she was in the one and only spot she could truly be honest, the one place she could find salvation from the chaos inside her head.</p><p>"I... I felt like a kid again today, sitting at my parents' bedroom door, listening to their conversation. They... Mom went to meet Nicky's girlfriend and... I thought maybe momma and I would watch a movie or find something to do, but she... She took off and went to visit the woman who took him. And I..." Dani's lip quivered as she lifted her head to look toward her best friend, the tears adding a pathetic shine to her eyes. "She saw him. She didn't speak to him, but she saw him. And I... I <em>asked </em>her what happened. She lied to me. She told me nothing was going on, fed me some bullshit about going into work. I -- Augh!" </p><p>Both of her hands flew up, cradling the entirety of her face as she exhaled a low and long groan, trying to sort through her feelings and finding herself unable.</p><p>"I get it, I do," she managed as she pulled them down and looked to George again. "They want to protect me. They always have. But I'm grown now. I'm graduating college in three weeks. I... I don't need them to fucking baby me about this. They've spent my whole life talking about him, wondering what he's up to or how he's doing. They've always talked about him like he was still alive and now that he is... They don't seem to want to talk about him at all."</p><p>She paused, tucking her lower lip between her teeth. It was unnerving, really, to say it all aloud, but she knew it was much needed. More than that, she knew it was safe with George.</p><p>"It feels... Unfair. I've been hoping for this moment just as much as they have and it feels like... I don't know. They're shutting me out? Or infantilizing me? And I just... I want to know, too. He's my brother too. And maybe it makes me sound like a spoiled brat but... I deserve to be in the loop. I've spent my whole life being the vessel for their unresolved trauma and paranoia and it's... It's fucked that they won't give me <em>this</em> part of it!"</p><p>Somewhere in the middle of that last little tirade and completely unaware of the heat on her cheeks or the tightness of her throat, Dani started to cry. </p><p>Dani didn't cry. It wasn't something she did. Sure, it happened a time here or there, but it was often something she actively fought.</p><p>In those moments, she hadn't even realized she was doing it. </p><p>As if it were nothing more than automatic reflex, George pushed up the center console and gave Dani's hip a nudge before climbing into the seat with her and pulling her into her arms.</p><p>Although her mothers had hugged her countless times since the start of the storm, there was something about the way it felt to be wrapped in George's embrace that quieted the thunder in her head. It hadn't stopped for days, driving her out of her mind, but being in her best friend's arms somehow muffled the severity.</p><p>There, being held by someone who would always love her, Dani found peace.</p><p>They stayed like that for a short while with Dani a teary mess as she cried into George's shirt until she fell asleep. Only a few minutes later, her phone dinged from its place in the door handle. Carefully, George made a play for it, already having a sense of who it was. When she saw 'Momma' above the '1 New Message' bubble, she knew a response was required.</p><p>Instead of waking the woman in her arms, George -- having known her passcode for the last two years -- unlocked her phone to see the message from Agatha.</p><p><b>Momma Bear: </b>Are you here? Did you go <br/>somewhere?</p><p>Even in those seven words, George could already feel Agatha's anxiety seeping through the screen.</p><p align="right"><b>Me:</b> Hey momma, this is G. I grabbed<br/>Dani for dinner and we came to<br/>do some stargazing but she fell <br/>asleep. I'll bring her home soon.</p><p>Almost immediately, the animated bubble at the bottom of the screen as Agatha typed her response.</p><p><b>Momma Bear:</b><em> </em>You're a good egg,<br/>Georgie. Thank you for taking care<br/>of her.</p><p>With a soft sigh, George locked the phone and squeezed Dani a little closer to her chest. </p><p> </p><p align="center"><b><u>Agatha.</u></b></p><p>After their rather emotional exchange, both Agatha and Rio had fallen asleep tangled in one another with quiet tears soaking the pillows beneath their faces. When they awoke a little after eight, it was to a completely silent house.</p><p>Rio scoured every room to no avail, returning a few moments later to announce that she was unable to find Dani.</p><p>While Agatha's initial reaction was the panic, she was very quick to remember that she had a phone and was perfectly capable of responding like any rational adult by shooting her daughter a text before she called in a search party. So, she did just that.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>Are you here? Did you go<br/>somewhere?</p><p>She took a breath and sent the message, though in the time it took for a response, she'd already started going over through the endless scenarios where she might never see her daughter again.</p><p>"My love," Rio soothed, sliding into bed to sit next to her as she handed over a bottle of water. "I'm sure she just went out for some air. Give her some time, I'm sure she'll text back."</p><p>Rio was right; she was always right, but Agatha still hated any moment in the here and now where she did not have full awareness of what was going on in her life and the lives of those she loved. Dani was a grown woman, yes, but she was still their little girl and if something ever happened to her?</p><p>Agatha feared she might not survive it.</p><p>Her phone vibrated in her hand, pulling at her attention.</p><p><b>Boog:</b> Hey momma, this is G. I grabbed<br/>Dani for dinner and we came to<br/>do some stargazing but she fell<br/>asleep. I'll bring her home soon.</p><p>"Oh," she breathed in relief, her shoulders slouching slightly.</p><p>"Oh?" came the soft question beside her.</p><p>"I didn't know George was in town. Did you?" It was a stupid thing to ask, but it tumbled out before Agatha could stop it.</p><p>"No, but it's not surprising they're together. Is Dani okay?"</p><p>Rio had a fair point; those two were usually attached at the hip, but with everything going on, Dani had obviously been trying to figure things out on her own. Apparently, her stubborn tenacity could only get her so far.</p><p>"She's fine. She fell asleep. George said she'll bring her home soon."</p><p>Quickly, she typed her response.</p><p align="right"><b>Me:</b> You're a good egg, Georgie.<br/>Thank you for taking care<br/>of her.</p><p>The moment she locked the screen, a set of nimble fingers reached out and plucked the phone from her fingers before Rio leaned across her to set it on the nightstand.</p><p>"What are you doing?" Agatha questioned softly, catching Rio's gaze as she settled back into her spot.</p><p>"Well," Rio began quietly, her hand raising to cradle Agatha's jaw. "It's been a very long time since I looked my wife in the eyes and told her I loved her, so..." She paused, their gazes locking as she took the lightest of kisses. "I love you. And while I admittedly don't feel up to sex... I would really like it if you would let me kiss you for a little while."</p><p>For just a moment, Agatha thought she was going to cry for the third time that day.</p><p>The lot of them, they'd been through hell. It was hard, dealing with what they were and still trying to live a normal life. It was even harder to act like it wasn't eating them up and trying to spit them back out. They were all wringer-thin to a point where Agatha had not even stopped to consider just how much strain the situation was putting on every facet of her life.</p><p>But Rio noticed.</p><p>She always noticed.</p><p>"That's funny," Agatha whispered, taking a light kiss of her own. "<em>I</em> would really like it if <em>you</em> would kiss me for a little while."</p><p>The most tender smile curled Rio's lips, one that caused Agatha's heart to skip a beat or two in her chest.</p><p>"I'd love nothing more. Well, other than you, of course."</p><p> </p>

<p align="center"><strong><u>Gabi.</u> </strong></p><p>After departing the cafe and managing to keep her trip to the market short, Gabi made her way home and was not at all surprised to find the house quiet. If anything, she would have surprised it it <em>wasn't</em> quiet.</p><p>She took her time stowing the items she'd brought home with her and put a kettle on for tea. If she could be convincing enough, she might be able to get Nik to have a cup. </p><p>That was wishful thinking and she knew it. </p><p>Nothing she chose to do was going to get him out of bed.</p><p>Well, she was half right on that.</p><p>Gabi headed for their bedroom with every intent of changing her clothes and curling up on the couch, but she was struck the moment she walked through the doorway and her eyes fell on their bed.</p><p>Their empty bed.</p><p>Their empty bed where her boyfriend was not wrapped tightly in their comforter and his own misery.</p><p>Immediately, panic filled every inch of her being as she began to scour their home in search of him. He obviously was not in the front room, not in the bedroom, and he was not in their bathroom. She even checked the office; empty. However, something about the bathroom caught her attention.</p><p>The boxers and t-shirt he'd been wearing for three days were in a pile on the ground.</p><p>Curiously, she made her way to the closet and was genuinely surprised to smell the faint leftover traces of his cologne.</p><p>He was out of the house.</p><p>That was good.</p><p>That was <em>amazing,</em> actually.</p><p>What was not so amazing was knowing he was out of the house and having absolutely no clue where he had gone.</p><p>If she had to guess, though, she probably could.</p><p>In the same way she was trying to make things better in some way by going to the cafe to meet Rio, she was realizing very quickly that he was reaching the same conclusions on the opposite end of the spectrum. He spent his days laying in bed, mourning a life that felt like an illusion, and it didn't accomplish anything. He wasn't healing, wasn't taking steps toward figuring out what his new life was going to look like. He was punishing everyone else in his life because he was too lost in himself to know which end was up.</p><p>Gabi would never fault him for that.</p><p>Everything he knew, <em>everything</em>, was a lie. That was a trauma she knew could not be funneled into words, something Nik might never be able to articulate. It was pain and grief and confusion all wrapped up into one chaotic package that seemed to have blown up right in his hands.</p><p>So, if he felt the need to pull himself out of bed to look into the eyes of the person that spent a quarter of his life lying to him, who was she to be upset?</p><p>Nik needed closure. More than that, he needed the ability to let go of what happened to him so he could focus on a way to move forward. Gabi knew -- even more after her morning spent with Rio -- that every single person missing him would have done any damn thing in their power to take his pain away. He had two mothers who relentlessly loved any and every version of him. He had a little sister who missed him without ever meeting him.</p><p>He had an entire life waiting for him, one he just needed to decide he wanted bad enough.</p><p>That was going to be a decision that could only be made by Nik. Whatever he chose, she would support him, but if they went the rest of their lives and he chose not to embrace what he was missing, it would surely kill her.</p><p>Rio was so incredibly kind in the face of so much devastation. Gabi knew she'd fucked up a couple of times in comparing them, but for as much as it seemed to hurt the other woman, she liked it, too. She explained as much, but some part of Gabi couldn't help but feel guilty. She was giving a mother glimpses of a son she didn't know by being told she just had to look in a mirror. It was a heavy sentiment, but it clearly meant a lot to her.</p><p>With hopes that Nik would find his way home without her added pressure, she undressed and showered, pulling on one of his hoodies and a pair of leggings once out. She fixed herself a cup of the chicken chili she'd made a couple days before and ate at the table in silence, fighting her urge to text her boyfriend by telling herself everything would be fine.</p><p>After her meal, Gabi made her way to the couch and flipped the television on to continue waiting.</p><p>She didn't have to wait long.</p><p>Her phone sounded quietly in her lap and her focus snapped to it, the incoming message popping up on the screen.</p><p><em>From: Nik</em></p><p>Her heart stuttered her in chest and she rushed to open it, thankful to see what was inside.</p><p><b>Nik:</b><em> </em>I'm on my way home. I <br/>stopped at Mario's and got a<br/>piece of their tiramisu.</p><p>Gabi paused in her reading to take a moment of reverence.</p><p>He had been miserable for weeks and on the one occasion he braved to leave the house, he was coming back with a gift. It was something he knew she loved, something he knew would say 'I'm Sorry' better than he could for the time being.</p><p><b>Nik:</b> I went to see Wanda. It...<br/>We'll talk about it when I get<br/>home. I love you, Gabriela.</p><p>By the time she finished reading, the tears were begging to overflow. </p><p>She let them. </p><p>She blinked them out, letting them roll cleanly and heavily down her cheeks. All of this was no, there was no questioning as much. However, learning to deal with it all? it was a different process for every single person effected, something Gabi came to realize sitting across the table from his mother, one of his <em>real</em> mothers.</p><p>Although she was nervous before about his absence, something about the wait for him to return was made more intense by the knowledge of where he'd been.</p><p>He went to see Wanda. Not Alisa. Not 'Mom.' </p><p>He went to see Wanda.</p><p>Someone who ruined his entire life.</p><p>There was something to be said, however, about the fact that he stopped for dessert. However bad it had gone, he still cared enough to offer a wordless apology of something Gabi liked.</p><p>It was only another ten minutes or so until the front door swung open and he shuffled through it, clutching the small brown sack in his hands. His head -- covered by his hood -- lifted and those beautiful hazel eyes found her across the space between them.</p><p>"Hi, mi amor."</p><p>Gabi almost melted. His voice was <em>so</em> soft, but she could hear how genuine it was. Even more than that, it had been <em>weeks</em> since he used the chosen pet name for her, knowing how much she loved it.</p><p>"Hi, handsome," she offered, pushing herself to sit up a little against the arm rest of the couch. He slipped his shoes off and made his way to her as he set the bag on the coffee table, but before she could adjust more, he simply laid atop her, his torso between her legs as his head landed on her sternum.</p><p>For a moment, Gabi just felt his weight. For the first time in weeks, she felt what it was like to have him against her, to have his arms around her as they wedged between her and the cushions. It was the most indescribable thing; she'd spent too many hours wishing for it and to finally have it was pushing her closer to her breaking point.</p><p>Gabi tried to be strong for everyone involved, but she forgot what it meant to be strong for herself.</p><p>That was out the window as the silence fell over him and Nik simply laid against her chest.</p><p>She let the night turn around them for a little while longer before she felt compelled to say something, something she wanted to make sure he knew.</p><p>"I love you," she murmured softly, reaching up a hand to lightly run it over his hair in the most soothing manner she could muster.</p><p>He didn't say anything but he <em>did</em> tighten his hold on her at the exact same time he gave a soft sniffle.</p><p>She heard it without a word spoken.</p><p><em>I love you too. I do.</em></p><p>"We don't have to talk about it tonight," she whispered to him, lightly pinching and rubbing a few strands of his hair between her fingers. "I'm just happy to have you so close."</p><p>He sniffled again, but he also snuggled in a little tighter. She knew the flurry of thoughts inside his head was immense and it was fighting to keep him below the surface, but he was fighting so impossibly hard to keep it at bay. If he needed to cling to her like some kind of life raft, she would more than happily be that for him.</p><p>Gabi would have been anything he needed whenever he needed it. She just hoped he realized as much.</p><p>Although she picked up the remote and turned on one of his favorite movies -- <em>The Voices</em> -- he stayed quiet throughout the duration of the film. That, Gabi realized, was because he had pretty quickly fallen asleep. When she woke him up a few hours later, she was careful with him as she coaxed him up and back to bed, hesitating by his side after pulling the covers up his torso.</p><p>Should she ask?</p><p>Should she just... get into a bed that was half hers despite sleeping on the couch for weeks?</p><p>Thankfully, she didn't need to dwell on it much longer because Nik spoke.</p><p>"Will you sleep in here tonight?" His tone was laden with exhaustion and his hand slowly raised to wrap around hers, dark eyes sweeping up to her in the dim light from the hallway.</p><p>How could she not? It was all she'd wanted for weeks and now that he was offering it, she knew she would be a fool to turn it down.</p><p>"Of course, baby," she murmured as she leaned down to kiss his forehead. After shutting off the lights and shedding her sweatshirt for a tank top, she climbed in beside him. Per their normal routine, she would have folded into him and drifted right off to sleep.</p><p>But nothing was normal anymore.</p><p>Instead, Nik was quick to roll to his side as he placed his head on her chest and fit himself to every curve of her body.</p><p>One more time, her heart shattered for him. </p><p>She couldn't remember the last time he'd been so desperate for physical affection, to know he had her right there in front of him. He wasn't a distant boyfriend by any means, but it was rare for him to show any overt need for closeness. What she was seeing right then was a man clinging to the only thing he <em>knew</em> was safe.</p><p>Because Gabi would always be that for him; a safe place to come back to every single time.</p><p>After about twenty minutes, she considered he'd fallen asleep again, but he spoke.</p><p>It startled her, but not as much as what he had to say.</p><p>"I saw Agatha at the jail," he disclosed in a whisper, sniffling softly again.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>Before she could say anything, he continued.</p><p>"I didn't talk to her, but we made eye contact as she was leaving. I had to wait a while because she was obviously there to see her, too. And... I don't think it went well."</p><p>Gabi was so close to silent she was nearly holding her breath. It was the longest string of words he'd spoken in some time and the weight of the ones he was choosing was immense. It was one thing to get out of bed and try to speak with someone he was owed answers from. It was something else to run into a birth mother longing to see him and not speak to her.</p><p>As much as she hated, Gabi understood it.</p><p>He simply wasn't ready.</p><p>He was coming to understand, however, that while his world stood still and he fell to pieces, everyone else's kept going. Agatha and Rio were still out there, missing him, and they wanted and needed answers just as much as he did.</p><p>"And did yours?" she finally asked in a hushed murmur. "Go well, I mean?"</p><p>Nik's arm tightened around her middle and her eyes squeezed shut. She knew what it meant before he was able to speak.</p><p>"I think it went better," he offered, trying to snuggle in a little closer. "I... She didn't say much, and what she did say didn't help me as much as what I had to say myself... Things out loud that I didn't want to inwardly acknowledge. I... Asked her why she never told me, even when I was an adult. I told her it was <em>my</em> right to make the choice. She didn't answer, but..."</p><p>When he stopped speaking, Gabi could feel as his arm constricted around her and pulled her tightly to him.</p><p>"She did tell me the truth about one thing."</p><p>Her hand lifted to gently brush over his hair again, something she knew often soothed him. It was clear he wasn't <em>angry</em>, but he was still upset.</p><p>"And what was that, baby?"</p><p>"She told me Agatha was there. And that... They never stopped looking for me. And they never stopped missing me."</p><p>Gabi's heart squeezed in her chest; it was a lesson she'd learned earlier that day, too, something Rio had made abundantly clear. She couldn't tell him that, though, not right then. He said it best; it was <em>his</em> choice. Telling him right then she'd gone over his head to offer comfort to a struggling family wasn't going to help either of them, but it did make her realize that she couldn't keep it from him forever.</p><p>Gabi loved Nik and lying to him was not something she ever chose to do.</p><p>Hiding the truth right then was what was best for both of them.</p><p>"And how does that make you feel?"</p><p>Her voice was calm and devoid of any nerves, but she could still tell it was a hard-hitting question. He was quiet for a long few minutes, almost long enough to convince her he truly was asleep, but he surprised her again by whispering softly into the night.</p><p>"Confused. Because... I know I should go to them, I should try to meet them, but..." He sniffled again but this time, he lifted his head to look at her in the dark. "This isn't the me I want to show them. And it's not the me I want you to see. I just... need a little more time."</p><p>Gabi's hand dropped to cradle his jaw and she lifted her head, pressing her lips softly to his in a loving kiss.</p><p>"It's okay to get yourself where you need to be. I'm sure they'll understand."</p><p>She said it like it was a hopeful misnomer, but the truth was she already knew they did. She knew they would wait for days, weeks, or months for him. It was just that no one wanted it to turn into years.</p><p>That could not happen.</p><p>Nik yawned and laid his head back on his chest, one last sad admission passing through his lips quietly.</p><p>"I think they love me more than Wanda ever did."</p><p>Oh, he was right about that.</p><p> </p><p align="center"><strong><u>Dani.</u></strong></p><p>When Dani awoke in George's arms, it was almost eleven at night. She was a little disgruntled with herself for falling asleep when she was meant to be spending time with someone she cared about, but George had been quick to assure her she needed the sleep.</p><p>"When you take on the weight of everyone else's pain, it's going to burn through muscles that were under prepared."</p><p>It was so profound as it left George's mouth and landed uncomfortably in Dani's ears as George pressed a kiss to the side of her head and climbed into the driver's seat again.</p><p>Dani knew she was right.</p><p>She was trying so hard to keep everyone else afloat when she hadn't been ready. It wasn't like she woke up the morning of the gala and thought 'We're finally going to know if my brother is alive today.' It wasn't even like she ever thought the day would come for them. It had been her entire lifetime of her mothers missing a son Dani never got to meet, an entire twenty-one years of her parents hovering over her to make sure they did not lose her like they lost Nicky.</p><p>He was the warning, the reasoning, the rationale as to why her entire childhood had been locked up and secured in every way imaginable. He was the reason she couldn't go to slumber parties, the reason she couldn't go to an amusement park without one of her parents present. Hell, he was even the reason she lived so close while not being in the exact same city. Sure, she would have gone to Julliard no matter where it was located in the country, but it helped to know it was close enough that her parents wouldn't obsessively fret over her once she was out from under their care.</p><p>Even then, her entire freshman year was spent under their roof until she turned eighteen. It was understandable and she couldn't exactly live on campus as a minor, but the moment she found an apartment a half an hour away, she jumped on it.</p><p>As much as Dani loved the idea of Nicky, it was also safe to say she blamed him (unfairly) for what she'd had to face. Older now, she was able to see it from all angles, but at the time had been frustrated by the circumstances. <em>She</em> had never done anything to warrant the way they helicoptered the living fuck out of her, but because <em>he</em> disappeared before he could walk and talk, she faced the consequences.</p><p>The older she got, the more she realized how childish that was.</p><p>Nicky could help what happened to him as an infant no more than Dani could control her parents' response to their loss.</p><p>Nicky was still her Imaginary Nicky. For as confused as it made her growing up, he was still the brother she wished she had. He was still the brother she wished she could have played baseball with, or learned to rollerblade with. He was still the brother she wished would have been there for her through high school and college.</p><p>Here he was, making his appearance just as she was going to graduate.</p><p>Stupidly, she wished he would be there.</p><p>She knew better than that. He clearly wasn't even ready to make contact with them, let alone show up at her graduation from one of the most prestigious music schools in the country.</p><p>He wasn't ready for family.</p><p>She couldn't place blame on him for that of all things.</p><p>The drive back to the house was quiet, though George <em>did </em>reach over the center console to hold Dani's hand on her thigh. When she pulled up in front of the Harkness-Vidal home, she turned to face her best friend with a kind smile on her lips.</p><p>"Give yourself a break," she coaxed softly, her thumb brushing over the back of Dani's hand. "And give the moms one, too. It's hard on all of you and I think... I think I have come to know them well enough to know they'll come to you... Just when they're ready. They need time, too."</p><p>Damn George and her sage wisdom.</p><p>Dani knew she was right even if she hated to admit it. Through George's perspective, Dani could see just how hard all three of them were trying. It was reasonable for her to be frustrated, but anger was unneeded. Agatha and Rio still loved her with everything they were, they just needed to figure out how to balance that with the grief and heartache of knowing their son was alive and wanted nothing to do with them.</p><p>"I don't know what I would do without you, Georgie," Dani murmured, leaning over the console to wrap her arms around her best friend.</p><p>"Go undeniably insane and spiral until you crash out and try to drink an entire bottle of SoCo again?"</p><p>They both laughed as Dani pulled away, shaking her head.</p><p>"Learned my lesson last time. Only top shelf shit from now on, and I <em>pace myself</em>. Because binge drinking is unbecoming of anyone."</p><p>She unbuckled her seatbelt, jumping slightly as she felt a light gracing beneath her chin just before George took hold of it and turned her head to look her straight in the eyes.</p><p>"Be gentle with yourself, Dan. And give the moms a little more wiggle room. It's going to work out. It's just taking its sweet time."</p><p>George's beautiful eyes sparkled in the light of the moon and it melted something in Dani's middle.</p><p>She loved Georgina with all of her heart and more often than not, she wanted to say fuck school and reestablish their relationship, but that was a conversation for another time.</p><p>"I love you, George," Dani told her reaching up for her hand to give it a light squeeze.</p><p>"I know you do, Dan. And I love you too. Now, go inside and get some sleep. Tell the moms you love them, even if they're asleep. Text me tomorrow, okay?" Her voice was velvet smooth and there was nothing but kindness woven into every inch of her expression.</p><p>Danica Harkness-Vidal did not deserve Georgina Divallo.</p><p>But she was <em>really fucking glad</em> she had her.</p><p>"Goodnight. I'll text you tomorrow." Against her better judgement, Dani leaned over and placed a soft kiss to George's cheek. "Get home safe."</p><p>With a light wave as Dani shut the door, George rolled away from the curb and began her journey back to the apartment. With a soft sigh, she turned to face her parents' home in the dark and climbed the stairs to let herself inside. She went through her usual routine of washing her face and changing into pajamas, but before she climbed into bed, she had a promise to uphold.</p><p>She was quiet as a mouse as she shuffled down the hallway and poked her head through the cracked door. Both of her parents were in bed, but the lights were on and they were both sitting up.</p><p>"Hey," she called softly, pulling at their attention. "I'm home, but I think I'm going to go to bed. I'm really tired."</p><p>Agatha's lips lifted minutely in a ghost of a smile as Rio lightly patted the bed; it was a request for a hug.</p><p>With a light nod, Dani pushed open the door and crawled onto the space between them. Unsurprisingly, they both caved in on her, hugging her tightly between them.</p><p>"We love you, Dani Banani," Rio teased softly, kissing the top of her head.</p><p>"We do," Agatha agreed, giving her daughter a tight squeeze.</p><p>She wanted to be mad. She wanted to be petulant and defiant and demand answers, but she was simply too tired.</p><p>"I love you too," she murmured softly, lifting her head to glance from one mom to the other. "But I'm exhausted. I'll see you in the morning, hm?"</p><p>Agatha nodded first and Rio placed another kiss, this one to her forehead, before she leaned back so their offer their final goodnights. </p><p>When Dani ventured down the hallway and climbed into her bed a moment later, she let herself cry again. She cried over her confusion. She cried over the way it felt like she was being left out of important conversations. She cried that her momma didn't feel as though she could be honest. She cried for every day that passed where Nicky couldn't find his way to them. She cried because she could.</p><p>She also cried until she fell asleep.</p><p>The next morning, Dani awoke to a sweet smell in the air and a soft tapping on her door.</p><p>"Yeah?" she grumbled, reaching up to wipe at her face as her brain realigned with reality.</p><p>"It's me," Agatha called before she opened the door. "Came to tell you mom made waffles. And I went and grabbed your favorite jam from the farmer's market this morning."</p><p>Damn.</p><p>They read her like a fucking book the night before.</p><p>"And why did you do that?" Dani asked sleepily as she pushed herself into a sitting position.</p><p>Agatha's lips turned down at the corners and she glanced toward the bed as if to silently ask to sit there. Just as silently, Dani nodded her head. When Agatha placed herself in front of her, she didn't waste a moment picking up her hands.</p><p>"Because I lied to you yesterday."</p><p>It was impressive, really. Dani convinced herself they didn't feel the need to be honest with her, but that wasn't it at all.</p><p>Like Nicky, they just hadn't been ready.</p><p>Thankfully, they came around first.</p><p>"About?" Dani asked as if she did not already know.</p><p>"I didn't go to the hospital. I went to the jail. To talk to the woman who took your brother."</p><p>Both pairs of blue eyes honed in on one another, locking in the space between them. Dani remained rather placid in her reaction, not letting the betrayal she'd felt the day before touch her expression. Her lips twisted slightly as she searched for what to say.</p><p>"And... How did that go?" Again, it was pointless to ask, but she didn't exactly want to admit to eavesdropping, no matter how forthcoming her momma was being.</p><p>"As well as expected. I left angry and..." Agatha paused and Dani knew why. </p><p>It was the hardest part to say out loud.</p><p>"I saw your brother. He was coming into the jail as I was leaving. It... I didn't speak to him, just let him be." Agatha's voice shook as she spoke in a way that caused Dani to grip at her hands. "I wanted to. But I knew I couldn't. He... He has to come to us."</p><p>Dani knew she was right, but it was killing her to see how much it was hurting her momma to say it out loud.</p><p>"I know. And you know. And mom knows. But... Was there at least <em>something</em> good about yesterday that came from her coffee with Gabi?" There she was again, Steadfast Dani always trying to find ways to soften the blows.</p><p>"Yes," Agatha answered, reaching up to wipe at the corner of an eye. "But I'll let mom tell you about it over waffles."</p><p>Dani smiled, a soft smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.</p><p>"I'd like that."</p><hr/><p>When Sunday rolled around, Dani knew it was time to head back to her apartment. </p><p>She missed it, missed George, and honestly even missed attending classes. It had become apparent that they were doing nothing more than playing a waiting game and her life could not continue to stand still with graduation fast approaching.</p><p>She kissed her moms on the cheeks and set off back to the city, happy to nestle in on the first night with a movie and her best friend showing up with popcorn.</p><p>Getting back to class was nice, but it was also nice to enjoy a night out here and there. </p><p>By Thursday, Dani needed a drink.</p><p>After class, she shot a text to George that she was going to the gym and suggested they should meet at their favorite bar after for a cocktail or two. George's agreement was easy, but as fate would have it, those were <em>not</em> Dani's plans for the evening.</p><p>She realized as much when, as she was briskly walking down the sidewalk with her head tucked an eyes on her phone, she ran directly into someone.</p><p>Immediately, she was panicking; it was completely her fault for not paying attention. She needed to focus more, even if it felt impossible.</p><p>It felt even more impossible when her eyes lifted to the face of her unintended victim and her blood ran cold in her veins.</p><p>There, standing a foot in front of her, was her brother.</p><p>Nick. Nicky. Nikolai. Nicholas. Nik.</p><p>It didn't matter what his name was.</p><p><em>He was right there.</em></p><p>When their eyes met and time stood still around them, there was an eternal silence that dropped over them like an insulated blanket. It sealed them away, locked them in a pocket of time where nothing else existed.</p><p>Then, he spoke.</p><p>"Dani?"</p><p> </p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Nick.</u></b></p><p>Panic.</p><p>Immediate fucking panic.</p><p>It was all Nick could feel as it flooded every single inch of his bodily form.</p><p>He was staring down into the eyes of someone he had only seen photos of, photos with captions wishing him a happy birthday and a good year, photos of a life he never got to live. He was staring into the eyes of a woman who had quite a list of accomplishments beneath her name all before she even started college.</p><p>He was staring down into the eyes of his little sister.</p><p>A little sister he wasn't sure how to face, even with her standing directly in front of them.</p><p>And yet, he spoke anyway.</p><p>"Dani?" he asked, as if he needed absolute certainty it was her name.</p><p>It had to be. She looked too much like the girl in the photos to <em>not</em> be her. </p><p>When she nodded, it felt like every bit of wind had been knocked out of him. The panic was even worse at the confirmation; he felt trapped. </p><p>What did he do when he felt trapped?</p><p>He ran.</p><p>He tried to step to the side, as if to walk away, but was stopped when a gentle hand touched the chest of his button down. It was just supposed to be a quick trip to the bookstore and then back home. There was something he wanted to learn more about in regards to work, but right then, he hardly knew how to breathe let alone remember what his plans previously were.</p><p>"Please," she bequeathed, her tone almost pitiful. "Please don't go. Can I just... Can I just buy you a drink or something? We don't have to talk but..." Her lips twisted and she looked him in the eye again. </p><p>Could she see his fear? Could she see him panicking? Could she see that he had no fucking idea what to say to her when his thoughts were crashing and colliding into one another?</p><p>"I just want to sit next to you. Even if you don't know what to say. And... I don't have to say anything either. We can just share a drink. No conditions."</p><p>Although she was younger than him, Nick could hear the wisdom and comfort in her voice. She spoke with the tone of an elder, of someone with a vast knowledge of what the world should look like. It made no sense; she was barely old enough to drink. Yet, there she stood with that honest look in her eyes, begging him to simply share space with her.</p><p>"I don't... It's not --"</p><p>"I mean it when I say we don't have to talk. I just want to spend time with you."</p><p>Hearing her beg was doing the impossible: it was tugging at his heart instead of being devoured by his head.</p><p>He knew he should have said no, should have gone to the bookstore to get what he needed and returned home to Gabi, but he couldn't.</p><p>How could he?</p><p>Not with his flesh and blood sister so fucking close.</p><p>"O-Okay. I... I need to text my girlfriend and I can't stay long, but... Okay."</p><p>The relief on her face was <em>palpable.</em> Nick could almost <em>feel </em>it. It broke something in him; all she wanted was a few moments of his time. She didn't want to make him listen to what she had to say, didn't want to force him to open up. She simply wanted to buy him a drink and sit next to him while they indulged in alcohol and silence.</p><p>"I know a good spot," she offered with a friendly smile and gave a nod, encouraging him to text his girlfriend. It could have come across as pushy, but it felt... warm. It felt gentle.</p><p>"Lead the way," he returned with a soft nod of his own as he fished out his phone.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>Hey, baby. I'm going to grab<br/>
a drink with a friend. I'll be back<br/>

to not over-do it. I love you.</p><p>He pressed send and took in a deep breath, following after the smaller dark-haired woman. As he went to stow the phone in his pocket again, her felt it vibrate.</p><p><b>Mi amor:</b> Okay, baby. If you need me to <br/>
come grab you in an uber, let me know.<br/>
I love you too.</p><p>He smiled warmly at the message and looked ahead, realizing Dani was still just a couple of steps in front of him, weaving through the early evening crowds. He couldn't help the way his chest squeezed when she looked back to make sure he was still behind her, worry in her eyes even if she didn't let it touch her face.</p><p>They walked for only a few minutes longer until she stopped in front of a small bar wedged between a bodega and a stamp shop and pulled the door open.</p><p>Nick knew that bar.</p><p>It was one he and Gabi spent a little time at with friends every now and again.</p><p><em>The Anchor.</em></p><p>Fucking ironic.</p><p>They slid onto stools with ease, the bar dimly lit by green sconced lights and neon signs. It was a tiny hole in the wall and saw little traffic; he was thankful it was the one Dani chose. It also led him to question...</p><p>How many nights had they both existed within those walls before? How many times had she been feet away and he remained clueless, probably even lamenting to his girlfriend about everything he missed out on in life? How many night had he maybe even held the door for her and not even realized?</p><p>They would never really know, and that had to be okay.</p><p>"Seven and seven for me," she requested as the bartender solicited their orders. "And whatever he wants is on me." She glanced to him as if to encourage an order.</p><p>"Jack and Coke, please."</p><p>"Wanna start a tab?" the bartender questioned, turning back to Dani. There was something about her body language, about the smile she was offering the woman next to him that almost read as... Attraction?</p><p>Dani glanced to him, her lips twitching slightly before she looked toward the woman before her. "Yeah, go ahead." </p><p>He realized that while he had made his short stay clear, she might not be so eager to stop drinking after he left. For as out of sorts as he was and for as hard as this all felt, he knew he wasn't the only one feeling that way. It was something he'd come to realize over the days of trying to parse things out with Gabi. They were slow-going conversations, but they were still being had, just one day at a time.</p><p>He knew, after his confrontation with Wanda, he was destroying his own life. He said as much to her in his anger and truth be told, hearing it out loud made him realize how true it was.</p><p>Shutting out the woman who loved him was a terrible choice. Not trying to find a way to more forward was a terrible choice. Being too afraid to make contact with people he knew longed for his presence was also a terrible choice, but that one was a little less in his control.</p><p>After a moment of silence, the drinks were placed in front of them and he watched as Dani reached for hers and held it up without a word.</p><p>In return, he tapped the edge of his glass to her and took a slow pull from it before setting it down on the bar top before him. His eyes landed on the television mounted to the wall, but they eventually dropped to the mirror in front of them.</p><p>In the reflection, Dani was looking at a different television. He could tell in his periphery that her leg was bouncing as a result of her nerves.</p><p>He should say something.</p><p>He should soothe her.</p><p>But how?</p><p>He took a deep breath and tried anyway despite having no idea.</p><p>"It's okay," he began, leaning a little closer to her to make sure his voice carried. "I'm not going to try and fight you." The softest chuckle left him and Dani turned her head to take him in, surveying him.</p><p>"I... It's not that. I'm just..."</p><p>"It's a lot," he admitted.</p><p>"It is. And... I don't even know what to call you."</p><p>Hearing those words from her lips felt like a punch to the chest, something that cracked his sternum wide open. It was a conversation had with Wanda, and something that ran unspoken between himself and Gabi, but Dani asking him what his name should be was almost earth-shattering.</p><p>But he had an answer. He just needed to tell her.</p><p>"You can call me Nick."</p><p>She grinned, a full and wide grin that showed how happy the permission made her.</p><p>"With or without a 'c'?" she asked, though he could tell she was joking.</p><p>His little sister was <em>joking</em> with him.</p><p>It was the strangest feeling, but he chose to feed back into her energy.</p><p>"Does it really matter?"</p><p>She took a sip of her drink and eyed him for a moment, deciding upon her answer. "No, I guess it doesn't."</p><p>They both chuckled, but nothing else followed. They were taking turns looking from television to mirror, trying to assess the situation and how best to handle it. It was what she asked for, but the one instance he caught her studying him in the reflection, he realized something.</p><p>She told him they didn't have to talk and she meant it. But the more they didn't talk, the more he felt like he <em>wanted</em> to. </p><p>He was quiet only another minute or so longer before he finally found his voice.</p><p>"Can I ask you something?" he posed before washing the taste of the question away with a pull from his glass.</p><p>"I would like it if you did."</p><p>The way she spoke, she was so <em>articulate</em> and so <em>intentional</em> with her tone. It was clear she was trying to keep herself calm and even to prevent from running him off. From the look <em>behind </em>the look in her eyes, he could tell walking out too soon would crush her.</p><p>"Why did you ask me to come share a drink with you if you didn't want to ask me anything?" It was not a harsh inquiry, but rather an honest one. All he wanted was to understand.</p><p>Dani tossed back some of her drink and turned to face him a little more, tilting her head at him in observation.</p><p>"Because I think I just want you to see that whatever perception of us you have, it's just that. <em>Your perception."</em></p><p>For a moment, Nick simply blinked at her.</p><p>So young, so studied, and so fucking profound.</p><p>That was his little sister.</p><p>She was right. He created an idea of them in his head, that they would want more out of him than he could give or have certain expectations of who he should have become over who he was. But that wasn't a reality. The reality was <em>he didn't know.</em> He didn't know because he was too afraid of giving them the chance and not being what they wanted.</p><p>He was prioritizing his fear over progress.</p><p>He sighed, looking down into his glass.</p><p>"You guys probably think I'm an asshole for taking so long..." he mused. He couldn't quite bring himself to look at her. Although... He should have known what her answer would be based on her first one.</p><p>"That's your perception," she reminded him, tapping softly at her glass while she considered. She turned toward the bar again and looked at him via the reflection in an attempt to take some pressure off of him. "The truth is... We just hope it's some day. We don't care if it's tomorrow, or the day after, or next month. We just want to be in your life."</p><p>It was calm and measured, but Nick could hear just how much she meant it. She wasn't lying or making things up to try and pacify him. She was being honest, telling him not what he wanted to hear, but what he <em>needed</em> to hear.</p><p>"I just..." he tried but the words tasted bitter. "I don't know how yet."</p><p>It was a soft admission, but he could see it land with the woman next to him.</p><p>"It's okay. Because they'll wait. We all will. Because all we want is just a chance to know you, and we're okay with that being on your time. As long as... That's an eventual plan."</p><p>A soft chuckle left him as his head hung.</p><p>"If it wasn't, I don't think I would have agreed to this." It wasn't snappy or rude; it was little more than fact.</p><p>"That's fair," Dani returned, her voice soft and rich as she slipped right back into the act of trying to soothe him as opposed to agitate him. "I didn't mean anything by it. No push. No demand. Just... Time."</p><p>Time.</p><p>That was all he'd taken from them since he found out, wasn't it?</p><p>He'd been hiding away in his bed, hiding from everyone and everything that wasn't Gabriela, and even then, he'd kept her at bay for some time.</p><p>"The truth is," Dani started, "that they're never going to <em>not</em> want you. Mom has made up every single possible version of you in her head and she loves all of them. Momma looks for you in every face she sees." Dani paused and the unspoken stayed that way between them; they both knew he'd seen Agatha that day, but neither of them felt the need to say it out loud. "They just want to <em>learn</em> who you are, who you want to be."</p><p>"But if I take too long..." he began, but Dani was quick to gingerly wave him off.</p><p>"Time is time, Nick. It's always going to be there for however much of it you wish to take. If you want to stave it off for as long as you can, everyone <em>gets</em> it, even if it sucks. But if you told me right now to book train tickets to Newark, I'd do it. Because it's all up to <em>you.</em> But I also know that you just aren't ready and that's <em>okay.</em>"</p><p>She was being so fucking understanding and he didn't get it. So maybe he needed to <em>try</em> to get it, to understand.</p><p>"Can I ask you something else?" he posed finally after a few stalled minutes of quiet.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Will you tell me about them?"</p><p>The kindness in Dani's eyes as she turned to face him nearly took him under.</p><p>"I'd love to."</p><p align="center"><b><u>Dani.</u></b></p><p>There was something so... undemanding about the interaction the two of them were sharing while sitting at that bar. </p><p>Dani wasn't pushing him; she wasn't making him answer questions or asking him to pose his own. She wasn't forcing his hand or making him do anything he wasn't ready to do. He <em>could</em> have turned her down when she made the offer, but he made the choice to accept instead.</p><p>He was trying.</p><p>That much was clear.</p><p>Based on what her mom disclosed over waffles, the idea of actually running into him hadn't crossed Dani's mind. He was stuck in bed, wallowing in his grief and shutting out the world as far as she knew.</p><p>But he wasn't.</p><p>He was sitting right next to her asking her to tell him about their parents.</p><p>"Well," she began, still looking at him though she traced a finger around the rim of her glass. "I don't know what you know. But momma -- Agatha -- is a neurosurgeon. One of the highest praised in the state. We were actually... We were at an awards ceremony where she was being honored when we got the news about you."</p><p>She watched him carefully as she started to reveal a little more about what he hadn't had the chance to know, trying to gauge where the stopping point might be.</p><p>"Mom -- Rio -- is a chef. Well, not professionally anymore but she used to own her own catering company. She..." Dani hesitated, her lips pressing firmly for a moment before she continued. "She sold it when I was born to stay home with me. But she still cooks all the time. And sometimes burns the pasta sauce. Which... Momma says Panera is a lifesaver on those nights."</p><p>The gentlest laughter fell between them at the admission; it truly was funny, but it would have been funnier if he had a better idea of who Rio and Agatha were.</p><p>"They got married a few years before you were born and have obviously been together ever since. They've had the same house for thirty years almost and have done too many renovations to count, but it'll always be home." She took a soft breath, tilting her head as she watched him. She was careful as she chose her next words, still of the mind she did not want to spook him.</p><p>"There's always a place for you there."</p><p>She could see the impact it had on him; for a moment, his expression wavered and a struck gleam crossed over his eyes. He clearly hadn't been expecting the offer, but Dani knew he severely underestimated how badly they all ached to be present in his life. For her, it was a goal she'd had since she was little.</p><p>For her -- <em>their</em> -- parents, it was something they'd held out hope for for decades. It wasn't like they decorated it or filled it with things they <em>thought</em> he would like, but there was still a room with navy walls and a queen sized bed inside. It bore no photos or art, nothing to make it stand out. It was simply a spare room most of the time, but Dani knew what it really was.</p><p>It was a place for him to come home to, if ever the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>"I don't want to keep disappointing them," he voiced, looking into his drink. For some reason he did not quite understand, it hurt to look at her when he made such loaded admissions. "But I'm not ready. I don't know what to say. I don't know how to act... I just... Don't know."</p><p>Dani could feel his words in her chest; he was so fucking scared and she had no idea how to properly ease his fears. She could sit there all night telling him anything he asked to hear, but she knew his time was likely up as soon as his drink was finished.</p><p>Then, it was as he tossed the rest of it back.</p><p>"I know this might sound like ridiculous cliche bullshit, but I'll be real with you. Just be yourself. That's all <em>anyone</em> in this situation hopes to get from you."</p><p>That was the wrong thing to say.</p><p>"How am I supposed to do that when who I am is so tied into the biggest lie of the century?"</p><p>Okay, so that was a little dramatic. He got that from Agatha.</p><p>Having any kind of knee-jerk reaction to his statement wasn't going to help either of them. She knew the likely outcome here was that he would go home, maybe take her number, and hopefully text her within the coming weeks to say he'd finally gotten himself where he needed to be. Still, she was there for whatever he needed in the moment.</p><p>"I can't tell you how to feel, Nick. I can only tell you that we've celebrated your birthday every year since I was little. I can tell you that momma still carries around your laminated baby photo in her wallet. I can tell you that every Christmas, we light a candle for you. I can tell you that when I was younger, you were my imaginary friend. I can tell you literally anything in the world, but it's not up to me. And it's <em>okay</em> if you're not there yet."</p><p>When he winced at the part where she talked about having him as an imaginary friend, she was afraid she might have pushed too hard. Would he get up and leave? Would he call her a liar and tell her she was making it up to somehow gain favor with him?</p><p>Looking over to her, he did not a single one of those things.</p><p>Instead, he asked a question that nearly stopped her heart in her chest.</p><p>"But what if I am?"</p><p>Was he fucking with her? Was he giving her false hope for... whatever reason?</p><p>"'What if you are' what?" she asked dumbly, blinking at him.</p><p>His nervous hazel eyes darted over her face, trying to find... something, but she couldn't tell what it was. Was it possible he changed his mind so quickly? What was the reasoning? Why was he suddenly on board with moving forward when she'd nearly begged him to join her for a drink?</p><p>"What if I'm there?"</p><p>Holy shit, he was being serious.</p><p>"Like... <em>How</em> there?" she questioned, tucking her bottom lip between her teeth to chew on it nervously.</p><p>"Is your offer to grab train tickets still on the table?"</p><p>HOLY FUCKING SHIT. </p><p>WHAT?!</p><p>"I... I mean --" she fumbled, completely stunned by the idea that he was ready to take it all on, to go to Newark and meet their parents. It was such a one-eighty that it was giving her whiplash, but she didn't care. She knew she could not waste too much time balking or he might backtrack. She couldn't have that when so much progress was instantaneously being made. "You're serious?"</p><p>It wasn't so much Dani doubting him as it was her wanting to make absolutely sure before she booked tickets and double checked their parents were home.</p><p>"What's the point in continuing to wait? If it goes half as well as... this," he indicated by waving a hand between them, "then what do I have to lose?"</p><p>It moved her, truly, to hear him speak so honestly. She knew he was scared, knew he might still snap and be defensive when it came to sensitive subjects, but he was trying <em>so fucking hard.</em></p><p>"Then yes, my offer is still on the table."</p><p>Nick's lips lifted in the first genuine smile Dani had witnessed from him that night.</p><p>"Can you book three? I'd like to bring my girlfriend, too."</p><p>"Of course."</p><p align="center"><b><u>Rio.</u></b></p><p>The days came to pass after her meeting with Gabi and while she'd been gifted with so much to hold onto, Rio's hopes that Nicky was going to come around started dwindling once more. It wasn't that she was hope<em>less</em> but she was coming to the realization that time was the be all end all. </p><p>They were going through something that couldn't be forced, something that just had to happen naturally without any undue pressure. It was hard to stomach, especially with every day that ticked by, but it was their reality and Rio understood as much all too well.</p><p>That night in particular, she prepared chicken cordon bleu for dinner and knew Agatha was going to be late, timing it roughly to when she would arrive. When her phone dinged from the kitchen table, she was certain it was her wife; although she already announced she was on her way home, surely something came up that would delay her.</p><p>When she scooped it up off the table and swiped it open, Rio was rather surprised to see an awaiting message from Dani.</p><p>It wasn't so much she didn't expect to hear from Dani as it was the contents of the message itself.</p><p><b>Boogerbutt: </b>Hey are you and momma<br/>
home?</p><p>Rio's brow wrinkled slightly as she typed her response.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>I am home and momma is on <br/>
her way. Is everything okay?</p><p>Dani's return was lightning quick.</p><p><b>Boogerbutt:</b> Yes. I'm coming home.<br/>
I just wanted to make sure you<br/>
were both there.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>For what purpose? Are you<br/>
bringing George with you?</p><p><b>Boogerbutt:</b> No George tonight.<br/>
But you'll both be there in<br/>
maybe an hour?</p><p align="right"><b>Me:</b> Yes. Should I leave dinner out<br/>
for you?</p><p><b>Boogerbutt:</b> No, I've been drinking <br/>
a little. Not hungry. But I will there <br/>
asap! I love you!</p><p>Okay... What was she up to? With her brow still creased, Rio fired off a text message to her wife.</p><p align="right"><b>Me:</b> Are you close to home? I just<br/>
got a series of very strange<br/>
text messages from our <br/>
daughter. She's coming home<br/>
tonight.</p><p>There was a delay as Agatha surely waited until she was stopped to respond.</p><p><b>LOML:</b> I just stopped for a bottle of<br/>
white to go with dinner. I should be <br/>
there in about fifteen. What makes<br/>
the messages so strange?</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>Well... She said she's coming<br/>
home, she didn't want to eat <br/>
because she's been drinking and<br/>
she was adamant about making<br/>
sure both of us would be here.</p><p><b>LOML:</b> Well... Why is that weird?<br/>
Seems pretty normal for her.</p><p align="right"><b>Me: </b>I don't know. I guess it just<br/>
felt a little off. But I'm sure <br/>
everything is fine and I'm just<br/>
being annoying mom.</p><p><b>LOML: </b>My love, I'm *definitely* <br/>
the annoying mom. I promise.</p><p>Rio laughed softly, giving a shrug to no audience. Agatha wasn't wrong.</p><p align="right"><b>Me:</b> If you ask Dani, maybe. Come<br/>
home to me, baby. See you soon.<br/>
I love you.</p><p><b>LOML:</b> I love you too, Rio. See <br/>
you in 5.</p><p>As promised, Agatha arrived five minutes later to a prepped dinner and awaiting wine glasses. They sat at the dining room table and savored the meal along with the wine, lightly discussing the potential outcomes of what their daughter was up to.</p><p>She could be wily, that was for certain, but Rio felt as though there was more to it. It felt like Dani was being cagey in her text messages, like there was something important on her mind that she simply wouldn't say outright. It was mildly frustrating, but Rio knew if they were patient, they would surely get answers.</p><p>She wasn't on a bender.<br/>
She wasn't injured.<br/>
She seemed sane enough.</p><p>So what could possibly be so urgent she had to come home in the middle of the week with little warning?</p><p>With a refill to their wine glasses, the hour mark passed since the last message Dani sent. The two of them migrated to the living room, but Agatha was quick to announce she wanted a change of clothes. With a soft kiss and a lightly playful tap to her hip, Rio ushered her on and suggested throwing on a movie. With an easy agreement, Agatha disappeared up the stairs.</p><p>Not a minute later, there was a soft rattling of the deadbolt on the front door and it swung open, drawing Rio's attention in spite of knowing already who it was.</p><p>Or, she <em>thought</em> she knew who it was.</p><p>Seeing Dani made sense, but when she spoke, that <em>did not</em> make sense.</p><p>"I brought a couple of friends with me," she offered, though it barely made sense as it spilled between grinning teeth. When she stepped aside as Rio climbed to her feet, she stopped dead in her tracks as her daughter's guests came through the door.</p><p>There stood one familiar face and one semi-familiar face. </p><p>Gabi and Nicky.</p><p>Her son and his girlfriend.</p><p>The same girlfriend who gave her hope less than a week before.</p><p>She couldn't have known back then how honest she was being, but Rio had. She just didn't think things would happen so quickly.</p><p>"What... How...?" Rio managed, but it didn't matter.</p><p>She didn't actually care.</p><p>Not when her son was standing in her foyer.</p><p>She was cautious in her approach as she stepped toward him, unsure what move was the best first move to make.</p><p>So she asked.</p><p>"Can... Can I hug you?" she asked him quietly; her eyes were filled with tears but she was trying desperately not to cry them.</p><p>So was he as he nodded his head.</p><p>Her arms wrapped around his built frame, fighting herself on her urge to cling to him for dear life. She wanted to squeeze him until her arms grew tired, to hold him and tell him she was so happy to meet him, but nothing was actually coming out. Well, nothing aside from the rivers of tears flowing down her cheeks. They only worsened when, over his shoulder, Rio caught Gabi's eye.</p><p>Her smile was genuine, but the way she nodded her head told Rio they'd finally got what they wanted: It was his idea, and they finally had him back.</p><p>Just as she moved to let him go, she heard a soft squeak of the stairs behind her and the quietest gasp of disbelief.</p><p>Rio released him and stepped back to behold the look on Agatha's face; it was little more than pure shock and lacked almost any color. As she came down the last few steps and paced her way forward, Rio could see the battle she was in to not completely crumble. Her arms opened slowly in question and much like he'd done with Rio, Nick simply folded into her.</p><p>"Oh, my boy," Agatha breathed, tucking her face into the side of his head. </p><p>"Welcome home."</p><p> </p>

<p align="center"><b><u>Nick.</u></b></p><p>It was just a conversation. It was just an agreement to share a drink with a woman that had a biological relation to him.</p><p>So how was he standing in the middle of his parents' home, meeting them for the first time?</p><p>The moment Dani stepped aside and Rio was on the other side of her, something in him broke. Her expression was so calm and gentle, so deliberately unnerving, but he could see the truth in her eyes. The truth was that she was truly seeing him for the first time in twenty-five years that he imagined had to have been unbearably long for her. He did not have it in him to ask where Agatha was, especially not when the woman before him asked if she could hug him.</p><p>He'd come that far; who would he have been to deny her? Who would he have been to tell her no after turning up at her doorstep?</p><p>Some part of Nick still didn't fully <em>understand.</em> He knew what was happening, but in his mind he was still sitting at that bar listening to Dani give him every reason he needed to stop waiting. He was staving off the unknown, sure, but at what cost? He was torturing himself, torturing his girlfriend, and he was torturing a family who only wanted to know him so they could earn the right to love him.</p><p>Love.</p><p>Aside from Gabi, was any form of love in his life real?</p><p>The short answer was that little existed outside of Gabi, and what did exist outside of Gabi was... Well, Wanda.</p><p>Of course he had his friends, their friends, but Wanda told him countless times that she loved him.</p><p>Did she?</p><p>Did she <em>really</em>?</p><p>How could she when their entire existence was nothing more than a fabrication of her making?</p><p>The moment he felt Rio's strong arms lock around him, something in him shifted.</p><p>She didn't <em>need</em> to say it. She didn't <em>need</em> to tell him. Right then, as she hugged him -- albeit him being a few inches taller than her -- to her chest and clung to him for dear life, he could <em>feel</em> it: She didn't need a conversation with him or to know anything about him at all to just... <em>love him</em>.</p><p>That embrace could have lasted thirty seconds or thirty years (Nick wasn't entirely sure which), but the sound of the stairs creaking broke them out of the moment. The mother in his arms broke her firm hold to step away, revealing the mother he'd seen before.</p><p>There had been that moment, that <em>very brief moment</em> in the jail when she walked right by him. Their eyes met then and she saw him for all he was; she saw him as the scared little boy who was just looking for answers. Back then, she had a choice. She could have upended his life, tried to push her way in, but she didn't. No, she chose to walk away, to give him space and breathing room. She walked right out of that jail and did not come back and for him, he had to believe it was because she respected him and his right to process.</p><p>Whether it was the truth was neither here nor there, but it made the moment they locked eyes across the living room a little more weightless.</p><p>Nick had been <em>so</em> scared to face them, <em>so</em> afraid of not being what they wanted... Right then, he could see that all they actually <em>really</em> wanted was him and only him, no matter the form he came in. </p><p>He was stalk still as he watched Agatha's approach, not entirely sure what to do. The moment her arms opened in silent question, he had his answer. He took no more than two steps forward and folded into her like a wet blanket, her arms wrapping around her tightly. </p><p>"<em>Welcome home.</em>" </p><p>She said it so easily and yet, it hit him with far more force than anyone could have guessed, and it showed in the choked but soft sob that escaped him. He was trying to keep his composure and brave his way through it, but there was something about the weight of their predicament that finally careened straight into him.</p><p>These women, Dani included, just wanted to love him. The only person who was stopping it from happening was... <em>him</em>.</p><p>Maybe he didn't know what to call them yet, and maybe he didn't know much about them, but he had learned enough from Dani in the bar to know that they were good people and they'd done an immaculate job in raising her. She was a little messy in her delivery and did not have the softest of hands when it came to being sensitive, but she got her point across to make him want to stop the bullshit.</p><p>Sure, maybe it was self-satisfying to cave to the depression, but it only hurt everyone else, including the person he loved most.</p><p>But this?</p><p>This was the payoff.</p><p>For every moment he'd spent scared and stuck, it was a moment wasted where he could have known what the true hug of a mother felt like. Because Wanda... Well, she wasn't the hugging type and never had been. She didn't squeeze him tight and tell him she was proud of him; it was always a head pat or a light rub of the shoulder. She didn't wrap him in her arms when he was hurt or upset and tell him everything would be okay: it was always a 'sleep it off, tomorrow will be better' and nothing more.</p><p>Right then, not having done a thing to earn it, his mothers were choosing to hug him, to hold him and let him feel the way they loved him and <em>had</em> loved him his entire life. He didn't need to be present for them to keep doing it.</p><p>It took him more than a minute of feeling Agatha's embrace to finally find his voice. </p><p>"I'm sorry," he breathed quietly into her shoulder.</p><p>Her response?</p><p>It was the softest laugh as she pulled back to look up at him.</p><p>"Why are you sorry?" she asked kindly. She started to raise her hand as if to cup his face, but stopped herself and let it settle on his shoulder instead. It might have been too much too soon, but Nick found warmth and comfort in even what she offered.</p><p>It was a good question, one that had many answers.</p><p>There was one thing he was <em>most</em> sorry for, though.</p><p>"I'm... I'm sorry I didn't say anything... When I saw you that day... I..."</p><p>"N-- Hey," she corrected quickly, not having any real idea what it was he wanted to be called. "It's okay. I didn't say anything either. Because I... Didn't want to make things harder on you. I just hoped that by giving you space... You'd make it here eventually. And I was right."</p><p>Her blue eyes, her pink cheeks, that sweet curl of her lips were all soothing in the most astounding ways. Arguably, he did not know this woman, but he knew that she carried him for nine months and then fought to bring him home for twenty-five years. No matter who he was, what he'd become... he was still her son. He was <em>their</em> son.</p><p>And he was home.</p><p>For a moment as she looked down at him, he could see the initial panic in her gaze; now that he was there, what did they do?</p><p>"Would you all like some wine? We can relax in the living room with a glass," came Rio's soft suggestion from behind him.</p><p>Truthfully, Nick didn't want to drink anymore. He wasn't <em>drunk</em>, but he didn't want to get there and risk losing any piece of the memory they would be building that night. He was still of clear mind enough that he wanted it to stay that way; he <em>needed</em> to be present.</p><p>"Water for me," he offered, glancing back at her as Agatha finally lifted her hand from his shoulder.</p><p>"Me too," Dani chimed softly from her place next to Gabi at the far side of the room.</p><p>"Wine sounds great," came Gabi next, though there was something in her eyes as she looked to Rio that Nick did not quite understand. It was soft, questioning. It didn't feel significant, just... <em>different.</em> "Would you like some help?"</p><p>"I'd like that," Rio affirmed with a nod before glancing back to Agatha. "And you my love?"</p><p>"A glass of red would be nice, thank you."</p><p>There was a stilled moment of silence where three things were happening at once:</p><p>1) Rio and Agatha were looking at each other and fighting for their lives to not burst into tears at finally having their dreams realized.<br/>
2) Nick and Gabi were locked eye-to-eye across the room with hope written on their faces.<br/>
3) Dani was beholding the entire scene before her with a sense of gratefulness and genuine reverie. </p><p>This was it. It finally happened.</p><p>Could it be said that the only place to go was up?</p><p>Nick wasn't sure, but in that moment, it sure felt like it.</p><p>Breaking from their respective bonds, both Rio and Gabi looked to one another and gave a nod, heading toward the kitchen to prepare drinks. When Nick turned around to face Agatha once more, she was already holding out an indicatory hand toward the living room. </p><p>"Please, make yourself comfortable."</p><p>It was so soft, so warm, but Nick could hear something more.</p><p>She was nervous.</p><p>Well... </p><p>So was he.</p><p>Slowly he shuffled forward, placing himself on one side of a loveseat while Agatha took her place in the middle of the couch. Even before Dani moved to take a spot on one side of her, Nick realized it was because she needed to be surrounded by the familiar to ground her in reality. It was the same reason he chose the loveseat and not the chair; when she returned, he <em>needed</em> Gabi by his side.</p><p>"And how did this come to be, I wonder," Agatha mused aloud, though as Nick looked up, it was to the sight of her looking over at Dani while lightly digging an elbow in her shoulder.</p><p>A pair of startlingly blue eyes raised to him and Dani simply smiled.</p><p>"You run into the people you're meant to run into, I guess," she answered honestly, but Nick saw it as something else.</p><p>It was his chance, the first chance to show his mother a piece of who he truly was.</p><p>"Quite literally, when you're both not paying attention." His voice was a little unsteady, but he sold the joke all the same the moment Agatha began to laugh.</p><p>It was a bright but gentle sound, one that caused Nick's heart to squeeze in his chest.</p><p>"Wait, you actually physically ran into each other?" she asked looking from Dani to Nick and back again.</p><p>"I was texting George," Dani replied sheepishly with a gentle shrug.</p><p>"And I just... Wasn't paying attention. Might have been doing that a lot lately," he offered with a light chuckle. "But... She offered me silence and a drink. But the more we sat there without saying anything... The more I realized I didn't want to do that."</p><p>Agatha's smile was kind, but it was sincere. "That's the thing about her... She gets us to do things we don't want to do by telling us we don't have to do them."</p><p>She was clearly speaking about herself and Rio, but the smallest part of Nick's heart warmed about the possibility that he could now be a part of that 'us' too.</p><p>"That's not --! Okay... yeah. That is what I do, isn't it?" Dani tried to refute, but she folded in the middle of her own argument as she leaned into her mother.</p><p>Their mother.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Mom? Momma?</p><p>He didn't know yet, and that was okay.</p><p>"Alright!" came a call from his left as Rio emerged with two wine glasses pinched in her fingers on one hand and a glass of water in her other. Right behind her was Gabi with a glass of red for herself and a large glass of water for him.</p><p>"Thank you," he told her softly as she placed herself next to him and handed it over. To punctuate his statement with a newfound sense of bravery, he pressed his lips to her cheek, smiling softly as he pulled away.</p><p>As everyone settled, so did something else: the silence.</p><p>For just a moment, all that was truly needed was appreciation of where they found themselves and how they'd gotten there.</p><p align="center"><b><u>Rio.</u></b></p><p>As Rio settled into Agatha's side, her timed and tapered interaction with Gabriela was still replaying over and over in her mind, stuck on a loop.</p><p><em>"How did this happen?" Rio asked in hushed tones as she pulled glasses and cups down from the cabinet. She was fighting tears, but only the happiest ones.</em></p><p><em>"I truly only have bits and pieces," Gabi admitted as she grabbed a cup to fill it with ice and water from the door of the refrigerator. "I guess they bumped into each other... She offered to buy him a drink. Two hours later he's calling me that he's on the way to pick me up. When he walked in, Dani was right behind him. I... Hardly believed my own eyes when I saw her."</em></p><p><em>She set the filled cup on the counter and began to repeat the process with the other as Rio uncorked the wine behind her.</em></p><p><em>"When he told me we were catching the next train to Newark, I... I knew what it meant. But I..."</em></p><p><em>"You haven't tole him," Rio deduced.</em></p><p><em>Gabi solemnly shook her head.</em></p><p><em>"I didn't have time."</em></p><p><em>For a moment, Rio considered as she began to fill the first of the three glasses.</em></p><p><em>"I know you don't really need me to say it, but that's probably a conversation better suited for sooner rather than later." She paused for a moment as she moved on to the second glass. "And hopefully... Tonight goes well enough that he's able to understand."</em></p><p><em>"Hopefully," Gabi agreed, placing herself at Rio's side and setting the second cup on the counter. Her hand detached from it but was only empty for a moment before Rio filled it with her own.</em></p><p><em>"You were right," she said softly. "The hope was still there. What we needed was a little more time."</em></p><p><em>"And for your spitfire of a daughter to talk some sense into him."</em></p><p><em>Rio laughed gently.</em></p><p><em>"Yeah, she's good for that most of the time."</em></p><p>Sitting next to her wife with Dani on the other side of Agatha, she knew it had to feel like a lot for him. Sure, he was ultimately the one to make the decision, but there was still an emotional anvil attached to the situation.</p><p>It was obvious when no one spoke.</p><p>It was because no one knew what to <em>say. </em>So Rio took the lead.</p><p>"What bar did you guys end up at?"</p><p>It was an easy question, one she hoped might break through the tension a little bit.</p><p>"The Anchor," Dani answered, her eyes catching his as she brandished a warm smile across her lips.</p><p>Rio caught the interaction, but it didn't seem like much until he spoke.</p><p>"We've actually been there quite a few times," he admitted, glancing down into his water. It was clear he was overwhelmed by the idea of not knowing who to look at, so he was simply trying to calibrate and get himself there.</p><p>Rio could admire that.</p><p>"Like for Halloween last year," Gabi added, giving his knee a soft squeeze.</p><p>"No way!" Dani all but shrieked. "What were you guys dressed up as?!"</p><p>Rio watched as Nick lifted his head and found his sister on the couch, a genuine grin filling his face.</p><p>"Eustice and Muriel from Courage the Cowardly Dog."</p><p>"Oh my GOD! I was the Louise who almost got kicked out for being too loud," she explained. While Rio had only half a clue what they were talking about, she realized something very important.</p><p>Their children had shared space before.</p><p>Agatha was right to be upset over how close he'd been for so long when they had no clue. They were <em>so</em> clueless, apparently, that Dani had been in the same bar on the same night and even <em>saw</em> the two of them, she just hadn't known it.</p><p>Nick's gaze scanned down the line of them as he spoke, a tender warmth laying gingerly over his tones.</p><p>"All this time, you've been so close... <em>So</em> close and... None of us ever knew..."</p><p>It was almost heartbreaking, honestly, to hear him be the one to point it out. Sure, not a one of them would have ever known or made the connection, but he'd been in the same tiny bar as a sister he always wanted but did not know existed and it was clearly hitting him just what it all meant.</p><p>It was hard; all of it was hard. He was taken from them, hidden away in too many corners of the world, and everyone was a little worse for wear because of it.</p><p>They all had their own struggles over it, but Rio could slowly feel in her wife's form pressed to her side that she was slowly coming to terms with it. Her muscles were easing, even if the grip she had on Rio's thigh was not. She was accepting that while their reality had been two and a half decades of pain and heartbreak and not knowing, <em>this</em> was their new reality; it was a reality where they got to sit together in their living room and try to hold light conversation.</p><p>"But now we do," Dani announced. "And we can do whatever we want to do with that. But I think this is a good start." </p><p>Rio's eyes darted from her daughter to her son, truly hit by the similarities suddenly so visible due to their close proximity. Sure, Dani's face shape was drawn from her own whereas Nick's came from Agatha's pointed nose and cheekbones, and their eyes were completely different colors, but it was too apparent that they were blood related.</p><p>Her children.</p><p>Her sweet, similarly looking children.</p><p>Right there with her and Agatha, the way it should have always been.</p><p>"You're right," Nick agreed softly, his gaze landing on his mothers. "And I just... Hope it's okay to try and understand what that might be. I mean... I'm not going to run home to never be heard from again, but... This is..."</p><p>"Weird?" came Agatha's gentle question from beside her.</p><p>Something happened.</p><p>Something <em>beautiful</em>, something <em>magical</em>.</p><p>They all laughed.</p><p>All five of them.</p><p>It wasn't raucous or boisterous but fell more along the lines of a chorus of chuckles that all agreed upon the same thing. It was a sweet and treasured sound the moment it hit Rio's ears and judging by the look on her son's face, he had to be feeling close to the same.</p><p>"Yeah, weird. It's like... Where do we even start?" His voice sounded far less nervous than when he initially arrived, but Rio had a feeling it had something to do with the way his fingers were twisting mindlessly -- and perhaps a bit anxiously -- around Gabi's where they rested on his thigh. "It's... What do I ask? What do <em>you</em> ask? It's just..."</p><p>"It's a lot."</p><p>This time, Dani was the one to finish his sentence. "So what if you just tell us what you want us to know?"</p><p>For a moment, Rio felt like she was melting. Neither herself nor Agatha wanted to place any undue pressure on him, but Dani wasted no time in trying to be the voice of reason when both parties seemed so uncertain. She had been the glue holding their family together for a very long time, and now, she was continuing to prove that it was something she was more than happy to do, even with two new additions.</p><p>Her offer seemed to settle the young man, his posture allowing him to sink a little more into the loveseat and a little more into his girlfriend. His eyes were still moving, jumping from woman to woman, but he finally settled on Rio when he found his words.</p><p>"I work at a physical therapy clinic in the city and spend most of my time not at work with her. We go to raves, but we like concerts too. We don't have a dog but want one when we move out of the city because we don't want kids. And I..." He paused, his gaze casting down the line of them and back up again as he cleared his throat. "And I researched you all. Enough to know that... That you've celebrated my birthday every single year. And that all you've wanted is for me to be happy."</p><p>A rock leapt into Rio's throat, staunching her airflow exponentially. She was already emotional, but when he continued, she was in an active battle to not let herself burst into tears.</p><p>"So what I want you to know is that... All of this aside... I'm happy. I have a good life because I -- <em>we</em> -- and built it for ourselves. Not because of... <em>her</em>, or anything she ever did for me. But because I wanted it for myself. And I'm happy with that."</p><p>Hearing him be so honest, it moved something in Rio. He was clearly a successful young man, had a good job and a good home life. They'd spent years on end thinking about him, wondering about him, worrying about him... And all he <em>needed</em> them to know was that despite everything, he was <em>happy. </em></p><p>"That's all we've ever hoped for," Agatha told him, her voice low but her words sincere. "No matter where you were, we just wanted you to be happy."</p><p>For a moment, Nick just looked at her. But then again, he wasn't <em>just</em> looking at her. He was seeing her, assessing her, trying to figure her out. She was being so calm and kind and he was trying to figure out how to respond in kind.</p><p>"Being a kid was hard," he admitted, his stare never wavering from the woman at Rio's side. "But it has to be okay now because <em>this</em> is who I turned out to be. And... I was scared that you wouldn't like this version of me because it's not the one you might have imagined... But..." Finally, he tore his gaze away to look at his sister, a small smile on his lips. "Someone very wise once said... 'Every version of you is a version that is loved...' or something like that."</p><p>"You mean to tell me <em>Dani</em> said that?" Agatha teased, lightly poking their daughter in the ribs, eliciting a giggle at the same time.</p><p>"She's... very smart. And very wise for being so young."</p><p>"I got it from them," she managed through her giggles as she leaned into Agatha's side. </p><p>"Well, maybe I have some things to learn yet."</p><p align="center"><b><u>Agatha.</u></b></p><p>For almost two hours -- until nearly eleven at night --- the five of them sat in their living room, drinking water and wine, as they simply held the lightest of conversations. They learned small things, like how Nick preferred pie to cake, how he sometimes got anxious in public places, how he loved eating dry cereal.</p><p>In return, he learned a little about Dani's time at Julliard and Rio's passion for cooking. He learned about Agatha's prolific career as a surgeon and smaller dynamics of their family. He asked the gentlest questions, still so timid about crossing any perceived lines.</p><p>There were no lines. There could be none. Not when he was their son and simply wanted to know them.</p><p>As exhaustion seemed to settle over them, the end of the night was drawing to a close.</p><p>"Do you think..." Nick began as he and Gabi -- hand in hand -- got to their feet, "that maybe we can come back again soon?"</p><p>For as much progress as they'd been making that night, Agatha was genuinely caught off guard by such a blatant ask. She, however, did not waste a single second in giving her response as the three of them stood as well.</p><p>"I think if you'd like to, you should come over this weekend. We were thinking about inviting Dani and her best friend over for a little cook out. We'd love it if you both joined us as well."</p><p>She said it without thought; they hadn't even brought it up to Dani yet, but she couldn't stop herself from extending the invitation. It was out of fear that if she didn't, he simply wouldn't come back even though he was asking if he could. It was irrational, but she <em>needed</em> to see him again. They all did. They all deserved a chance to have him in their lives.</p><p>There was a glance to his side that was met with an encouraging nod from Gabi, her agreement easy and fast. </p><p>"We would really like that," he voiced, finally releasing Gabi's hand to step forward. That time, <em>he</em> was the one to open his arms up for a hug.</p><p>"Then Saturday it is," Agatha agreed, stepping into his hold as she embraced him with strong arms. Next to her, Gabi offered a strong hug to Rio. She did not hear the soft exchange between them, the one where she whispered <em>"I will tell him,"</em> right into Rio's ear, but she could feel the warmth emanating from them even as Gabi turned to hug Dani as well.</p><p>The five of them shuffled toward the door, exchanging in one last round of embraces before Nick looked her in the eyes one last time.</p><p>"Thank you... All of you... For just..." His lips pressed as he clearly battled the tide of emotion swelling inside of him. "Thank you for accepting me."</p><p>"Oh, son," Agatha breathed at him, this time losing her battle in reaching up to lightly cup his cheek in her palm. "You never have to thank us for that. We will <em>always</em> accept you for who you are."</p><p>Although she was convinced the embraces were done for the night, Agatha was genuinely surprised when Nick launched at her, wrapping his arms tightly around her neck. The quickness was enough to throw her off balance, but he did not let her go far. The moment she realized he was not letting go, she had to force herself to blink back the tears at the sudden show of emotion. </p><p>Her son loved her. He didn't have to say it, didn't have to put it into words. She could feel it.</p><p>"Go home," she soothed a moment later, finally able to force movement to lightly rub at his back. "Get some rest and let things process a little. We'll see you this weekend, hm?"</p><p>Slowly, he released his hold on her and pulled away, looking down as he offered a soft nod in return. "This weekend. And... Thank you again."</p><p>"You're always welcome," Rio voiced as she sidled up beneath Agatha's arm.</p><p>"Goodnight, everyone."</p><p>"Goodnight," Gabi added, offering a small wave as they let themselves out.</p><p>Agatha's head turned, her curious blue gaze pinning her daughter. "Are you not going back with them?" she questioned as she raised a brow to punctuate.</p><p>In answer, Dani slid beneath her other arm and laid her head on Agatha's shoulder. "I was thinking I'd stay here tonight and catch the morning train for late morning class. If that's okay."</p><p>Agatha kissed the top of her head, giving her a gentle squeeze at the same time. </p><p>"Permission granted. You seemed to do us a solid tonight, huh?"</p><p>Rio shifted at her side, swinging around so they were better able to wrap Dani up in their arms, holding her between them like the precious gem she was.</p><p>"How do you do it?" Rio questioned in a murmur as she tucked her face into their daughter's shoulder. "How do you fix things without even trying?"</p><p>"I guess I'm just charming," Dani returned through soft giggles. "Or I just have a really trustworthy face. Considering I look like you, I'm gonna go with that."</p><p>Between the two of them, they peppered her head in at least a dozen kissed, leaving her to try and fight them off through a bout of giggles she could not control. By the time they finished, her cheeks were pink and that soft sound of her laughter began to wane.</p><p>"I'm going to go shower and then I wanna come lay with you guys for a little before bed. Is that okay?"</p><p>Realistically, Agatha knew they all had a lot to talk about and while that was probably partially where Dani's request came from, Agatha was not sure she was quite ready. She needed time to think, time to process and understand all the things they'd learned that night. </p><p>"Yes, of course," she offered softly, brushing Dani's cheek lightly with her knuckles. "But give us a little. I'd say midnight would be good. Then we're all yours." It might not have made sense to Dani, but Agatha just... needed to breathe and did not want to have to explain as much aloud. When Dani met her blue eyes with a mirror pair, she just seemed to... <em>get it.</em></p><p>"You got it, captain. See you shortly." She placed a quick peck to Agatha's cheek first and then Rio before she dramatically wiggled her way out from between them and scampered off toward the stairs and her impending shower.</p><p>Left alone for the first time that night, there was really only one thing to do.</p><p>Agatha simply folded into Rio, her face crumpling as her body began to tremble with soft sobs that she tried her hardest to choke back. The moment she felt Rio's lips on her ear and her hand smoothing over her back, it felt absolutely pointless.</p><p>"It's okay, my love," she soothed, holding Agatha a little closer. "You can cry all you need, but maybe you'd feel better if we laid down, hm?" </p><p>Rio was right. She was always right. Agatha didn't exactly <em>want</em> to be having a breakdown in the middle of their home, but it was all hitting her at once just exactly what they'd experienced that night.</p><p>They had him.</p><p>He was in their lives now.</p><p>He <em>wanted</em> to be in their lives.</p><p>And some part of Agatha did not know what to do with that.</p><p>She sniffed softly and lifted her head from Rio's shoulder, reaching down to take one of her hands as she left her wife lead her toward the stairs and up to their room. They were both quiet and silent as they climbed into bed and Agatha found herself fastened to Rio's side, her head resting on her chest as the tears began to flow freely.</p><p>"I never thought it would happen," she admitted in the smallest whisper. Rio's fingers traced light lines along her upper arm as she pulled her closer, held her tighter.</p><p>"But it has. And will again." Rio's words were reassuring, of course, but there was something more to be said. "Because he knows. He knows we love him. And I think... I think he's going to love us, too."</p><p>Agatha wanted to argue, wanted to say Rio couldn't possibly know that, but she didn't.</p><p>She managed something else instead.</p><p>"I really hope you're right."</p><p> </p>
