<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>When morning came, and with it the inevitable headache and creeping nausea, Rio would seriously consider murdering Alice. Not in the dramatic, crime of passion kind of way—but in the slow, grumbling, grudge-holding way that involved cold glares, passive-aggressive texts, and maybe a cancelled brunch plan or two.</p><p>Shots, then cocktails, then more shots? It had Alice written all over it. Rio could already see the future version of herself groaning into her pillow, whispering dire threats toward her best friend through a mouth dry as sandpaper.</p><p>But that future version wasn’t here yet.</p><p>Tonight, Rio had agreed-reluctantly-to go out. It was a celebration, after all: Alice had just been accepted into the police force, something she’d been working toward for years. They’d known each other since college, had survived awful roommates and worse breakups together, and Rio hadn’t been able to say no when Alice had asked her to come out “for just one drink.”</p><p>That one drink had snowballed into a full-blown descent into chaos.</p><p>Rio was no stranger to a party, but her life had shifted into quieter rhythms. She was a respected professor now, teaching botany at the university with a specialty in medicinal plants. Her days were filled with lectures, research, greenhouse visits, and emails from students who hadn’t read the syllabus. Her nights were mostly spent curled up with a book and a mug of tea, not tequila.</p><p>But tonight? Tonight, Rio was unrecognizable. She was far enough from campus to not worry about bumping into any of her students, and her outfit reflected that distance, tight, high-waisted black leather trousers that hugged her hips a little too well, and a fitted blazer worn recklessly without anything underneath, the plunge of fabric leaving little to the imagination. Her hair was curled, wild and untamed, and her eyeliner was a little smudged from laughter and dancing.</p><p>She was drunk. Blackout levels of drunk. And in that delicious haze, with her limbs loose and her thoughts looser, she saw her.</p><p>Standing by the bar, framed by warm, golden lighting, was a woman who looked like she'd been cut out of a dream. Effortlessly elegant, she had long, cascading curls the color of rich chocolate, spilling over the back of a silk blouse. Her posture was relaxed, but not careless, confident, as if she owned the room without needing to prove it.</p><p>When she turned her head slightly-responding to something the redhead beside her said-Rio caught a glimpse of her profile. A sarcastic, half-smile lifted one corner of her mouth, and something in Rio’s chest fluttered, then clenched.<br/>
Her ice-blue eyes glittered under the lights, sharp and observant, set above high, sculpted cheekbones that would have made a sculptor weep.</p><p>She was stunning. Unfairly so.</p><p>The redhead beside her laughed at something, tossing her hair over her shoulder, but Rio’s eyes were locked onto the brunette like a moth to flame. Sober-Rio might have quietly admired her from afar, convinced that someone so magnetic could never possibly notice someone like her.</p><p>But drunk-Rio? Drunk-Rio had no such limitations. She was riding the high of tequila confidence and wild possibility. In her mind, she was dangerous. Charming. Irresistible.</p><p>She downed the rest of her drink in one go, barely wincing at the burn, and began to make her way through the crowd, eyes fixed on the woman with the chocolate curls. The redhead might have been a friend. Hopefully just a friend. And if not. Well, future-Rio could deal with that too.</p><p>She had to pause once-maybe twice-to steady herself, her hand grazing against a sticky table or the shoulder of a stranger. Her balance was... negotiable. But her goal was clear. Her eyes remained fixed on the brunette as though drawn by an invisible tether.</p><p>By the time she reached the bar, her heart was thudding hard, part nerves, part alcohol, part the sheer audacity of what she was about to do. She sidled up next to the woman, who hadn't noticed her yet-still deep in conversation with the redhead, who leaned in to say something over the music.</p><p>Rio leaned against the bar, swaying slightly, trying for casual but ending up somewhere between seductive and barely upright. She cleared her throat, took a second to remember what words were, and then, in what she was certain was a devastatingly flirtatious tone, said, "Hey. I was just wondering... are you always this gorgeous or is it, like, a... special occasion?"</p><p>Agatha turned to her slowly, that same unreadable half-smile still playing on her lips, but her blue eyes flicked over Rio with a quiet, clinical assessment. Rio didn’t notice. She was too busy leaning closer, her breath warm and heavy with tequila, her pupils dilated with excitement.</p><p>Agatha blinked once. Then again. “Excuse me?”</p><p>"I-uh-wait, no, I meant that as a compliment," Rio said, gesturing vaguely with her glass, which was somehow still half full, though she had no memory of ordering another. "You're like... I dunno, you have amazing hair…like a beautiful... gazelle. But, like, intimidating. The sexy kind."</p><p>The redhead choked on her drink.</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. Her voice was smooth, but clipped. “You’re drunk.”</p><p>“I am not-” Rio began, but was immediately cut off by a hiccup that betrayed her lie with ruthless precision.</p><p>She blinked, tried to stand a little straighter, and promptly stumbled sideways into the bar, shoulder first. The clang of glass and a startled yelp from the bartender made several people turn and look. Rio blinked again, staring wide-eyed at her drink as if it had betrayed her.</p><p>Agatha set her own glass down, crossing her arms, head tilted slightly. “You’re going to spill something on someone. Or fall. Possibly both.”</p><p>"I wasn’t trying to... fall," Rio muttered, her cheeks burning. She gave a slow, hazy smile. "I was trying to flirt with you. Your eyes are amazing. Was it... working?"</p><p>There was a beat of silence. The redhead covered her mouth, shaking with silent laughter.</p><p>Agatha didn’t laugh. But something flickered in her eyes-amusement, maybe. Or something like interest. Not in the way Rio wanted, not yet, but it wasn’t dismissal either. She leaned in just slightly, her voice lower now. “Why don’t you give me your name before you start comparing me to safari animals again?”</p><p>Rio perked up. “Oh! Right. Um. It’s-uh-Professor Rio. Wait, no. Just Rio.”</p><p>“Professor?” Agatha echoed, skeptical.</p><p>“Mmhmm,” Rio nodded, proud and entirely too drunk for modesty. “Plants. I know a lot about them.”</p><p>“I’m sure,” Agatha murmured, her voice unreadable again. Then, after a pause: “I’m Agatha.”</p><p>Rio grinned wide. “That’s a beautiful name.”</p><p>“You’ve said the same about me, my eyes, my hair, and my ‘gazelle aura,’” Agatha said dryly. “You’re very generous with your compliments.”</p><p>“I have so many more,” Rio promised, slurring the 'so' just enough to make it comically long.</p><p>Agatha picked up her drink and took a slow sip, clearly considering whether Rio was more entertaining or alarming.</p><p>“You might want to sit down before you fall down, Professor,” she said.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio insisted, just before stumbling backward into a barstool and grabbing onto it like a lifeline. “See? Strategic.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched. It wasn’t quite a smile, but it was close. “Strategic,” she repeated.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said proudly. “Told you. I’m not just a pretty face. I'm... brilliant.”</p><p>The redhead gave up entirely and turned away, shaking her head as she muttered something under her breath. Agatha, to Rio’s surprise, didn’t walk away. Instead, she turned slightly to face her, one arm resting casually on the bar, her expression skeptical but... curious.</p><p>Rio, somehow encouraged, leaned forward again and whispered conspiratorially, “If you stay here, I’ll tell you a fun fact about mushrooms that’ll blow your mind.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows. “Alright, Professor. Let’s hear it.”</p><p>Rio beamed like a child about to share a secret treasure. She wobbled a bit as she leaned in closer, eyes glittering with excitement. “Okay, okay, listen. Some mushrooms can survive in space.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “I... what?”</p><p>“Space, Agatha. Like actual, outer, terrifying, cold, no-oxygen space.” Rio gestured to the ceiling as if space might be just above the club’s flickering lights. “They’re called extremophiles. Isn’t that sexy? I think that’s sexy.”</p><p>“I think that’s... concerning,” Agatha said, but her lips twitched again.</p><p>Rio giggled, pleased with herself. She was glowing with the kind of unearned confidence only inebriation could provide. “Do you like mushrooms? I could teach you about spores. I have a spore print tattoo. Wanna see it?”</p><p>Agatha raised a cool eyebrow. “I’m... both intrigued and terrified.”</p><p>Rio had already turned to twist her blazer open a bit wider, attempting to locate said tattoo on her ribs, but fumbled with the fabric and nearly elbowed the bartender in the face. She gave up after a second, slapping the counter instead.<br/>
“Drinks!” she declared. “More drinks!”</p><p>“Water,” Agatha countered, holding up a finger toward the bartender. “She’ll have water.”</p><p>“Nooo,” Rio whined. “C’mon, I’m fine. One more tequila. Or maybe-ooh! Espresso martini! Fancy, right?”</p><p>“You’re slurring every fifth word and about to flash more than your spore print in the middle of a club,” Agatha said, her tone somewhere between amused and gently exasperated. “You need water.”</p><p>Rio pouted, dropping her chin dramatically onto her hand. “You’re bossy… I like that.”</p><p>“And you’re a menace,” Agatha replied calmly.<br/>
Then, to the bartender: “Water. Please.”</p><p>The bartender gave her a grateful look and slid over a tall glass. Agatha nudged it toward Rio.<br/>
Rio stared at it like it was a punishment. “That’s not a drink.”</p><p>“It is,” Agatha said. “It’s just one that won’t end with you face-down in a gutter.”</p><p>Rio snorted and pushed the water slightly to the side. “I’m not that bad. I can-“She spun on her stool with a flourish meant to prove her grace and instead caught her heel on the leg of the stool, nearly launching herself onto the floor. Agatha caught her arm without missing a beat, steadying her as if this happened all the time. Rio blinked up at her, eyes wide. “Okay. That one doesn’t count.”</p><p>“That’s two near-falls in five minutes,” Agatha said, her hand still holding Rio’s arm. Her grip was firm, her skin cool. “I’m starting to think you’re testing gravity on purpose.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Gotta do research somehow.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a sharp little laugh through her nose. “You are ridiculous.”</p><p>“And you haven’t left yet,” Rio said, eyes narrowing playfully. “So what does that make you?”</p><p>There was a pause. Agatha’s smile returned, barely there, but undeniably real this time. “Curious.”</p><p>Rio preened, lifting her chin like she'd just won a prize. “Ha! Got you.”</p><p>“I’m not sure if you got anything,” Agatha murmured. “Except drunk. You definitely got drunk.”</p><p>At that, Rio raised her glass to the ceiling with a cheer. “To... mushrooms and mystery women!”<br/>
Agatha just shook her head with a small laugh, watching Rio with something cautious but fond forming in her expression. “Drink your water, Professor. Then we’ll see about walking you in a straight line.”</p><p>Rio took the glass, gave it a suspicious sniff, then sipped it like it might betray her.</p><p>The water wasn’t terrible, Rio had to admit. Cold, crisp, grounding. It cut through the haze a little, just enough to make the room stop spinning in slow, lazy circles. She sipped it like a child being forced to eat broccoli, then set it down with an exaggerated sigh and turned her eyes back to Agatha.</p><p>“So,” she said, propping her elbow on the bar and resting her chin on her hand again. “What’s your deal, Mystery Woman?”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “My deal?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said seriously. “You’ve got the aura of someone who owns... I dunno, art. Maybe a dangerous pet. A falcon. Or a snake named Bertrand.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, soft and surprised. “No falcon. No Bertrand.”</p><p>“Then what do you do?” Rio asked, poking her lightly in the shoulder. “Tell me your secrets.”</p><p>“I’m a lawyer,” Agatha said, reaching for her drink.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “Oh. Hot.”</p><p>Agatha paused. “That’s your reaction?”</p><p>“I mean, yes?” Rio gestured dramatically. “Power suits and courtroom drama? Objection sustained and all that? Very hot.”</p><p>Agatha took a slow sip of her whiskey. “I own a firm downtown.”</p><p>Rio nodded solemnly, as if this were both impressive and deeply mysterious. “You’re the boss?”</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>“Boss, bossy and hot?” Rio said, leaning a little closer. “What kind of romance novel nonsense is this?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a sidelong glance, amused. “And you’re a professor who can’t stand up straight.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Rio said, grinning. “Opposites attract. It’s like... academic disaster meets legal goddess.”</p><p>“You’re out of your mind.”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her drink-amber liquid swirling quietly in the glass-then glanced away, distracted for a moment by something across the room. That was all the opportunity Rio needed.<br/>
With a sly little grin, she reached across the bar and snatched Agatha’s half-finished whiskey, bringing it to her lips before Agatha even realized what was happening.</p><p>“Hey-!” Agatha turned back too late. “That’s mine.”</p><p>“Mmm,” Rio said, wincing a little at the burn. “Yours is better than mine. This is... smoky. Sexy. You have sexy whiskey.”</p><p>“You just stole my drink.”</p><p>“I borrowed it,” Rio said, handing the glass back triumphantly. “It was a bonding moment.”</p><p>“You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>Rio beamed at her. “You keep saying things like that, but you haven’t left.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment, messy curls, blazer still slightly off-center, cheeks flushed from alcohol and mischief. Her smile was easy, honest, ridiculous. And for some reason, Agatha stayed.<br/>
“I guess I haven’t,” she said.</p><p>Rio leaned closer, suddenly quieter. “Why not?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She just looked at her, the noise of the club seeming to dull around them.</p><p>Finally, she said, “Because it’s not often someone makes me laugh. Especially someone quoting mushroom facts and drinking my whiskey.”</p><p>Rio rested her head on her hand again, smiling like she’d just been handed the universe.</p><p>“That,” she said, “might be the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to me.”</p><p>The whiskey however hit a bit harder than Rio expected. It crept in slow, like fog rolling over a valley, but then it clamped down. Her limbs got heavier. The corners of her vision blurred, and the lights of the club began to smear into soft halos. Her words came slower now, and her grin had gone lopsided, sleepiness tugging at the edges.</p><p>She blinked, trying to focus on Agatha’s face, still faintly glowing under the bar’s ambient light. “You’ve got... really nice cheekbones,” she mumbled, almost dreamily. “Like, unfair. They should be... illegal. Do you prosecute cheekbones?”</p><p>Agatha gave a soft chuckle, but her gaze sharpened. Rio was slumping now, her earlier bravado dissolving into the undeniable haze of too much alcohol. She placed a steady hand on Rio’s forearm. “Hey,” she said gently. “Are you here alone?”</p><p>Rio blinked at her. “Huh?”</p><p>“Do you have someone with you?” Agatha asked. “A friend I can call? Someone who can take you home?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth dropped open slightly, and then she smiled-slow and wicked, or at least she thought it was. “Ohhh,” she said, the word dragging out like taffy. “So that’s your move.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What?”</p><p>“You wanna take me home,” Rio said, pleased with herself. “I get it now. All the boss-lady charm and sexy whiskey was just foreplay.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, genuinely startled. “That’s not…”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio said, patting her hand like she was granting permission. “You don’t have to pretend. I’d seduce me too. Look at me. I’m irresistible.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose, though there was an unmistakable twitch of a laugh she was trying not to let escape. “No, Rio. I mean do you have a friend here. Someone who knows where you are. Someone sober.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her brows scrunching in exaggerated confusion. “Wait. Are you not trying to sleep with me?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, exasperated.</p><p>“Oh.” A long pause. Rio stared at her drink like it had betrayed her again. “Well, that’s just rude. Why not?”</p><p>Agatha let out a low, amused groan. “Do you have someone I can call?”</p><p>“Oh! Alice!” Rio perked up. “Alice is... somewhere. She’s a cop now, or almost. We were celebrating. She’s got red streaks in her hair. Loud. Probably yelling at someone about their shoes.”</p><p>“Red streaks and yelling. Got it,” Agatha said dryly.</p><p>“She has my phone,” Rio added. “I think. Or maybe I threw it.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her for a long moment, then slid her own phone out of her coat pocket and stood up. “Alright. Stay here. I’m going to find Alice.”</p><p>Rio saluted sloppily. “You’re very heroic.”</p><p>“Try not to steal any more drinks while I’m gone.”</p><p>“No promises,” Rio mumbled, her head lolling slightly to one side as Agatha disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>And just before sleep could claim her at the bar, Rio sighed and whispered to no one, “She’s definitely into me.”</p><p>Agatha moved through the crowd with sharp efficiency, scanning faces as bass-heavy music pulsed around her. It was like swimming through perfume, bodies packed together, limbs flailing, lights flashing in confusing colors. Finding one loud woman with red hair streaks in a club full of loud people was not exactly a promising mission.</p><p>But she found her. Eventually.</p><p>Alice was pressed up against the wall near the back of the club, thoroughly entangled with a tall bald woman in a floaty pink jumpsuit. They were deep into a make-out session, hands roaming, drinks forgotten on the floor at their feet. Agatha hesitated for half a second before clearing her throat, loudly.</p><p>No response.</p><p>She stepped closer and said, “Excuse me. Are you Alice?”</p><p>Alice peeled her mouth off the womans neck long enough to blink at her. “Who’s asking?”</p><p>“Your friend Rio is at the bar,” Agatha said, trying to keep her tone civil. “She’s very drunk. I don’t think she can get home safely on her own.”</p><p>Alice groaned like she’d just been asked to run a marathon. “Ugh. Again?” She glanced at the woman, then back at Agatha. “Is she crying or throwing up?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Is she bleeding?”</p><p>“…No.”</p><p>“Then put her in a cab.” Alice waved a hand. “She’s a professional. She’ll be fine. Just tell the driver her address is in her notes app.”</p><p>“She said you have her phone?”</p><p>“It’s inside her blazer probably.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, unimpressed. “Seriously?”</p><p>Alice was already turning back to her make-out partner. “She’ll live.”</p><p>Agatha stood there for a moment longer, jaw tight, before spinning on her heel and heading back toward the bar.</p><p>She spotted Rio right away-slumped against the counter, her blazer half-off her shoulder now, dangerously close to exposing her chest, eyes half-lidded. She looked like she was holding court with invisible dignitaries, mumbling to herself and occasionally laughing at a joke only she could hear.</p><p>When Agatha approached, Rio lit up like a streetlamp.</p><p>“You came back,” she said, grinning ear to ear. “I knew you would. You couldn’t stay away.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and gently took her elbow. “Your friend’s occupied. I’m putting you in a cab.”</p><p>Rio leaned in instantly, wrapping both arms around Agatha’s waist like they were long-lost lovers reunited. “That sounds so romantic. Take me home, lawyer lady.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back slightly, trying to pry her arms free, but Rio only clung tighter. “Rio..”</p><p>“I’m serious,” Rio said, resting her head on Agatha’s shoulder. “We can make out. I have wine. Or cheese. One of those. Possibly both.”</p><p>“I’m not taking you home.”</p><p>Rio leaned back, blinking slowly. “Oh my god. You have cheese, don’t you?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“You’re lying. You look like you have cheese.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, despite herself. “You’re drunk.”</p><p>“I’m a sexy drunk,” Rio corrected, raising a finger dramatically and nearly poking Agatha in the eye. “Very sexy. And smart. You could learn so much from me. In bed.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a breath, rubbing her temple. “I’m calling a cab.”</p><p>“To take me to my bed” Rio whispered conspiratorially, then tried to kiss her.</p><p>Agatha caught her face gently with both hands and redirected her so the kiss landed harmlessly on her cheek. “Alright, Casanova. Time to get you in one piece to a pillow that isn’t mine.”</p><p>Rio pouted, swaying slightly. “This is discrimination.”</p><p>“Against what?”</p><p>“Hot drunk professors.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Let’s go, Professor.”</p><p>And with one arm looped around Rio to keep her upright, she guided her slowly out of the club and toward the streetlights.</p><p>The night air hit Rio like a freight train. The moment they stepped out of the club and into the crisp darkness, she gasped dramatically and spread her arms as if being baptized in moonlight. “FRESH AIR!” she cried. “Agatha, this is incredible. Why don’t we live out here? Like-outside people.”</p><p>Agatha kept a steady grip on her elbow, steering her toward the curb. “Because we’re not raccoons.”</p><p>“I could be a raccoon,” Rio said proudly. “I’m resourceful. I could survive on trash.”</p><p>“I’m sure.”</p><p>Rio giggled, swaying in place while Agatha pulled out her phone to call a cab. She seemed fascinated by the passing headlights and waved to every car like they were old friends. “That one looked kind. That car had a kind face.”</p><p>“That's a Toyota Corolla, Rio.”</p><p>“She had gentle eyes.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She was too busy texting wanda to say she was leaving and checking the uber ETA. She glanced at Rio, then sighed as she realized she wasn’t going to be able to trust her to get in the cab alone. “Alright. I’m coming with you.”</p><p>Rio beamed. “I knew it. Agatha! You’re so into me.”</p><p>“I’m making sure you don’t choke on your own tongue.”</p><p>“Hot.”</p><p>“Where do you live?”</p><p>Rio gestured vaguely. “The place with the blue door. Or maybe red? I have a door.”</p><p>Agatha reached into her blazer pocket-dodging Rios mouth-and pulled out Rio’s phone. She unlocked it by holding it up to her face and found the address in a pinned note labeled In Case I Drink Too Much (Again)</p><p>A car pulled up, headlights flashing once, and Agatha opened the back door. She guided Rio in gently, which was like trying to fold a noodle into a suitcase. Once they were both inside, the door shut and the car pulled away from the curb.<br/>
For about thirty seconds, there was silence-peaceful, rare, filled with the soft hum of tires on asphalt.</p><p>Then Rio turned, grinning with a mischievous glint in her eye. “You’re in the cab with me. That’s practically second base.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Please don’t.”</p><p>But Rio was already leaning in, lips puckered in the least coordinated kiss attempt ever launched. Agatha braced a hand against her forehead mid-lunge, holding her at arm’s length.</p><p>“No. No kissing.”</p><p>Rio wriggled like a determined cat. “But we have chemistry!”</p><p>“You have tequila.”</p><p>“I could be such a good girlfriend!” Rio announced, voice muffled by Agatha’s hand. “Think about it. I know how to propagate succulents and I can bake sourdough when I’m sad!”</p><p>“Good qualifications,” Agatha said dryly. “But I don’t date people who-”</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>Without warning, Rio went rigid. Her face twitched, her brows furrowed and then she made a soft, ominous sound from deep in her throat.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Oh no. Rio. Don’t!”</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Rio turned suddenly, mouth half-covered, and vomited in a spectacular, technicolor mess across her own lap, the cab seat, and most unfortunately... Agatha.</p><p>There was a beat of silence.</p><p>Agatha stared down at the warm, horrifying splash soaking through the fabric of her very expensive clothing. Rio blinked slowly, clearly not understanding the full scope of what she’d done.<br/>
Then she looked up at Agatha, teary-eyed and pale, and whispered: “...I’m still sexy, right?”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. “Oh my god.”</p><p>The cab driver let out a low, disgusted groan from the front. “You owe me so much money.”</p><p>The stench hit Agatha first. Warm, acidic, and unmistakable, it soaked into her jacket and trousers. She stared down at the mess on her lap, her jaw locked tight. Rio, meanwhile, looked seconds away from either crying or falling asleep or both.</p><p>Agatha inhaled slowly, through her mouth. The stench clung to Agatha like betrayal.</p><p>She sat in the cab, soaked in Rio’s whiskey-laced vomit, blinking in stunned silence while Rio swayed beside her, drowsy and blissfully unaware of the full horror she’d just inflicted. Agatha turned her head slowly, like she was afraid moving too fast might make things worse.</p><p>Rio, teetering with a dopey smile, blinked up at her. “Still… hot?” she mumbled.</p><p>“Sir,” she said to the cab driver, her voice tight, controlled. “Please pullover.”</p><p>The driver did not hesitate. He yanked the car toward the curb and slammed it into park like he wanted them out yesterday. Agatha opened the door, stepped out with grim determination, and somehow managed to get Rio, half-conscious and muttering about spore reproduction, out of the back seat without slipping to brush as much vomit off as possible.</p><p>Fifteen minutes and several gags later, the cab pulled up in front of a brick building with a red door and crooked numbers on the front. Agatha got out first, shivering in her soaked clothes, and hauled the door open. Then, with the kind of strength only powered by adrenaline and rage, she lifted Rio out of the car and onto the sidewalk.</p><p>“Wait here,” she told the driver, her voice dangerously level.</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” he muttered. “Take your time. She’s a peach.”</p><p>Agatha found Rio’s keys, miraculously still in her purse, let them in, and half-dragged her down the narrow hallway. The apartment inside was small, warm, and unexpectedly charming: mismatched furniture, stacks of books, a wall of houseplants, and string lights still glowing from a half-hearted attempt at ambiance.</p><p>“Cute,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Rio flopped backward on the couch, limbs sprawling like she’d melted. “I live here,” she said proudly. “I have coasters.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her. Then at herself. Then at the puke on her coat.</p><p>She moved with precision now, tossing a blanket over Rio after helping her out of her blazer and trousers, yanking a trash bin beside the couch, and checking that a glass of water was within reach.</p><p>“Agatha,” she mumbled, eyes fluttering. “You smell like puke.”</p><p>“That’s because I’m wearing your digestive tract,” Agatha muttered, looking down her outfit with an expression of pure disgust.</p><p>Rio blinked up at her. “You’re really pretty.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed the edge of the blanket and tucked it around her. “Sleep, mushroom girl.”</p><p>Rio gave a sleepy little smile and murmured something incoherent.</p><p>“I’m gonna leave,” she said firmly.</p><p>Rio’s eyes fluttered open, barely. “You can stay, if you want. There’s room in my bed. It’s warm and has, what’s it called, ethical sheets.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “That’s tempting.”</p><p>“Ethical,” Rio repeated, snuggling into her throw pillow.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and turned toward the door, but then paused. Quietly, she reached back into Rio’s bag, fished out her apartment key again, and walked into the hall. She locked the front door from the outside, then bent down and slid the key back underneath, hearing it slide along the floor with a soft clink.</p><p>Only once the door was locked and Rio was safely passed out did she let herself breathe.</p><p>She walked back to the cab, peeling off her ruined coat with two fingers like it was radioactive, and climbed inside.</p><p>“Everything good?” the driver asked, nose wrinkling.</p><p>Agatha slumped against the seat. “She’s asleep. I locked her in.”</p><p>The driver glanced at her through the rearview mirror. “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha stared out the window, giving a tired nod, her blouse sticking to her skin, mascara slightly smudged, smelling of whiskey and regret.</p><p>The cab rolled to a stop in front of Agatha’s apartment building, the sky above beginning to bleed into that inky shade of pre-dawn blue. She was exhausted. Her jaw ached from clenching it for the past hour. Her coat was ruined, her silk blouse would never recover and she felt like she needed a shower, a hazmat team, and maybe a full-body exorcism.</p><p>The driver glanced back at her with a tired sort of sympathy.</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>“Thats $500. Cleaning fee included,” he said with a shrug. “Company policy. That, and the interior shampooing I’m about to need.”</p><p>She was tired. She was soaked. And the thought of dragging this out for another second made her want to scream.</p><p>She sighed, reached for her wallet, and handed over her card.</p><p>“Charge it. And for god’s sake, get the seats steam-cleaned.”</p><p>He took the card, ran it, and handed it back. “You need a drink. Or a nap. Or both.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply. She got out of the cab and walked up the steps to her apartment in silence, the hem of her coat slapping wetly against her legs. Inside, she peeled off her clothes the second the door shut behind her, dumping them straight into a trash bag without remorse. The shower was immediate and scalding. She scrubbed her skin like it owed her money.</p><p>When she was finally clean, dressed in a hoodie and sweatpants, and sitting on her couch with a mug of too-hot tea, she finally let herself... feel the night.</p><p>She shook her head slowly. “What the hell just happened?”</p><p>Rio had been chaotic. Charming, in a deeply unhinged way. And for a moment-before the vomit, before the surreal cab ride and the $500 lesson in poor decision-making when it came to hot drunk women - Agatha had felt something she hadn’t felt in a long time: interest. Curiosity. A weird, reluctant kind of... spark.</p><p>She reached for her phone out of habit, intending to check if Rio was okay. Then paused.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>She didn’t have her number.</p><p>Agatha blinked, staring at the screen like it had betrayed her. She didn’t have her number. Or her last name. She hadn’t saved the address Rio lived at. The only real detail she had was... mushrooms. Plants. A biology professor at the university.</p><p>She leaned back into the couch, groaning into her hands. “I let a woman throw up on me, put her to bed, and didn’t even get her number.”</p><p>She looked at the phone again, considering.<br/>
She could track her down. Probably. She was a lawyer, after all. A resourceful one.</p><p>But not tonight.</p><p>Tonight, she would finish her tea, wash her hair a third time, and try to forget that someone had whispered, ethical sheets,at her after projectile vomiting all over her lap.</p><p>Still... Agatha smiled despite herself, one brow arching. “…I kinda hope she remembers me.”</p>

<p>The first thing Rio registered was pain.</p><p>A dull, throbbing ache that seemed to pulse through her skull with every heartbeat. Her mouth felt like it had been stuffed with cotton, and her throat was raw, as if she’d been screaming at a concert the night before rather than downing copious amounts of burning liquid.</p><p>She groaned, her eyelids heavy. She blinked once, twice, then immediately wished she hadn’t. The light from the window stabbed into her brain like a thousand needles.</p><p>“Oh god.”</p><p>She tried to move, but the weight of her limbs felt like she was trapped in rock. Her body was sore, especially her legs, which felt like they’d been folded into positions they weren’t designed for on her sofa.</p><p>She squinted down, realising that her blazer was folded over the back of the chair, her trousers were completely missing.</p><p>Her eyes snapped wide open.</p><p>“Did I...?”</p><p>Rio’s heart rate quickened, and she shot up on the sofa, her mind racing back to the events of the night before. The club. The drinks. Agatha. She remembered the lawyer’s face, sharp and striking, a vision in a see of blurred faces, her ice-blue eyes that looked like they could freeze you in place... And the unsuccessful kiss attempts. And the vomit. A deep, mortifying flush spread over Rio’s skin as she buried her face in her hands.</p><p>“Oh god.”</p><p>She looked around her apartment, disoriented, realising the chaos of the night hadn’t exactly been contained in her body. There was a half-empty glass of water on the table, a pillow on the floor, and a lingering smell of alcohol and vomit in the air emitting from the trashcan at the side of her. Her stomach twisted again.</p><p>But nothing, nothing, compared to the memory of Agatha. The lawyer had been here.</p><p>And Rio had kissed her. Or, at least, tried to. She was pretty sure she’d tried to kiss her at least three times... and then there was the part where she puked on her. The panic was rising, but Rio tried to hold it back.</p><p>“No, no, no...” Rio muttered, rubbing her temples. “I did not puke on her. I didn’t. I was drunk. She’s fine. I’m fine. I’ll text her, no, I’ll call her. She probably won’t answer, but…”</p><p>Her mind was spiralling, and just as she was about to grab for her phone, something caught her eye. Her apartment door.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>The door showed as locked. And she distinctly knew that she always left it unlocked when she was drunk. Had she?</p><p>Her stomach dropped.</p><p>Had she locked me in? she thought, her mind spiralling. Had she really been that out of it that Agatha felt she needed to lock her in? The thought of Agatha being the one to lock her in, to keep her safe… the thought was almost too kind, too protective from someone she just met.</p><p>Rio stood, her legs wobbly, and walked cautiously to the door, her stomach twisted once more, but not with nausea. This time, it was a strange fluttering feeling, embarrassment mixed with a curious hope at the key that had been slid under the door.</p><p>“Shit,” Rio whispered to herself, feeling her face flush. She stared at the key in her hand, and just for a second, she almost smiled.</p><p>But then she remembered everything else. The puke. The drunken attempts at flirting. The humiliation.</p><p>“Okay. No. I’ll... deal with this later,” she muttered, shaking her head as if she could shake away the overwhelming rush of feelings.</p><p>She tossed the key on the counter and grabbed her phone, quickly texting her best friend, Alice:</p><p>“I need a hangover cure that works. I’ve made a mess of my life and I need you to fix it.”</p><p>She hit send. And then she let out a long breath, knowing she’d have to face the truth at some point.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>Rio sat across from Alice at their usual brunch spot, the clink of silverware and the hum of the café around her. But none of that mattered. Not when her brain was still trying to process the chaotic mess that had been the night before.</p><p>Her hand trembled slightly as she reached for her coffee. She took a sip, but the warmth didn’t do anything to settle the storm of beer fear swirling inside her chest. She could feel her heart pounding in her ears. Alice, as always, was unbothered, happily sipping on her mimosa while scrolling through her phone.</p><p>“So, spill,” Alice said, raising an eyebrow as she set the phone down and looked at Rio, a grin playing on her lips. “I need the details. Tell me everything.”</p><p>Rio’s heart nearly stopped. She stared at Alice, trying to form words, but it felt like her tongue had been replaced with sandpaper. She opened her mouth to speak but closed it again, feeling a lump rise in her throat. She could feel the colour draining from her face as the memories hit her all at once - Agatha’s icy blue eyes, her steady hands guiding Rio out of the bar, the tenderness that Rio hadn't deserved, the horror of puking on her, the vulnerability that still made Rio want to crawl into a hole and disappear.</p><p>“I don’t know what to say,” Rio finally choked out, her voice small, barely above a whisper. “I... made such a fool of myself, Alice. I don’t even have her number to apologise.”</p><p>Alice blinked, clearly taken aback by the sudden shift in Rio’s demeanour. “Whoa, whoa. What happened? You’re not still hungover, are you?”</p><p>“I—well yeah,” Rio muttered, nodding her head, her face burning. She took another sip of her coffee, but it did little to calm her nerves. “It’s... it’s about her. Agatha. The woman I was talking to.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened. “Wait - blue eyes and cheekbones for days? She asked about getting you home. I thought you said you weren’t that drunk!”</p><p>“I wasn’t!” Rio shot back, but it was a lame defense. Her face flushed harder, a mixture of embarrassment and self-loathing. She reached for a napkin and crumpled it in her hands. “I just... I don’t know what happened. I was... I was fine at first, you know? But then... I drank more, and... and I’m pretty sure I puked on her. In the cab.”</p><p>Alice blinked, then laughed. “Wait, you puked? On her. In a cab?” Her grin was half-adoring, half-poking fun, but it was a little too sharp, a little too on the nose for Rio’s fragile ego.</p><p>“I did…. I puked on her!” Rio’s voice broke. She pushed the napkin away in a frustrated gesture, slamming her palms flat against the table. Her head throbbed again, the shame so much worse than any hangover. “She was so nice to me, Alice. After... after I threw up all over her—all over her—she took care of me. She tucked me in. She locked my door.”</p><p>Rio paused, swallowing hard, her eyes glassy. “She... locked my door, Alice. I didn’t even ask her to. She just did it. She didn’t run away, she didn’t yell at me, she didn’t make me feel worse than I already did. And she didn’t make me feel like a burden.”</p><p>For a second, Alice was quiet, her usual teasing nature gone. She leaned in a little, resting her chin on her hand, watching Rio with a much softer expression.</p><p>“That’s... sweet,” Alice said slowly. “Did you have to pay a cleaning fee?”</p><p>Rio felt a tear slip down her cheek before she could stop it. “I don’t think I paid anything actually. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, Alice. She took care of me, and I don’t even know her last name to pay her back. I don’t have her number.”</p><p>Her breath hitched in her chest, and before she could blink, a wave of tears followed. She quickly wiped at her face, but the embarrassment of not having been able to hold it together in front of Alice only made her feel smaller. More exposed.</p><p>Alice’s face softened with concern. She reached across the table, placing a hand gently over Rio’s.<br/>“Hey, hey. It’s okay,” Alice said, her voice quiet, no longer teasing. “I get it. You’re feeling vulnerable. You puked. You’re mortified. But... Rio, from the sound of it, this woman chose to help you. She didn’t have to, but she did. She obviously saw something in you she liked.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened at Alice’s words. Her friend was trying to make her feel better, and for a second, it worked. But only for a second. “But I don’t know her,” Rio murmured. “I didn’t even get her number, and now... now I just feel like an idiot.”</p><p>“Well,” Alice said, raising an eyebrow, “there’s your problem, right? You let a hot woman take care of you and didn’t even get her number. Classic rookie move, Rio.”</p><p>“I wasn’t exactly in a position to be thinking straight,” Rio mumbled, still feeling the sting of her mistake.</p><p>Alice chuckled and gave Rio’s hand a comforting squeeze. “Look, if she really took care of you like that, she’s not going to mind you reaching out when you manage to track her down. And if she does? Screw her. But the fact that you’re sitting here, panicking over a woman you only just met? It shows theres something there.”</p><p>Rio sniffed, nodding as the weight on her chest lightened slightly. It was ridiculous, this crisis she was having over a single night. Over a single woman.</p><p>“You’re right,” Rio said quietly. She sighed, trying to compose herself. “I’ll figure it out. How many Lawyers have their own firm called Agatha?”</p><p>“There you go, positive thoughts,” Alice said, smiling warmly. “And don’t be so hard on yourself.”</p><p>Rio cracked a small smile, even if it didn’t quite reach her eyes yet. “Thanks, Alice. You’re the best.”</p><p>“I know,” Alice replied, with that trademark grin, before taking another sip of her mimosa.</p><p>Rio stared down at her coffee, still processing everything. Still unsure of how this would all play out. But for the first time that morning, she didn’t feel like she was going to implode.</p>

<p>The week had dragged on for Rio like a slow, torturous crawl.</p><p>Every morning, she told herself she was fine. She had work. She had students. She had responsibilities. But beneath the lectures and lesson plans, beneath the coffees and academic conversations, the memory of that night clung to her like static: I don’t even have her number.</p><p>She could’ve gone looking. Could’ve mustered the courage to march over to the law department and see if anyone knew of a lawyer named Agatha who had a firm locally. But the idea made her stomach twist. She had barely known her. And the version of herself that Agatha had seen? Drunk. Sloppy. Vomiting. That’s what she would be remembered as: the unhinged woman from the bar who couldn’t hold her liquor.</p><p>So she let it pass. One day. Then two. Then six.<br/>Every night she tried to convince herself, You missed your chance. She’s probably forgotten about you already. Or worse—she remembers everything. But her brain betrayed her with memories: the way Agatha had held her upright, her cool fingers steady on Rio’s arms, the gentleness in her voice as she’d helped her to her apartment, locking Rio’s door behind her.</p><p>There had been something there. A glimmer. A pull.</p><p>By the seventh day, Rio had managed to bury it enough to breathe without choking on regret and embarrassment. She stepped into the corner café near her apartment, craving caffeine.</p><p>But there she was.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>As soon as Rio stepped through the door, the air changed. The scent of roasted beans faded into white noise. Agatha stood at the counter, her long, chocolate-brown hair pulled into a perfectly chaotic curly bun. Even in profile, she exuded composure, the kind that made Rio instantly feel like a walking disaster and unworthy of her attention.</p><p>Rio froze, mid-step. Her body tensed, heart in freefall.</p><p>No. Nope. You’re not ready for this. Turn around. Pretend you forgot your wallet. Go back later.</p><p>But her legs wouldn’t move. She was rooted to the spot, painfully aware of the way her breath suddenly felt too loud in her chest.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t seen her yet. She was laughing softly with the barista, her voice a smooth making Rio’s knees weak. Just watching her speak made her remember that night all over again, how electric she felt under her gaze, how devastatingly charismatic she’d been, how she’d given Rio her full attention despite her being black out on tequila.</p><p>You puked on her. God, you puked on her.</p><p>The doorbell chimed behind her, but Rio didn’t move. Then Agatha turned.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>And in an instant, Rio was spiraling. Her stomach flipped, her mouth went dry. But Agatha’s expression didn’t recoil. Instead, her eyes softened. There was recognition. Then, unexpectedly, a slow, unmistakable smile.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha’s voice cut through the hum of the café. Warm. Curious. Not an ounce of disgust in it. “Wow. I didn’t expect to see you again.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard. “I—uh... hi,” she croaked. It was pathetic, nothing like the cool confidence she’d had with a multitude of drinks in her system. She wanted to melt into the floor.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, coffee cup in hand, her gaze steady, a mischievous glint in her eye. “You look a lot more sober than the last time I saw you.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flared red. “God. Please don’t remind me.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted, amused. “You mean the vomiting, or the part where you tried to convince me to live outside like a raccoon?”</p><p>Rio groaned, dragging a hand over her face. “Oh my God?! Why did I even—? Ugh. I’m so, so sorry. I wasn’t... I don’t usually—”</p><p>“Get wasted at bars and charm unsuspecting lawyers with tequila breath?” Agatha teased, eyes dancing.</p><p>“I was mortified,” Rio muttered, wishing she could just fast-forward through this whole conversation. “I woke up the next day convinced I’d dreamed you until I saw you’d locked me in. I could have died from sheer embarrassment.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again, soft, low, and warm. “I’m quite real. And you were surprisingly entertaining, especially when you insisted on showing me your spore print tattoo.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped. “I did not.”</p><p>“You absolutely did,” Agatha laughed, “right before you almost flashed the whole bar.”</p><p>“I’m going to crawl into a hole now,” Rio mumbled.</p><p>But Agatha just grinned wider, unbothered, her eyes catching the sunlight streaming through the window.</p><p>Her brain stuttered, flustered at the wave of pure desire that ran through her. Rio blinked. She didn’t know whether to apologize again. “You... didn’t have to take care of me. I don’t even remember how I got home.”</p><p>“We got a cab, that you puked in,” Agatha said simply. “I took you home. You didn’t give me much choice.’”</p><p>Rio stared at her in horror. “Kill me.”</p><p>“I didn’t mind,” Agatha said, more softly now. “You were... sweet. Ridiculous, but sweet.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, really looked at her, and saw the glint in Agatha’s eyes wasn’t mockery, it was interest. A curious little pull.</p><p>“I thought I’d never see you again,” Rio admitted. “I didn’t even get your number. I wasn’t sure if... I don’t know. If you’d want to hear from me.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression shifted, becoming quieter, more intent. “I wanted to,” she said. “But I made the same mistake. I didn’t get yours either.”</p><p>Rio’s heart stuttered.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha continued, setting her coffee down and pulling out her phone, “no time like the present. Can I have it now?”</p><p>“Y-Yeah, of course.” Rio fumbled with her phone. “It’s, um, 555-9234. Sorry, I’m, still nervous. You’re very... poised. It’s intimidating.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled as she typed. “I get that a lot. But I promise, I don’t bite.” She glanced up. “Unless asked nicely.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. That was definitely flirting. She almost dropped her phone. “I, wow. Okay,” she said, recovering. “I, uh, got your text.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said. “I’ve got court in twenty minutes so I can’t stay, but... I’d really like to get a drink. Or coffee. You choose.”</p><p>Rio met her gaze, suddenly steadier. “Both. Eventually. But let’s start with the drink.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile was slow and delicious. “I like how you think.”</p><p>“I’m free tomorrow,” Rio said, surprised at her own boldness. “If you are.”</p><p>“I’ll make time,” Agatha replied. “Text me. I’ll see you then, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>The way she said her name sent a ripple of heat down Rio’s spine.</p><p>“Looking forward to it,” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha gave her one last smile, then turned and walked out into the street.</p><p>Rio exhaled, finally able to breathe again.</p><p>Her phone buzzed a few minutes later.</p><p>Agatha: Really glad I saw you today. I’ll be thinking about that drink. Let me know what time and where</p><p>Rio read it twice. Then again.</p><p>Her fingers hovered, then she typed:</p><p>Rio: Thanks again for everything. I’m really glad we ran into each other. Witches road at 8pm, I’ll lay off the tequila and mushroom talk this time</p><p>She hit send with a grin and stepped back out into the city, latte in hand, feeling, for the first time in a long while, like maybe something good was just beginning.</p><p>She’d barely taken two steps down the block before she had her phone back in her hand.<br/>She wasn’t usually the kind of person who texted while walking, it was a pet peeve of hers, actually, but this wasn’t just anything. This was Agatha. The Agatha. The Agatha who had plaques her thought over the last week and now wanted to get a drink.</p><p>Her hands trembled a little as she opened her messages, thumbing into her conversation with her best friend.</p><p>Rio:<br/>Alice. Emergency. Not like, dying emergency. But like... feelings emergency.</p><p>Three dots blinked to life almost instantly. Alice<br/>didn’t play around.</p><p>Alice:<br/>You can’t just start with “emergency” and then pause. What happened. Are you alive. Is someone dead. Did you text your boss something unhinged again.</p><p>Rio:<br/>Worse. I saw Agatha. Like in the flesh. At the café. Just now. She was there. Standing. Existing. Looking like a goddess.</p><p>Alice:<br/>OH MY GOD. You mean The Lawyer?? Vomit Night Lawyer?? RIO.</p><p>Rio:<br/>I KNOW. She remembered me. And she smiled. Like, genuinely. Not in a “haha there goes the girl who threw up on me” kind of way. And she asked for my number. And she said she wanted to get a drink. Like. With me.</p><p>A short pause.</p><p>Alice:<br/>Okay but… that sounds like a date. A real date. Like, not a pity-coffee-for-the-messy-academic kind of thing. She asked you.</p><p>Rio stared at the screen.</p><p>Rio:<br/>BUT DOES IT??? Maybe she’s just being nice??? Maybe it’s like... post-traumatic politeness??<br/>Alice:<br/>Rio. Babe. She flirted with you the night you were slurring and talking about living outside as a raccoon. You think she’s not interested when you’re sober and adorable and visibly panicking in a café? Please.</p><p>Rio:<br/>I told her I’d lay off tequila and mushroom talk next time. Was that too much? Was that a weird thing to say? WHY DID I SAY THAT. What does it even mean?? I panicked. She’s going to think I’m obsessed with mushrooms.</p><p>Alice:<br/>You are obsessed with mushrooms.<br/>Obsessed with her, as well maybe. Which... you are. Also? She probably thought it was cute. If she laughed when you were blackout quoting plant facts, she’s into you. How did she look, btw?</p><p>Rio:<br/>Like a tragic poem in a legal drama. Like the boss fight in a romance visual novel. Like if a thunderstorm got a law degree.</p><p>Alice:<br/>I’m writing that down. Fucking poet</p><p>Rio:<br/>She said to text her time and place WHAT IF SHE DOESN’T COME???</p><p>Alice:<br/>Check in. Text her tomorrow. You’re not playing games. You’re being brave and hot and emotionally literate. But she will. She sounds into you</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, holding the phone to her chest for a moment like it might absorb her pulse and calm her down. She could still smell the faint trace of coffee on her hands, still see Agatha’s ice blue eyes glancing back at her before she’d stepped out into the street.</p><p>She pulled up Agatha’s message again, rereading it for the fifth time.</p><p>Really glad I saw you today. I’ll be thinking about that drink. Let me know what time and where</p><p>That didn’t sound like obligation. That sounded like interest. And not the “i feel sorry for you” kind.<br/>Rio's phone buzzed again.</p><p>Alice:<br/>You got this. Deep breaths. Wear those boots I like. And babe... it’s a date. Trust me.</p><p>Rio didn’t reply right away. She just smiled, tucked her phone into her coat pocket, and let herself feel the dizzy rush of hope. It buzzed in her chest like static electricity, messy, dangerous, impossible to ignore.</p><p>She was going to text Agatha in the morning. She was.</p><p>And maybe, just maybe, it was a date. She really, really hoped it was.</p>

<p>Rio had been awake since six.</p><p>Not for any particular reason other than the existential weight of her own gay panic pressing down on her chest like a warm, anxious cat.</p><p>She'd laid in bed for a full hour and a half just thinking about texting Agatha. Then she'd gotten up, made coffee, brushed her hair, changed her clothes three times, and still hadn't sent a message.</p><p>Now she was pacing her living room in socked feet, her phone clutched in both hands like it might explode.</p><p>Rio stared at her phone like it was a cursed artifact. Her thumb hovered an inch above the message box, paralyzed. She had composed three versions already, each one worse than the last, ranging from painfully enthusiastic to borderline apologetic.</p><p>Rio:<br/>Morning! Hope court went well yesterday! Just wanted to check in, are we still on for tonight?</p><p>She read it. Cringed. Deleted it.</p><p>Rio:<br/>Hi! Just checking to see if you’re still up for that drink tonight 😊 No pressure if not!</p><p>Nope. The emoji looked desperate. Too much. She deleted that one too.</p><p>“God, why is this so hard?” she muttered to no one, pacing her tiny kitchen. “It’s a text, not a blood oath.”</p><p>Eventually, she typed:</p><p>Rio:<br/>Good morning! Still good for drinks tonight?</p><p>Short. Normal. Safe. She hit send, flung her phone onto the counter like it might combust, and fled to brush her teeth again for no rational reason.</p><p>Three minutes later, the ping came.</p><p>She skidded back into the kitchen so fast her socks betrayed her on the tile, nearly sending her into the fridge.</p><p>Agatha:<br/>Definitely. I’m looking forward to it. 8pm still work for you?</p><p>Rio let out a noise that sounded like someone squeezing a balloon. She bit her lip, tried to be cool:</p><p>Rio:<br/>8 is perfect. And I promise, absolutely no vomiting tonight. Probably.</p><p>Agatha:<br/>I’ll hold you to that, Professor.</p><p>Then she laid the phone down like it was made of glass and threw herself face-first onto the couch with a muffled scream.</p><p>Alice:<br/>How’s it looking for the lawyer date????</p><p>Rio:<br/>It’s ON. 8pm.<br/>I have approximately nine hours to become a functioning adult.</p><p>Alice:<br/>Lies. You’ll be a beautiful disaster with killer eyeliner.<br/>Now go pick an outfit before your gay panic gives you hives. Hives are not hot.</p><p>7:58 p.m.<br/>Rio stood across the street from The Witches Road, her heart in her throat, her pulse hammering like a warning bell. She’d already passed the door twice, pretending to dig for something in her bag while trying not to visibly hyperventilate.</p><p>Her dress, an emerald green wrap number she hadn’t worn since her cousin’s engagement party, clung to her in a way that felt simultaneously elegant and deeply accusatory. Her heels were scuffed just enough to say “I’m casual” but polished enough to scream “I spent twenty minutes panicking about these.”</p><p>She tugged her coat tighter, stared at her reflection in the window, and winced. “I look like a raccoon in couture,” she muttered. “A raccoon who learned to walk upright five minutes ago.”</p><p>She turned to pace—just one more lap—when a voice stopped her.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>She spun around too fast, smacking herself in the face with her own hair, a strand sticking to her lipgloss.</p><p>Agatha stood there, serene and stunning in a tailored navy coat, the collar slightly popped, revealing a crisp white blouse and high-waisted plum trousers. She looked like she’d been styled by a magazine editor with a taste for courtroom drama.</p><p>“You’re early,” Rio blurted.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “You’re early. I’m exactly on time. I just arrived.”</p><p>“Oh. Right. Of course.” She gave a short, nervous laugh. “That’s… punctual. That’s normal.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile deepened, eyes dancing. “Shall we?”</p><p>Rio nodded too quickly, then stepped forward, only to catch her purse strap on the door handle. It yanked her sideways with a startled squeak.</p><p>“Ow, yep. Okay. Smooth entrance. Just keeping things... dynamic.”</p><p>Agatha reached forward, gently freeing the strap. “You’re doing fine. You look great.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “I, uh, you too. I mean. Obviously. You look like—like a really hot villain who wins the courtroom case and the protagonist.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “That’s… oddly specific. And flattering.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio breathed. “I talk too much when I’m nervous.”</p><p>“I noticed,” Agatha replied with a smile.</p><p>Inside, they were seated in a softly lit corner booth. Having decided to forgo the bar for the restaurant side for some small plates. Candles flickered, casting golden light over the dark wood table. The setting was intimate. Romantic. Dangerous.</p><p>Rio tried to sit gracefully and nearly missed the seat, catching herself at the last second by grabbing the edge of the table with a noise that definitely wasn't dignified.</p><p>Agatha, entirely composed, rested her chin on one manicured hand and regarded her like she was the most fascinating thing in the room.</p><p>“So,” she said, voice low and velvety, “tell me, are you always this nervous when you’re sober?”</p><p>Rio made a sound somewhere between a laugh and a small animal cry. “I, uh…no? Maybe? Depends. I’ve had caffeine. Does that count as a substance?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled. “Then I’m glad you’re caffeinated. I like this version of you.”</p><p>“You like… this?” Rio gestured vaguely at herself. “This twitchy, wind-up toy energy?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes sparkled. “It’s very expressive.”</p><p>Rio stared at her. “I’m… expressive?”</p><p>“You’re delightful.”</p><p>Delightful? Rio briefly forgot how to use her lungs.</p><p>Their server arrived. Rio ordered water first, then knocked over the glass while reaching for the wine menu. She nearly apologized three times before Agatha placed a steadying hand over hers for just a second, warm, calm, confident.</p><p>“It’s okay,” she said with a quiet smile. “Breathe.”</p><p>Rio nodded mutely. She was vaguely aware that Agatha ordered the wine for them - a bottle of red, local, something she said had “notes of dark fruit and enabled terrible decisions.” The cheese plate arrived. Rio accidentally stabbed a cracker instead of an olive.</p><p>But the thing was - Agatha laughed. Not at her. With her. Genuine, bright laughter with the occasional snort that made other people at nearby tables glance over in curiosity.</p><p>The more Rio fumbled, the more Agatha seemed charmed.</p><p>Rio laughed, relaxing a little. “Okay, your turn. Lawyer life. What’s your courtroom win rate?”</p><p>“Wouldn’t you like to know,” Agatha said, sipping her wine, her eyes sparkling. “Let’s just say... I’m very persuasive.”</p><p>Rio stared. Her mouth worked, but no sound came out for a second.</p><p>“...That was dangerously sexy,” she blurted.</p><p>Agatha laughed. “I was hoping you’d think that.”</p><p>Rio covered her face with both hands. “Please tell me I didn’t say that out loud.”</p><p>“Oh, you definitely did.”</p><p>The conversation flowed from there, easier than Rio could’ve hoped. They talked about teaching, about the absurdity of faculty meetings, about the worst student emails she’d ever received. Agatha had dry, biting humor, but everything she said to Rio was gentle, curious. Like she was interested, not just in Rio’s stories, but in Rio herself.</p><p>As the night went on, conversation flowed easier.</p><p>They talked about everything: Agatha’s worst opposing counsel story (involving a man who tried to flirt mid-deposition), even their mutual hatred of pineapple on pizza.</p><p>“Can I ask something?” Agatha said later, swirling the last of her wine.</p><p>“Sure,” Rio said, immediately drinking hers too fast and coughing a little.</p><p>“That night. Do you remember much?”</p><p>Rio groaned, covering her face. “Not as much as I wish. I remember… you. Mostly. You felt like the only stable thing in a room that was melting.”</p><p>Agatha smiled slowly. “You told me I had a trustworthy face.”</p><p>“Oh god.” Rio buried her face in her hands. “Please tell me I didn’t also cry about mushrooms.”</p><p>“You didn’t cry. But you did preach mushroom facts like you were on a mission from God. I learned a lot.”</p><p>Rio peeked through her fingers. “I should be embarrassed.”</p><p>“But I liked it,” Agatha said. “I liked you.”</p><p>And just like that, something in Rio softened. The tight coil in her chest eased. She sat back, grinning a little. “You’re either the kindest person alive, or a very convincing liar.”</p><p>“Can’t it be both?”</p><p>Outside, after the check was paid (by Agatha, who did it without fanfare and the same ruthless efficiency as a courtroom objection), they stood on the quiet sidewalk, streetlights catching the shine in Agatha’s hair.</p><p>Streetlights glowed amber, pooling warm light onto the sidewalk as if the city itself were conspiring to make this moment cinematic. Rio and Agatha lingered by the entrance, reluctant to let go of the evening.</p><p>The cold nipped gently at Rio’s cheeks, though she barely felt it. Her body buzzed with wine and nerves and something sparking dangerously close to joy.</p><p>“I had a really nice time,” Rio said, her voice softer now, more certain. Her breath misted in the chill air between them.</p><p>Agatha stood with her hands tucked into her coat pockets, head tilted like she was studying a painting she hadn’t quite finished admiring. “So did I. I hope it’s not the last.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth, then hesitated, biting her bottom lip. “Can I ask a potentially humiliating question?”</p><p>Agatha raised one elegant brow. “Only if I get to answer it dramatically.”</p><p>Rio laughed, nervously. “Was this… a date?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She stepped forward instead, slow and deliberate, until she was standing just close enough that Rio could smell her perfume again, dark rose, cedar, and something that made Rio’s thoughts fuzz around the edges.</p><p>“I thought it was,” Agatha murmured. “But I didn’t want to assume. Did you… not want it to be?”</p><p>“No, I did,” Rio rushed out, hands fluttering uselessly before she jammed them into her coat pockets. “I just didn’t want to be that person who reads way too much into politeness and, you know, oxygen shared in the same space—”</p><p>“You are exactly that person,” Agatha said, smiling. “And it’s endlessly charming.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her, a little dizzy. “Charming,” she echoed weakly. “Huh. Okay.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment longer, then reached out, her hand brushing Rio’s arm, lightly at first, then more firmly, anchoring her in place.</p><p>“Would it terrify you,” Agatha said, voice low and smooth as velvet, “if I kissed you right now?”</p><p>Rio made a small sound that might’ve been a yes or no or a spiritual awakening.</p><p>“I’ll take that as a ‘please proceed,’” Agatha murmured.</p><p>She leaned in, slow enough that Rio had time to panic, to process, to thrill in every breath of space closing between them. Her fingers gently cupped Rio’s cheek, her thumb brushing just beneath her jaw.</p><p>And then she kissed her.</p><p>It wasn’t rushed. It wasn’t hesitant. It was a kiss that said I know exactly what I want. Confident. Careful. Deliciously certain.</p><p>Rio melted. That was the only word for it. Her knees threatened mutiny, her heart tried to climb out of her chest, and she had no idea what her hands were doing, one clutched awkwardly at her purse strap while the other sort of hovered before finally landing on Agatha’s arm.</p><p>When Agatha pulled back, just enough to look at her, Rio was breathless, stunned, and very close to collapse.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio whispered, lips tingling.</p><p>“Still terrified?” Agatha asked, a little teasing.</p><p>Rio’s laugh came out breathless. “A bit.”</p><p>“Want to do it again?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “I—uh—yes? Definitely. But also, maybe give me five seconds to reboot my brain.”</p><p>Agatha laughed quietly, brushing her thumb along Rio’s cheek once more before stepping back. Not far. Just enough to let the night breathe around them again.</p><p>“Let me take you out. Tuesday?” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“Tuesday,” Rio echoed, barely above a whisper. “Perfect.”</p><p>Agatha turned to go, walking away with that same quiet grace, but just before she reached the corner, she glanced back, one last lingering look, a smile that curled like an invitation.</p><p>Rio stood there, dazed, the warmth of Agatha’s lips still burning on hers, the shape of her hand still cradling her cheek.</p><p>She pulled out her phone with trembling fingers.</p><p>Rio:<br/>OH MY GOD SHE KISSED ME<br/>IT WAS A DATE<br/>SHE CONFIRMED<br/>SHE TOUCHED MY FACE<br/>SHE KISSED ME<br/>SHE KISSED ME !<br/>I AM ACTUALLY DEAD<br/>I HAVE DIED</p><p>Alice:<br/>I KNEW IT<br/>THIS IS NOT A DRILL<br/>YOU GOT KISSED BY A HOT LAWYER<br/>I expect a second date outfit, a third date strategy, and possibly a ring by next summer</p><p>Rio:<br/>I THINK I’M IN LOVE<br/>OR HAVING A STROKE<br/>BUT IN A GOOD WAY</p><p>She stared up at the stars, dazed, lips parted in disbelief and awe.</p><p>This time, there wasn’t doubt. There was a kiss to prove it.</p>

<p>Epilogue – One Year Later</p><p>Rio was drunk. Stupid drunk. Blackout, obliterated  drunk, tequila-soaked, gin-heavy, and powered at this point purely by alcohol. Rio was gone. Drunk in a way that defied physics, common sense, and the very concept of shame.</p><p>She clung to Alice with the full force of someone whose feet no longer trusted gravity. They were tucked into a corner booth at The Witches Road, which was spinning just a little too much for Rio’s taste. Either that or the planet had decided to do a funky little jazz number. She couldn’t be sure.</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Rio slurred, pointing vaguely in the direction of no one, “that cordyceps are fascinating. They zombify ants. Zombify. That’s a real word. Like. In science.”</p><p>Alice snorted into her gin and tonic. “You’re officially in plant fact mode so I’m calling it, you’re wasted.”</p><p>“I’m not wasted,” Rio said indignantly, spilling a little on her own lap. “I’m being educational.”</p><p>“Rio, you just tried to put your coat on upside down and told the coat rack it was doing ‘amazing work.’”</p><p>Rio gasped, scandalized. “Because it is! It’s so loyal. Standing there. Holding things. Every day. Every damn day.”</p><p>Alice looked around for someone to save her.</p><p>Rio’s chin hit the table as she tried to rest her head and missed her hand. “Photosynthesis,” she said dreamily. “You know about it? Plants just… make food out of light. Light. That’s witchcraft, Alice. Witchcraft.”</p><p>“I do know about it, yes,” Alice muttered, patting Rio’s shoulder. “You also explained it to the bar tender. Twice.”</p><p>Rio blinked blearily, eyes glazed with passion and alcohol. “Did I mention that ferns are older than dinosaurs? That’s why I respect them.”</p><p>“Only six times.”</p><p>“And moss,” Rio whispered. “Moss doesn’t care about time. It just… is. Like you. You’re like moss.”</p><p>Alice sighed, tapping her phone.</p><p>“Mushrooms!” she shouted, standing up on the edge of the booth. “They’re not plants! They’re closer to animals! And they can talk to each other underground!”</p><p>Alice, slumped back with a drink clutched between two fingers and the look of someone who’d aged five years in one night, groaned into her glass.</p><p>“You said that already.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “I did?”</p><p>“You did.”</p><p>Rio, barely listening, was now staring toward the bar. Her eyes widened. She reached out, whacking Alice in the arm with all the grace of a stunned pigeon. “Oh my god. Look. Look. Look at that woman.”</p><p>Alice followed her gaze, confused. “What woman?”</p><p>“That one,” Rio breathed, pointing with awe. “Brunette. Tall. Immaculate. Oh my god. She’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>Alice looked again.</p><p>“Oh thank god.”</p><p>Rio struggled to her feet like a baby deer learning to walk, smoothing her hair and missing entirely.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she whispered again, breathless. “Alice. Alice. Look. Look at that woman. LOOK AT HER. ARE YOU LOOKING!”</p><p>Alice sighed. “Rio…”</p><p>“She’s stunning,” Rio gushed. “Like… like a vogue model and a disney villain all in one.”</p><p>“Where are you going?” Alice asked, alarmed as Rio nearly face planted trying to climb out.</p><p>Rio grabbed her sleeve with both hands and whispered, “There’s a goddess at the bar.”</p><p>Alice didn’t even look, too busy trying to steady her best friend. “Please stop.”</p><p>“She’s gorgeous. I bet she smells like danger and azaleas. I would die for her. Right now. On this floor.”</p><p>Alice muttered, “I know you would.”</p><p>Rio ignored her completely, staggering to her feet like a reanimated corpse, limbs twisting unnaturally as she shook Alice off.</p><p>“Wait, Rio” Alice reached out, but Rio was already weaving toward the bar like a determined raccoon who’d seen something shiny.</p><p>At the bar, Agatha sat waiting, poised, hair swept back, trench coat open just enough to hint at a loose blouse and high-waisted slacks. She watched Rio’s approach with clear amusement.</p><p>Rio stopped three feet away, blinking hard.</p><p>“Oh,” she breathed. “Oh no.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Problem?”</p><p>“You,” Rio whispered. “You’re… you’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. Like, criminally. I think I’m having heart palpitations. Your like a thunderstorm. Should I be sitting? I can’t tell. I might need an ambulance.”</p><p>Agatha hid a smile. “Maybe you should sit down a minute.”</p><p>“I can’t. If I sit I’ll fall in love harder.” Rio pressed a hand over her heart. “Please. I’m begging. Just give me a chance. One chance. I will love you forever. I’ll make you breakfast in bed. I’ll compost. I’ll give you flowers. Just—just let me try.”</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha said, swirling her soda. “That’s quite the offer.”</p><p>Rio nodded furiously. “I’m very loyal. I’ll make the best girlfriend I promise you ? You’re perfect.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip to stifle a laugh. “So you’re single, then?”</p><p>“I must be,” Rio said. “Because there’s no way I’d cheat. Not even in a dream. Unless you asked me to. Then I might consider it. Ive never been drawn to anyone like this before.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Wow.”</p><p>“I would build you a library,” Rio continued, wobbling slightly as she stepped closer. “And organize it alphabetically and by genre for you.”</p><p>“Thoughtful.”</p><p>“I’m a mess,” Rio said suddenly, eyes glassy. “But I would try. For you. I would try so hard.”</p><p>Agatha set her drink down, leaning closer. “Rio.”</p><p>Rio froze. “How do you know my name? Are you a witch? Oh my god, I knew it.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, taking Rio’s hand gently “Sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her. “Wait. Your voice is so sexy... and it sounds familiar.”</p><p>“Does it?”</p><p>Rio stepped even closer, close enough to smell Agatha, “You smell like my dreams.”</p><p>“Try again.”</p><p>Rio squinted, swayed, then gasped. "Wait. You’re not, are you, AGATHA?!”</p><p>Agatha gave a little bow of acknowledgment. “In the flesh.”</p><p>Rio’s face collapsed like a sandcastle at high tide. “NO. NO. OH MY GOD. I HIT ON MY OWN GIRLFRIEND.”</p><p>“You did.”</p><p>“I begged you to give me a chance!”</p><p>“You did.”</p><p>“I meant it!” she wailed. “I still mean it!”</p><p>Agatha laughed loud and bright. “I know you do.”</p><p>“I said I’d make breakfast in bed for you.”</p><p>“I’m going to hold you to that.”</p><p>“I flirted with you like I didn’t know you,” Rio whimpered. “I said you smelled like danger and azaleas. I tried to seduce my own girlfriend like she was a stranger.”</p><p>Alice walked closer, held up her phone. “I recorded it. For science.”</p><p>Rio covered her face with both hands. “I need to go lie down in a bog for a hundred years. Let moss grow over me. Become folklore.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her hands gently away from her face, holding them in hers. “You know,” she said, voice soft, “I kind of like being hit on by you. Even if you don’t recognize me while doing it.”</p><p>“I’m a disgrace,” Rio groaned.</p><p>“You’re adorable.” Agatha leaned in and kissed her forehead. “And mine. Even when you’re slurring mushroom facts and propositioning me with plant metaphors.”</p><p>Rio blinked, tearing up slightly. “Wait, I did that?”</p><p>“You asked if I wanted to ‘forage together forever.’”</p><p>“Oh my god.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, slipping an arm around her waist. “Come on, my little fungi. Let’s get you home.”</p><p>Rio buried her face in Agatha’s coat. “I’m the worst girlfriend in the world.”</p><p>“You’re the drunkest. There’s a difference.”</p><p>Rio leaned into her side, dramatically. “I love you so much it hurts.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>They passed the coat rack, Rio paused and gave it a solemn nod.</p><p>“You’re doing great,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio clutched Agathas arm as they exited the building, sniffing. “You’re not mad?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said warmly. “Honestly, it’s the most fun I’ve had all week.”</p><p>“I’ll still love you forever,” Rio mumbled. “Even if I forget again.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, grinning as she helped her girlfriend through the door, letting Alice climb in as she buckled Rio in like a toddler to the passenger seat.</p><p>Rio clung to Agatha’s arm like it was her only tether to the mortal realm.</p><p>“I love you so much,” she sniffled. “Like, so much it’s physically upsetting. I feel like there are bees in my chest. Friendly bees. But still, bees.”</p><p>Agatha kept one hand on the wheel, the other casually holding Rio’s hand in her lap. Her expression was calm, save for the slight twitch of her lips that betrayed her amusement.</p><p>“I know,” she said softly.</p><p>Alice, lounging in the back seat, phone in hand and recording everything, cleared her throat dramatically. “Tell us more about the bees, Romeo.”</p><p>Rio twisted around, wide-eyed. “They buzz every time I look at her! Every time she breathes, I want to cry and propose!”</p><p>“You did propose,” Alice said. “A minute ago when she was wrestling you into the seat like a damn child.”</p><p>“I stand by that decision,” Rio said, offended. “I should marry Agatha. She deserves everything. The stars. My organs. The moon.”</p><p>“Spoken like a stable, sober woman,” Alice muttered.</p><p>Rio turned back to Agatha, teary-eyed. “Would you marry me?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss a beat. “Is this the fourth or fifth time tonight Alice that she’s proposed marriage?”</p><p>“I’m serious!” Rio sobbed, flinging her arms around Agatha’s shoulder even as she drove. “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me. You’re, like, the human version of a perfectly shelved library and a thunderstorm and emotional security!”</p><p>“I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p>“You’re so beautiful it makes me mad!” Rio wailed. “And you’re nice! And smart! And your eyebrows are like, like daggers of seduction!”</p><p>Alice howled with laughter in the back. “Daggers. Of seduction. Oh, I’m writing that down.”</p><p>Rio sniffled, burying her face into Agatha’s arm. “You smell like… Expensive fabric. Probably have high credit. I bet you floss. I love you.”</p><p>Agatha patted her thigh calmly. “Thank you, darling.”</p><p>“I don’t deserve you.”</p><p>“You’re enthusiastic. That counts for something.”</p><p>“I want to build you a house. Like a tiny one. A mushroom house. I’ll learn how to use tools. Dangerous ones.”</p><p>“I know you will.”</p><p>Alice leaned forward between the seats. “Hey, do you remember earlier when you called her a ‘sexy stranger’ and told her you were tragically single?”</p><p>Rio gasped. “I would never!”</p><p>“You did. I have video. You were crying.”</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha, horrified. “I didn’t mean it. I forgot. I forgot you were mine, and I flirted with you like a heathen, and you were so nice about it, and I don’t deserve, oh no it’s happening again.”</p><p>Real tears. Actual sobbing. Wet, dramatic, snotty sobbing into Agatha’s coat.</p><p>“I just—hic—you’re the best person I’ve ever known, and I’m a disaster, and you’re always so calm and so hot and so competent and…”</p><p>Agatha pulled over gently in front of their building and put the car in park. She turned and wiped Rio’s tears with a handkerchief she’d clearly planned ahead for.</p><p>“Rio,” she said, gently but firmly. “You’re drunk. You’re dramatic. And I absolutely adore you.”</p><p>Rio sniffed. “Really?”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, kissed her lightly on the lips, and whispered, “Yes. Even like this.”</p><p>Alice groaned. “Ugh. Gross. I’m third-wheeling a romance movie.”</p><p>Rio turned to the back seat with intense sincerity.</p><p>“Alice, if I die, tell Agatha I wanted to name our baby after endangered plants.”</p><p>“You just told her, babe.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio blinked. “Okay. Good. That’s covered.”</p><p>Agatha opened the passenger door and got out, rounding the car. Rio immediately slumped sideways like her bones had been turned to soup.</p><p>Alice unbuckled and got out too, still snickering.</p><p>“Hey, try not to propose to the elevator this time, yeah?”</p><p>“I’m making no promises,” Rio muttered.</p><p>Agatha pulled her upright, threading her arm around Rio’s waist.</p><p>“I’m gonna marry you,” Rio whispered again as Agatha guided her up the steps.</p><p>“I look forward to the formal proposal,” Agatha said smoothly. “When you're not sobbing into my coat and calling me .”</p><p>“The hottest thunderstorm in the world,” Rio whispered fiercely.</p><p>Alice, still filming: “This is gonna be my maid of honor speech. Just raw footage. Nothing added.”</p><p>And as they made their way inside, with Agatha calmly supporting the chaotic, tear-soaked mess she loved, Rio blinked up at her and said, voice thick with wine and awe: “I don’t remember how I got so lucky. But I’m not letting you go. Not ever. Not even if I forget again.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her on the cheek. “Don’t worry, love. I’ll always remind you.”</p><p>Alice stepped inside behind them, phone still recording and cackling. “I have two hours of footage. I’m going to edit it into a documentary called The Many Drunken Lives of Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha closed the door behind them with a sigh that was part exhaustion, part patience.</p><p>Rio turned in a wobbly circle in the entryway. “Our house smells like safety and expensive candles. I love it here.”</p><p>“You live here,” Agatha reminded gently, placing a hand on her back to steer her toward the couch.</p><p>“I know,” Rio said, dramatically throwing herself facedown onto it. “That’s why I’m crying again.”</p><p>She wasn’t, yet but tears were clearly coming.</p><p>Alice tossed her own coat on the chair. “How did I survive this before you existed in our lives?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha said, expression amused, walking calmly toward the kitchen to grab a glass of water and a bowl.</p><p>From the couch, a groan echoed.</p><p>“Something’s wrong,” Rio whimpered. “The room’s doing that thing where it spins like it’s been possessed.”</p><p>Alice leaned over the back of the couch. “That’s called drinking half the bar.”</p><p>Rio rolled to her side with great effort. “I feel like a regret-flavored cocktail.”</p><p>Alice blinked. “What the actual hell does that mean.”</p><p>Before anyone could find out, Rio bolted upright, eyes wide. “Oh no—oh no no no—”</p><p>Agatha was there in two strides. “Bathroom. Now. Let’s go.”</p><p>She guided Rio with practiced efficiency down the hall. Moments later, the sound of dramatic retching echoed through the apartment.</p><p>Alice winced. “Jesus.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice floated out calmly. “You’re okay. You’re okay sweetheart. Just breathe.”</p><p>Another retch.</p><p>“Water's here. Hair's out of the way. You’re safe, sweetheart.”</p><p>Alice wandered toward the bathroom, lingering just outside the door. “Do you need anything? Water? A mop? A whole new human body?”</p><p>From the bathroom, Rio croaked, “Tell my houseplants and babies I loved them.”</p><p>Alice cackled and wandered off again.</p><p>Inside, Agatha sat on the cool tile floor behind Rio, one hand gently holding her hair back, the other stroking her back in slow, grounding circles.</p><p>She didn’t flinch. Didn’t grimace. Just held space for Rio’s body to do what it needed to.</p><p>Eventually, the nausea passed, and Rio slumped against the wall, exhausted and clammy. Her eyes were glassy but sincere.</p><p>“You’re too good for me,” she mumbled. “You’re holding my hair. I’m, like, vomiting, and you’re still here.”</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha said simply. “This doesn’t bother me.”</p><p>“It should.” Rio blinked at her. “I threw up and an entire emotional breakdown.”</p><p>“I noticed.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward suddenly, swaying slightly.</p><p>“But you shouldn’t be the one dealing with this! You’re the one with a baby inside you! You should be the one puking!”</p><p>Agatha froze, glancing to the door where Alice was a moment ago.</p><p>Rio blinked. “Wait. Did I say that out loud?”</p><p>Agatha slowly tilted her head, lips quirking into a soft, knowing smile. “Yes. Yes, you did.”</p><p>“Oh no,” Rio whispered, eyes wide. “I ruined it. I ruined the secret. I’m not supposed to tell anyone, right? That’s what we said, right? We said, oh god, I’m crying again—”</p><p>And she was, full-blown blubbering now, face buried in her knees.</p><p>“I was gonna make a scrapbook! And get, like, a mushroom onesie! I RUINED THE MOMENT.”</p><p>Agatha, cool as ever, wrapped an arm around her shoulders and pulled her into a hug. “It’s okay, my love.“</p><p>“You should be the one throwing up,” Rio whimpered into her chest. “You’re making a whole human, and I’m just over here, drunk and crying and full of cocktails and tequila.”</p><p>From the hallway, Alice shouted: “WAIT - YOU’RE PREGNANT?”</p><p>Rio shrieked. “OH GOD, ALICE IS HERE?!”</p><p>Alice reappeared in the doorway, slack-jawed, holding her phone again. “You didn’t tell me? I’m your best friend! I need to know these things!”</p><p>Rio curled tighter into Agatha’s side, now too far gone to process anything but emotion. “I’m gonna be a mushroom mom.Like a fun gay mom but for spores. I don’t know what that means but I feel it.”</p><p>Agatha kissed the top of her head. “You’re going to be the best mushroom mom in the world.”</p><p>Alice wiped away an invisible tear. “This is the most chaotic domestic bliss I’ve ever witnessed. I love it here. I’m never leaving.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio sniffled, muffled by Agatha’s shirt. “But you clean the bowl.”</p><p>Alice recoiled. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>Agatha just smiled, still stroking Rio’s hair as she melted quietly into her lap.</p><p>And in that moment, vomit, chaos, confessions, and all, it was clear: This wasn’t just a mess.</p><p>It was theirs.</p>
