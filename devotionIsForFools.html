<h2 class="toc-heading">Devotion is for fools</h2>
<div class="userstuff">
<p> Agatha was seven years old when she learned that loving women was a sin. She sat uncomfortable in the wooden pews, legs tangled together as she tried to ignore the ache down her back. Her mother shot her warning glances every time she shifted in her seat. She’d heard a million times how the other girls managed to keep still during the service, why couldn’t she do the same?</p><p> The coven knew all the religious drivel to be nonsense, but to keep up appearances they had to act like the other townsfolk did. At that age she had already picked up on the ridiculousness of it all. Since she was able to read and write she had learned of Hecate, of spirituality and magic. Power was shared between her sisters, not held by a man in the sky. But she found it curious the lessons that her sisters seemed to take from the services when behind closed doors they would laugh at the naivety of the townsfolk. They continued to dress modestly when alone in their groups. There was a certain solemnness in the manner of the older witches, particularly her mother, that matched that of the devout townsfolk. Life was to be devoted to a higher power, they just disagreed over which one.</p><p> The preacher's voice boomed over the congregation, spit flying out of his mouth as he spoke his words of peace with rage. There had been some scandal in a nearby village, Agatha was too young to quite understand the details. “In this town, under the eyes of God, man shall lie with his wife, and anyone who does otherwise is a sinner.” He growled his words, eyes fiery with indignation. “A man wanting to commit perverse acts with another man is evil. A man doing such things is possessed by the devil! He shall have no place here, I shall banish him to the depths of hell!” </p><p> People clapped widely throughout the congregation. Some worriedly looked at their children and covered their ears, others eagerly awaited more, like chicks awaiting food from their mother. Agatha’s mother was the latter, nodding her head sagely, in a rare show of open agreement of the words the preacher spoke. </p><p> “And as for women,” he laughed darkly. “Any woman taken by another has fallen to the temptations of a witch! They are no less sinners than the perverse men.”</p><p> Agatha chuckled. It was funny to her what the regular people thought of witches. She turned to face her mother, hoping to see the same reaction, but was instead met with an icy glare. Her smile dropped and she quickly turned her face down to look at her hands. Stupid. She should have known mother would not find humour in such a thing. </p><p> She supposed the mortals were right. She only saw men and women together. That was the natural order of the world. Babies came from a husband and his wife, there was no mention of a woman and a woman or a man and a man being together in a union in any of the old teachings. </p><p> She kept her head down and her hands pressed together until the end of the service. It was different from previous ones. People murmured and shook their heads as they left, an air of righteous disgust floating through the crowd.</p><p> She walked stoically behind her mother, careful not to trip on the ends of her cloak. When they got home her mother gave her a sharp word about laughing during the ceremony.</p><p> Agatha kept her head down as her mother berated her. “I’m sorry mother. I thought the mention of witches was funny. I was wrong.”</p><p> “You must never give away our secret Agatha. They would treat you worse than if you were a perverse being like they mentioned today.”</p><p> Agatha nodded, thoughts whirling round her head. Was it really wrong? She got confused over what the witches agreed with the mortals on, there were so many contradictions. </p><p> “Mother?” She asked quietly. </p><p> Her mother sighed. “What is it?” At that age her mother still had patience with her. Her motherly instincts hadn’t quite yet been eroded away with bitterness and rage.</p><p> “Do we agree with them, about the women being with women?” </p><p> Her eyes darkened. Agatha bit her lip, hands worrying behind her back as she instantly regretted asking the question. </p><p> “Yes,” she said curtly. She leaned down and held her face, fingers pressing into her cheeks. “It would be an abomination. <em>You</em> are not like that Agatha, none of us are. The ones that fall for that are foolish mortals who cannot resist evil temptation. We are better than that.” </p><p> Agatha nodded quickly, her heart beating fast in her chest. “Yes mother, I understand.” </p><p> Her mother watched her for a beat then let go. “Go clean your room, I will call you down for lunch in an hour.” </p><p> She ran to her room and sat curled on her bed. She pulled out her little book where she kept her notes from class and turned to the last page. It was where she kept her notes from church when there was something her coven said she also had to learn. </p><p> Underneath her notes about dressing modestly and acting humble in public, in neat black letters she wrote today's lesson. <em>Loving women is a sin. </em></p><p>Agatha was thirteen years old when she first became infatuated with a girl. She was two years older than her and sat next to her during lessons. Long blonde hair floated down her back, and round green eyes sparkled with mirth every time she talked to her. While the other girls in her class found her pitiful and useless, Martha found her harmless. “You’re so cute,” she used to say whenever Agatha would speak to her in class, and Agatha would blush and fluster. </p><p> She began to look forward to actually going to school rather than it feeling like an exercise in futility. She would giggle with Martha as they ridiculed the slog of readings they were to get through to supposedly strengthen their magic in practice. They would draw little characters in the corners of their pages and make them come to life, running across the pages to keep her mind otherwise occupied. One time she cut out and drew a caricature of their teacher with warts and hair sticking out of her chin, and then enchanted it to walk around on wobbly paper legs around their desk. Martha had cried with laughter, and Agatha had never felt so proud. </p><p> But she was worried. She was able to grasp the basic concepts of magic. She could make objects appear and reappear with a wave of the hand. She could make her classmates float with a flick of a finger, although the fierce reprimand she got from her teacher and then mother made her never try it again. Yet she couldn’t find a speciality like all the other witches had. She had tried her hands at potions and nearly burnt her eyebrows off. Divination had been lost on her, how was she supposed to know what a vague blob of tea leaves meant? They had suggested they take a break before looking at other options like a protection witch, but Agatha had a feeling that would be lost on her too</p><p> Mother was clearly disappointed. Her teacher had told mother that Agatha was a distant and lazy student, unwilling to push her mind further than what was taught to her. Evanora had howled at her, asking how she could call herself a Harkness when all she wants to do is sit idle. </p><p> Agatha had bit back righteous anger. How dare her teacher call her lazy? She was anything but. All the concepts her teacher taught her came to her as easy as breathing, if she hadn’t already worked out how to do them before. She didn’t need to know the exact history and process of how to turn water into wine if she could do it with her eyes closed. She was distant in class because she was thinking of a world bigger than the coven. She’d picture herself somewhere far away, exotic flowers and trees lining the path she walked. She was strong and confident and in control of her power. Sometimes, when she let herself fully dream, her hand would be in Martha’s too. </p><p> She knows she’s meant to be modest. She knows she’s not meant to be proud. But sometimes she feels like she’s destined for more. She can feel her magic thrumming beneath her skin, just waiting to burst free. Agatha just doesn’t know what will unleash it. She’s tried before. She’ll take herself to the outer corners of the woods and yell and scream and throw her arms at a tree, hoping something will come from within her. Nothing ever comes. </p><p> Late at night is the worst. When she can’t sleep, and even the thoughts of Martha’s kind smile and laugh can’t soothe her, her magic is all she can hear. She can feel it trying to break through the confines of her skin, itching and aching to be released. </p><p> She tried to tell mother but she simply rolled her eyes. “Don’t be so dramatic Agatha, if it’s that bad then go put the work in to find out what it is to be used for.”</p><p> She had shyly confided in Martha who smiled sympathetically. “I’m sure you will work it out soon. Maybe your power isn’t conventional. You could be like one of the special ones we read about. Maybe you can raise the dead,” she said, wriggling her fingers and laughing. </p><p> Agatha’s face dropped. “I don’t want to be a bad witch,” she said quietly. </p><p> “Sorry,” she said quickly, shaking her head. “You won’t be. You’ll be something really powerful though, I can feel it.” Agatha was about to rebuke her, but bit her tongue when she saw the confidence in her eyes.</p><p> Martha was a clairvoyant witch. When Agatha had first found out her stomach had dropped, and after class she ran to her mothers library to discover ways to seal off her mind to a mindreader. She had stayed up all night exercising how to protect herself against wandering minds, and the next morning came to class prepared. When Martha saw her, her smile slightly faltered, but she mentioned nothing and talked to her as normal.</p><p> Agatha had pushed down the reasons for needing to seal off her thoughts to Martha. She thought of Martha as a friend, that was all. After being neglected from her peers for so long it was nice for someone to see her as normal and not a failure. When her gaze lingered on her hands and lips for too long, or the flames of jealousy burnt through her when she saw her talking to another girl, it meant nothing. </p><p> </p><p> Agatha was fourteen when she first met death. </p><p> She was to try her hand at protection spells to see if that was where her specialty power lay. It was arranged for after the church service, one of the girls her age who had already realised her power was to help her. She was one of Martha’s friends, Esther. Agatha didn’t like her, she found her saccharine sweetness false and excessive, but to appease her mother she agreed to it.</p><p> She sat in the church service, mind wandering as it always did to pass the hour before she was free. She still found no point to her and her coven attending. Now she was older, she knew that the townsfolk found them strange and different, what was the point of trying to fit in? Still, she was bound to this chore every week for the foreseeable. </p><p> To the left in front of her was familiar blonde hair. From this angle she could see the soft slope of her nose, the plump redness of her lips, the stretch of her neck. </p><p> Agatha had been complaining to her about the endless sermons, how every congregation member nodded along like obedient dogs. They didn’t know what the real world was like. Martha had stayed quiet, watching her with inquisitive eyes. </p><p> Agatha huffed and shrugged her shoulders. She had noticed herself getting more snarky around Martha, not because she didn’t like or respect her, but because she felt more comfortable being herself around her, and she didn’t seem to mind. “What, do you disagree?”</p><p> “I think…,” Martha pursed her lips, choosing her words carefully. “I think you’re right that a lot of what they say is false. But, I don’t know,” she shrugged, “I think believing in something  bigger than yourself is romantic.”</p><p> “Romantic?” Agatha asked, heart stuttering. </p><p> “Yeah,” she said shyly, “to devote yourself so wholeheartedly to something, unconditionally, letting it into every part of your life. I’d say that’s pretty romantic.”</p><p> Martha’s words had never left her head. She wondered what it felt like to be completely consumed by something. To surrender yourself and let your guard down, but in return for what? Perhaps her magic was the closest she would ever feel to that, but she didn’t know how to give herself to her magic. She wishes she did, but she could feel that her true power still fell frustratingly out of her reach. </p><p> She thought of the devotion to God the preacher always spoke of. That didn’t seem romantic to her. He seemed to speak of it as an obligation, something you did in return for salvation. But surely that wasn’t devotion. If you gave your life to something only because you believed you would get something in return, that wasn’t love, that was a contract. Or maybe she was a cynic. </p><p> She thought of the pious women who walked round the town with everything covered, eyes averted from any prying eyes. The ones that kneeled at the altar every night, confessing their sins and desires to an unseen being. She supposed that was devotion. Believing that if you dedicated your every action to something, letting it know the worst parts of you, your darkest fears and pleasures, and knowing your God will still love you. They sought unconditional love. Agatha couldn’t fault them for that. </p><p> She was startled out of her thoughts by a sharp pinch in her arm. Agatha flinched and looked up to an angry glare from mother. Shit. How long had she been staring at Martha? She quickly ducked her head, hiding her reddening cheeks with her long hair. </p><p> She had to be careful. She was spending too much time with Martha, thinking about her too much. Thank God she had learnt how to block off her mind. She couldn’t help it. When she walked into a room Martha was all that mattered. She was the only one that listened to her, the only person that cared. How could she not be drawn in by those bright kind eyes?</p><p> Mercifully, the sermon finally ended. She dutifully trailed out of the church behind her mother all the way back to their end of the town. There waiting was Esther and her mother, her hands posed on her daughter's shoulders, standing like the perfect mother and daughter. Using all the power she had, she refrained from rolling her eyes and provided a polite smile. </p><p> With a warning glare, Evanora and Esther’s mother left them, and they walked through to a clearing in the middle of the woods. The girl babbled incessantly about how she discovered her own protection powers and how she used them. Agatha clenched her teeth together, trying to avoid screaming. It was all so asinine. The girl was marvelling over being able to put out flames while Agatha could create bonfires that would tear through the entire village.</p><p> The girl faced her, an over-forced smile on her face. “Now, I am going to use minor spells on you, and you are going to try to deflect them, okay?” </p><p> Her condescending tone grated harshly against Agatha’s ears. “You’re only a year and a half older than me Esther, you don’t have to talk to me like I’m five.”</p><p> Her smile faltered, “Well, I don’t see the harm in making sure you know what’s going to happen.” </p><p> Agatha rolled her eyes and held out her arms. “Let me have it.”</p><p> Some invisible force hit the back of her legs, and the next thing she knew she was on the ground, landing with an <em>oof. </em>Agatha huffed and pushed herself up, moving her wild hair out of her face. “I don’t think my enemies are going to trip me up,” she spat. </p><p> Esther looked back at her with a smug look. Agatha could feel her rage bubbling in her chest. How dare this idiot think she was better than her.</p><p> “Well maybe they should. It seems to be very effective.” </p><p> Agatha growled and threw her hands towards the girl. She grinned as Esther’s haughty stance was crumpled into a wiggling mess as she slowly floated up into the air. </p><p> “Agatha!” She screamed. She simply laughed, enjoying the view as her feet kicked and fought against the air. </p><p> “Put me down right now Agatha, I demand it!”</p><p> Agatha pouted. “Aw, now that’s no way to talk to someone. Say please.”</p><p> “My mother was right,” she howled, “you’re a lazy, good for nothing, bitch.”</p><p> Agatha’s resolve faltered. As much as she knew this girl was an idiot, her words hurt. She knew what her mother thought of her, but to have it confirmed it was also thought by other people? It stung. </p><p> Fuck this. With a wave of her hands she let the girl drop unceremoniously to the ground. Her stomach stewed as she digested the words. Was it her that was wrong? She thought she could do more, could be so much more than this tiny coven, this town. But maybe she wasn’t. Maybe this was all she would ever be, stuck doing party tricks her whole life, never ascending to anything more. </p><p> “Hey Agatha.” She snapped out of her thoughts to see an extremely dishevelled and angry Esther. “Try this.”</p><p> Her hands shot out, blasting a direct beam of magic straight into her chest. She yelped, stumbling back and falling as the magic burnt through her chest. Esther didn’t relent, moving forward and standing over, focusing her magic into Agatha. </p><p> It ached all over. Her magic, vengeful and bitter, washed through her. </p><p> “Stop,” she cried out. </p><p> She could see the way Esther’s hands shook, unable to handle this much exertion of her magic, but she wouldn’t relent.</p><p> “Please,” she breathed out, barely able to voice her words through the pain. God, she really was pathetic. Beaten and left cowering by a pathetic and righteous witch. Her mother would be disappointed, although probably not surprised. Word would get round, Martha would look at her differently. So much for being a powerful witch. </p><p> No. She wouldn't just lie here and lick her wounds. With heaving breaths and stiff limbs she ungracefully rolled onto her knees. She noticed a twitch of surprise in Esther’s face, sweat glistening on her brow. </p><p> Acting on a dormant instinct she didn’t know she had, and against what her natural need for survival wanted of her, she opened her arms wide, opening her chest to the onslaught. </p><p> She winced as her wingspan painfully stretched, but just as soon as the pain was there, it suddenly dissipated, turning into a buzzing warmth instead. She looked up, expecting to see an exhausted Esther that had given up. She gasped as instead she saw panic in her eyes as her magic continued to funnel into Agatha’s chest. </p><p> “Stop!” She ordered. </p><p> “I can’t!” She cried. Her face paled as her magic continued to flow into Agatha. The skin on her face pulled taught, greying as her energy seeped into Agatha. </p><p> She couldn’t control it. Part of her still thought it was a sick joke on Esther’s behalf, but she couldn’t ignore the glowing feeling of power that followed from Esther’s attack. She had reversed the giving and taking of power, and she had no idea how to sever it. With horror she watched as the once youthful girl withered before her. With a low moan her magic gave out and she fell face first into the ground. </p><p> The loud rush of magic quietened. The forest was silent, no bird song or whisper of the trees. </p><p> Agatha breathed heavily, mind and body buzzing with new power. She held her trembling hands up to her face, wisps of Esther’s orange magic dancing in and out of her fingers with her purple. What had she done? </p><p> Esther’s body lay twisted in front of her, her mouth left gaping in eternal shock. Her fingers were blackened, her skin mottled and lifeless. Her eyes stared into the distance, red and unseeing. </p><p> She was dead. She had killed her. </p><p> She scrambled back away from the body, panic rising in her throat. She killed her. She didn’t mean to. She really didn’t mean to. She’d taken her power. Not on purpose. Or was it? She didn’t know. She’d acted on the basis of something within her. </p><p> Was this what she had been missing? Her power, greedy and dormant within her, wishing to take the lifeforce of others. Is that who she was? Her great destiny? </p><p> She sat trembling, unable to fathom it all. She’d never seen a dead body in person. Was this what they all looked like? </p><p> A twig snapped behind her. She flinched and turned around, heart in her throat as a figure stood behind her. Her lips quivered as she struggled to form any words. She didn’t recognize her, certainly not one of the coven. Had she seen what had happened? </p><p> She was covered in a long dark green cloak. From this angle crouched on the ground she could see dark tendrils of hair floating past her face under the long hood that covered her face. </p><p> She approached her with quiet but sure steps. Agatha remained frozen to her spot, trembling with fear. She watched with wide eyes as she bypassed her and walked towards Esther’s body, barely shooting Agatha a glance. She crouched down over her. Long slender fingers appeared from beneath her cloak and hovered over her face. They twitched, and from Esther’s gaping mouth a thin sliver of grey twisted out and round the women’s fingers. Her soul? </p><p> The woman retracted her hand into her pocket and stood up straight. She turned and finally faced Agatha, though much of her face was still covered by her hood. Her head cocked to the side, inquisitive. </p><p> “You see me?” A firm, but questioning voice asked. </p><p> Agatha nodded, her mind busy with a million questions. </p><p> “How peculiar,” she murmured. “You’re not dead are you?”</p><p> Agatha barked out a laugh of disbelief, her mind struggling to keep up with anything going on. “I sure hope not.” She paused, “although, mother will probably kill me after this.” Her eyes drifted back to the body, mournful and guilty. </p><p> “You did this?” The woman hummed in approval. “Impressive.”</p><p> Agatha furrowed her brow, confused. How could causing any form of harm or death be impressive? </p><p>Trying to tamp down her fear, she licked her dry lips and asked, “Who are you?” with a shaky voice. </p><p> The woman watched her for a beat, then took a step towards her. Her hands reached up and pulled back the hood covering her face. </p><p> Warm brown eyes revealed themselves, long eyelashes slowly blinking at her. She was older than her, but still young. Her skin was tanned and smooth, her defined cheeks drawing down into a small chin. Her lips looked soft, pursed as she took Agatha in. </p><p> Agatha’s heart hammered in her chest. She was taken aback by how beautiful she was. Her presence was commanding, yet Agatha didn’t feel small or slighted like she usually did when elder coven members looked at her. She was looking at her. <em>Really </em>looking at her. </p><p> “People don’t usually see me, you know. They usually don’t steal other witches' magic either. You’re special.” She crouched down so she was face to face with her. Agatha gulped, but didn’t lean back. “What’s your name?” She asked softly. </p><p> “Agatha. Agatha Harkness,” she said hoarsely. </p><p> “Agatha,” she said, carefully trying the name with her lips. “Well, I have a feeling I will be seeing you again some time soon Agatha. Goodbye. <em>Te veo.”</em></p><p><em> </em>She got up smoothly and left in the direction she came. Stunned, Agatha stared into the space she had just occupied, leaving only Esther’s still lifeless body curled on the ground. </p><p> She shuddered. Wait. “You didn’t tell me who you were.” She turned around, but she was gone. The rustle of the trees was all she left behind. </p><p> Agatha sighed. Was she going crazy? Very possibly. Even if she was crazy, Esther was still dead. </p><p> Everything washed over at once. Esther’s death. Her murder. Her magic. The woman. </p><p> She began to cry, sobs wracking their way through her. Why did she have to be so<em> wrong?</em> She thought of bad things, perverse things. Her dreams were her only recluse, and even then she would wake up yearning and guilty. </p><p> And never in her wildest dreams did she dream of killing someone. She wanted to be <em>good</em>. To please her mother. To please her coven. Make them proud. She was going to have to run away. Escape to another country. Another continent. Somewhere they couldn’t find her; Agatha, the witch killer. </p><p> She got up on shaky legs. She sniffed as tears still ran down her cheeks. She wouldn’t have time to go back for her things. No time to say goodbye to anyone, not even Martha. </p><p> “Esther!” She heard a howl behind her. Shock went down her spine like ice water. This was the end </p><p> Agatha was fourteen when she first felt heartbreak. </p><p> She’d been dragged away from the clearing by her mother, while Esther’s mother screamed and cursed Agatha’s name. </p><p>Her own mother hurled words at her, sinking into her skin like needles. She was <em>cursed, wretched, and vile</em>, and she was <em>no daughter </em>of hers. </p><p> She had pleaded with her mother. It was an accident. She hadn’t meant it. Esther had attacked her first. But her mother wouldn’t listen. </p><p> She was thrown into her room and left there for two nights. She had cried and wailed, trying to reason with her mother, but it was no use. She had given up and curled up on her bed, trying to comfort herself with her blankets wound tightly around her, head buried into her pillows away from the outside world. </p><p> On the third day her mother had finally unlocked her door and came into her room. Her eyes were cold and stern, her back straight, hands clasped tightly behind her back. </p><p> Agatha shrank against the wall, her covers still twined around her. </p><p> “Stand up,” she barked at her. </p><p> She flinched. She quickly shed herself of her bedsheets and stood up on unsteady legs. She held herself straight like her mother, her posture tense as she tried not to fall apart. </p><p> “You have one last chance, Agatha Harkness” she said darkly. “You will only take lessons with me from now on. You will only leave the house for the church service. You will not <em>fraternise</em> with the other coven members. You will dedicate your life to the pursuit of pure witchcraft, and maybe one day you will be able to have your sins forgiven, but that is not for me to say.”</p><p> “Yes mother,” she nodded. She felt faint. She hadn’t known what she had expected. Her scenarios had ranged from exile to being burnt at the stake. But mother was letting her stay.  </p><p> “You are lucky that I am the coven elder, otherwise your punishment may not have been so <em>kind. </em>If you ever set a foot out of line again, you’re out.”</p><p> Agatha nodded again, tears pricking at her eyes. “Yes mother.”</p><p> The next few days passed painfully slowly. As soon as she woke up she was subjected to page after page of history and theory. After lunch she was to regurgitate onto a page everything she had read, and after dinner she was to read old transcripts of coven meetings and agreements. </p><p> She was forbidden from using any magic. Part of her found herself agreeing with her mother. She didn’t know how to control it, or what had caused the <em>incident</em> with Esther. But the other part of her despaired. That was exactly why she should be using it. How was she going to learn if she was left with her head stuck in a book every day. </p><p> Her magic did not want to lie dormant. She could feel it running through her bones. Every time she got frustrated or upset, the lavender purple wisps would spark out of her hands and she’d have to stick them under her dress until it subsided. </p><p> This wasn’t the life she wanted. Was it the life she deserved? </p><p> Sunday rolled around. Agatha woke up with a pit of dread in her stomach. For a second she even considered reasoning with her mother that it was a bad idea, but the severe look she gave her as she came into her room that morning made her bite her tongue. </p><p> She walked to church that morning like a condemned man walks to the gallows. She kept her eyes trained on the ground in front of her, ignoring the obvious stares burning into her skin. The air was charged as her coven members walked around her. They all knew. </p><p> She had wondered why her mother had insisted on her going to church every week, but now she realised. This was part of her punishment. </p><p> She took her seat in the pew, her mother to the right, no one dared sit on the other side. </p><p> She kept her head down the entire service. She knew Martha was there, could <em>feel </em>her, but she couldn’t face seeing her. With nothing to distract her she took in every word of the preacher's speech. <em>Sinners should be punished. Those who danced with the devil would find hell as their home. Almighty God would save us all. </em></p><p> As the final prayer left her lips she let herself relax, just slightly. Suddenly the volumes of books didn’t seem so bad. She turned to follow her mother, when her eyes couldn’t help but connect with those oh so familiar green ones. Where once they held warmth and comfort, all they reflected was grief and chaos. She snapped her gaze back to the floor and dutifully followed her mother out the building. </p><p> She willed her mother to walk faster. She had to get home as soon as possible. The thought of facing Martha made her feel sick. She had killed her friend. Martha would never forgive her. </p><p> Uncaring of the prying eyes and unsubtle whispers, she counted every step, thanking every one that carried her home and over the door. She was nearly there, her house was in sight. </p><p> “Agatha?” She froze. </p><p> Her mother turned around. “Well hello there Martha.” </p><p> “Hello Miss Harkness, could I talk to Agatha for a minute. I’ve not seen her in lessons.” Her voice was pointed and deliberate. She could imagine her polite ingenuine smile that she used when talking to the elders.</p><p>  She willed her mother to decline her. She was to speak to no one, wasn’t that the rules? A firm hand grabbed her arm and pulled her to face her former friend. “It’s rude to ignore people, <em>Agatha.” </em></p><p> She kept her gaze steadfastly on the ground, refusing to see her familiar face once more.<em> </em></p><p> “But of course Martha,” her mother answered. “Just don’t keep her long, she must help me make dinner.” Her mother left her with another sore squeeze of her arm, and turned into the house.</p><p> They stood in silence. Agatha clenched her hands into fists behind her back. She wanted desperately to reach out and hold her, but the possibility of that ever happening had was a distant unattainable dream. </p><p> “Why did you do it Agatha?” She asked brokenly. “She was my friend.”</p><p> She bit her lip trying to hold back tears. She shook her head, still focused on the ground. “I didn’t mean it,” she said through the lump in her throat. “You have to believe me, it was a mistake, I couldn't control it.” </p><p> “Everyone’s saying it was deliberate. That you <em>murdered</em> her.”</p><p> “And when has everyone in this stupid coven been right about something,” she lashed out. She looked up, pleading. “You <em>know</em> me, Martha. Better than anyone. Why would I kill someone on purpose,” she cried. </p><p> Martha’s eyes were wide, doubtful. “I don’t know what to believe anymore,” she said quietly. </p><p> She roughly wiped away the tears that had broken free. No one had ever seen her cry apart from mother, she couldn’t have Martha think of her as weak. </p><p> “But,” she said, taking a step forward, “I can get a read on everyone else. Their thoughts are so loud, I can usually pick out the most important ones. But you, you keep your mind to yourself. Let me in, Agatha,” she reasoned. “Let me know you’re telling the truth.”</p><p> Agatha despaired. She couldn’t show Martha her mind. She’d be disgusted by how she thought of her, how she imagined the two of them living like a husband and wife should. Waking up together, cooking meals together. Married with a kiss under the altar. </p><p> She shook her head, backing away until her back hit a tree. “I can’t.”</p><p> “Why not? What are you scared I’ll find?”</p><p> Agatha couldn’t even begin to explain. </p><p> Martha walked towards her. She had expected anger, but Martha didn’t look angry. She wanted to understand how her friend could do such a horrible thing, but Agatha couldn’t explain it herself. </p><p> “Please, just for a second. Then I’ll know you're telling the truth. I want to know that my friend isn’t a murderer.”</p><p> She studied her. She looked for malice or revenge, but her heart lurched as all she found was concern and care. </p><p> Against her better judgement she slowly nodded. “Okay,” she whispered. </p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to picture the day all over again. Esther’s taunting. Her rage. The loss of control. It was all at the forefront of her mind. Slowly, like peeling back a layer of paint, she let the guards round her mind strip away. </p><p> But then Martha’s soft hands cupped her face. She’d dreamt of that feeling for so long, she couldn’t help the unbidden thoughts rushing to the front of her mind. Martha’s hands. Martha’s lips. How they’d feel against their own. </p><p> She gasped and pulled back. It had only been a second, but it was enough.</p><p> Martha recoiled, pulling her shaking hands into her chest. Her face morphed into a wide display of shock. “What- I don’t-”</p><p> “I’m sorry,” she begged, “I didn’t mean it, it was a mistake.”</p><p> Martha shook her head, disgust in her eyes. “You’re sick Agatha. Sick and perverted. Everyone was right.”</p><p> “No,” she cried, “that’s not true I’m-”</p><p> “Stay away from me Agatha Harkness, you hear me? Never speak to me again,” she spat, her voice breaking. She turned on her heel and ran back home. </p><p> From then on Agatha’s life was a dull and unrelenting monotony of solitude, comforted only by the teachings of her elders. Her restless magic was trapped in the confines of the house and the weekly trips to church. Her pain was left to fester, her only escape her dreams, which all too often were a rehash of everything she couldn’t stand to relive. </p><p> Agatha was fifteen when she decided enough was enough. </p><p> Down in the basement was her mother’s collection of secret and restricted books. Agatha wasn’t meant to know about them, but it took a weak suspicion to confirm that they would be down there as the only room Agatha was banned from. </p><p> As she lay in bed one night she realised she couldn’t take it anymore. Her magic was becoming more and more relentless, thrumming under her skin every night, begging and pleading to be unleashed; and she was sure her eyes would fall out of her head if she had to read about the mechanics of one more simple transformation spell. </p><p> It was late at night, her mother’s snores echoing loudly through the house. She scampered down the stairs down to the basement, arriving at the locked door. She took a deep breath and cast a simply unlocking spell, smiling when it easily gave way. </p><p> She sighed with relief. She had barely used her magic in a year, and it hummed happily in return. She created a ball of light in her hand and slowly made her way downstairs. She winced as every floorboard creaked beneath her, but her mother’s snores continued to rattle throughout the house.</p><p> She walked around until she found the old bookshelf, padlocked again with another lock that easily bent to her powers. </p><p> She browsed the spine of each one, marvelling at the wealth of magic that had been kept from her. Volumes on body manipulation, possession, resurrection. Each one an untapped practice for her magic. </p><p> And so Agatha developed a new routine. She occupied her days with the usual boring readings, biding her time until late at night when she could sneak out to her corner of the woods and practise <em>real </em>magic. </p><p> It pushed her, oftentimes leaving her exhausted and worn out, but she could never resist going back and trying and testing out more. She searched for an answer to her powers, to explain what had happened that one day with Esther. Nothing seemed to provide any answers, but they did explain the tenuous link between life and death, the transfer of souls from one plain to another. She grew more confidence, and the dream of leaving and starting over somewhere else seemed more and more real. </p><p> This happy routine developed for years, until one early morning she returned to her house to see her mother and the other coven elders waiting for her, the damning evidence of the book of resurrection clutched against her chest. </p><p> Agatha was eighteen when she was sentenced to death. </p><p> She had been dragged kicking and screaming to the stake. She was powerful, but seven elder witches intricately linked binding spell was difficult for even her to overcome.</p><p> She’d begged and pleaded with her mother. “If only you had just <em>taught</em> me.” But her mother held no sympathy for her. That had been lost long ago. </p><p> Their magic blasted into her body, fierce and vengeful. She screamed as it burned through her, but then just as what happened all those years ago, something flipped. She absorbed the magic, taking it for herself, stealing it from the coven members. There was no room for guilt or regret. One by one they fell, hollow husks of the proud witches they used to be. </p><p> Her mother growled at her. For a soft, foolish moment, she thought her mother wouldn’t go through with it. She knew her mother was brutal and cold, but taking out her own child? That was harsh, even for her. </p><p> But soon her own kin’s magic was shot at her, trying to rip her apart from the insides. She groaned, and this time she did, she really did, try to not take it. She threw her own arms out, trying to sever the connection, but it was no use. </p><p>Her mother fell to the ground with an inelegant thump. The Salemite’s coven leader taken out by her own daughter. So much for a dynasty.</p><p> They were gone. All of them. She’d killed them all. </p><p> She let herself down from the platform, panting as she took in the circle of dead bodies. Her mind was muddled. It had been self defence, they’d tried to kill her over an unjust crime. Did that make it right?</p><p> She heard a whistle behind her. “Wow, pretty impressive,” a familiar voice said behind her. She turned around to see the same cloaked figure from before. Her hood was down this time, her dark brown hair cascading in waves down her back. “Remind me to never piss you off.”</p><p> Despite herself, Agatha laughed. It was wild and erratic, and she probably sounded insane, but she couldn’t help it. It was ridiculous. Her coven elders were dead. Her mother was dead. She killed them. She killed them all!</p><p> She killed them all. </p><p> She stopped laughing, rubbing a hand over her chest that still burnt from taking the brunt of the magic. </p><p> “Woah there, Harkness.” The woman was suddenly in front of her, lending her a helping hand to sit down on the ground. “Absorbing all that magic can give you quite the head rush. Best to sit for a little bit.”</p><p> Agatha nodded dumbly. She hadn’t realised just how hard she was trembling. She looked down at her hands. The tips of her fingers were singed black, while the other witches' colourful magic twisted and twirled around them. </p><p> She watched as the woman slowly went round, leaning over each witch and pocketing their souls. </p><p> During her endless readings and research she had come across mentions of the being that helped the recently deceased pass into the other life. It was mentioned across the centuries, appearing in different forms in different cultures and folklore, but it all came under the one name. </p><p> “I guess you’ve worked out who I am then.” </p><p> Agatha nodded, curiously watching as she came and sat opposite her. “Death,” she said simply. </p><p> The corner of her mouth twitched up into a smile. “You know, it’s rare I hear my name said with so little fear.” She leaned closer to her. “Do you fear me Agatha?” </p><p> She never imagined that death would look so human. Her movement and features were so painfully reminiscent of her peers, or at least what she remembered of them. Her eyes were dark and probing, but she could see the life behind them, inquisitive and searching. </p><p> “Last time you were surprised I could see you,” she deflected, “why is that?”</p><p> Death smirked, allowing the diversion. “People can usually only see me if I let them. You’re powerful, if tonight is anything to go by. A syphon witch is rare. You take what someone uses to kill you, you reverse the order of things. You dance with death,” she said with a wriggle of the eyebrows. </p><p> “Literally?” </p><p> “Well, only if you want to,” she said through a toothy grin. </p><p> Agatha put down her blush and racing heart to the abundance of magic still racing through her veins. </p><p> “But…why?”</p><p> Death leaned back and shrugged. “That is your little mystery. I guess you’ll need to find out.” She looked around, listening for something Agatha couldn’t hear. “You should get moving little witch, I don’t think the rest of your coven will be too happy with your party trick. Unless you’re looking for round two.” </p><p> Oh right. Reality. Agatha stood up, shaking off her dress and trying to realign herself with the world. Where would she go? She supposed she could find other covens, see if they had any answers to her relentless questions. </p><p> “I have a feeling I will be seeing a lot more of you, Agatha Harkness.” She held her hand out for her to shake. “Until then.”</p><p> She reached out, her fingers just out of touch with death’s hand. “What am I supposed to call you? Surely you have a name other than death.”</p><p> She tilted her head to the side, a smile playing on her lips. “I suppose I do. Most people call me death, but you Agatha Harkness can call me Rio.”</p><p>She clasped their hands together and pulled her in, placing a chaste kiss on her cheeks. “Goodbye Agatha. <em>Te Veo</em>.”</p><p> For years Agatha wandered. She sought out covens looking for answers, but no matter how hard she tried she couldn’t outrun her legacy. Whispers of the witchkiller followed her wherever she went, and despite her best intentions she would always be left with a dead coven at her feet. </p><p> Rio was always there to collect the bodies, offering a snarky remark about how they were too stupid to realise the power of the witch that had ‘stumbled’ their coven. </p><p> “What did it this time,” she asked, as she collected the souls of this month’s unfortunate coven. </p><p> Agatha sighed, rubbing her eyes as she tried to quell down her frustration. “I made a mention of dark magic. I didn’t quite realise they were the strict puritan branch of witches.” She shrugged her shoulders. “I tried to tell them but they wouldn’t listen.”</p><p> She heard no response from Rio. She was quiet, that was rare. </p><p> She turned around. “What is it?” </p><p> Rio was chewing on her lip, mulling over what words to say. </p><p> “Well,” she started, “you keep looking for a coven to give you answers. But, maybe you don’t need one. Maybe you can just <em>be,” </em>she said, with a flourish of hands. </p><p> Agatha chuckled bitterly. “Unfortunately, a witch isn’t much without her coven, no matter how powerful she is.”</p><p> “Well,” Rio shrugged, “I’ll be your coven.”</p><p> Agatha barked out a laugh. “Seriously?” </p><p> “Yeah,” she said simply. She loosely linked their fingers together, letting them sway between them. “If that’s what you want.” </p><p> Agatha loathed the way Rio would say such heavy things like they were the easiest things to say in the world. Her heart hammered in her chest, her hands tingling at Rio’s touch. </p><p>“Death and the witch-killer. That’s some coven.” </p><p> Rio grinned, her tongue sticking out through her teeth. “Yeah, I think we’d be pretty great at it.” </p><p> She looked down bashful. She hadn’t had a coven in years. Really, she hadn’t had one since she was fourteen. Yet she’d found a strange companionship in Rio that she’d never expected. Through every coven she tore through, Rio was always there, picking up the pieces and helping her to keep going. </p><p> The next thing she knew, a warm body was against hers, arms winding around her back. Agatha froze, unused to the sensation. </p><p> “This is what humans do to comfort each other, right?” </p><p> Agatha chuckled, letting herself lean into the warmth of the other woman's body. “Yeah,” she said softly. “Thanks.”</p><p> She tightened her arms around her, resting her head in the crook of her neck. She hadn’t been held since she was a young child, the solid comfort of another. A lethargic heat settled in her bones, resting her weight against Rio. </p><p> She felt Rio play with the ends of her hair, twisting tendrils round her fingers. “You’re the only person that can see me, Agatha,” she whispered into her hair. </p><p> She thought of the countless nights they had spent debating the laws of dark magic. How mortals view death, how they fear it and create religions just to give them a sliver of comfort about what comes next. How Rio felt taking young children to the other side, how she couldn’t get in the way of the natural order, how the only comfort she could offer them was that other children were there, and that mommy and daddy would be there soon.</p><p> Agatha spoke of her isolation as a child. Being shielded from her peers after what had happened with Esther. Her mother’s coldness, her refusal to help her with her magic just because it was rare, and not knowing something terrified her more than she would ever admit. </p><p> Rio’s eyes always darkened at the mention of her mother. “I could tell when I took her soul that lady was a bitch.”</p><p> She spoke of devotion. How she didn’t think she’d ever treated something like that in her life, and didn’t know if she ever could. </p><p> Rio had stayed quiet, contemplating her words. “I think,” she spoke eventually, “devotion isn’t an obligation. It’s a choice you make every day, even when it’s hard. If it’s a cause you dedicate your life to it, you perform every action with it in mind. And when it’s a person,” her eyes flicked up to Agatha’s, her stare heavy with unspoken words, “you know every part of them. All the kind and nasty parts. Their idiosyncrasies that make them imperfect and different. All the things that make them <em>yours.</em> And you love them because of it.”</p><p> Agatha had swallowed the lump in her throat, shifting and uncomfortable under the implications of Rio’s words. </p><p> She had shaken her head. There were no implications. Rio was intense, that was all. </p><p> That was the first night she had woken up to see Rio still there in the morning. “Wanted to make sure no witches came in the night and stole you away,” she said with a soft smile. </p><p> Thinking about Rio made her scared. All the things that she felt for her were things she had pushed down to the deepest parts of her, locked away to never see the light of day. Yet when she was here in Rio’s arms, it all seemed so simple. Rio was always in her mind, even when she wasn’t with her. When some mortal treated her like a simpleton for being a woman, or whenever she was bored and decided to set animals loose in a village to cause mayhem, it was Rio she thought of, already building how she would retell the story to her. It was Rio’s warm eyes that plagued her dreams. It was Rio’s soft lips she imagined against her skin. </p><p> Rio pulled back, cupping Agatha’s face with her hands. She licked her lips on instinct, catching how Rio’s gaze flicked down to the flash of tongue, then back up to her eyes. </p><p> Her thumb stroked softly against Agatha’s cheek, and she could have wept for how soft it made her feel. She’d never known such tenderness. She never could have imagined her greatest comfort would come from death, but perhaps her life was always destined to be this way.</p><p> “I always thought this was wrong,” she confessed.</p><p> Rio’s brow furrowed. “What was?”</p><p> Her breath shuddered. “Loving…a woman,” she said shyly. “I was told it was wrong my whole life. I thought it was another one of my perversions, along with my magic.”</p><p> “Oh Agatha,” she said, cradling her face carefully in her hands. “All the things they told you were the worst parts of you are the best parts of you. Your magic is innate to who you are, you can’t control it. Just like this.” She moved nearer, bringing their faces closer together. Their breaths danced over each other’s lips. “Does this feel wrong?” </p><p> Her heart thundered in her chest. Her skin was on fire everywhere Rio touched.</p><p> A small, hurt and broken part of her screamed at her to pull back. It told her that she was sinning and being impure, that she was broken and couldn’t be fixed. But the parts of her that Rio had nourished and nursed back to life calmly told her that this was natural, that this was the best thing to happen to her. </p><p> She reached up with her own hand to push Rio’s hair back from her face, tangling into her hair. “No,” she breathed, and closed the distance between them. </p><p> She sighed into the kiss, savouring the way their lips slid against each other. Rio’s hand wrapped around her waist, bringing her in closer, their bodies flush. Agatha tightened her hold in Rio’s hair and heard a small noise of approval at the back of her throat. </p><p> She smiled, pulling back slightly to look Rio in the eyes. “I love you,” she gasped in between kisses. </p><p> Rio was flushed, her lips red and hair dishevelled. “I love you more, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha was twenty-three when she devoted herself to Rio, to lady death herself. </p><p> </p>
