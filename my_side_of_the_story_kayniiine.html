<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>When it comes to being Hollywood royalty, Agatha Harkness has clawed her way up from the bottom to make a name for herself in the film industry. With three Oscars to her name and a potential fourth on the horizon, it seemed to the rest of the world as though there was no slowing her down.</p><p>Working on a new project, Agatha finds herself in New Zealand to scout for locations. One afternoon after a particularly annoying meeting, Agatha's attention span is shot enough that common space-sharing courtesy vacates her mind.</p><p>At the sound of a sharp whistle across the water, Agatha's eyes find her for the first time.</p><p>And then, the fall.</p><p>Each chapter is a brief snapshot of Agatha's perspective throughout the course of the events that unfold in Here With You Now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>hi everyone (:<br/>if you have migrated here, you know what this is! i can't commit to a complete retelling, but i got a hair up my ass about wanting to offer some perspective on Agatha outside of the way Rio and the kids see her. so, voila! hang in there with me as I navigate trying to regularly update 3 stories now. i appreciate each and every one of you!</p></blockquote>

<i>Where will I be tomorrow?<br/>
Where will I be next year?<br/>
I'll never put my finger on, just what I wanted to say<br/>
My motivation changes, when things turn out this way<br/>
*****</i>
</p>
</center><p>The pressure being applied directly to the center of the forehead by a lone pointer finger left the poised woman at the end of the fifteen foot mahogany boardroom table feeling like she was going to puncture a hole through her own skull.</p><p>This was the worst part of the job.</p><p>Agatha Harkness typically overpowered any room she walked into. She had a presence about her from her posture to the way the hair that fell to her lower back always whipped around behind her as she strode. She carried about her an aura of someone who had rightfully earned her place in the world and the spaces she chose to occupy. She had built her reputation from the ground up and <i>any</i> time she found herself in a boardroom with a bunch of men prattling on about budget constraints and practicalities of trying to shoot on location in certain spaces, she felt like she was going to lose every last shred of sanity she might have had left.</p><p>This was a dance she had done all too many times before, and it was one she was <i>always</i> tired of.</p><p>Agatha had been creating and directing films since she was in high school, putting on productions of timeless classics to help hone her craft. The older she got, the more her imagination seemed to blossom and the worlds that lived inside of her head begged to be visualized, commanded, cultivated. Creation was what Agatha knew to do best, and it was something that had given her quite a bit of wealth and status throughout the course of her twenty-five year career.</p><p>Out of the eight films she had led thus far in her career, she had secured nominations for six, won three, and was a few weeks away from possibly winning her fourth, which would put her at a fifty-fifty ratio of award-winning and ones that she'd put into the world because she'd needed them to be there. All of her films fit that criteria, really, but crowds could be hit or miss.</p><p>The art of human interaction was the one thing she tended to focus on the most. She liked to tell stories about the recesses of humanity, the parts people found difficult to talk about.</p><p>Agatha was a sucker for visuals to tell those stories, too; places to insert her characters that were not only beautiful, but had their own sense of intent, were a character in and of themselves.</p><p>Agatha had earned herself a reputation of asking for the most and accepting nothing less.</p><p>Sure, there were plenty of people that would have called her an unadulterated witch to be in the company of when she was in the throes of her creativity, but they also would admit in the same breath that it was something to be respected, no matter the distaste it left in its wake. Agatha was an absolute machine; she never stopped.</p><p>If Agatha stopped? Well, then life caught up with her and that wasn't something she had ever been to keen on handling for the last ten years or so, and she had no intention of starting any time soon.</p><p>The jet setting lifestyle had been all she had known for decades and even though she was well aware that she was getting older, she had kept to the mindset that she would only find power in her age, and power was Agatha's most important currency.</p><p>The amount of power she had?</p><p>It left her wondering why she was sat at the head of that table fighting every urge she had not to break her own nose on it as some means of getting out of the meeting early.</p><p>Two chairs down to her right sat Regan Hipelius, the newest addition to the financial team. He had been lecturing her on making budget-friendly choices in regards to location for the last eight minutes. She had half a mind to hurl the remaining bit of her black coffee with a shot and a half of Jack in it directly at his head and that ridiculous haircut.</p><p>Who the fuck had hired this guy and why had she not been notified?</p><p>The studio, of course.</p><p>"Look, Regan. I know this is a whole new foray for you, and I don't really care what kind of accounting degree you have. I don't need you to lecture me on budgets," she snapped curtly, but he was quick with his rebuttal.</p><p>"The cost of the permits here alone are astronom--"</p><p>"Regan! I do not believe my pause was meant to elicit a response from you. I was taking a breath." Agatha spoke with authority, and she tended to weaponize it when she was in a room full of men who thought they were going to tell her how to move about any project she took on.</p><p>She lifted her coffee and tossed the rest of it back before nearly slamming the empty cup down on the table in front of her, her steely blue eyes flashing in warning as the man opened his mouth to speak again.</p><p>"I get it, Regan, I really do. You're new here. And you've been tasked with..." Both hands raised, her first two fingers out on each hand as she mimicked quotations around her next words, "'keeping me in line,' but if you ask <i>literally</i> any person in this room, they'd be more than happy to inform you that what I exceed in budget I do not hesitate to cover out of my own personal finances."</p><p>At this, the man's mouth slowly closed, his lips flat together beneath that gods-awful mustache.</p><p>"I know that you are undeniably here at the behest of the studio, and I respect that. But <i>do not</i> think for one second that you're going to waltz in here in a suit two sizes too small, unkempt and a little less than put together and assume that <i>you're</i> the one in control here." She leaned back in the chair, one leg folded over the other knee, her foot swinging around in circles that channeled her irritation into one place.</p><p>"Perhaps you should try to make friends instead of a name for yourself within the studio. The more you learn, the more useful you will be to both them as well as myself. On paper, you're only looking at numbers. Things change, schedules get pushed or compounded." She shifted, shimmying her shoulders before she settled back into her chair. "This is <i>my</i> battlefield, and I have traversed it many a time. I do not need you, fresh out of boot camp, to lecture me on what I am doing." Her elbows shifted to rest on the arms of the chair and her hands met, fingers weaving, directly over her middle.</p><p>It was a move that screamed power, but it was what Agatha did when she wanted to fortify her defenses. She refused to let a man see her buckle in any situation and she was not going to waver in front of this fresh-faced idiot who had no idea just how much he was going to need to learn if he was going to survive in her company.</p><p>"Point being, Regan, I am the captain of this ship and you are a deck hand. If you happen to prove useful, then you'll have a much easier time around here. Understood?"</p><p>Regan's dark brown eyes were wide and more than a little shocked that she had just spoken to him like that in front of six other people, but she quickly realized that the shock had come from the fact that no one had stepped in to defend him.</p><p>"Y-yes, Ms. Harkness."</p><p>Agatha wouldn't have said that people were <i>scared</i> of her, but she knew that she demanded the attention of those around her and required presence from them as well. Focus was imperative and drive was something she wanted anyone working on a project with her to have. It was the attention to detail, the desire to want to create something memorable that she sought out.</p><p>That was why he sat there; she had not picked him, the studio had. Should he have been her choice?</p><p>Well, if she had willingly selected him from a pool of candidates, she would have demanded in the same turn that she be submitted for a wellness evaluation.</p><p>Vision was the one thing Agatha had always had, and because of it, it felt impossible to keep company of those who looked at the world through a pinhole. There was so much out there to see and experience, so many things to absorb and take in. There were so many sides to the human condition and Agatha was often starved to explore the deeper parts of what it meant to walk this earth through so many different paths.</p><p>There were some, like her most recent, where she had stepped a bit out of the box. Shooting that one in Germany had been a pure thrill and the local reception to their presence had been incredible. They had been welcomed, been taken care of in their stay in a way she really had never expected.</p><p>This trip, though, she was facing a lot more pushback. She'd already been emailed several notes from her casting director about more studio interference and it was beginning to grate on her nerves. It was like they were trying to set her up for failure when she knew that this would be worth every single penny she wanted to sink into it. This was not her first time at this rodeo, or even her fifth. This would be her <i>ninth</i> project, and they were trying to wrestle it out from her grasp?</p><p>Absolutely not.</p><p>She knew what this was; this was a cash grab. The plot had sat well with the focus groups in polling and because of the higher ranking, the studio had gotten a relatively good idea of what it might look like once it hit the big screen.</p><p>If there were ever one thing in the world that Agatha positively <i>loathed?</i></p><p>
<i>Fucking focus groups.</i>
</p><p>She, quite frankly, did not give a solitary fuck about a focus group. Sure, it might have been a mandated part of the industry, but she wasn't making films that were meant to be shoehorned into one category. To her, it felt like another attempt to stifle the creatives in their field that refused to stick to the cut and copy style of film making.</p><p>She'd been doing that for years, and it had never not panned out for her. Sure, some of her works had a bit of a harder time gaining tractions, but to carry the ratio she currently had? For a woman in the industry, it was impressive. Hell, for anyone in the industry. She was still in the process of climbing the ladder, wanting to reach those names like Kubrick and Leone.</p><p>Typically, she would have been told to stop at five, maybe six. And truthfully? She had been, by a handful of people. Had she listened? Well, then there would have only been one Oscar in her den instead of three.</p><p>Bending to the will of the world was not something Agatha Harkness knew how to do. She was too rooted in her sense of self to ever think for a moment that she should move out of the way for the rest of the world.</p><p>No, the world moved for Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Agatha's hands lifted from her middle, though her elbows were still planted and she instead brought them up, her fingertips meeting at a narrow point, her eyes sweeping the room.</p><p>"Is there anything else anyone would like to say?" She posed, that pointed glare darting from face to face.</p><p>"Well..."</p><p>"Oh Jesus fucking Christ Dave. What Johnny Raincloud bullshit are you coming at me with now?" she posed, an exasperated sigh forced through her nostrils.</p><p>"We have less than a week to make the decision between here and Brisbane, if you want to keep Brisbane as an option. Their windows for filing the permits there are a lot smaller and so we'll have to act fast." Dave was nothing if not informative when he knew he was going to be delivering less than desirable news to a woman he had worked under for nearly eighteen years.</p><p>Dave?</p><p>Dave was a special breed, Agatha had always thought. He was a touch younger than her, though sometimes in the wrong lighting, he certainly didn't look it. His hair was cut short but was also shaved on the sides. The salt and pepper that sat atop his head matched the beard that covered his entire jaw. He always had those ridiculous half-moon spectacles on that made him look like a member of a biker gang became a professor at Hogwarts.</p><p>More than Dave's looks was his sheer dedication to Agatha and her craft. Everything she did, he found a way to press it forward, a way to make sure there was a path that could be followed exactly to her specifications. Dave was a doer. Dave made things happen, no matter how hard Agatha was on him.</p><p>They'd had their gentler moments, though they were incredibly few and far between. In fact, there had only been about five of them in their entire time spent working together.</p><p>In those five instances, she had learned that Dave had been married for four years to his husband and they had two Corgis -- who, much to Agatha's disdain, were named Benny and June -- and they lived in Malibu, not too far from her own home, as it had turned out. She had never really ventured to dig much deeper than that; Dave had made it apparent that he was there as a proponent to her success and he would do what he needed to do to ensure that each vision she had, it was replicated with crystal clarity. That did not mean, for either of them, that they had to be friends.</p><p>Agatha respected Dave.</p><p>She respected him because he seemed to be the only person who could tolerate her bullshit for that long and not leave.</p><p>People always left.</p><p>But not Dave.</p><p>She knew it was because, at the end of the day, Agatha appreciated Dave's work ethic. It was probably why she was harder on him than anyone else; she knew he could take it, and that he would remain in his undying loyalty to her. In a way, there was a silent understanding between them that he didn't mind being the example for those who were getting their first glimpses of what life would look like on the S.S. Harkness.</p><p>"Well, then I suppose I better get my ass over there Monday morning to get good enough of an idea to understand where I want to take this. You'd be a doll and set that up for me, hm?" She posed, tilting her head at him in a manner that she knew would intimidate everyone in the room but Dave.</p><p>"I'll text you the details as soon as I have them."</p><p>There was always comfort to be found in just how damn efficient he was, and she was more thankful than she knew she ever told him. Maybe he would be due for a hefty Christmas bonus this year, far more extensive than the one the year before.</p><p>The thing about Agatha? She treated her people well when they treated her well. She knew it was a fucked up mentality with the authority she held as a result of her position in the industry, but she refused to engage with people who somehow got through interviews only to prove that they were in it for all of the wrong reasons.</p><p>Agatha wanted forward thinkers, people who didn't just think outside of the box, they stood on top of it to reach for whatever stars they could snag from the sky. Agatha wanted motivation, wanted the thirst for greatness to bleed out of those who were honored with the opportunity to have a hand in something that was created under her name.</p><p>Many gossip rags were all too eager to jump at the chance to post fabricated -- though there may have been a <i>little</i> truth to a couple of blurbs -- stories from disgruntled former employees who claimed mental anguish and emotional damage, but nothing had ever even made it to court. She'd settle for half what they probably deserved, make a condition of the money that they had to sign an NDA and then moved forward with her life.</p><p>Agatha hated another thing with a little more fervor than focus groups.</p><p>Agatha <i>fucking hated</i> quitters.</p><p>Giving up without exploring every single avenue in search for a viable answer to any problem? There had been literal days when Agatha had been up without sleep, trying to think herself out of a hole. She would pace, she would chug coffee, she would hit the drawing board again and again until that precise moment when she turned one piece just the right way that it fit and made sense of the bigger picture.</p><p>There was always an answer to be found, but it took effort and time, two things that people did not seem all that keen on these days. Agatha might have been a little old world in that respect, but if that was what it meant to keep on achieving greatness? She was never going to stop, no matter how many interns she sent packing along the way.</p><p>Suddenly, Agatha dropped her foot, the heel catching on the ground before her toes did. At the same time, she sat forward and smacked both palms flat to the table, taking one last sweeping glance across every other face in that boardroom.</p><p>"Well, gentlemen, if there's nothing else I can ease your qualms over, I believe this meeting has concluded. Oh, and Regan?" she called as she got to her feet, lifting her head to see him walking away as if he had not heard her. <i>"Excuse me, Mister Hipelius!"</i> she snapped, her eyes narrowing at the back of his head, his feet cementing to the ground before he turned around.</p><p>"Ma'am?" he posed, his tone tight and a little stressed. If she wasn't mistaken, she could hear the embarrassment, too.</p><p>"Word of the wise. If you want people to take you seriously, it happens a lot quicker when you take yourself seriously."</p><p>He gave a terse nod. "Yes ma'am."</p><p>Agatha's eyes never left that lanky frame as he nearly fought to keep from sprinting out of that room. She was pleased with herself, of course, because she knew that one way or another, people were going to get it. She did not tolerate anything else than what she expected, no matter how much that seemed to upset people.</p><p>Agatha had not gotten very far in her life by giving a fuck what other people wanted or expected of her. She had her own dreams, her own ambitions, and she would keep doing this until she was too old or her creative spark seemed to disappear.</p><p>For as long as Agatha knew how, she would keep pushing both herself and her work to new limits every single chance she got.</p><p>Everyone else vacated the room slowly, but as Agatha checked the time and stowed her phone in the pocket of her plum trousers, Dave remained.</p><p>"You don't have to actively scare the fucking life out of them, Agatha," he admonished gently as he slid his papers back into his folder, though he wasn't looking at her.</p><p>"I don't have to, but fear tends to inspire bravery!" she chirped back at him as she removed her sunglasses from atop her head and slid them onto her face.</p><p>"Now, David, if you'll excuse me, I have all of Auckland to spend my next three days in. Perhaps I can find some trouble."</p><p>This got a rise out of the man who shook his head at her. "Agatha, the last thing you need is trouble. But... happy mischief to you, I suppose. Have a good night."</p><p>She had made it to the door but stopped, one hand on the doorframe as she turned around to face the lone remaining occupant.</p><p>"Buy yourself a nice dinner this evening. Put it on the company card."</p><p>"Thank you, Agatha," he offered back, his voice a bit too sing-song in a mocking kind of way for her tastes, but she did not push the matter and simply carried herself toward the elevators.</p><p>By the time she had hit the street, she was pulling up Wanda's contact number and pressing send to submit the call as she lifted the phone to her ear. Since she'd left Los Angeles, they tried to spend a bit of time together each evening to just touch base, to get a feel for how things were going on either side of the fence.</p><p>As of late, Wanda had been dealing with her own crisis and although Agatha had been sworn to secrecy over the entire thing due to the very real possibility of Wanda losing her job, she had been eating up every single crumb Wanda would toss her way, which happened more frequently when they drank.</p><p>Wanda was a fellow cog of the industry, but in a very different vein. Her forte was reality TV and she'd been heading the production team for the last three years at the base of The Bachelor franchise. When she had taken on the most recent season of The Bachelorette, she had surely never been able to predict that they were going to cast the most closeted socialite in all of America.</p><p>One who, apparently, had a thing for cute redheads.</p><p>"I was beginning to wonder if you'd ever get out of there!" was what greeted her the moment the line went live.</p><p>"Jesus Christ, neither did I. I thought I was going to have to sail that new accounting idiot through the window. Either that or hit him with what was left of my coffee. Ugh." Agatha exhaled a rough and frustrated grunt, but she was met with laughter from Wanda's end.</p><p>"Let me guess, the studio appointed babysitter?" Wanda offered back, though she'd known before she'd even had to ask.</p><p>"Of course. And then David informed me that we are on a <i>much</i> tighter deadline in regards to the location decision than I had initially thought. So, I'm headed to the wildlands in Auckland sometime Monday morning or early afternoon." Agatha had been walking the entire time, but she had no idea where she was going.</p><p>Fuck it. If she got lost, she had her phone and could find her way back to the hotel where she was staying.</p><p>"You seriously don't know what it means to slow down in the least, do you?" Wanda posed, the taunt clearly audible in her tone.</p><p>"Of course not," Agatha offered back, but Wanda immediately announced that she had missed what she said, likely because her speaker had started to pick up the dispersed shouts in the background that Agatha was completely oblivious to.</p><p>"Are you headed back to the hotel now?" Wanda probed, though the anticipation in her tone was nearly palpable.</p><p>"Yeah, do you have your gin ready?"</p><p>Wanda laughed.</p><p>"It's almost like you know me or something," the other woman returned.</p><p>"I'm ready to be six shots deep while I hang over the edge of my hotel bed like a five year old because my lust for immaturity is strong after three hours in that fucking boardroom."</p><p>As Wanda began to speak, she was drowned out by another shout that Agatha had not caught the context of as someone whizzed by her.</p><p>Like a crack of thunder in the sky, something hit Agatha's ears, sharp and demanding of her attention. Wild blue eyes swept around, looking beyond the railing of the bridge for the source of the sound.</p><p>And then, they found it.</p><p>There was a woman on the deck of a houseboat, a light green tank top and a pair of shorts on her lithe frame. There were a pair of aviators over her eyes, but she was just far enough away that Agatha could not quite read her expression. She lowered the phone and placed both of her hands on the railing that was a little higher than her hips.</p><p>"Can I --?!" she had started, but the moment it started to leave her lips, the heard another shout as it got a lot closer. Half a second later, she felt the force of the biker that had been screaming at her. It almost knocked the wind out of her, but it did successfully knock her forward.</p><p>It felt like slow motion, the way she went from looking at the beautiful blue New Zealand sky, down over the skyline, and then straight into the water. As she toppled, her phone launched out of her hand somewhere feet away into the water. She thrashed around for a moment as she tried to right herself in the marina before she surfaced, her head whipping around wildly to locate the source of the sound.</p><p>They landed on her again, that woman.</p><p>"Is there something you wanted?!" Agatha shrieked as she began to swim over to where the woman was, noting that she had a ladder on the edge of the deck that she was in the process of letting down.</p><p>Agatha grabbed either side of it as she climbed up. Her eyes lifted, though, to see an awaiting palm to pull her the rest of the way out. Without a second's hesitation, she slid her hand inside of the woman's and finished removing herself from the water.</p><p>The woman finally spoke.</p><p>"You were walking in the bike path."</p><p>
<i>Well... shit.</i>

</p><p> </p><p>As the tether of consciousness began to reel her back in, Agatha identified several things that felt off even before she opened her eyes.</p><p>Firstly, whatever pillow was under her head was definitely not hers. The material was wrong and the firmness was lacking in the most headache-inducing way. Fingers flexed into it, but brushed something that was not the soft sheets of whatever hotel bed she was staying in. It felt like... furniture?</p><p>Secondly, there was a pleasant aroma wafting through the air, which Agatha was certain was not any kind of furnished breakfast provided by the hotel -- it smelled too good.</p><p>Lastly, the way the shirt on her torso was hugging her frame felt oddly uncomfortable, like it was a shirt that hadn't belonged to her. It was too tight in the places that Agatha usually liked to feel space and air, primarily her midsection. Agatha was a guarded human, and while some form of snug fabric should have felt like armor, instead it made her feel as though she were not in her own skin.</p><p>Slowly, with a disgruntled groan slipping through her lips unhindered, Agatha forced her eyelids up and open, blinking in the sight of her surroundings. For a moment, she was <em>incredibly</em> confused. Where the fuck was she?</p><p>As her gaze dropped to the coffee table in front of her and she saw the clothes she had been wearing from the previous day folded on the table in front of her, it all came barreling back, hitting her hard enough that she actually had to gasp for air to level her own mind.</p><p>The bridge.</p><p>The woman.</p><p>The post-it note Agatha had left between two flower pots.</p><p>The wine.</p><p>The dinner.</p><p>More wine.</p><p>The dryer.</p><p>The documentary.</p><p>Her eyes lifted across the space of the den and there sat that tiny little television and the DVD player that could have been considered ancient.</p><p>It crossed her mind that the woman who had pulled her out of the water actually lived her life a little out of touch with reality. Hell, Agatha was shocked that she had a smart phone; something more along the lines of a flip phone would have better suited the general aura the woman seemed to carry around with her.</p><p>Agatha shifted, rolling to her back on the couch so that she could look up at the ceiling.</p><p>How the hell had she wound up here? Well, she knew that answer, but... Why had she stayed? She could have left, could have found a way to call Dave and get him to pull his superhero shenanigans and replenish her with a new phone, a way to the hotel, and perhaps a shred of her dignity.</p><p>She had literally fallen off of a bridge.</p><p>
<em>How fucking embarrassing.</em>
</p><p>There were so many synapses firing within her head at one time that Agatha was fighting to play catch-up, trying to replay each important recollection as she could catch it when it flew by.</p><p>After a struggle, she found her way back to the beginning.</p><p>The hand was there, and she'd taken it. The moment she'd hit her feet and locked into those green eyes, speckled with flecks of amber, just barely an inch above her own? For a split second, Agatha had forgotten how to breathe, even if she played it off with a fluid charm.</p><p>Once the initial shock of looking into those eyes had worn off, Agatha had been able to see the bigger picture; that face was <em>striking.</em> Her features somehow toed the line of being completely breathtaking and also an undeniable softness to the way her cheeks curved up with her smile. Her nose could not have fit her face any better, and those lips had an utter fullness to them that hardly wavered even when they pulled back to show teeth. Her jawline was both strong and yet there were not any <em>harsh</em> angles to detract from the rest of her facial structure.</p><p>It was those eyes though, that Agatha could see so perfectly in her mind's eye. She was quite certain that she had never seen a pair of eyes so beautiful in the millions she had surely met evenly in her entire life.</p><p>Agatha <em>always</em> looked someone in the eye. It could have been considered a power play, sure. To her, though, it was a way to see what you really needed to see. If someone met her dead-on, she respected it. Averting a gaze was a sign of weakness, nervousness. Maybe she could make people nervous, but there was more respect to be earned in staring her right in the face and not backing down.</p><p>There was admiration in fearlessness, Agatha thought.</p><p>The longer the two of them had sat on that deck, drinking their wine and eating that <em>perfectly cooked</em> steak, the harder it had been for Agatha to meet that bright green gaze. It made her stomach churn in a feeling she couldn't put a finger on. Agatha was not shy, she did not hide any bit of herself from anyone who looked in, but meeting that gaze across that table, those little candles flickering between them?</p><p>It felt like swallowing melted glass, heating every inch of her throat, lungs, chest to an unbearable temperature.</p><p>And Agatha had never wanted to run so far so fast in her life.</p><p>Still, she sat. She ate. She drank wine.</p><p>When she sobering realization had come that her clothes were probably dry?</p><p>For as much as that desperate feeling to get away from that woman's scrutinizingly beautiful gaze had been consuming her, the idea of leaving made something else in her waver with panic.</p><p>When she had asked for the water, it had not been Agatha's intention to become entirely unhinged, but as they stood there, so close that they could almost kiss... She'd acted on impulse, and before she even understood what she had done, she'd been staring into that empty glass and the dryer had rumbled back to life once more.</p><p>More wine. More conversation that flowed as easily as if they had known each other for years and were simply catching up after time apart. More deep thinking.</p><p>She was just... so easy to talk to, Agatha felt. She was warm and receptive and when she got into those little introspective ruts of thought? The way the workings of her brain wrote themselves so plainly, it was breathtaking and beautiful in its own right.</p><p>How stupid was it that she thought someone looked beautiful when they thought about something so thoroughly?</p><p>Agatha did not blush. She did not let the things people chose to say or do affect her in any kind of way that she would ever outwardly show, at least intentionally. That heat that crept up that very center of the back of her neck, though, was begging to tell a completely different story.</p><p>When Agatha had been presented with an opportunity to relocate, she had not been foolish enough to turn it down. It truly was beautiful out there, just listening to the waves and looking up at that dotted night sky. Something a little more cozy didn't sound too bad, either, though.</p><p>She could recall with absolute acuity the decision she had made, having already done her bit of snooping, to get to her feet and hold out her hand to the woman who owned the home. Normally, something of that nature would have been a play by her to gain power or favor in a situation, but right then, all she wanted to do was enjoy a few more minutes of the company the beautiful woman was willing to offer her.</p><p>Agatha's hand, as she was reliving through every bit of the night, raised to cover her eyes at what played across her skull next.</p><p>She'd grown restless, but not enough to want to leave. The woman had offered her physical contact, even in the form of Agatha's cheek pressed to the top of her thigh.</p><p><em>Pathetic.</em> Agatha goaded herself, her expression souring in her solitude of the den at the memory. <em>Feeling the physical presence of another human being had quite literally knocked her out.</em></p><p>And there she lay, staring through the cracks of her fingers at an unfamiliar ceiling. Another gentle groan passed through her lips as she forced herself into a sitting position, the dullest ache eating at the base of her skull, undoubtedly from the wine. It had been a while since she'd managed to put down an entire bottle; whiskey was more her poison.</p><p>With measured care, she shifted to place her feet on the soft carpet, her eyes taking in the sight of the room in the daylight. It was so... homey. It was soft, and warm, and it radiated that the person who lived there was happy to exist in such a space. Agatha had gathered that much the night before when she had taken her time to look over each plant that lined the far window, when she had noted the spare bedroom that clearly belonged to a younger woman even before she'd been informed of the daughter who wasn't around as much.</p><p>It made Agatha miss Nicky.</p><p>He had been home for his birthday a few months back, but she'd not heard hide nor hair from him since. This was how it went with them. He came home, things would be alright and he'd leave with an intention of inserting distance before things could get bad again. She had no one to blame for that but herself, though, and she was well aware.</p><p>Her cold gaze fell onto her clothes, her lips twisting into a dissatisfied frown. She didn't want to get dressed, didn't want to depart to find her way to the nearest phone someone would let her use. She knew Dave would handle it the moment she got him on the line, but she was also going to have an impossible time getting him to believe this. She sighed and lifted her head, glancing toward the front of the boat to listen. She could hear soft vocals, almost hums, as if the woman were... singing?</p><p>It was distant enough that Agatha knew she had the time to get dressed, sliding her feet into shoes that were still damp, much to her chagrin. She pressed her lips in a tight line and shuffled back to the bathroom as soundlessly as she could possibly manage just to check her reflection in the mirror.</p><p>She was a bit startled at what she saw. Her hair had dried wildly and would have appeared unkempt or messy to anyone who saw her, but she didn't care. She did manage to run her fingers through it enough to keep the strays from winding out too far. Agatha met her own steely blue gaze in the mirror and found a sense of resolve.</p><p>She had wrecked one night of this woman's life with her sudden intrusion. Surely, she would be kind enough to offer Agatha another meal, would be more than willing to be sweet, but that kind of sweetness could only be tainted by Agatha's presence. On the other side of that coin, Agatha had never stopped to consider... that same sweetness, raw and thick like honey, had already started to seep through her own skin.</p><p>She flipped her hair back over her shoulders which she shook her confidence back into, her posture poised and assured despite the sinking feeling in her middle that she did not really want to go, even if she knew she had to.</p><p>When she finally strode back into that kitchen, the sight of the other woman at the stove pulled at something, a sense of longing, right in her gut.</p><p>Even though she was<em> just barely</em> taller than Agatha, she looked so small there, cooking eggs like it was the most natural thing in the world to be making breakfast for a woman who had completely bulldozed her way into her life.</p><p>Her head lifted -- <em>those damn eyes</em> -- and the smile on her face was so instant and genuine that Agatha could actively feel herself slipping. If she stood there much longer, she was going to end up staying, and that would play in no one's favor.</p><p>"Good morning," Agatha greeted, and while her tone was not cold or rigid, there was an intent of separation in it.</p><p>"Good morning. Coffee's on if you want some. And I'm making eggs and bacon," came those low, velvety words that Agatha had already known were coming. There it was again, that sharp pang of loneliness that struck somewhere near the middle of her chest.</p><p>Refusing to crumble, Agatha steeled herself.</p><p>"I really should get going. I am sure there at least a few concerned people waiting to hear from me." She was fighting the war on keeping her voice tight to protect herself from the blow she was about to inflict on herself, but wanting to be warm in the appreciation for what had been offered since the moment she'd tumbled off of the bridge. "But thank you, this has all been so kind of you, -- uh..." she had started to offer, but it hit her like a ton of bricks. She did not know this woman's name. Her eyes instantly filled with panic at the thought and her breath was hitched toward the top of her throat as she silently begged the woman to just indulge her.</p><p>But then, she spoke. And Agatha's heart sank.</p><p>"It was my pleasure, really, -- er..."</p><p>For as convinced that Agatha had been that her heart had been in her throat, she was suddenly all too aware that it had just plummeted out of her body and into the hot core of the earth thousands of miles below them.</p><p>She had been right to assume that she had wrecked a day of this woman's life. She had been right in feeling like she'd never really had any right to be there, like she should have left when she was still soaking wet from head to toe, covered in salt water.</p><p>Agatha's jaw clenched for just a moment, her lips white around the edges with how tightly they were pressed together, but she knew that the decision was now made. It was her time to leave.</p><p>For one second, she'd intended on heading for the door. And then, in the next, she made an executive decision. This woman didn't have to tell her what her name was for Agatha to tell her without words what her hospitality and conversation had meant to her. She pushed forward right as the woman had started to turn back to the stove, catching her jaw in her palms. She pulled her close, but stopped long enough to lock their gazes together in a way that gave the other woman <em>just enough</em> time to push her away if she wanted to.</p><p>When she didn't? Agatha gave another tug, this time meeting her half-way in a tender and thankful lip lock. It wasn't forceful or brash, but there was intent and a feeling Agatha wouldn't admit to herself was within her own being. And then, she pulled away. She did not go far, however, but she was holding her breath. Her eyes were still closed.</p><p>Finally, she exhaled and in the same breath, let loose her sincere gratitude.</p><p><em>"Thank you,"</em> Agatha whispered at her as she found those eyes at close range, the emotion that welled within her nearly sinking her like a stone, wanting to cement her to that very spot.</p><p>She hesitated, having the hardest time pulling her hands away, but she forced herself into the action, her stomach twisting more and more with each second that passed.</p><p>They were a reflection of tight smiles, of a sad understanding, and so Agatha compelled herself to walk, carrying herself over to the front door. Her hand found the knob, but her head lifted and she looked back at that little Kiwi woman in her tank top and short shorts, her hair tied at the base of her neck, and it actually felt painful to keep on the path she was on.</p><p><em>"I won't forget you,"</em> Agatha had told her, and even though she tried to relay just how much she meant it, even she knew her tone had not carried with it the sincerity she had been hoping it would.</p><p>The moment the door clicked shut behind her, something happened to Agatha for the first time in any recallable memory.</p><p>Her back pressed to that front door and a hand clapped to her mouth, silencing the choked sob that fell from her lips.</p><p>How miserable was it to spend twelve hours with the first person to ever just... <em>see</em> her, and then have to leave without even knowing her name?</p><p>In that moment, Agatha would have said it was pretty fucking miserable.</p><p>So, she'd found a tech store that happened to be pretty close and managed to sneak an email to Dave and he'd been instantaneous in getting everything set up for her based on the location pin she had dropped him.</p><p>The car had arrived, taken her to get a new phone, and she had returned to her hotel room.</p><p>Agatha spent the time it took to set up the phone and knew that her first call was going to have to be to her best friend who was probably out of her mind with worry at the fact that their conversation had been abruptly cut off and then Agatha had been entirely unable to reply to any other message or call.</p><p>Sure enough, as she turned the phone on after the transfer, she had about eight messages and two missed calls from Wanda.</p><p>"Agatha! Are you okay?"</p><p>"What happened, are you alright?"</p><p>"Agatha, what's going on?"</p><p>"If I wake up tomorrow and I have not heard from you, I am reaching out to the Auckland authorities."</p><p>She was halfway through the slew of messages when her phone screen changed and Wanda's profile was ringing in. Agatha laughed, shaking her head as she lifted the phone to her ear.</p><p>"I'm alive," she offered, though her tone didn't sound that convincing.</p><p>"Agatha! What the hell! I have been worried sick! I was going to try one more time before I called Dave. If he hadn't heard from you, my next call was the police." While Wanda's worry was touching, Agatha felt like she sometimes forgot who Agatha was inherently as a person, but that was neither here nor there in this instance.</p><p>"I'm fine, Wanda." The fact that Agatha was suddenly being so tight lipped was most assuredly throwing red flags for Wanda left and right, but Agatha just... didn't have the words.</p><p>How did you talk about something when you didn't just live it, you <em>experienced</em> it? How was it possible to channel that energy, that thrum of excitement that had prickled over her skin every single second she had spent in the presence of that woman?</p><p>"Okay, but... what happened?"</p><p>Agatha exhaled a forceful sigh, more frustrated with herself than she was with Wanda's line of questioning.</p><p>"I was an idiot. I was talking to you, all pissed off about fuckin' Regan, and I was not paying attention to the fact that I was walking in the bike lane on the bridge I was crossing."</p><p>"Oh no," Wanda breathed, sensing that where this was headed was not the greatest.</p><p>"Someone wolf-whistled at me, and when I looked down across the water, there was a woman on the deck of a houseboat who was very obviously trying to get my attention."</p><p>"I heard the whistle! It was loud!" Wanda offered, more of a sudden recollection that it was something that actually needed to be said.</p><p>"As I went to ask her what she wanted, another biker came by and hit me. Wanda, I flipped over the fucking railing of the bridge and just flung my phone into a fucking marina."</p><p>"AGATHA! WHAT?!" Wanda roared in her disbelief, the laughter taking her whole. "You're fucking kidding me. There's no way..."</p><p>"Oh, trust me. It gets better."</p><p>"Did the woman who whistled at you jump into rescue?" Wanda asked sarcastically, her tone a little too sharp for Agatha's taste, but she let it slide.</p><p>"No," Agatha responded, but was quick with her follow-up. "But she did pull me out and offer to dry my clothes."</p><p>Agatha could hear Wanda's active fight to temper down how giddy this was making her, but Agatha knew better than to give too much away too soon. She needed the time it would take her to find her sanity over this before she would be able to have an honest conversation about it.</p><p>"And that's why you're answer the phone at... Two in the afternoon the next day?"</p><p>"Her dryer was old as shit," Agatha shot back, trying to brace those defenses. Maybe this would be a conversation with Wanda at some point, but Agatha was of the feeling that she needed to live with it a little longer before she found a way to put it into words.</p><p>"I was tired. Fell asleep on her couch. When I woke up, I got dressed and left."</p><p>"Mhmm," Wanda countered, her tone disbelieving. "And what is this houseboat woman's name?"</p><p>It was a reasonable question.</p><p>It was still a question Agatha didn't have the answer to.</p><p>"I don't know, honestly."</p><p>"Agatha... what?! What do you mean you don't know?!"</p><p>Agatha's lips were pressed again, that annoying itch to be done with this conversation digging at her skull.</p><p>"I thanked her and when I indicated that I didn't know what her name was... she just... gave me the same treatment back instead of giving it to me? So... I didn't push. If she wanted to tell me, she would have, right?"</p><p>"This is tragic, you realize that?" Wanda posed and Agatha sighed again.</p><p>"Yeah, and that's before I tell you I kissed her."</p><p>"AGATHA!"</p><p>*****</p><p>The rest of that day, Agatha had spent the majority of it walking around the city, just taking in the sights. If the scouting trip went well the next day and she preferred it to what they had gotten to see in Brisbane, she at least wanted to have a small hold on a city she would be spending quite a bit of time in.</p><p>It really was a beautiful place, but no matter how many windows she looked in, no matter how many martinis she drank at the bars dotted along the city streets, she couldn't stop thinking about the woman from the houseboat.</p><p>The only thing that had been able to distract her during the remainder of her time in the country had been that location trip. It was all that she had been envisioning and more and she had instructed Dave to have the permits pulled so that they could be signed and filed.</p><p>That night, she'd made a bold choice when the thoughts of that woman had crept back in. She'd removed the handle of whiskey that she'd bought at the duty free and had proceeded to self-medicate enough to put herself to sleep. She was tired of letting that woman live in her head, of letting her run around up there wreaking havoc.</p><p>Waking up the morning she knew she had to depart, she realized that the alcohol had only helped in the way that it had let her find sleep easier. It hadn't driven the thoughts out.</p><p>There was nothing on her schedule, nothing that she needed to tend to, and so she just sat in that hotel room and stewed.</p><p>She had been stupid. She had made a dumb decision to just not tell her what her name was. Of course, Agatha would justify it by claiming that the other woman had sent the message first by not giving Agatha anything when it had been clear she had been searching wildly for some part of her to hold onto.</p><p>By Noon, she knew that she was running out of time.</p><p>Agatha <em>needed</em> to know her name.</p><p>She checked through her email, thankful that the pin she had dropped Dave of her location the morning after was still nestled inside. In a flurry, she'd pulled up and ordered a car, got dressed and made up (probably a little more effort put into it than she would have had it been for any other reason) and was nearly barreling out the front door of the hotel to meet the car.</p><p>The car rolled up in front of that tech store she had been at the two days before and she was pretty confident that she could get back to the docking post where the boat should have been.</p><p>She'd only taken one wrong turn but she had realized it pretty quickly and got herself back on track, relieved when she came up over a hill and saw it.</p><p>The houseboat.</p><p><em>Her</em> houseboat.</p><p>Footsteps fell quite a bit quicker as Agatha fought herself on breaking into a dead sprint and looking like a lunatic to any neighbors.</p><p>As she approached, though, she surged toward the door and raised a fist, knocking a little harder than even she had meant to.</p><p>There was no sound.</p><p>No movement.</p><p>She knocked harder, opening her mouth to say something, but she had no idea what to say. She couldn't call out to her, nor could she identify herself and have it mean anything.</p><p>Instead, she just knocked. For a solid minute, she knocked, feeling absolutely insane.</p><p>Finally, acceptance hit her.</p><p>She wasn't home.</p><p>Her head hung, her forearm braced on the door in defeat.</p><p>Agatha had been too late. She had simply waited too long.</p><p>Slowly, she gathered herself and managed to head back down the walkway, though she hissed as she felt a catch on her leg, looking down to see that a nail sticking out of the post had produced a tear in her slacks. Great.</p><p>And then, like she was struck with a bolt of lightning, it hit her.</p><p>With a deft quickness, Agatha's hands flew up to remove her right earring. As she brought it down in front of her, she slipped the backing onto it and glanced down at this post.</p><p>This was stupid.</p><p>This was literally throwing a hail-mary completely blind in the dead of night with a receiver about two football fields away.</p><p>And yet, she reached down and slipped the earring onto the nail at the same time she swallowed down the blind hope that had started to burn in her chest.</p><p>At least she had tried.</p>

</p><p> </p><p>Getting on that plane headed for LA had been one of the hardest things Agatha had ever forced herself to do. Knowing that she was leaving, knowing that she had no idea when she was coming back made something ache deep inside of Agatha's chest.</p><p>She had no idea why she was so hung up on the woman that lived in the houseboat. It was foolish. She clearly had a life and probably did not care for the abrupt intrusion that Agatha's presence had brought with it.</p><p>Even as she sat in her seat in first class, watching the clouds roll beneath them soft as cotton, she still could not stop thinking about her.</p><p>Those green eyes with their little flecks that shimmered in the sun. That tan skin dotted with the lightest freckles. That breathtaking smile. The sound of her laugh. The way she had run her fingers through Agatha's hair almost the moment she had laid her head in her lap.</p><p>She had folded Agatha's nice clothes neatly and left them where Agatha would easily find them.</p><p>She had fucking cooked them breakfast.</p><p>And Agatha had high-tailed it out of there before she could let herself stay. She had convinced herself that it had been something done out of necessity. She had convinced herself that she was nothing but an imposition in that woman's life.</p><p>She had opened the door for introductions and the other woman had slammed it in her face.</p><p>She didn't want Agatha to know who she was. So Agatha had taken it as her not wanting to know who Agatha was, either.</p><p>Her disappointment felt unfounded, but it had been an automatic reaction to feeling like she wasn't going to gain any ground. It wasn't that she felt slighted, but it had become clear to her that she had intruded on the woman's peaceful and quiet life with a brand of chaos that only Agatha could bring.</p><p>What a way to make an entrance, right?</p><p>It didn't really matter what she did over the coming weeks, she was always chasing her tail over that one night. She spent hours on end burning holes into the eyes of a friend and fellow director, Jack Coppola, about how hung up she was over the entire ordeal and how angry she was with herself for not doing more. He had pointed out more than once that she had tried, that she <em>had</em> gone back, but something deep within Agatha felt like she should have tried to do more.</p><p>He had asked her if she would have pushed her flight, and she had actually been pretty devastated that in the throes of everything that had happened, she had never even considered it. She had initially resigned herself to walking away with the confidence that she had wrecked that woman's evening, but by that Tuesday, she simply needed to know if it was only her that seemed so stuck.</p><p>But the woman had been gone and Agatha had been stupid enough to think that doing something as foolish as leaving an earring on a wooden post would actually yield a result. What had she actually thought would come of it? At the end of the day, all it would really accomplish was making sure the woman knew that at least Agatha had been thinking about her. There was no other way to even assert that she was the one who left it; for all Agatha knew, the woman would find it and simply think it was lost.</p><p>The thoughts happened with less frequency as soon as the very active awards season circuit hit full force. There were interviews and press junkets left and right and while this was nothing more than routine for Agatha, there had clearly been something different about her demeanor, even if it wasn't too extreme. Her smiles were still bright, but the wattage had decreased. Her eyes darted with more frequency when looking out at throngs of people, somehow hoping that maybe she just might see <em>her.</em></p><p>That was an incredibly stupid thought. That woman was not going to suddenly turn up in the middle of a press event in Los Angeles for a film Agatha highly doubted the woman even knew of.</p><p>Agatha had scanned those shelves and she had found only one DVD out of the tens the woman owned that was <em>not</em> a documentary. That fact was also what caused Agatha to realize that the woman really did not have the slightest iota of who Agatha actually was.</p><p>Perhaps therein lie why Agatha could not get over it all.</p><p>That beautiful Kiwi woman had not a clue who Agatha was and she had still treated her with such kindness, such veneration, and such respect that Agatha did not have to command from her.</p><p>Agatha was used to asserting her power and status to garner those kinds of emotions out of people, which was a broken fact of her life, but she hadn't had to do a thing when it came to her. In fact, Agatha actually recognized it for all that it was: Agatha had been able to just be Agatha.</p><p>She hadn't climbed onto that boat as Agatha Harkness, Oscar Award Winning Director.</p><p>She had climbed onto that boat as Agatha Harkness, Professional Dumbass.</p><p>And there she had been, that angel of a human, doing everything she could to tend to the bruising of Agatha's ego, even on a very basic level. She had been generous, she had been sweet, and Agatha had made it a point to leave her own little indicators that the kindness had been appreciated and did not go unnoticed. None of it would matter, ultimately, but she had still tried to leave her own impression.</p><p>By the night of the Oscars, Agatha had almost succeeded in chasing those thoughts away. The day had been busy enough that it was all too easy to be distracted, to be focused on the many things she needed to do, the many places she had to be pushed to and from over the hours leading up to the actual awards ceremony.</p><p>The distraction had been nice, honestly. It was almost an entire day of her not kicking her own ass and dwelling on what an absolute idiot she thought herself to be for having walked away.</p><p>Jack had even asked her, though only once, why she didn't just go back. He had pointed out that it would be the only way to get a definitive answer one way or another, but that little part of Agatha that had felt herself to be a blemish on the woman's week had dismissed that she just needed to get over herself. To not have those conversations for once had actually served her well, or so she had told herself.</p><p>Winning?</p><p>Winning was everything.</p><p>Winning an Oscar was even more.</p><p>However, winning four Oscars was a goddamn <em>feat</em> in any lifetime, but to consider that all four wins had happened within twenty years?</p><p>Agatha felt unstoppable. She felt like what she was doing was working, it was resonating, it was pushing the limits of what the entertainment industry currently was into being something more and she was not going to slow down or stop any time soon.</p><p>If there was anything that could be said about her, it was that she had a vision. In that vision were multiple smaller visions and she went to whatever lengths she needed to in order to see them visualized, to see them form before her very eyes instead of in the confines of her mind. It was something people seemed to just... get. Of course she was not immune to the stray negative review or someone trying to do a think piece on all of the wrong points of one of her films, but overall, what she envisioned, she put on the screen. How people chose to receive that was always going to be based on personal experience.</p><p>It was that age old adage; One simply couldn't win them all.</p><p>But Agatha was going to win as many of them as she could.</p><p>Victory inevitably meant celebration. Celebration meant a variety of things for Agatha. It meant champagne and toasts abound. It meant attention and showing gratitude for any and all support. It meant swaths of women in the industry who wanted to praise her, some with a brush of her arm or a squeeze of her hand. Some were even so bold as to offer a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>This was a dance she had done before. This was something she was accustomed to.</p><p>It just so happened that this time? Those touches, those kisses to the cheek, those flirty little quips thrown at her left and right did not inspire her to go home to a warm bed and a good time. That was a break in character for Agatha and the moment she let the thought cross her mind as the after-party wound down that night, she was right back in a place that she had spent countless days trying to separate herself from.</p><p>Agatha had almost done it. She'd almost escaped the woman from the houseboat. Yet, she'd reached right up from Agatha's subconscious and gripped at the stem of her brain. She scaled up Agatha's spine, using each vertebrae as a step on the ladder that led to the base of Agatha's skull. Once there, she'd found the smallest opening and crawled right in. There, she sat for days, not paying a lick of rent to be living there.</p><p>Time seemed so much slower in the days following the awards and Agatha spent more often than not trying to throw herself into work in a way that would keep her distracted. She was working on scripts, building the staff she was going to need in those first stages of pre-production.</p><p>She'd nearly forgotten about the permits until she had received an email one afternoon to notify her that they were still in the process of being reviewed.</p><p>Once more, she was living on that goddamned houseboat again. It was a place her mind ventured to in those deeper, quieter moments as she was dozing at the end of a long day. It was a place she tried to not actively visit when she was of a right mind. All she knew how to do when she let those thoughts surface was rake herself over the coals over how foolish she had been.</p><p>As she stared at the email on her laptop screen and leaned back in her chair, her phone vibrated on the desk. Sitting forward, Agatha unlocked the screen to see a text from her friend, Wanda, who had announced that she was finally free from the insane shooting schedule for that season of The Bachelorette.</p><p>This intrigued Agatha for a myriad of reasons, but none more pressing than the fact that halfway through filming, the starlet of the season had confessed that not only was she a deeply closeted lesbian, but she also found herself undeniably attracted to Wanda. While Agatha was more than mildly interested in how that had all ended up playing out, she also was all too aware of the fact that Wanda pointedly made mention of finally having the time to get the entire low-down on what had happened that weekend in Auckland.</p><p>So, Agatha had agreed to abandon her tasks for a few hours so that the two of them could grab lunch and get day drunk on wine while they gabbed about their life.</p><p>It had been the plan, but how often were things going to plan lately when it came to Agatha?</p><p>"Okay," Wanda began, cradling her wine glass in her palm as she eyed Agatha skeptically. Her bright red hair fell down over her shoulders and the interest on her face was palpable. "So... I think that the only way I am going to comprehend this entirely outside of your completely disjointed texts is if you start from the beginning."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and heaved a sigh, tearing a piece of her bread off so that she could toss it casually into her mouth. She used the time it took to chew to try to build an answer.</p><p>"Obviously, I was on the phone with you. We've already covered the majority of that. Bike lane, disgruntled biker, yadda yadda. I swam over, mad as fuck, but when I looked up at her?" Agatha let out a low whistle, shaking her head. "She was <em>so fucking beautiful.</em> Her hair was dark, but between that and how tan her skin was, it made her green eyes so damn bright. When she looked at me with that smile on her face, I... I don't know. It's stupid. So anyway..."</p><p>She took a brief pause, but as her blue eyes flickered up to Wanda, she could tell that she was eating every last bit of this up like she'd been starving for a while now.</p><p>"Oh, knock that off right now," Agatha chastised, waving a hand in her friend's direction.</p><p>"Or else what? You'll stop telling me the in-depth version of the sweetest heartbreak I've ever heard of in my life?"</p><p>"Yes," Agatha shot back, taking a sip of her water subconsciously before she continued, "exactly that."</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes and took another intentionally slow sip of her wine, pinning Agatha with a gaze that encouraged her to keep going.</p><p>"So she offered to dry my clothes and told me where the bathroom was and where I could find clothes. I nosed around a little... I couldn't help myself," Agatha admitted, giving a shrug in response to the expression of astonishment that had fallen across Wanda's face. "She has... a <em>lot</em> of plants. Like, so many different ones and I know the names of none of them. The houseboat was just so... homey. And so I ended up writing a note, just telling her how soft of a place it was to fall into. I folded it into an origami flower and stuck it in one of the plants."</p><p>"Agatha, stop," Wanda nearly gushed, leaning forward in her seat. This time, it was Agatha's turn to roll her eyes.</p><p>"Anyway. Showered, pulled on one of her t-shirts that was probably a little too small and a pair of shorts I found. When I brought her my clothes and she came back outside, she had wine. And I mean, who would I be to turn down wine?" Agatha was telling this story as nonchalantly as possible, but there was this emotion welling inside of her the longer she spoke.</p><p>It was yearning.</p><p>It was longing to go back and do it over, do it different, do it right.</p><p>"So we drank. We talked. She told me about her daughter, about how she was away at college but lived on the houseboat with her during the summers. And, for the record, she absolutely did not <em>look</em> old enough to have a child in college, but I digress." Agatha's lips twisted for a moment in thought, those blue eyes darting over Wanda's face as if she'd find the correct syntax she was searching for. "I talked about Nicky, vaguely, and so we kind of bonded over that, I guess. She asked me about my <em>husband,</em>" Agatha managed, the smile on her face nearly shattering the word as both she and Wanda fell prey to a fit of giggles at the same time.</p><p>"You've really got to work on exuding 'raging lesbian' energy, apparently," Wanda offered, still attempting to taper off her laughter.</p><p>"I was pretty vague, but the longer we talked, the more I started to realize that she had no clue who I was. Which, not a huge deal but for someone who just seemed so down to earth, she also seemed... So out of touch." By the fourth sip of her water, Agatha realized she had not touched her wine. She let the thought pass and turned her attention back to recounting to Wanda what a giant idiot she'd been.</p><p>"She ended up grilling steak and putting together a couple of potatoes. While she was cooking, we kept drinking and kept talking about a bunch of different things. She gave me pointers of other places to check out, talked about how much she loved the country she'd spent the majority of her life in. It was just this effortless back and forth that felt so comfortable. It's insane even as I sit here right now and think about it." Agatha breathed a slightly disappointed sigh. "She turned on string lights, lit candles so that we could eat outside. The sun was setting and it was just... It was stupidly romantic and yet, it wasn't. It makes no sense."</p><p>To busy herself, Agatha tore off another piece of her bread and chewed on it slowly, as if buying herself some time before she had to keep going.</p><p>"We ate, and then she brought up the clothes. I wasn't drunk, by any means, but I knew I needed water. And I had every intention of drinking it. But when she went to check on my clothes... I was right there and I just... I wasn't ready to go." Agatha's eyes dropped to the table in front of her and her lips turned down at the corners. She should have kept that mindset the next morning. "I threw the water in and turned the dryer back on. And she just... went with it."</p><p>Wanda's eyes were so wide that Agatha was certain they could not get any bigger, but her silence was impelling.</p><p>"We went back outside to more wine. We started talking again and... she asked me if I believed in God. And, as you know, I answered to my own truth. But when I asked her back... I don't know what I had been expecting, but it wasn't what she provided. She talked about trying to find reason in her life, trying to know if there was cause for certain things to happen the way they do or if they're just, and I quote, 'some random lottery of meaningless tragedy.' That one... That one got me," Agatha admitted, lips worrying together for a moment. "She said that most of the time, it's the latter that she favors, but in moments like the one we were in? She said... she said those moments made her wonder."</p><p>"Agatha, I am absolutely going to let you continue on with this, but I am not going to pass up the opportunity to ask you what the fuck you were thinking with how this concludes?!"</p><p>"Yeah, I'll get there," Agatha grumbled, neglecting her wine yet again for a long drink of her water. "We ended up going inside and she let me select a 'movie.' She does not own more than one actual film. Every single DVD on her shelf was a documentary except one which, honestly? It was 'Fried Green Tomatoes.' I can't even be mad at that. I picked a random one and put it in. I really was trying to watch it, but I was restless and couldn't sit still. So... she offered to let me lay with my head in her lap. And I fell asleep no more than fifteen minutes later with the way she was running her fingers through my hair."</p><p>"This is absolutely soul crushing." Wanda's tone was tight and the look on her face already expressed her disdain for how she knew this ended.</p><p>"Walking out of that door was... so fucking hard. You know me, Wanda, there are times when I am desperate enough that I'll fuck anything with a pulse, but... I had prime choosings at the Oscars after party and yet... I didn't <em>want</em> it. I wanted to be back in Auckland, to be beating down the door of a damn houseboat the same way I did the day I left my earring."</p><p>"Wait!" Wanda cried, leaning forward over the table. "You did what?!"</p><p>Agatha's cheeks felt warm for the first time since she had started recanting the entire experience.</p><p>"I went back the day I left to see her, but she wasn't there. All I could leave was an earring. It was incredibly stupid and obviously did nothing, but... I tried?"</p><p>"You know, you're a total fuckboy ninety nine percent of the time, but this may just be the one percent of the time that I might dare to say that you could very well be a <em>romantic.</em>"</p><p>Agatha grimaced and then rolled her eyes at the same time she waved a hand dismissively. "I've been trying to do better! Even when presented with the opportunity I said no! Give me <em>some</em> credit!"</p><p>Wanda was laughing; she quite enjoyed being able to give Agatha a hard time without much effort.</p><p>"So when you get the permits, you're going to go back, right?" This time, Wanda's voice was lower, softer. It was genuinely curious.</p><p>"I... Ask me again when I board a plane to go back to New Zealand."</p><p>*****</p><p>Though they had enjoyed their meal, Agatha had ended up forking her wine over to Wanda. She didn't have much desire to drink, especially not with those memories so fresh in her mind. Reliving it in detail had dug up that sense of yearning she had tried so fervently to bury and for once, Agatha had decided that she wanted to live with it a little longer.</p><p>Near the end of it, Wanda had suggested that they go back to her place and relax and swim. It had sounded good enough that Agatha had agreed, though she hardly had the intention of getting in the pool. She just needed out of that office for the rest of the day.</p><p>Agatha had shot a message to Gio who had informed her he would be there in about five minutes to pick them up and run them by the office so she could grab her things. They ride back to that tower of a building had been short and Agatha snorted at the way Wanda nearly tumbled out of the car as she pushed the door open.</p><p>When Agatha thought her life was going sideways? Wanda drank almost a whole bottle of wine at lunch and reminded Agatha that they were all only human.</p><p>They climbed out and headed across the concrete toward the office building, but about twenty yards away from the bottom of the stairs, Agatha had glanced up toward the building. She saw several people coming and going, but there was someone who approached the top of the steps that immediately drew her attention.</p><p>Like cement, Agatha's feet planted and her hand flew out and grabbed Wanda's forearm, squeezing hard though her focus had not shifted from the top of the steps.</p><p><em>"Wanda," </em>Agatha hissed, damn near breathless. <em>"That's her."</em></p><p>Wanda's gaze lifted to follow Agatha's, trying to decode what she meant.</p><p>"That's who?" she asked, not following.</p><p>
<em>"Boat Woman. That's... That's her right at the top of the stairs. I..."</em>
</p><p>"Agatha! What the fuck, go!"</p><p>It was all Agatha needed to hear. In an instant, her feet were moving and she was trying to avoid looking so desperate in a sprint that she simply tried to speed walk her way across the stretch of space between them. Before she even realized it, the other woman was moving too. Once Agatha's gazed locked onto her, she was not letting her attention divert even an inch elsewhere. They were evenly met and they were going to collide together the moment they got close enough.</p><p>That was exactly what they did.</p><p>The moment the woman hit solid ground and Agatha entered her vicinity, Agatha's hands were on her and she was pulling her close, taking a kiss that was somehow reminiscent of the only other one they shared and yet also filled with every single moment of emptiness she had felt since their parting. It didn't have to make sense, but the way she could feel as the other woman melted and kissed her back?</p><p>It was <em>everything.</em></p><p>Their lips parted and Agatha's deep blue eyes opened to behold the woman in front of her, utter amazement written all over her face.</p><p><em>"Hi. I'm Agatha. What might your name be?"</em> If this woman thought for a second that she was going to get out of this without at least that much information, given the gravity of where they were standing and what it meant that a woman from Auckland, New Zealand was standing at the base of her office in Los Angeles, she was out of her mind.</p><p><em>"My name's Rio,"</em> the other woman murmured and something in Agatha completely lit up. What a beautiful name for an incredibly beautiful woman.</p><p><em>"Rio," </em>Agatha repeated, quite fond of the way it rolled off of her tongue and bounced between her lips. <em>"It's nice to meet you."</em></p>

Love in my arms and the sun in my eyes<br/>
I feel safe in the 5am light<br/>
You carry my fears as the heavens set fire<br/>
</em> <em>*****</em></p><p>Looking down at the city Agatha knew and loved so much as it splayed out hundreds of feet below where she sat behind Rio, there was this disconnect that felt foreign and strange, but only in the way that did not carry any negative connotations with it. Instead, it was as if she were looking at something so familiar as it was shed in a new light.</p><p>She was seeing that city in the wonderment that was so prevalent on the other woman's face. It was a look that Rio had been wearing for the majority of their day. </p><p>It had been there in the office when she was likely pretending to read, those glasses periodically sliding down her nose.</p><p>
<em>Gods, she looked so good in those glasses.</em>
</p><p>It had been there when they had arrived at the beach, when Agatha had carefully led the horse over to her.</p><p>It had been there as they stood in that cove, the shimmering lights of the sun bouncing off of the water, rippling over every craggy surface of rock that surrounded them.</p><p>It had been there when Agatha had approached her on that beach, asking her what she was thinking about.</p><p>There it was again, as though they were on the edge of the world and Rio could see life for exactly what it was.</p><p>It was Rio's life, and Agatha wanted her to see as much of it that she could help provide. Sure, Rio had been the one to take the leap, to make that journey, but now Agatha felt it her duty to provide a new vantage point. It wasn't just things to see or do, it was a variety of experiences to be had, to be felt. It was the true definition of living in the moment.</p><p>Since Rio had appeared at the top of those steps, there was very little in Agatha's life that had gone to any plan she might have had laid out before those moments. She'd been so invested in her work before then and yet, once Rio was there, it all seemed so unimportant.</p><p>Since Rio had shown up, Agatha stopped giving a shit so much about what she should have been doing and instead poured every bit of her effort into doing things she <em>wanted</em> to be doing. It was a freedom she had not ever really allowed herself to have. Agatha's entire life was her career. It had been that way for decades. </p><p>Since Rio had come into her life, Agatha had started to question exactly what her place was in the world.</p><p>She was a household name, had made millions of dollars from the work she pushed out to the world.  She was, by all definitions, Hollywood royalty and had worked her ass off to get there. She had sacrificed personal relationships, foregone making connections with people because all that had mattered was her ability to produce. Her worth was only as good as her worst critic's opinion; it pushed her to do better with each piece, to anchor more thought into the subtleties.</p><p>The only thing Agatha cared about from her place perched on the lip of her building, that breathtakingly beautiful woman sat against her, held firm in the embrace of her arms admist the breeze of the Los Angeles night?</p><p>Making sure she got more of that feeling, the one nestled at the apex of her ribcage, just below her sternum.</p><p>Ruminating on such a resolution, her bright blue gaze burned in the twilight as her head turned to behold the miles and miles of California terrain that stretched out into the darkness. Very quietly, in a mindless slip, she began to hum.  It was something Agatha did often when the noise in her head got a little too loud.</p><p>Right then, she needed to drown out the thoughts that she could very well be tanking her career with how badly she wanted to invest all of her time in this mysterious, enigmatic and enrapturing woman that held a line that was seemingly connected to the very middle of Agatha's chest.</p><p>So she hummed.</p><p>It hadn't lasted long, but only because the chill started to set in. The deeper into night they rode, the more biting the wind seemed to become. It had been subconscious, her falling silent, and then the shiver that happened not a moment later. She hadn't wanted to move. Not from that spot. Not with Rio in her arms.</p><p>She felt Rio's grip as it flexed into the back of her wrist, fingertips light but also prodding.</p><p>Disappointingly, Rio shifted and slipped just out of Agatha's hold. Somehow, Agatha kept from showing her dismay on her features and instead left the space for Rio to speak.</p><p>"Let's get you inside. You're cold," came her rich, sweet voice. </p><p>Agatha started to say something, started to dismiss it and say it was fine, because it was. But then, she saw something when she looked into those insane green eyes, so bright even under the cover of the inky sky above them. Her slightly parted lips pressed again, her own scrutinizing gaze darting between points on Rio's face.</p><p>Slowly, Agatha's expression eased and her shoulders sank slightly with her understanding. They had been carefully toeing these lines between them, so calculated in each step they took in the dance they had tangled in. The intent was there, it was clear, but Agatha wasn't quite sure that Rio was ready for her to verbalize it.</p><p>Agatha chose to be playful, hoping beyond all hope that it was the right move. There were undertones, without question, but Agatha knew enough to know that Rio needed to be handled with care. While it was not something Agatha was used to doing, she wanted to, for Rio. </p><p>Anyone else wouldn't have been sat up on that rooftop with her. Anyone else wouldn't have had nearly as many chances to speak. Anyone else would never have gotten any opportunity to see Agatha as vulnerable as she felt so insanely comfortable letting Rio witness.</p><p>So, while still suggestive, Agatha could keep that deep sense of caution and care in her intentions.</p><p>
<em>"So I suppose the onus is on you, then, to find a way to warm me up."</em>
</p><p>While Rio's placidity did not waver much, Agatha could have sworn she heard it: the quietest catching of Rio's breath just above the sound of the wind. Or... was it just a part of that gusty symphony? Agatha couldn't be certain because nothing else on Rio's expression gave her away.</p><p>Then, with an impossible smoothness, both of Rio's brows lifted and she closed a little bit of the space between them.</p><p><em>"I can think of a couple," </em>Rio murmured and for a brief moment, Agatha could suddenly feel her heart beating very firmly in two places at once.</p><p>With little thought, Agatha sealed off the distance between them with a heavy kiss, but she kept her hands to herself. She simply kissed Rio with that vigor that came from not understanding such insane emotions without having adequate time to compartmentalize them. </p><p>Agatha was being slow, yes. She was being patient. However, that did not completely void every bit of who she had been not even two months ago. Agatha was, and always had been, a hungry and sexual being. Even in a marriage of convenience, she had sought so desperately to find release without actually going so far as to cheat. That only would have hurt her and her career in the long run. She'd done... more than questionable things in the midst of those miserable ten years, not limited to voyeurism, but that was a chapter of her life she had since tried to close for the most part.</p><p>Hearing such a coy statement, seeing that look on Rio's face as she uttered those words? It reignited that fire, the one that had been nothing but hot coals since the day Agatha had met Rio.</p><p>It was so instant and scorching that even as she pulled away and her eyes opened to take Rio in, she could not mask it.</p><p>Rio didn't seem to care.</p><p><em>"Let's go." </em>Rio's suggestion had not been demanding or desperate, but the way she gave Agatha's cheek the softest tap with the tips of two fingers only deepened the heat Agatha was feeling in her stomach.</p><p>It took them little time to clean up from their meal and make their way to the ground floor where Gio had been waiting with the car outside. Something about the night suddenly felt like it had been jump started, like there was a charge in the air around them that neither of them knew how to acknowledge.</p><p>Truthfully, Agatha didn't want to push Rio. There was already enough reason to know that this wasn't something Rio had done... since she was a teenager, and that could have been intimidating in its own right. Agatha wasn't scared, or nervous, but she was overtly aware and attentive. </p><p>If, Agatha thought with her hand on Rio's thigh as they bumped through the city back toward the Freehand, she had to fall asleep horny that night, she would at least do it happy because someone she was realizing she cared for very deeply was going to be in her arms. </p><p>With her eyes on the orange and yellows of the city lights outside of the window, Agatha was trying to construct a plan. She had to find a way to make her intent known and yet, leave every choice out for Rio to be the one to make them. Agatha could offer invitations, she could use her imaginative creativity to find ways to show what was available without appearing greedy to obtain it. All that Rio had to do was take them at face value and do with them whatever it was she felt at peace enough to do.</p><p>For as rational as Agatha was trying to be, she could feel in every bit of her body that she was being betrayed. As they slid into that elevator -- nearly silent -- her arm draped over Rio's shoulders to hold her close, Agatha knew that there were jackhammers not nearly as loud as the sounds being made in her chest. Perhaps an exaggeration, but it felt pretty accurate in the moment.</p><p>When the door of the room shut behind them, Agatha had devised a plan. It wasn't <em>entirely</em> suggestive in the way that it wasn't meant to entice so much as it was to gently nudge open the door to a new facet of what might be able to unfold between them. She watched for a moment as Rio retreated to the other side of the room to charge her phone and drew in an impossibly deep breath.</p><p>It was right there. It was then or never.</p><p>Agatha was still only a moment longer before she started toward the bathroom.</p><p>"I'm going to shower really quickly," she informed Rio sweetly, though her head turned just enough that she could catch sight of the other woman on the other side of the room. The smallest curling of her lips pushed on her cheeks; the first invitation. It was the softest beckoning, one that didn't need words.</p><p>
<em>You're more than welcome to join me.</em>
</p><p>There, it was out in the open without her actually having to say it. Feeling a little more resolved, Agatha continued her way into the bathroom to strip down and start the shower. Once she was satisfied with the temperature, she stepped inside and slid the door shut behind her. </p><p>Agatha had not looked at Rio again. She had not been anywhere near brave enough. She had not wanted to see any kind of panic or concern, but even more, he had not wanted to see if something happened where her request did not impact correctly and broke Rio instead.</p><p>Those thoughts began to churn with a little more fervor the longer Agatha stood in the shower, backing up to bask beneath the warmth of the water. Her vocals trilled lowly in a hum, mind continuing to stew and stir. Despite the fact that she felt like she was about to explode with her desire to simply be closer to the other woman, she knew she could tame it. She knew she could shove down her own wants to tend to Rio's emotional needs instead.</p><p>It was this strange compulsion, this tic that Agatha could feel in her bones. It pushed her toward being things she didn't usually choose to be. Agatha was not gentle, she was not caring. She did not show such compassion for nearly anyone, not her longest employee or even her son. She loved Nicky, but things between them were often taut and fragile in a manner that did not allow for softness.</p><p>When it came to Rio, though, she wasn't even <em>choosing</em> to be those things... She was simply being them, not giving it a single thought before it just happened.</p><p>Agatha had just started to reach for the bottle of shampoo when she saw something through the frosted glass. It was a blurred silhouette, but Agatha could immediately tell that it was nothing more than a vast expanse of bare skin.</p><p>Rio had decided to join her. </p><p>She remained stalk still, holding in a breath as she watched Rio raise her arm. Then, she stalled. </p><p>Agatha didn't want to wait anymore.</p><p>Cautiously, Agatha's fingers hooked around the handle and gave a gentle pull. The very second her crackling blue gaze landed on Rio, she had to put every bit of effort into remembering to simply breathe. </p><p>Rio wasn't looking at her; in fact, she was still staring at her own hand as it hovered in the air, no longer able to find purchase on the door handle. Slowly, those beautiful green eyes began to dart and shift. While they swept up, Agatha was not surprised that they did not lock with her own and chose to survey what was presented before her.</p><p>As Rio took her time to scope Agatha out, Agatha's urge felt almost primal to drink up every bit of Rio that was stood there on that tile floor.</p><p>Her tanned skin was so smooth, dotted by the ever-so-occasional mole or freckle across her chest and shoulders. Her hair draped over her muscular shoulders in a way that likely tickled her collarbones. Agatha simply couldn't stop herself from allowing that reverent gaze to drop lower, to those perfectly shaped breasts with nipples that were likely only stiff because of nerves. Her stomach was toned, little indents from the shapes of her abdominal muscles running through skin like rivers. Lower still, her hips were smooth and wide, housing that tuft of dark hair between her legs.</p><p>Before Agatha could let her mind run away with her, she looked back up to Rio only a few seconds before Rio met her eye-to-eye.</p><p>In those few seconds, she saw it.</p><p>Unimaginable beauty hidden beneath so much wariness and fear.</p><p>The worry was there, so obvious, but Agatha didn't let it unsettle her. Instead, the hunger smoothed out of her expression and she did one thing she knew she could do.</p><p> She reached forward, several feet above the lip of the shower, and held her hand out for Rio to take when she decided she was ready.</p><p>It took the duration of one whole blink for Rio to make such a decision, her palm sliding confidently into Agatha's despite the uneasiness that seemed to be reverberating throughout her. Agatha stepped back as Rio crossed the threshold to lay her feet against the stone of the shower floor. She shifted, allowing for Rio to face the stream of the shower and the comfort that could be brought by the temperature of the water.</p><p>So easily, Agatha slid up behind her. Her touch was tender as her hands found Rio's hips and Agatha's cheek pressed to the side of Rio's head, her hair still dry for the time being.</p><p><em>"I'm glad you decided to join me," </em>she informed Rio lowly, her voice almost a purr. She turned to place a kiss atop Rio's hair, giving her hips a soft squeeze at the same time. </p><p>Rio stepped forward, turning enough to wet her hair and so that she could take in the woman before her, a lucid smile tugging on her lips. Agatha leaned over to gather a palm full of the shampoo so that she could tend to washing and showing compassion to this insanely beautiful woman that was somehow the most prevalent thing in her life after merely days spent together. It was so utterly nonsensical, but as she stood there, her fingertips massaging Rio's scalp with intentional softness, she knew that it was too right to be wrong. </p><p>It was this incredible thing to behold, the longer Agatha worked, as the tension slowly started to ease from Rio's form. It had been obvious that she was nervous, worried even, but there was no reason to be. Agatha had learned enough to know that finding the ability to be patient was going to be the key here, and for Rio? For Rio, Agatha could somehow find every bit of patience there was to be had in the world.</p><p>It was this dangerous dichotomy in Agatha's mind, the way she wanted to know what Rio's skin tasted like sans the soap that Agatha worked over it and yet knew that she would only get that answer when Rio was ready. </p><p>Never in her life had Agatha approached anything from a truly predatory starting point, but even if she had been close a couple of times before, this instance was not one of those times. Instead, she was simply basking in the beauty and vulnerability that Rio was willingly forking over. With that, she was going to use a tender touch both physically and emotionally.</p><p>This was big for Rio, and Agatha <em>got</em> that without having to be told directly.</p><p>To Agatha's delighted surprised, once Rio had been cleaned of the film from their day, she turned her attention to Agatha, insistent on returning the favor. So... Agatha let her. </p><p>The truth was, for as easy as it might have seemed for her, this was not something Agatha chose to do with regularity. She did not let women this close because she had a fortress to present to the world. She needed to be guarded and giving some random woman she chose to fuck at 2am a view of this? Of what she looked like when she could be at her most unprotected state? The mere idea was an absolutely dreadful nightmare.</p><p>In the motions of Rio working the shampoo into a lather in her hair, Agatha's eyes had fallen shut and she found herself humming again. This time, it was because of how good it felt to simply be touched in an affectionate manner by someone else, someone she knew she had developed feelings for. For as much as Rio was choosing to be bare and exposed and vulnerable, Agatha realized as Rio washed at her skin that she was making that came choice, too, maybe to prove that she could.</p><p>Hardened and defensive Agatha was letting someone finally see her for the woman she never let see the light of day. Rio was looking at the Agatha that could have been, had she not locked herself in the armor of her career.</p><p>Rio was seeing an Agatha that, despite what she had believed her entire life, was starting to understand she might actually be capable of falling in love with another human being.</p><p>Each time one of Rio's fingers pressed intentionally into a tight spot of Agatha's muscles, it reiterated to her that making such a choice to have those kinds of feelings, it was valid. It was warranted, even, at that point. Rio had never touched her like this before, or even anyone within two decades, and yet, she seemed to know exactly what to do. It was comforting in the way that Agatha could only express with contended sighs and groans of approval.</p><p>She turned in her spot, eyes opening to behold the woman directly before her, just... studying, appreciating. There were so many things Agatha did not know in those moments, but one thing she did know with little doubt?</p><p>Rio Vidal was something special.</p><p>And Agatha wanted to keep her around for as long as she could manage.</p><p>Such a dawning urged her to act, leaning forward to kiss her as a couple of wrinkled fingertips landed feather light beneath Rio's chin. It was a warm kiss, but not hungry. It did not pull or drain. It was simply a showing of exactly what it was Agatha was feeling right then, something that didn't have an appropriate syntax that could communicate it effectively. It was her gratitude, her appreciafion of Rio's value on full display.</p><p>When it broke, Agatha shut the water off and leaned into Rio slightly so that she could pull the door open and retrieve them the towels that were hanging on the bar fixed to the wall on the other side of the shower entrance. The quiet way Rio thanked her, sliding that towel around her lean frame as she stepped out into the cool air of the bathroom, it did something to Agatha's heart, tripping it up the slightest bit in her chest.</p><p>Who was this woman?</p><p>Why did she feel familiar in the most dissociative way?</p><p>Was it because Agatha looked into those eyes and saw a way of life that had been so lonely in a way that she could recognize? Was it because she saw the physical personification of her own loneliness that had simply manifested differently as a result of the way their separate lives had unfurled before their meeting?</p><p>Agatha knew the answers to a grand total of none of those questions, but that fact alone did not seem to carry with it too much weight. </p><p>They finished drying off and hung their towels with ease, Agatha stealing a quick kiss as she finished the task. With a light flick of her wrist on the way out of the bathroom, Agatha shut the light off and paced out behind Rio who had stopped to look over at her bag and the clothes she had packed inside of it.</p><p>She could have held a debate, could have second guessed herself but Agatha didn't give herself the time. She stepped directly behind Rio, a ginger touch of fingertips gracing over the skin of her back.</p><p>From her place, her lips were close to Rio's ear but not close enough to make contact. Her whisper came soft, full of compassion and patience. There was also a comfort to be found there, too, as Agatha's words escaped her. <em>"We don't have to get dressed, if you don't want to."</em></p><p>Rio nearly shivered there before her, her skin spiking with a million little bumps. Agatha needed to say something more, but she pressed a kiss to the side of Rio's head first.</p><p>
<em>"It's entirely your choice. I just want you to be comfortable."</em>
</p><p>It was the best way Agatha could say what she was feeling without cramming it into so few words, words that she was not certain she was ready to say aloud. She knew how she felt, and those feelings had only cemented themselves over the course of their night together, but it still felt dangerous. </p><p>Rio was going to leave.</p><p>That was an inevitable fact.</p><p>Agatha wasn't sure she could admit to something so massive for the first time in her life and then force herself to watch Rio walk away, to watch her go back to a life that she had been living before those moments.</p><p>She couldn't let herself admit that she was capable of romantic love just to break her own heart with the irrefutable facts of the universe. She had faired well enough that far in life and she could keep going, even if she knew that she was already going to have a very distinct and Rio-sized shape hole in her chest when they parted ways. </p><p>In some ways, it made Agatha angry with herself but solely because she knew that she shouldn't have let herself slip so far down. But... If Rio was teaching her anything, didn't she deserve to be cared for as much as the next person? Didn't she deserve, in some way, for Rio to care about her the way she cared for Rio, even without rationale to back it up?</p><p>Rio's head turned, her damp hair brushing the tip of Agatha's nose.</p><p><em>"C'mon," </em>Rio offered lowly. Before it could actually sink in that Agatha was getting what she wanted, she felt Rio's fingers as they tangled with her own, using the hold to guide her toward the bed. She offered no protest as the contact broke and Rio placed herself atop the bed, leaning against the pillows as her hands fell to the tops of her thighs in a clear display of her nerves.</p><p>With a dash of grace, Agatha slid herself onto the bed, her bare skin bumping against Rio's as she settled directly next to her, almost on top. It was meant to be soothing, meant to offer a comprehension of that anxiety that Agatha could so clearly see as it rocketed its way around Rio's being. Before Agatha could address it, Rio spoke first.</p><p>
<em>"I'm sorry... I'm just nervous."</em>
</p><p>Lacking any hesitation, Agatha's hand dropped to Rio's thigh, right next to where her own was placed. A couple of Agatha's fingers overlapped Rio's and curled around them, giving a reassuring squeeze. Upon feeling it, Rio looked up and met Agatha's gentle gaze full on. Agatha thought, for just a moment, as her lips worried together.</p><p>It took her little time to realize what it was she needed Rio to hear.</p><p>
<em>"This is why I didn't ask you to come home with me yet. Because here, we're on your court. Every pass, every play, it's your call and on your terms. I understand the responsibility you are tasking me with, even unknowingly."</em>
</p><p>Rio's eyes were moving, darting all over Agatha's face, looking for some kind of explanation that she would not find without Agatha bringing herself to speak again. Her response came with simplicity laced all throughout.</p><p>
<em>"You told me that I'm the first person you've been with... in a very long time. I... cannot imagine the loneliness you have felt for over half of your life, but I understand it. I recognize that it was a necessity built on trauma. Someone hurt you, abused you, and changed your entire life without your permission. And so..."</em>
</p><p>Agatha could feel as her throat started to tighten with the sincerity of what she was trying to explain. It was heavy, it was deep, and she knew no other way to address it than directly. </p><p>
<em>"So long as you and I are together, nothing will ever be done without your consent. It's not that you have to be the one to engage, or start, but I just want you to know that you always have a choice, a voice."</em>
</p><p>It was what she needed to say, how she needed to be perceived in those moments. She had an inexplicable desire for Rio to just <em>hear</em> what she was saying. </p><p>After the silence laid heavily over them for several drawn on moments, Rio began to move, raising her hand in a gesture that Agatha anticipated, even before she felt the flesh of Rio's palm as it pressed to the skin of her cheek. Her eyes wanted to slide shut in bliss, but she held that gaze, just seeing Rio for every bit of the intricate package of human life she was.</p><p>She was this formidable woman in her own right, in a way Agatha knew was <em>so </em>different from her own title as such. Rio had instead conquered life despite what it had dealt her, in her own way, and she never questioned it. She never once thought that her life needed to be any different, that she needed to make a change. She had found contentment in complacency. That was the truly remarkable part.</p><p>And yet, somehow, Rio didn't realize just how beautiful that made her, or how deep the impact was on Agatha that she was making those executive decisions now, the ones where she was finally letting someone in.</p><p>She was letting Agatha in.</p><p>Agatha knew what that meant and the best way she could convey that was to show not tell. So, Agatha kissed Rio. She kissed Rio like it was the last thing she might ever do. She kissed Rio like she needed Rio to understand that while they were feeling and experiencing things that seemed to exist only outside the realm of defined sense, they were going through that sensation together. It wasn't a one way street. This was mutuality.</p><p>The exchange was steady for several minutes, just the gentlest locking of lips on lips. It was an outpouring from both ends, depleting neither of them and yet filling them both to capacity at the same time.</p><p>Slowly, it wound down and she felt Rio separate the contact, leaving Agatha's blue eyes to flutter open to appraise her. She had a request she wanted to make, but she did not want to press Rio in any direction where she was not okay with something Agatha asked of her. </p><p>Agatha released her hold on Rio's fingers and thigh and raised her hands as she spoke. <em>"Come here," </em>she asked softly, giving her lap the lightest tap. <em>"I'd like to see you."</em></p><p>The response Rio had to offer her came at a considerable pace, one that Agatha had not expected, but she was thankful that Rio found little hesitance in the idea of complying. Agatha was completely enchanted as she watched Rio swing a leg over her lap, settling atop her thighs. When she stilled, Agatha's hands landed automatically on Rio's hips and her adoring gaze lifted. She was fighting to not let the stinging at the backs of her eyes win out at just how goddamn beautiful she thought the woman before her to be.</p><p>It wasn't just her appearance, or this divine showing of a body. It wasn't the way her eyes sparkled in the light of a setting sun.</p><p>It was that Rio contained all of these possibilities, the ones that Agatha had told herself for nearly fifty years that she did not deserve. Rio offered Agatha a chance to know what it might actually mean when someone said they cared enough to go to the ends of the world. The reason Agatha was growing so sure was because <em>she</em> was feeling that way about <em>Rio,</em> too.</p><p>Agatha raised a hand, watching with her chest frozen in the breath she was holding as Rio's eyes slid shut. Her fingers hung mid-air as she debated what direction she was going to take. Where was she going to let that touch land? Where was she going to show Rio that she could trust her? After a seconds long contest, Agatha placed her palm so very lightly around the front of Rio's throat, just a brushing of flesh before it moved. </p><p>She took her time, just tracing out the endless waves of skin that housed the important parts of this woman before her. She felt over every curve and divot that Rio was granting her access to, just paying every bit of attention she could to every blemish, every stretch mark, every mole or freckle.</p><p>Slowly, that touch skated down the center of Rio's torso but stalled mid-way, Agatha's focus lifting from her work to meet Rio's gaze, soft and exposed in the dim light of the room. </p><p>What Agatha saw there was holiness and purity. What Agatha saw in the expression on Rio's face was absolute devotion.</p><p>Rio must have seen it mirrored in Agatha's features too, because she gave the slightest nod in response to a question Agatha had not been able to bring herself to ask. She got that consent anyway, and Agatha knew better than to fumble right then. She recognized what she had and was absolutely committed to not blowing it apart.</p><p>She didn't.</p><p>Agatha took her time from the very second her touch sank into the warmth of Rio's desire. She paid special care to each and every spot she could reach, showing her the attention and attunement Rio so wholly deserved. She could sense it, feel that it was working, that she was reading Rio's body the right way and acknowledging those responses accordingly. </p><p>Feeling so struck with the wonder she was feeling at simply just watching, Agatha began to fall breathless at the sight. Rio's eyes couldn't seem to stay open, her body too receptive. Her hands were restless, eventually hesitating on Agatha's shoulders, and she seemed to be doing little else aside from melting at the tips of Agatha's fingers. The stress, the worry, the anxiety it all just seemed to roll off of her like steam on a cold night with each little rocking of her hips that occurred. </p><p>She had been so focused on what she was doing that when Rio's finger landed beneath her chin and beckoned her upward, she was almost jarred from the moment, her movements stuttering for just a second when their eyes met. Agatha didn't hesitate to correct herself, resuming what it was she was doing, but it was made a bit easier as her muscle memory took over the moment Rio sealed their lips in a hot and wanting kiss. </p><p>Every moan? Devoured. Every inch of Rios mouth? Tasted and savored.</p><p>Agatha had been set on taking what she could, but it all happened at the same rate as a high-speed car crash: Rio's body tensed. Then, her head whipped back and a loud, long moan spilled into the air around them, pleasured and wild in its reverberations. Her body was trembling like a leaf in a tornado but Agatha didn't let up, at least not at first.</p><p>The moment Rio rocked forward, planting her face in Agatha's neck to stifle the unkempt whimpers that were rolling from her, Agatha was quick to cradle her, to hold her close as she felt what Agatha was assuming was the first orgasm she'd had at the hands of another human being in over twenty years, maybe longer. </p><p><em>"Holy shit," </em>Agatha breathed with the softest giggle as she turned her head to nuzzle into Rio's hair affectionately. </p><p>With Rio laid there against her in a spent and pleasured heap, Agatha was realizing something that felt dangerous to admit to herself.</p><p>She had been warring throughout the entire night about the insanity of what she knew she was feeling, but right then?</p><p>Right then, Agatha knew how she felt about Rio.</p><p>It would never make sense, but it was still true.</p><p>Agatha Harkness loved Rio Vidal.</p><p>And that was even before Rio looked her in the eye minutes later and made a request of her own.</p><p>
<em>"I want to touch you."</em>
</p><p>Agatha heard what she was really asking.</p><p>
<em>I want to show you I love you too.</em>
</p><p>So Agatha answered with every bit of honesty she could muster.</p><p>
<em>"Touch me."</em>

</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Thump. Thump. Thump. Thump.</em>
</p><p>It was all Agatha could hear the moment the request left her lips as her heart hammered in ears.</p><p><em>Touch me,</em> she had asked, nearly begged. </p><p>And yet, staring up at the woman in her lap, into those unbelievably bright green eyes felt stunning. When Rio whispered to her to close her eyes, something in Agatha felt so jilted that she would have assumed it was a similar feeling to getting struck by lightning. She had asked for this, so why, when Rio requested that she silence a sense to pay attention to the others, did she panic?</p><p>Because Rio was asking her to let go. Rio was asking Agatha to trust her. Agatha knew she could, without reserves, but something else was holding her back. It wasn't that she didn't trust Rio. That wasn't the issue at all. </p><p>The issue was that Agatha did not trust herself.</p><p>Everything had happened so quickly, snowballing into an absolute avalanche that decimated everything she had thought she had known about her life. She had left New Zealand knowing in her bones that she was never going to see the woman who lived on the houseboat again, and she had somehow talked herself into living with that fact, even if she couldn't find it in her to stop talking about that woman and that night to anyone who she trusted enough to be told.</p><p>Mere weeks before her trip to Auckland, Agatha had been on that fast track to nowhere good, drinking too much champagne and fucking too many women. She had been living the life that she had made for herself, a life that she had been thrilled to experience every moment of. It was money and booze and the occasional line or two of coke when she was feeling it. It was the endless sex, the sweaty nights and 2am town car rides back to the lavish and empty home she owned that sat just minutes from the beach.</p><p>She had been okay with the idea of being alone, with not having a partner or a relationship. She had all she needed in her work, her fame, and her sex appeal.</p><p>And then she had fallen off that damn bridge.</p><p>There she sat, her heart screaming in her ears that she loved this woman she arguably barely knew. It was shouting at her, telling her that this was what she would never find in high rise hotel rooms or high class bar bathrooms. This was something she was never going to discover in six glasses champagne and hungover mornings. The was the one thing she had told herself she could never have, and yet there it was, right in her lap in the most literal sense.</p><p>And that seemingly unattainable presence was asking Agatha to trust her, to fork over the iron grasp she had on her entire sense of self. It startled Agatha, but when Rio spoke again, the live wire slid from the water and the waves stopped jumping with fervor.</p><p>
<em>"It's okay, I promise."</em>
</p><p>It was so quiet, that whisper, but the genuine sincerity in it felt heavy like lead, giving weight to the brief and soft statement. </p><p>So, Agatha chose to listen.</p><p>There was a softness in her eyes, something that was swinging dangerously close to fear as she looked up at Rio. Rio was... divinity in a mortal form. She was full to the brim with patience, with kindness and respect. Rio was gentle in the most obscure ways, but at the same time, so forceful in her mere presence.</p><p>After another breath that only partially muted the drumming in her ears, Agatha finally closed her eyes.</p><p>She wasn't sure what she had been expecting, but it was most assuredly not the feather light touch that graced her hairline. The way it skated, barely there, from one side to the other. It dropped, fingertips brushing over her temple in a way that made goosebumps flare on every inch of her bare skin. Those peaks seemed to heighten as Rio's touch kept going, feeling out the angle of Agatha's jaw, tracing down it and then right back up the other side. </p><p>It was the brushing of Rio's fingers along her ear that cause a shiver to spike through her, though she did her best to tame it. Agatha could sense almost instantly that Rio was moving and that was confirmed when her palms raised to cup Agatha's cheeks. Agatha couldn't <em>feel</em> the back and forth touch beneath her eyes, but she could <em>sense</em> it, and such a feeling wrote itself so plainly in every inch of her expression.</p><p>Then, that touch became heavy as all eight fingers dragged around Agatha's neck, meeting at her throat. The way Rio reached up, pressing lightly on the underside of her chin, Agatha knew what she was asking for without saying a word.</p><p>Agatha tipped her head back in concession, lips parting unwittingly despite her nerves only for her to tuck the bottom one between her teeth.</p><p>Rio did not kiss her, leaving Agatha feeling surprised and a little closer to unsettled. In fact, her suspicions were confirmed as Rio began touching her again: Rio just wanted to explore first, to learn and understand the lay of the land, so that was what she was doing.</p><p>Her fingers were pressing and sliding again, but this time she touched a spot just below Agatha's right ear that cause Agatha to inhale sharply, her desire mixing somewhere with her nerves to settle like a boulder in her throat. Rio was trekking again in her exploration, that gracing moving over Agatha's neck, her shoulders.</p><p>By the time Rio had taken her by the hand, Agatha was fighting herself on not opening her eyes.</p><p>What Rio was doing right then, even though Agatha was sure she had no clue, was reaching right into her to pull out the smallest and most forgotten part of her and dragging it to the surface. Agatha did not do this. Agatha fucked. That was it. She did not sit in hotel rooms with women she took on horseback rides and let them touch her like she was letting Rio touch her.</p><p>Even when Rio patiently kneaded at her hands, outlining her bones and veins, Agatha still did not open her eyes. She let Rio place her where she wanted her, though her heart nearly jumped right into her throat the moment she felt Rio's hand squeeze hers where it rested on Rio's thigh. This was <em>so fucking intimate.</em> Intimacy was not an act that Agatha dared dip her toes in before, but right then, she didn't want it to stop.</p><p>As Rio began to repeat the process on the left side of Agatha's body, she let her for a little longer. She even continued to let her by the time she couldn't keep her eyes shut any longer, absolutely needing to see what was scribed onto this woman that was showering her in endless affection and attention. </p><p>She needed to see for herself how this woman could be so impossibly invested in showing her that she was worth more than hair pulling and choking and meaningless entanglements. She <em>needed</em> to understand how the woman that sat on her lap was also quickly becoming the woman who could be capable of her undoing. </p><p>At the bottom of it all, Agatha knew this was foolish. She knew it was dangerous and she could be doing something that would let her stare career suicide in the face.</p><p>She didn't care right then. All she cared about in those moments was the way Rio was looking at her, the little tip of her head she offered as if to ask why Agatha had gone against her wishes.</p><p>All Agatha could managed was a question that she tried to force into not sounding as frightened as she felt.</p><p>
<em>"What are you doing to me?"</em>
</p><p>She felt helpless in her inability to understand, to comprehend why this had all happened to her, <em>for</em> her.</p><p>When Rio spoke, Agatha was certain her heart ceased its repetitious thumping in her chest.</p><p>
<em>"I'm taking one of my many lessons in learning how to love you."</em>
</p><p>She said it. Rio said the word. <em>That</em> word. She didn't outright deliver the sentiment, but she had still very specifically chosen <em>that particular word.</em></p><p>Agatha was completely still, frozen in the shock she felt at hearing another human being use that word in her presence. It was not one she could easily recall ever having heard before, not from her mother, not from her ex-husband, not any fuck buddy she'd ever lost herself in.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was not able to be loved, and that had been a mantra she had kept in her head for so fucking long that it had become the essence of who she was. </p><p>There sat Rio Vidal, proving her wrong.</p><p>The shock and fear on Agatha's face had appeared and lasted too long, far beyond her own comprehension until Rio pulled into herself, deflating visibly.</p><p>She had chosen to use a weighted word and Agatha's reaction had caused her to grow doubt over such a choice. Rio was afraid that what had just happened between them, how Agatha had made her feel, was nothing but an unreciprocated showing.</p><p>Agatha knew <em>she</em> had to be the one to prove Rio wrong this time.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Agatha was sitting up, her hands quickly taking firm hold on either side of Rio's face. Agatha did not look at her, assess her, try to spark any conversation. No, the only shouting Agatha wanted to do was in the form of the desperate kiss she pressed to Rio's lips, pouring every ounce of her longing into the woman before her.</p><p>It was hungry, hinging on slipping into ravenous. It was a cry for more, for attention that she had been trying to stave off. Agatha had been clutching onto her steel walls for her entire life, but she wouldn't anymore, not when Rio was right there, begging to be let in. </p><p>Her tongue was venturous and aggressively exploratory in the way it barged into Rio's mouth. Agatha was kissing Rio like her life absolutely depended on it, like if she stopped she just might shrivel up and cease to exist. Rio wanted to love her, she'd said that much. Maybe she already did, but felt too scared to say it. As Agatha kissed her and Rio touched her body at the same time, Agatha knew the truth. </p><p>Agatha knew how she felt and that she was not doing either of them any kind of a favor in trying to bite it back or keep it from being known. </p><p>When Rio's hand found her chest, the way her palms skimmed over pebbled nipples drew a loud and fervent moan that could do little else that pour right into Rio's mouth. Her touch flexed, but the kiss did not break, their teeth still bumping in clicks and their tongues still tasting and devouring whatever they could touch in Rio's mouth. That touch on her chest lifted, shifting to those soft fingertips again, first over nipples and then down Agatha's abdomen.</p><p>Rio was touching her like she was the most precious commodity in the world. Rio was touching Agatha like she <em>was</em> actually capable of being loved by someone else. Rio was touching Agatha like she loved her.</p><p>She'd said it in too few words, but the longer they kissed, the quicker Agatha was losing the war of wills within her. </p><p>With a sudden surge of emotion and bravery, Agatha immediately drew back, those wild blue eyes flying open at the choked feeling of the words she wanted to say as they gathered and jammed in her throat. As Rio's gaze fell into her own, she knew that the tears brimming on her lids were probably visible, but she wasn't going to let them fall.</p><p>In a world where Agatha had been forced to be well-done, Rio had finally shown her what it meant to be truly raw.</p><p>That had to be obvious in the pathetic sound of her voice as she somehow found a way to produce the words.</p><p>
<em>"I love you, Rio. I know it's insane, it's--"</em>
</p><p>Before she could keep babbling on like the dumbass she always had known herself to be, Rio silenced her with one single finger as it pressed to her lips. Once more, she was shocked by how abruptly the gesture happened and how she had not at all expected Rio to want to silence an explanation of something so deranged that it should have never left her lips.</p><p>When the removed it, the kiss she replaced it with was... strange. It was soft. It was tender in a way that Agatha had absolutely never before known in her life. </p><p>Their lips broke and Agatha felt immediately as Rio pressed their foreheads together. While her response was still quiet, it held strength that Agatha herself had not been able to manage.</p><p>
<em>"I love you too, Agatha. And I have since the moment I pulled you out of that marina."</em>
</p><p>What could she say to that? What could Agatha truly respond with that would ever convey what it felt like to finally see life through a lens that was not entirely clouded with distrust and weariness?  Thankfully, she didn't have to because Rio filled the space with a kiss and then the silence with her kindness.</p><p><em>"It doesn't have to make sense, because it doesn't make sense at all. All I know..." </em>Rio whispered, so close that Agatha swore she could taste them on her lips. Rio was moving, much to Agatha's dismay, but when her eyes opened to look up at her, Agatha felt like nothing more than glass, completely see-thru. <em>"All I know is that I am ready to do what I need to if it means I get to keep you, like this, in my life."</em></p><p>Hearing those words, listening to the exact cadence that Rio had chosen, it struck her cleanly through the middle of her heart, There was a welling of tears that spilled over only in two droplets that careened down her cheeks, but Agatha made no move to hide them. They were not tears to be ashamed of, or ones of weakness. Agatha chose to let them fall because for as terrified as she had been feeling about the illogical attachment she had formed to Rio, it was clear that Rio knew the attachment was reciprocated.</p><p>The feeling of Rio's palm on her cheek caused Agatha to tilt into the touch, fighting to not let her eyes flutter shut so that Rio did not think she was shifting her focus.</p><p><em>"I've got you. And I promise, I will never intentionally hurt you. You've given me every single reason to trust you, to believe that you have my best interests at heart." </em>Rio was putting forth the most calming front, being so soothing with just the way she was speaking to Agatha, knowing that there were intricacies here that neither of them were ready to point out so blatantly just yet. <em>"Trust me, Agatha. Trust me to do for you what it is you strive to do for me every moment we're together. Trust me to love you."</em></p><p>Rio was dripping in honesty, so filled with it that it had nowhere else to go other than to seep out of every inch of her being, and Agatha could see it, could hear it. Agatha could even feel it in the way Rio's hands were so gentle against her skin.</p><p>Her glassy eyes were frantic as they darted over Rio's beautiful features, as if she were trying to look for <em>any</em> trace that might indicate she was being insincere. Agatha found no such thing.</p><p>Her mouth felt like she'd been eating sand for half of her life, but she still tried to speak, though very little came out.</p><p><em>"You... You're..." </em>Even as Agatha started the thought, she had not known how she would finish it. </p><p>Rio was what? Rio was beautiful, and intelligent, and wrapped kindness around herself like a warm blanket only to offer a sliver of it to anyone who was cold from the cruelty the world had to offer. Rio was vibrant and wild, making decisions like flying across the world in the off chance they might see one another again. But Rio was also purity in its rarest form, and Agatha had toppled -- quite literally -- head over heels into this feeling of love for her that now filled the deepest wells within her chest.</p><p>Before she could even attempt a suitable answer, Rio filled in the blanks for her.</p><p>
<em>"What I am, Agatha, is yours."</em>
</p><p>The way those words hit her was similar to a spark being hurled toward a pool of kerosene, but the kerosene was actually her brain and it caught fire in an instant. She leaned forward, their bodies pressing together hurriedly as she made a play for Rio's face, pulling her in for a kiss that grew in fervor and in sound as it became wetter and heavier.</p><p>Rio felt it, too. It was obvious by the way she was pawing at Agatha's body, the way her hands could not stay still and fingers could not resist the temptation to sink into Agatha's muscles and skin. </p><p>That kiss could have gone on forever, nothing more than a true exchange of love and emotion in ways that had never been experienced before by the two women in that bed. They had been lonely and isolated from true connection for their own reasons, but it no longer had to keep going on that way. They could find that connection and with it, a lack of fear when it came to embracing it.</p><p>The second Rio's lips went away, leaving Agatha cold and still starved, Agatha released a low whine of disapproval, wanting nothing more than to have that feeling back. Rio was quick, though, removing herself from Agatha's lap to fall in place at her right side, head dipping instantly to press her lips to Agatha's neck as she eased them back into the pillows once again.</p><p>The way Rio carried on, so doting and careful as she bit lightly and sucked softly, it was driving Agatha to the brink of madness. When she shifted again, her hand landed on Agatha's stomach and her lips latched on to that impossibly sensitive spot on Agatha's neck, the one that caused her to suck in a long and full breath, one that she felt all the way in her belly.</p><p>She needed this. She needed Rio. </p><p>Agatha had <em>never</em> begged to be touched by another woman, but there was a first time for everything, as it turned out.</p><p><em>"Touch me,"</em> she pleaded in a whimper so soft it was almost unintelligible.</p><p>Although Rio obliged, it was not a direct response to her request. Instead, she could feel Rio's palm on her thigh, just caressing, until she ran over the wet spot she had left and offered a giggle before resuming her work.</p><p>Agatha didn't know why, but that soft sound, that little show of amusement as it echoed out of Rio's throat turned her on so badly she thought she could very well black out. Thankfully, she didn't have to. Before it could happen, Rio's lips latched to that spot just behind her ear at the very same moment Agatha felt her fingers press down into her folds, surely finding every dripping ounce of arousal over what she had been feeling over the last hour or so.</p><p>The quietest cry of ecstasy left her lips, her head tilting back automatically. </p><p>At first, she had been torn on trying to pay attention to both Rio's lips on her neck and the feel of her touch between her legs, but the way Rio's fingers were just exploring, feeling, understanding quickly won out. The kisses and teeth were nice, but the way Rio was handling her body was too intense to be ignored.</p><p>That touch was steady, persistent as it roamed and mapped, never stilling. When it dropped, fingertips just <em>barely</em> applying pressure to her instance before they grazed upward, Agatha had been biting back a moan. That effort became futile the moment she felt Rio's touch on her clit, however brief it was. In sheer reaction, Agatha's body tensed for only a second and a rich but loud moan spilled from her lips, lingering in the air around them.</p><p>The very second that pressure increased and Rio began to run small circles around her clit, Agatha knew she was not going to last long. She knew that she could fight, that she could try to hold on and revel in the feeling for as long as humanly possible, but she knew that the likelihood that it would actually work was very slim. Still, she attempted a grasp, one on Rio's arm, as if it might prolong the inevitable.</p><p>Never before had Agatha expressed and emotion as truly meaningful as love before she'd let a woman have sex with her, and in those moments that were wrought with nothing but pleasure and bliss, she would have not wanted that to change for the world.</p><p>It was Rio. It could only have ever been Rio.</p><p>The more that tide swelled in her belly, the more desperate Agatha felt to make it last just a little longer. It was pointless.</p><p>The only thing that offered reprieve was the way Rio stopped kissing at her neck and instead crushed their lips together in one. Agatha's lips were parting with no reserve, Rio's tongue easily sliding inside to ravage Agatha's mouth.</p><p>Then, something happened.</p><p>There was this <em>thing</em> that Rio did. It was this light flick of her tongue as it skimmed the roof of Agatha's mouth. The exact moment it happened, Agatha could feel every single nerve in her body as they all lit up at one time. The moan that wailed out of her and directly into Rio's mouth was loud and intense, absolutely uncontainable in another other way than for it to be swallowed by her lover.</p><p>Any thought in Agatha's head was gone. Instead, it was the blinding white of nothing but sheer pleasure as it overtook her entirely. She was not aware of the way her knees slammed together, trapping Rio's hand, nor was she in control of the way her body was close to seizing completely. Even the way her nails were embedding themselves into Rio's arm was far beyond her cognition. </p><p>There was nothing other than bliss, pure orgasmic bliss.</p><p> In the duration of a blink, something that left Agatha entirely surprised, the room around them snapped back into focus and she realized that she was holding her breath. With a gasp, she seemed to recover, the tension easing out of her legs as her grasp on Rio's arm loosened. Her chest was still heaving and she felt like she couldn't get enough oxygen, but the way she could still feel the remnants of that pleasurable pulsing was trying to drag her mind away, trying to keep her held in it a little longer.</p><p>As if it were the most natural thing in the world, Rio was moving so that she could lay back and pulled Agatha right along with her, tucking her to her chest in the sweaty spent heap she was. Agatha let her. She let herself be held as that trembling in her limbs began to quiet.</p><p><em>"I've got you," </em>she heard Rio whisper above her, having pressed her lips to the top of Agatha's head.</p><p>She knew saying it once had been a lot, but Agatha couldn't keep herself from saying it again. Maybe she wanted Rio to hear her say it, but there was another part of Agatha that wanted to hear herself say it for the second time in her life to someone who was not her son.</p><p>
<em>"I... Fuck, Rio. I love you so much."</em>
</p><p>Agatha swore she could feel every hair that got rustled when Rio released that painfully sweet chuckle into them.</p><p>
<em>"I love you just as much. You can believe in that."</em>
</p><p>Hearing it again, as it so happened, was even sweeter than hearing it the first time. Somewhere in her chest, Agatha found the hope that perhaps that feeling would multiply every single time she heard those words as they sailed from Rio's lips. </p><p>A light laugh of her own fell onto Rio's warm skin and her eyes fluttered shut.</p><p>
<em>"Yeah? And what is it that you believe in?"</em>
</p><p>When Rio reached for her chin, Agatha did not resist and instead offered her compliance by way of making eye contact with her.</p><p>Rio's response did something Agatha was realizing she was going to have to get used to.</p><p>It struck her right in the heart.</p><p>
<em>"I believe in you, Agatha."</em>
</p><p>They had only moved to slide beneath the down comforter on the bed, otherwise remaining tangled as they settled for the night, the drowsiness beginning to win them over. It was Rio who slipped off first, leaving Agatha to stare at the bare skin before her from her spot on Rio's chest.</p><p>The moonlight kissed Rio's skin in all of the places Agatha knew she, too, would someday kiss. It bathed her in the gentlest light, illumining the softest parts of her that Agatha was quite certain she had shown no one else. Agatha found herself thinking that thought again: Rio was divine, outright. </p><p><em>Perhaps,</em> Agatha mused to herself as her eyes closed and the teeth of sleep began to gnaw on her consciousness, <em>I could learn to have a little faith.</em></p>

<em>"I should check out."</em>
</p><p>Agatha hadn't been waiting for Rio to choose to go home with her. Yes, she had offered it as an option, but she wasn't wondering every second of the day if the next interaction the two of them had was going to be Rio trusting her enough to leave the comforts of that hotel room.</p><p>In fact, Agatha would have been more than happy to keep occupying that space for as long as Rio wanted or needed. It was a comfort to her in a very new world for her. She had abandoned everything she'd always known to jet across the world and make this happen. The very least Agatha could do was accommodate her until she was ready to take the next steps on her own.</p><p>Hearing her say those words the next night as they lounged around the hotel room had been a shock to Agatha, like she had been jumpstarted with a higher voltage as to run a little faster, a little harder, a little longer. </p><p>This was progressing. Rio truly was trusting her with more than just her body.</p><p>Rio was trusting Agatha with her heart, too, and Agatha realized that with a shocking sense of duty. </p><p>Agatha would not let Rio down. Not if she could help it. Not ever.</p><p>She would show it like this, even if Rio never could have known what such a gesture meant. Agatha brought women home to fuck them, full stop. That was the <em>only</em> reason she brought women home. She didn't bring them home with the intention of taking them upstairs and curling up in bed to enjoy the rest of the lazy day they had been having.</p><p>But that was exactly what she was taking Rio home to do.</p><p>They had gathered their things and headed out, but when Agatha had entered the hallway and turned to look at Rio, she stopped to just watch. Rio had been standing in the doorway, looking inside the room one last time before that door closed and they walked away from it and toward something very new for her. It was surely a moment of pure introspection, but it softened Agatha to be privileged enoguh to witness it.</p><p>And then it was over, Rio turned around, took her hand, and they exited into the crisp night air and an awaiting Gio who took them to Agatha's home.</p><p>When they had walked inside, she could sense that Rio was marveling at the size even before the front door opened. Truthfully, Agatha could probably fit two-and-a-half houseboats within the walls of her own house, if not three, and, she knew that it was likely jarring. Agatha would find a way to help her feel at home yet.</p><p>Once fully inside, there was a scent that filled the air that also filled Agatha's stomach with dread. It smelled like Tom Ford. Nicky's favorite.</p><p>
<em>No. No no no no. Not tonight. Not this night. Please gods, not </em>
<em>
<b>this</b>
</em>
<em> night.</em>
</p><p>When Agatha flipped on the light as Rio set her things down, her eyes fell over Rio's shoulder and right onto the piece of evidence she had not been wanting to see. It was a sweater. A school sweater. That Nicky had been apparently been wearing for the last three years.</p><p>Agatha was not sure how this was going to go and that made her nervous. If she had known he had come home, she would have urged Rio to stay one more night in that hotel room. The truth was, Nicky had his own opinions about Agatha's dating life -- or severe lack thereof -- and all of them were anything but positive. She didn't know what his reaction was going to be with no context when he realized she had brought a woman home.</p><p>Rio was different, but she wasn't going to be able to explain that to him in a greeting.</p><p>Sneaking Rio up to the bedroom in her own home in hopes he wouldn't see them pass by his door was absolutely not something Agatha was willing to do. This was <em>her</em> house, and if there were any issue, he could leave. It was that simple. He would always have a place there, but she also would not allow him to present himself and then try to mold how <em>she </em>was living her life.</p><p>With a quiet sigh, Agatha softened. There was only one way to know how this was going to go and it was to charge straight ahead. She paced over to the bottom of the stairs, hanging lazily over the banner.</p><p>"Nicholas Scratch! If you're up there in that bedroom instead of waiting to surprise your mother whenever she decided to turn up, you've missed your shot!"</p><p>When she heard movement, followed by a soft swear, she caught Rio's breath of a laugh from her place across and pushed off the stairs, moving to stand at the base of them to receive her son.</p><p>It had been a few months since she had seen him last when he had come home for his birthday to party with the Landon boys. As happy as she was, she would have appreciated some form of a heads up that he had decided to return home. She loved him, but Agatha had suddenly found herself directly in the eye of the storm, waiting until it all went sideways and everything blew by her at a speed she could not keep up with.</p><p>Her blue eyes were bright as he scrambled to find himself at the top of the stairs, a wide grin slapped on his face. He was so quick as he came down those stairs that Agatha had thought he might trip and barrel right into her. He barreled into her anyway, but on steady feet at least. </p><p>Feeling Nicky hug her was always an emotional feeling. She knew that she had not made the first part of his life very easy and she hadn't really done much better throughout his second decade. He seemed to still love her and move past her transgressions, but it appeared as though it was because he thought things were how he wanted them to be.</p><p>The giggles that fell from her at the show of love from her son were crisp and joyous, sheer proof that even if he had been waiting to surprise her, she had not been expecting such a reception.</p><p>Several seconds into that hug, Agatha felt Nicky stiffen within her grasp and could hear as he sucked in a sharp breath. His hands were suddenly on her arms and he was moving, pulling back to look down at her, his lips tilted in discomfort.</p><p>"I didn't know you were going to have company. I should have texted," he told her and while maybe to Rio it would have sounded like a gentle apology, Agatha knew that was not what this was at all. She could hear it in his voice, and she could see it on his face.</p><p>Nicky was disappointed in her.</p><p>He was only disappointed because he didn't know who Rio was and didn't understand how much Agatha already knew she loved her.</p><p>"Nicky," Agatha offered softly, reaching up to cup his cheek in her palm. "It's okay. I'm glad you're home. And before you get annoyingly persistent about going somewhere else, I will lovingly remind you that you know where the keys to the pool house are, and also remind you that the refrigerator in there still has that twelve pack of beer from your birthday."</p><p>His lips were twisting in his uncertainty, but the tension ebbed just slightly out of the muscles in his face. "Mom, are you sure?"</p><p>As their gazes were locked with Agatha peering up at him, they were having a second conversation. It was a conversation where Nicky was telling her that he should have known better than to come home and Agatha was trying to explain to him that what was happening was not at all what it appeared to be through his eyes.</p><p>She gave him a small nod and stepped to his side, turning so she could lay her hand across the small of his back to usher him forward. "In fact, there's someone I'd like you to meet." She lifted her hand out to Rio as they approached and pulled her in the moment their palms met.</p><p>"Nicky, this is Rio. She's..." Agatha paused. What was the right word? Agatha would never be caught dead, as old as she was, using the word 'girlfriend.' She didn't much prefer anything that was coming to mind, so she settled on the one she hated the least. "She is my partner."</p><p>Some part of Agatha was actually so fucking thankful he did not burst into laughter. That would have been humiliating for more than one reason, but she was not quite ready to spill every bean to Rio about what her life had looked like before she had tumbled into Rio's world. </p><p>He still balked, though, and Agatha didn't miss it. His breath caught slightly and his eyes got a little bigger, but his recovery was quick and smooth. He lifted a hand, offering it to Rio to shake. </p><p>"And Rio, this is Nicky, my son."</p><p>When Rio let her hand go, the most neglected part of Agatha shriveled, knowing she could never make her son understand that feeling. She would never be able to explain to him that it was tearing her apart to watch this interaction and have a relatively good idea as to what he was feeling about it.</p><p>She was watching like a hawk, trying to assess everything there was to assess about the scene before her, from the way Rio looked like she was about to either cry or run for the hills to the way she could almost hear the disdain as it simmered in her son. It wasn't fair. He didn't know Rio enough to be forming that kind of opinion toward her based on a predisposition that had everything to do with Agatha and nothing at all do do with Rio. It was beginning to seem like he wasn't even going to give her a chance.</p><p>The hand at Agatha's side began to pinch at the fabric of her leggings. She pulled and tugged and rubbed, her heart so loud in her ears like infinite claps of thunder that knew not how to be tamed or muted.</p><p>If Agatha could keep it from happening, keep her son from discredting this incredible woman unfairly, she was going to. He just needed a little bit of time with Rio to truly get it, to understand why Agatha had just made such a grand confession. Since divorcing his father, Agatha had not been in an actual relationship. It was not hard for her to understand his skepticism, so she wanted to cut it off before it could grow.</p><p>"Would you like to have dinner with us? I can throw something together, if you'd like," she offered him, her tone light and inviting, trying to pacify him in some way. She was really just trying to convince him to stop jumping to conclusions and spend a little time with them, but deep down, Agatha had already known it was futile but wanted to try anyway.</p><p>When he answered her, even though she was well aware it was coming, Agatha could feel as her stomach melted, seeping through the bones of her legs until it all pooled at her feet, leaving her feeling hollow in an excruciating way.</p><p>"It was a long flight. I think I'll grab those keys and tuck in for the night. Maybe we can do something tomorrow?" </p><p>Rio would not know anything was wrong, mostly because Nicky was choosing a sweet tone of voice and keeping a relatively placid expression on his face. Agatha's hope leaked out of her and her posture slumped almost imperceptibly, though the words that followed still fell out in kindness.</p><p>"Of course, baby boy. As always, help yourself to anything in here. The back door will be unlocked if you need anything."</p><p>Nicky stepped a little closer to her and pulled her in for a hug. For just a moment, Agatha did not want to let him go.</p><p>"I'll see you in the morning, mom," he told her softly before loosening his hold to step away. She felt him squeeze her arm and then watched as he walked away, not once looking back. There was a sadness that filled her that he could not seem to acknowledge Rio before he departed, but fixating on it was going to sink her.</p><p>So, she turned toward the light. And by light, she meant Rio.</p><p>Rio looked so fucking guarded, standing there holding herself like it might be some kind of shield from the awkwardness of the moment and Nicky's air of indifference. </p><p>Cautiously, Agatha approached her and placed her hands on each of Rio's sides, a silent request for her to lower her defenses enough to let Agatha back in. When she did, Agatha's right hand moved and wrapped around Rio's waist, pulling her in close. The way Rio's palms landed flatly on her chest offered some form of mental relief.</p><p>"I... I had no idea he was going to be here," Agatha admitted truthfully. Even though she meant it, she couldn't help the guilty feeling that had wrapped snugly around the stem of her brain. "If I would have, you know I would have said something..."</p><p>Despite her uneasiness, there was something... soothing about the softness of Rio's gaze as they looked directly at one another. That was only amplified by the words she spoke.</p><p>"Agatha, shh, it's okay. I believe you." Rio shouldn't have been comforting her. She shouldn't have been trying to make Agatha feel better about something that had absolutely nothing to do with her and everything to do with every single bad choice Agatha had ever made. </p><p>Agatha needed to fortify. She had just brought Rio home for the first time and it was already crumbling too quickly for her to hold it together. There had to be a way to salvage it, to make it better. She was scrambling inside of her own head to try and find a path to recovery, but her silence was instilling uncertainty in the woman she was holding onto.</p><p>"I can... go back to the hotel, if you think it would be better?" Rio spoke.</p><p>That suggestion felt like Agatha had been punched full force in the stomach. It wasn't what she wanted at all. She still wanted to go up those stairs, show Rio her bedroom and then crawl into bed and hold her until they fell asleep. It did not matter that Agatha had since gained fifty pounds of emotional weight, all she wanted was to be close to Rio.</p><p>Rio going back to the hotel wasn't going to happen, not if Agatha had anything to say about it. She wanted Rio there. Nicky was a traveler, an infrequent presence that should not have a say in how she was choosing to live her life. This wasn't his realm to rule, it was hers, and that thought spiked a bit of defiance deep within her.</p><p>She shook her head, dismissing Rio's suggestion adamantly.</p><p>"Of course not. This is, after all, my house, and whether or not my son decides to show up on a whim does not dictate the company I get to keep in said home."</p><p>Her chin tipped up in her indignation, gaze casting stubbornly across the room as she tried to find the will to act like she meant it. </p><p>Nicky's opinion <em>did</em> matter to her, but she was not going to let him call the shots in the walls of a place she had curated to house mostly herself, with his surprise arrival every so often. Still, his behavior, while mild, had left her unsettled and if she had to bristle toward her own son to protect the peace that Rio had brought into her life, she absolutely would.</p><p><em>"Agatha..."</em> she heard as it fell softly from Rio's lips. It was a request for attention, an ask that Agatha look at her. When she obliged, Rio gifted her a kiss of both affection but also understanding. <em>"You don't have to do that when it's just us."</em></p><p>Ouch. That had been a direct shot and it had hit her in the chest, where she was sure Rio meant it to land.</p><p>"I'm sorry... I just..." There wasn't really any good excuse as to why she was bristling. The <em>reason</em> was clearly her son's appearance, but there could be no explanation that could excuse it. She had already made it obvious to Rio that she trusted her, so why was her immediate reaction to hunker down and shield herself? That wasn't fair to Rio.</p><p>Agatha debated only a moment, lips pressed and head tilted before she offered a suggestion. <em>"Why don't I throw something together for us to eat, and then we can go get comfortable?"</em></p><p>When Rio offered her soundless agreement, Agatha found herself relieved. She knew that she owed Rio answers, that she'd more than earned them with her patients, but she needed time to figure out how that conversation could possibly go. When Rio delivered the softest, sweetest kiss in reassurance and then departed to place herself at the island in the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha followed suit but headed for the refrigerator, pulling a few things out to make them a snack of bruschetta. Everything she did, from chopping to mixing to slicing, she did in silence. She could feel a spot on her back, probably right at the base of her neck, were Rio's gaze was searing into her. She knew Rio was probably confused, that she had questions. </p><p>What worried Agatha the most was that she could spend hours on end wondering what those questions might be, and even if she thought she found an answer? Rio was more than likely going to deliver one that Agatha would have never had the capability of pinpointing. That was just who Rio was proving herself to be. The obvious answer to anyone else was the least likely answer for Rio.</p><p>Rio could have tried to call her before getting on a plane. She could have even written a letter and mailed it to the office.</p><p>Those things never would have been who Rio was as a person.</p><p>And those things were exactly why Agatha loved her.</p><p>She was in the process of dropping two oil-brushed pieces of the baguette she had sliced into a skillet to toast them when she heard Rio's timid question.</p><p>"Agatha... are you okay?" </p><p>This had been the longest amount of time between them where they were sharing space and were not sharing in light conversation, at the very least. While Agatha wanted to bridge that gap, she was not quite ready yet.</p><p>He head lifted and she cast her gaze over her shoulder for just a moment, just long enough to grace along the sight of Rio before she turned her attention back to the stovetop in front of her.</p><p>"I'm fine," she offered in dismissal, trying to somehow relay that she just wasn't ready yet.</p><p>Rio did not offer any other inquiries and she did not offer any comfort, she simply sat there behind Agatha and let her continue to cook for them. </p><p>As Agatha moved back and forth between the stove and the counter, she was still trying to parse out what the right way to go about this could possibly be. She knew that realistically, they'd been together less than a week. Because of that, spilling the entire truth was completely out the window. Did she <em>feel</em> like she could, and not be judged by Rio? Yes, but Agatha had spent her entire life not letting how she <em>felt</em> have any bearing on large and consequential decisions.</p><p>There were things about Agatha's life that only one soul knew, things that she couldn't tell anyone and yet some completely insane part of her felt like she <em>could </em>tell Rio. But she wouldn't. She couldn't, even if those pesky feelings were trying to override her logic. Those were things about Agatha that Rio would never know, not unless Agatha never wanted to see her again.</p><p>So, she had decided, she would tell Rio what she <em>needed</em> to know as it pertained to Nicky's presence around the house.</p><p>Agatha pulled the golden and toasted slices of bread off of the skillet and plated them before spooning the tomato and basil mixture over them. Once she was finished, a pinch of sea salt was added a long with just a few slivers of basil for garnish. Picking up both plates, Agatha turned to face Rio who still looked so understanding, if not a little confused.</p><p>"Would you like to go upstairs? I'd just really like to climb into bed with you, eat this, and snuggle up." Agatha's words were quiet, but she meant them. All she wanted was to put a little food on their stomachs, get under that giant and fluffy duvet on her bed and pull Rio into her arms to forget that any of this had happened for the time being. </p><p>She was fully aware of the fact that none of that was going to happen without some kind of a conversation. Rio deserved that much, at the very least. If the three of them were going to be sharing space -- even if Nicky thought Rio would probably be gone by morning -- Rio deserved to know that any negative emotion or comment from him would have absolutely nothing to do with her.</p><p>When Rio agreed and departed to grab their things because Agatha's hands were already full, Agatha met her at the bottom of the stairs to lead her up. She crossed the bedroom to set the plates down on her nightstand, the bottle of wine landing next to them. </p><p>"So this is it, hm?" came Rio's musings from behind her. </p><p>She turned around, the need for clarification written in her expression.</p><p>"This is the temple of Agatha Harkness," Rio offered in response, so calm and collected as if it should have been more than obvious to Agatha. </p><p>There was something about the rich and soothing voice Rio had chosen that heated that ice cold tension in Agatha's form enough to melt it. Her shoulders dropped, her chin tucked and that guarded expression on her face ebbed away. She paced across the space that separated them, looking Rio directly in the eyes as she reached to cradle her jaw.</p><p><em>"How do you do that?"</em> Agatha asked her, blue eyes searching wildly for some kind of an answer.</p><p>Rio was quiet for the longest moment, those green eyes shimmering with her contemplation as she tried to figure out what was going to soothe that panicked look in Agatha's gaze.</p><p>
<em>"Because I see you. Sometimes, I even think I hear you in my head. But you... you are a book I've read a million times, and yet, somehow, new chapters keep appearing."</em>
</p><p>That wasn't an answer in that it just left Agatha asking the same question all over again. Even in her response, Rio found a way to reach straight into Agatha's chest, desregaring any ribs or muscles that might get in her way. That understanding was a hand gracing over the heart that sat there.</p><p>Something in Agatha was moved beyond measure and it made her eyes glass over beyond her own cognition. Instead of trying to find a response in words, Agatha simply dropped her head enough that their foreheads met. She didn't know what to say that could somehow make Rio understand what she was feeling and how she felt about her. </p><p>Rio did not initially prod and instead tilted her head enough to provide Agatha with a light kiss. It was after that when she posed her quiet question.</p><p>
<em>"Do you want to talk about it?"</em>
</p><p>It was quite a loaded question, at that. </p><p>Agatha wasn't sure how to answer it, so she deflected instead. </p><p>"Let's sit," she suggested, her tone low but inviting. Maybe it wasn't a direct answer to Rio's question, but she was doing her best to build her nerve to get there. </p><p>Rio obliged her without protest, thankfully, and they both found themselves sitting side by side in the middle of that California king that truly was too big for only Agatha herself. In an instant, Rio offered her hand, and for the first time in a meaningful fact, Agatha was the one to take it and accept the help.</p><p>The moment their fingers threaded together, she could feel as Rio leaned into her. Agatha considered, even for a moment, that Rio might drop her head to rest on Agatha's shoulder, but she didn't. She was just asserting her physical presence in the form of her form offering a comforting pressure to Agatha's.</p><p>With a slow breath and the confidence she garnered when she felt Rio's fingers squeeze her own, Agatha finally felt like she had a good enough idea of what to say.</p><p>"I... When Colton and I divorced, ten years ago..." she began, not looking over at the woman next to her for fear of what she might see. "I made a lot of really questionable choices. And I did that for years, bad choice after bad choice. By day, I was living my dream, making the films I wanted to share with the world. By night?" Agatha's voice had dropped the longer she went on, the embarrassment slowly starting to crawl up the length of her spine.</p><p>Agatha took a beat to refocus, to try and press forward while knowing that even with this being a rather tame sliver of the truth, there was still shame to be had over it.</p><p>"There was just... this endless frustration that I had wasted so long of my life on someone who had never really cared about me, not actually. And so, instead of turning to copious amounts of booze, or drugs like my counterparts in the business, I let the door of my home become a revolving one of countless strangers that could... make me feel like I mattered for an hour at a time."</p><p>When she tried to dig in to find a way to keep going, Agatha felt Rio's grip tighten on her hand, a soft encouragement that it was okay.</p><p>"I was selfish, in that time. I didn't take Nicky into consideration, and I... I know that even though he has probably tried to cope with it with countless hours of therapy, it was hard for him, and he probably still holds it against me." Agatha knew it was the case. She knew by the way he had reacted earlier that evening that he absolutely still held it against her. </p><p>In Nicky's mind, because he wasn't around to bear witness to Agatha's endless self-destructive behavior, it stopped happening.</p><p>That was not how life worked, especially not Agatha's life.</p><p>"He's been gone for three years. I had really fought myself on letting him leave before he was eighteen, but he couldn't seem to get away fast enough. In that three years... I've become a different person. And even more than that, I am certain that the me he just met? That woman is probably a stranger, in his eyes."</p><p>It was the best way she felt that she could put it, the easiest way to make Rio understand that did not include her spilling twenty years worth of trauma onto a very fresh relationship.</p><p>There was a halted quality to the air around them as Rio digested all that Agatha had just divulged to her. It wasn't quite stagnant, but nothing around them moved and the only sounds were of their breathing.</p><p>Agatha's focus landed on their hands, the way Rio was brushing over her skin with a light tracing of her thumb. Then, Rio's soft voice rang out in the space between them, knowing in its tone.</p><p>"I... I guess what you have to ask yourself is... Is the you he just met the one you want him to know going forward?"</p><p>There it was again, that nagging desire to know how Rio kept doing that. How did she keep finding ways to see through Agatha to point out the most important things? They had known each other less than a week and in moments like that, Agatha felt like they had spent lifetimes together.</p><p>The weight of such an inquiry was heavy within her, sinking into her very being. Finally, she found a response.</p><p>"I don't know that I can be anyone else, anymore," she admitted truthfully. The reality was that even hearing herself say it, it scared Agatha. Rio had appeared in her life twice and it was all Agatha had needed to see in order to know that what she'd had for nearly fifty years was not at all what she wanted.</p><p>Agatha still had not been able to bring herself to look at Rio, but Rio's next movements vowed to bring that to an end. She reached up and Agatha could feel her touch on her left cheek, beguiling her to turn her head. Agatha didn't want to, but she did anyway. The softness she saw there felt unparallelled, like something she could never truly understand.</p><p>
<em>"Maybe... maybe you should talk to him. Just... be honest with him. He's probably just feeling a little confused, and I think that if you explain things to him, it might help bridge that gap a little bit."</em>
</p><p>Rio had that insane ability that seemed to know no quit, that ability to point out the obvious but in a way that did not make Agatha feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it herself.</p><p>The light breath of a laugh she gave was tinged with a morose sense of understanding, but her expression was gentle as she took in the sight of the woman spilling those words into her ears and how helpful she was trying to be as it sparkled in her eyes.</p><p><em>"So... do you just carry around a book called 'all of the right things to say,' or is it just natural for you?" </em>Agatha decided to ask quietly, one corner of her mouth hitching up with her humor as her head tilted just slightly in admiration.</p><p><em>"No, I just thought about the other night when Estee texted me and you encouraged me to go outside and talk to her. I realized that even though it's hard, communication with our kids can make or break how they feel about us." </em>Rio answered simply. It was, of course, far deeper than that espescially now, but Agatha understood the sentiment regardless. </p><p><em>"I didn't realize at the time that I'd be able to spin it back on you so soon though," </em>Rio added, causing Agatha to chuckle breathily again.</p><p><em>"I don't know if I like it when you use my own logic against me," </em>she muttered. Truthfully, she did. She liked that Rio, unlike literally anyone else in her life, was not afraid to call her on her shit.</p><p>Rio didn't provide any argument, she simply closed the distance between them with an attentive and caring kiss that tasted like blind hope.</p><p><em>"Go," </em>Rio urged her, taking one more kiss. <em>"Go talk to him."</em></p><p>Agatha was going to, but for a moment, she just wanted to appreciate this work of art before her. Rio seemed to have her touch to the pulse of Agatha's existence in a way Agatha would have never let anyone else close enough to do. She seemed to know the right way to act, the right things to say and it left Agatha with only one thing that she could really say in response.</p><p>
<em>"I love you, you know?"</em>
</p><p>The smile that curled up Rio's lips in a flash was calming and gave Agatha one more surge of courage. When she spoke, that courage rose even more.</p><p><em>"I know. And as you are well aware, I love you too. Now, stop stalling." </em>The giggle that accompanied those words caused Agatha's steeled reserves to slowly slip, dropping even more when Rio decided on one more kiss.</p><p>They parted and while Agatha was absolutely going to do what she had been told to, she needed one last glance at the reason this would all be worth it. No matter what Nicky's reaction was going to be to their conversation, it would all be okay because she would climb back up those stairs and slide right back into bed against Rio.</p><p>After she found what she had hoped she would need, Agatha pulled herself from the bed and let go of Rio's hand to make her way toward the door. Once there, she stalled and glanced back. Seeing the look of utter hope and faith on Rio's expression quelled that viciously nervous energy within her.</p><p>In that bed sat all she might ever need.</p><p>Ahead of her lay something that might make her realize that even more.</p><p>One last deep inhale filled Agatha's lungs and she departed, knowing there was nowhere else to go that was not to talk to her son in the pool house. She grabbed a bottle of water in the kitchen before she slipped out the back door and crossed the patio.</p><p>As her hand raised to knock, something in Agatha gave her pause. She needed to do it, to just knock and walk in and have a calm conversation with her son about the fact that he was passing judgement way too fast on something he did not understand.</p><p>Softly, she knocked.</p><p>When he opened the door, Agatha could not quite read the look on his face. He did look tired, yes, but there was something else there, something that appeared a lot like exasperation. In an attempt to soothe him, Agatha offered a gentle curve of her lips to show she wasn't there to accost him or berate him.</p><p>"Can we talk?" she questioned, though her tone was hopeful.</p><p>Nicky did not answer her, but he did step back to allow her in. He wordlessly shut the door behind her before brushing past on his way back to the main living space. It was clear he had been watching a hockey game and drinking a beer, and while she didn't want to disturb his peace, this was a conversation that absolutely needed to be had.</p><p>He plopped himself back down on the couch and scooped up his beer, nearly chugging the entire thing. That was not the best sign, but it reminded Agatha that she had to be cautious about this. </p><p>After a few quiet strides, she placed herself on the couch next to him, relaxing into the cushions as she looked over at him. She was studying those strong features, trying to read him when he was being so positively stoic that she couldn't see through it.</p><p>"Can I ask you to explain why you're upset?" she ventured, but realized her mistake immediately.</p><p>"I'm not upset," he snapped back, quick to follow up, "I'm disappointed."</p><p>Oh. That was how he wanted to start this off?</p><p>Agatha knew that Nicky had his feelings toward her, but they had been taking strides in healing that. Agatha chose to spend her time alone when he was in town and because of that, he had derived the misconception that her life had done a one-eighty and that she deserved to be alone <em>and</em> celibate to keep him happy.</p><p>Agatha honestly was already fumbling. How did she, as a parent, handle a statement like that coming from her son, who was a mere twenty years old? She sat up, leaning forward with her elbows on her knees as her fingers locked together in front of her. </p><p>"I'm trying very hard right now to understand your point of view, but you are making it hard by being disrespectful," Agatha informed him evenly, doing her best to keep her tone neutral. "Instead of coming to all of these foregone conclusions, you could have texted me and asked me to come down here sooner and asked me those questions yourself."</p><p>Nicky scoffed, bringing the rest of his beer up to drain it. There was an unopened one on the coffee table that he grabbed as soon as the settling of the empty can on the glass rang aloud. He cracked it and leaned back again, but he spoke before he resumed his drinking.</p><p>"There aren't any questions to ask," he announced assuredly. "It's all pretty obvious."</p><p>"Nicholas," Agatha attempted, doing what she could to keep the scolding out of her tone. "You may think that, but it is far from the truth."</p><p>This time, Nicky laughed and Agatha's stomach churned heavily with no reserves, angry like the tide in the midst of a cyclone. </p><p>"You're not sitting there trying to tell me that after all this time you've decided to try dating out for fun?" he snarked, taking a drink from the beer can before he lowered it to his lap.</p><p>"No, I'm not 'dating,' in the way that you're inferring. I met Rio... Several weeks ago in New Zealand on a scouting trip," she tried to explain. She knew that there was too much nuance here to make him understand, but she was going to at least put forth some kind of effort into painting the clearest picture she could for him, even if minor details got left out. </p><p>"Christ," he huffed, rolling his eyes behind her. "You just never stop."</p><p><em>"Nicholas,"</em> Agatha hissed, her head snapping to the side so she could pin him with her glare. "I don't know if it's because you're drunk or because you've developed some strange sense of entitlement where you think you get to control how I live my life, but knock it off."</p><p>His face dropped slightly and those green eyes met hers as if to encourage her to continue speaking. </p><p>"I spent an evening with her after a slight accident, and then I went on about my life. She... She came to see me last week. And she's going to be staying for a little while longer. And so... I just need you to know that while I am happy you are here and I am, as always glad to see you, while you're staying here, you're going to be respectful. If not towards me, then you absolutely will be toward Rio."</p><p>Something in Nicky's eyes flashed dangerously and Agatha felt suddenly sick.</p><p>"You're joking right?" he countered, sitting up so that he could look directly over at her without her having to look backwards. "Let me ask you a serious question. How long have you <em>actually</em> known her?"</p><p>Agatha didn't like this. She didn't like that he was already stamping massive holes in the logic of her relationship with Rio. It wasn't logical. The two of them were both well aware, but Agatha held a very deep conviction that just because it didn't make sense, that did not mean it deserved to be immediately invalidated. </p><p>"I should not have to dignify that with an answer," she responded sternly, but Nicky almost cut her off with his response.</p><p>"So... The night you spent with her... and then the time she's been here. A week maybe? And you're sitting here looking me in the eye and demanding I respect her like she isn't a prolonged version of one of the hundreds of whores you've ever fucked?"</p><p>Agatha tried not to be a violent person, but right then she wanted to punch her son in the face. Instead, she got to her feet and took several steps away from the couch to prevent that from happening.</p><p>"I don't know who the fuck you think you are to show up here and assume you can just talk to me whatever way you feel like because your feelings are hurt," Agatha clipped, her brow knit in her anger. "But you are <em>not</em> going to stay under my roof and speak about her or to her that way, do you understand me? So if you're so goddamn angry about it, you know where the door is." </p><p>She had started and it seemed that now, she couldn't stop.</p><p>"I don't know where this self-righteousness you're holding like a weapon came from but I'm absolutely not going to allow you to sit in a pool house on <em>my </em>property, drinking beer <em>I </em>paid for, watching hockey on a television <em>I </em>bought while you cannot respect someone I could see myself spending the rest of my life with, got it?"</p><p>Agatha had not even realized what she'd said, not until her son met her with another dangerously wild look in his eyes.</p><p>"Fuck off, you cannot be serious," he fired back, his voice raised. "Like... Are you okay? Genuinely, what the fuck?"</p><p>Agatha's head shook and her hands were both up, palms out. </p><p>"No. No, fuck this," she muttered, spinning on her heel to make her exit. </p><p>"No! We aren't done! You wanted to talk, let's talk!" he called after her, leaping to his feet to follow.</p><p>Agatha flung the door open and stormed outside, her rage nearly boiling over to a point that made her want to throw something. </p><p>"You don't get to do that, Nicholas. You don't just get to fuck off to Dubai for three years with the <em>ever so</em> occasional visit or phone call, and then turn up here and think that you get to make snap judgements and lecture me on how I am living my life." Agatha did not care that she was shouting, did not care that Rio could probably hear her in the bedroom. All she cared about was ending this conversation and hoping he would leave.</p><p>"Well, you raised me to call a spade a spade, and you are being LITERALLY insane!"</p><p>At those words, that rage in her became something more, something more intense as she whipped on her son, a lone finger raising to point at him menacingly. </p><p>"I get it, I do. I thoroughly wrecked a good chunk of your childhood. But gods be damned, Nicholas," she told him, clearly tiring of running circles around the same facts every time Nicky threw a tantrum when he couldn't have his way. "if I haven't fought to make myself better. I know I wasn't always the best mother, but I loved you, and I have <em>always</em> respected the fact that you're able to make your own decisions. Why is it that hard for you to give it back?"</p><p>Agatha could see his anger, could see his pain and his inability to sort out how to deal with it, but when he spoke, she felt like he had smacked her so hard that she could see stars.</p><p>"Maybe if you'd ever been anyone worth being respected in any given memory, it wouldn't be such a struggle."</p><p>Agatha was no saint. She knew that much. But to hear that kind of remark from her son, it really fucking hurt. She wasn't perfect. She'd made her mistakes. But she had still <em>tried</em>.</p><p>When she found a response, the volume of her voice had decreased measurably. "I... I don't know what you want from me, Nick. You told me you wanted me to be happy, and now that I'm happy, you take issue with how I got there."</p><p>Nicky still had that stupidly struck look on his face. It was almost as though he were really questioning the state of her sanity. </p><p>"You're literally talking about spending the rest of your life with someone who is a complete fucking stranger. Mom, come on. You're smarter than that," he bit back, his voice still loud despite Agatha's choice to try an deescalate what was happening.</p><p>Once again, Agatha raised her hands, but this time it was in complete surrender. She didn't want to fight with him like this anymore.</p><p>"I do <em>not</em> owe you an explanation about what goes on in my personal life, but fuck me for thinking it was a decent thing to do to try to just have a conversation with you about it. It <em>means</em> something to me, and I had hoped that might make it mean something to you, too." There was painful sincerity in her words, a true edge to them that tried to communicate how serious she was, but it didn't matter.</p><p>He chose disrespect once more, rolling his eyes through his scoff as he waved a dismissive hand at her that instantaneously made her want to vomit. He took a step toward her but then stopped, that deep scowl still on his face. </p><p>"Do what you want. But keep me out of it. Don't <em>ever</em> expect me to look at her, or anyone else you bring around like they'd ever be any kind of parent to me. You hardly are yourself," he spat. Without another word spoken, he turned around and stomped his way back into the pool house, acting every bit of the petulant child Agatha knew him capable of being.</p><p>Well, that went about as well as she had expected. In a way, she felt foolish for having any modicum of hope that he might be reasonable instead of so fucking hostile. That was definitely her mistake.</p><p>Still, the things he'd said? The words he'd chosen to use with her? The idea that he could hold the association of Rio in his head with the word 'whore?' It caused Agatha far more grief than she would ever willingly admit to. Rio didn't deserve that. She didn't deserve for a stranger to hold that opinion of her because of <em>Agatha's </em>bad choices.</p><p>Agatha's head lifted and turned toward the house, ready to build a plan of attack on how she could salvage their evening, but she found herself staring through the kitchen window, at Rio who was standing at the sink.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Agatha was scrambling inside that head of hers again, trying to figure out how the fucking <em>that</em> was going to be salvaged. Judging by the look on Rio's face, she'd heard far more than she needed to. </p><p>It surprised Agatha, then, when Rio began to move and the first place she went was the back door to hold it open. As Agatha watched her, she knew she should not have been surprised by the way Rio tipped her head toward the interior of the house and offered her soft instruction.</p><p>
<em>"Come on."</em>
</p><p>Before Agatha even discovered the ability to heed Rio's request, she knew that what she was moving toward in those moments -- Rio, bed, comfort, rest -- was far more than what she was leaving behind in that pool house. Nicky could stew and pout and be angry all he wanted. With any luck, he'd be gone by morning.</p><p>Right then, Agatha didn't care.</p><p>All Agatha needed was Rio.</p><p> </p>

</p><p>Watching things mend before her eyes, Agatha hadn't been entirely sold, but Nicky had proved himself in the days that had followed their blowout. Coming down to him cooking them a meal had been the first stake planted in rebuilding that bridge between them and he had continued to add planks during his stay.</p><p>The three of them spent time together, watching television or going to amusement parks. They ate meals together and sat outside at night just enjoying conversations accompanied by the steady thrum of insects in the background. It was glasses of wine and laughter that seemed to provide a steadiness to that bridge he was constructing. He was mending things the best he could; Agatha could see it and she could appreciate it.</p><p>Something Agatha found true elation as those last couple of days passed and she watched Rio find little ways to make her mark, to bond with someone who had not shown her much kindness upon meeting her. He had been so cruel and she had heard things he surely had not meant for her to hear, but she had put that aside to instead pay respect to the fact that he was still Agatha's son and having a contentious relationship with him would only make things harder on everyone involved. </p><p>Even more than her ability to keep the waters calm, Agatha got to watch first hand as Rio flourished in the act of establishing any kind of relationship. It left Agatha wondering what her life had been like before she'd watched as some flustered American woman was flung off a bridge and into her life. How did she relate to people? How many friends did she have? Surely people loved her.</p><p>It would have been entirely stunning to her to find out that really, Rio was a solitary human for the most part. Then again, with the things she had been put through in her life, would it have been all that surprising?</p><p>Agatha listened -- even if she didn't understand -- as the two of them would dive deep into a rabbit hole of codes and algorithms, throwing around words like Linux and HTML. She didn't need to know what they were talking about to see very plainly that they were connecting. They were finding something they both invested their lives into and they were using that to forge a path.</p><p>This could work, Agatha thought. Somehow, this might work.</p><p>When they had taken him to the airport, it had been a bit harder to say goodbye. Things had finally swung toward a positive direction and he was off once more for some undetermined amout of time before she would see him again. It was its own heartache in the sense that for once, she just wanted things to <em>stay</em> good. Agatha had never pushed Nicky out intentionally, but this was the first time she wanted to keep him close.</p><p>Maybe because it was the first time he wasn't so fucking angry with her.</p><p>There had never been tears upon his departure before, but as she had climbed into the car for that silent ride home, she hadn't bothered to wipe away the couple that has slipped away. </p><p>The following week had been as equally frustrating as it had been fulfilling as both herself and Rio invested hefty amounts of their time into work. Agatha was reviewing quarterlies and taking meetings and trying to check on permit processes. When they were at home, they were usually hip-to-hip unless Agatha was on camera, just working away.</p><p>Occasionally, Agatha would mutter something unintelligible and instead of asking for the fiftieth time what was wrong, Rio would simply lean over and kiss her on the cheek before returning to what was before her.</p><p>There were a couple of instances when Agatha would glance over, just to gauge what Rio was working on. Agatha did not understand a bit of it, but it interested her all the same. It was complex, had so many parts and pieces that all had to work together to ensure full operation. It was admirable, really, to have the knowledge to not only understand it, but to utilize it to make the world a better place.</p><p>In her office, things were an entirely different story.</p><p>Agatha had a perfect view of the other woman where she would sit on the couch with her full focus directed at what she was working on. Rio would get these small shifts in her features, her annoyance or frustration leaking into her expression when something wasn't working right. That kind of drive was so... <em>sexy.</em></p><p>Busy and occupied days rolled into the most wonderful nights, walking down to the beach or going out to grab a bite to eat. Some nights there was alcohol and others, the only thing Agatha ached to get drunk on was the taste of Rio's skin.</p><p>With three days left in her stay, Agatha had made up her mind.</p><p>They had spent a lot of their time in lower profile places and no one had really bothered them when they had gone to Knotts, but Agatha thought that Rio deserved more before she was gone and Agatha could not be there to provide it. </p><p>She had woken up early that morning and readied herself for her day before jotting down a quick note to Rio. She instructed her to purchase something nice for herself and that they would meet at six and laid the note atop her matte black credit card and wound her way to the other side of the bed. There was a barely-there contact of her lips to Rio's cheek and she was off, ready to tackle her agenda and wind up across a table from the woman who was currently clutching her affections while they shared an extravagant meal.</p><p>Her schedule had been rather full and she and Dave had needed to have their own personal meeting about certain aspects of the current project. She had not been expecting that it would last almost two hours. When she caught the time and looked a bit alarmed, his eyes narrowed in his inspection.</p><p>"Are you late for something?" he asked, quirking a brow in interest.</p><p>He didn't have to do that. She knew he'd seen the pictures. If some absolute fuck-knuckle rapist on a different side of the world had seen them enough to reach out to Rio's daughter, she knew Dave had seen them.</p><p>But she wasn't going to tell him right then. It was too soon. She wasn't even sure what this was and so, calling it out to the one person in the world who likely knew her best simply wasn't an option.</p><p>"I'm meeting Wanda for dinner," she lied with ease, leaning forward to gather the papers they had been going over into a neat pile. "And I'm running a little late because I did not expect for this to have to extend out so far. But... So goes life when you have idiots like Hipelius dickead making things more difficult at every turn."</p><p>Dave cleared his throat, attempting to indicate that she was being a bit unprofessional, but she rolled her eyes at him, waving him off. Dave knew things about Agatha that would likely go to his grave with him and that was a loyalty she never had any desire to sever. Dave was a good man, if not annoying in the most orderly way.</p><p>He was her structure, the one thing that could keep her in line when it would have been all too easy to step out of it, and she would always appreciate him for that.</p><p>"Fuck professionalism in this office, David, we both know this. As long as I don't call him a dickhead <em>to his face,</em> I will be just fine."</p><p>"Or an idiot," Dave added, getting to his feet as Agatha stood as well. </p><p>"I can't make any promises there," she offered back with a devious grin. Striding to her desk, she slipped the folder inside a drawer and slid it shut before turning to the large cabinet that had several garment bags inside.</p><p>"I'm heading out," he announced, looking at her, even if all she was letting him see was her back. That was more likely a good thing than not because when he spoke next, she could not have kept the blush off her cheeks if she tried. "Goodnight, Agatha. Have fun with <em>Wanda.</em>"</p><p>The way he had said it, she knew that <em>he</em> knew she was lying. That also indicated to her that he was not going to push the issue and instead allow her to be the grown woman she was and make her own choices.</p><p>Agatha thumbed through the tags on each bag, trying to decide what it was she wanted and at last, she found it. She had slipped into the attached bathroom to change, emerging a few moments later in a sleek violet dress that was form-fitting but still flattered her figure. She selected a pair of shoes to accompany and decided that the jewelry she had put on for the day was suitable enough.</p><p>On her way out of the office, she snatched up one of the red roses that had been delivered that morning and was sitting on a side table near the elevators. </p><p>As promised, she was at Capo and awaiting Rio's arrival, hardly able to keep the smile from her face even though she realized that she had to look insane. She was standing there, alone, holding a single rose grinning like an idiot. Passersby probably derived their own assumptions, but she didn't really care. </p><p>There was an anticipation that had filled her; she wanted to know what Rio would pick to wear. Agatha wanted to know what she would look like made-up and dressed to the nines.</p><p>She got her answer about a minute and a half after she, herself, had arrived.</p><p>Agatha saw Gio through the windshield upon his approach, and he was wearing a grin that she felt was a direct line of communication with her. When he stopped and the door opened? </p><p>Rio stepped out and Agatha felt like she had been hit several places at once. It was like a slap to the face to see how fucking stunning she looked in the black, short hemmed dress she had chosen. It felt like a punch to the stomach to understand that it was all for <em>her</em>, because Rio wanted to stun <em>Agatha. </em>And it was fucking working. Then, it felt like she had been kicked between the legs and the intense throbbing was not going to ease any time soon.</p><p>Rio was stunning. No, Rio was... pure beauty at its very essence.</p><p>Agatha wanted to see her, truly see her. When she shut the door, Agatha began her survey, starting from the bottom.</p><p>Rio was wearing a pair of her shoes. Adorable and also, they looked <em>damn good</em> on her. The dress itself was a masterpiece, that deep V bridged with mesh was delectable in the most sinful ways, but was still tasteful to be attending dinner in LA on a crisp and beautiful evening.</p><p>There was something Agatha noticed next that took her breath away.</p><p>Rio was wearing her earrings. </p><p>Not just any earrings.</p><p>Rio was wearing <em>the</em> earrings. </p><p>The very ones that had been separated when Agatha had left one behind as some sort of hopeful calling card. </p><p>"Are those... <em>the</em> earrings?" she asked aloud, needing to vocalize the thought so that she could have a definitive answer that would assure her that her eyes were indeed working.</p><p>The moment Rio nodded her head, Agatha pressed forward and wrapped an arm around Rio's waist, pulling her in for a warm and tender kiss, one that shouted how visible she was to Agatha and how much she realized she loved her.</p><p><em>"I took your shoes, too," </em>Rio had breathed in a giggle, her nose wrinkling in her amusement.</p><p>Handing over the rose, Agatha took hold of her and pulled her inside, declaring her name and that she had made a reservation. It took little time for them to be seated and, per the resevation she had made, a bottle of wine had already been waiting for them.</p><p>They drank and talked and laughed and chattered, but there was something in the back of Agatha's mind that wouldn't leave her alone and she had felt the need to address it.</p><p>"I... I know that you're leaving in a few days," Agatha said, her voice actually cracking over the last word. "And I... I don't know right now when I can come see you again... But know that I want to. We'll just... Have to figure it out as we go. But... This isn't over."</p><p>Agatha wondered, even when Rio reached for her hand and gave it a squeeze, if she knew just how honest such a sentiment was.</p><p>Once their meals were finished and they were still sufficiently buzzed, they had met Gio at the curb to find their way home, nothing but closeness and soft kisses filling the back space of the car. </p><p>Agatha didn't want Rio to leave. She didn't want her to climb on a plane and say 'I'll see you when I see you.' Because it was the truth and right then, Agatha didn't like it. She didn't <em>want </em>it to be true. What she <em>wanted</em> was more time.</p><p>They had fallen into one another with ease that night, a flurry of lips and tongues and hands and sighs and moans. Being with Rio physically almost felt transcendent in a way that Agatha had an impossibly difficult time trying to source the words for. She wanted to understand it, to know why it felt like absolute heaven to be wrapped up in Rio's arms or to feel every bit of pleasure in every muscle of her body. </p><p>Agatha had slept with too many women to count and yet, being with all of them had never even come close to what it felt like to be with Rio.</p><p>Maybe she would never understand it, but that would never stop her from reveling in it as long as she possibly could.</p><p>She had fallen asleep with ease that night, comforted by Rio's soft skin and the faintly floral scent of her perfume that still somehow clung to her skin. It had been a deep sleep, one that was only minorly disturbed at a light being turned on.</p><p>A soft sigh passed through her lips as she willed herself back to sleep; Rio was probably just looking for something.</p><p>That had been a plausible hypothesis, at least until Rio let out a sharp and pained cry into the air around them, one that had Agatha on alert immediately. Her eyes shot open, though they were still filled with sleep. Where she had been focused, on Rio's side of the bed, she found nothing and so her gaze turned, finding Rio as she clutched at her phone and punched at it with her thumb a few times before she tossed it on the bed.</p><p>What in the name of <em>fuck</em> was going on?</p><p>"Rio?" Agatha called softly, but Rio wouldn't look at her. She just marched around the room, collecting her things and throwing them into her duffel bag. </p><p>She doubled back toward her side of the bed and for the first time, Agatha could see that she was crying and not likely because of a stubbed toe. There were far too many tears for something so trivial. Something was going on, something that seemed really fucking bad. </p><p>In the blink of an eye, Agatha tossed back the covers and scrambled forward to where Rio stood at the edge of the bed. Kneeling on the mattress, she reached for Rio's hands and looked up at her, ready to ask for communication, but Rio had other plans.</p><p>Those plans included her doing something she had not done once in the last eleven days.</p><p>Rio pulled her hands away. No, she <em>yanked</em> them away.</p><p>Agatha felt like she'd been hit directly in the chest with a mallet made of steel. Not only did it fucking hurt, but it sucked the breath right out of her lungs. For as much as she wanted to be wounded, to be hurt that Rio had pulled herself away so violently, something else struck Agatha in the very next second.</p><p>If Rio was crying and acting unlike herself, there had to be a reason. She wouldn't have suddenly flipped a switch like that, not with everything they had discussed and how they felt about each other. </p><p>"Rio," Agatha tried again, though this time there was a little more force behind the lone word.</p><p>It didn't matter; Rio just ignored her and kept going, kept gathering every trace of her that Agatha would never be able to hold onto, just like she did not seem to be able to hold on to Rio in those moments. Agatha could see her slipping further and further with each item that got stowed and if was... hard. It was a blow, each and every time.</p><p>She couldn't take it. Agatha couldn't take the not knowing. She was hurring across the bed in an instant once more, pushing herself to her feet. She made her way directly to Rio and did not hesitated to take hold of her firmly, pulling her in to a smothering hold. </p><p>The sound that left Rio in those moments?</p><p>It shattered Agatha. Not only was it the most pained and anguished wail that she was sure she had ever heard, but she also heard where it was coming from. She could hear the fear, the pain, the anxiety, the lack of knowing.</p><p>She was clutching at the woman in her arms, holding Rio's head to her shoulder as she brushed over her hair softly with a single thumb, just a reassuring contact to let Rio know that she was not going anywhere. Rio kept crying and Agatha's suspicions felt as though they were being confirmed the longer it wore on.</p><p>It was hitting her, knowing that it could have been her, and that fact made tears brim along her lids.</p><p><em>"This is about Estee, isn't it?" </em>she asked softly. The hand that was on Rio's back began to move, rubbing in the most soothing motions she could manage.</p><p>She didn't get an answer. Instead, all Rio was able to do was sob harder. </p><p>Agatha was remarkably aware of every place in her body that was completely breaking apart to hear such pain coming from someone she had fallen in love with so quickly. Agatha didn't love other human beings, so this secondhand ache she was feeling was something new to her, something that she knew she was going to have to deconstruct when the moment was severely less dire.</p><p>Slowly, Rio seemed to calm, finding her breath as Agatha rubbed at her back and held her close. When she pulled away, Agatha could feel the dread pool in her stomach at the look in Rio's gorgeous green eyes. They were darker, they were frantic and filled with a unyielding panic.</p><p><em>"She and Tay were in an accident. Tay's probably got a broken wrist but..."</em> Rio had managed a hefty piece of information with that much, but she hadn't been able to continue with the way she dissolved to tears again, burying her face in Agatha's neck. Agatha only held her tighter as she found her voice again. <em>"Her leg is broken badly. They've taken her into surgery. I... I booked a flight. It leaves in three hours."</em></p><p>Rio was leaving.</p><p>A whole two days before she was meant to, Rio <em>had</em> to leave. There was literally nothing that could change that fact. It wasn't just a suggestion, or something she could do later. No, she needed to be by her daughter's side. There wasn't an option where Rio did not end up with Estee, right where she should be.</p><p>However.</p><p>As Agatha looked across the minimal space between them when Rio pulled away, she <em>knew.</em></p><p>She could not let Rio leave alone.</p><p>Not only did Rio not deserve to cram into a plane with a hundred other people while she was verging on coming completely undone, but she didn't deserve to do it alone. She was fragile, she was upset, and she was going to be worried sick until the moment she got to see Estee with her own eyes. Agatha understood it, but as a mother and as a human being.</p><p>Estee was the most important thing in Rio's life. Having her safety compromised was surely wreaking havoc on Rio's internal monologue and Agatha knew that she was capable of soothing it, as well as making things easier.</p><p>
<em>"Finish packing. I'm going to make a call." </em>
</p><p>Agatha gave a gentle tug to the back of Rio's neck, placing her lips to the top of her head before she eased the pressure, looking at her directly when she continued. <em>"I love you."</em></p><p>Rio's quiet sniffle tugged at the bottom of Agatha's heart; seeing her in pain was unbearable. For as heartless as Agatha had spent her life claiming to be, she had come to understand that it had been buried and locked away. As a result, no one but Rio could have ever had the key. </p><p>She watched, just a moment, as Rio continued packing before stepping away to gather her phone. Still naked, she approached the window and brought up Jack's contact information, sending the call. </p><p>His groggy greeting came grumbled across the line. <em>"Agatha? Are you okay?" </em></p><p><em>"Hey, Jack," </em>she returned, her voice low. She wasn't trying to hide anything from Rio, but she also didn't want to having a conversation of such magnitude at such volume. <em>"I know it's early, but I need a solid." </em>She paused just long enough for him to hum his encouragement for her to keep going. <em>"Can you have the Hoatzin on the runway for me in less than two hours? I'll give you whatever you want, but I... It's really important."</em></p><p>Agatha could almost <em>hear</em> him trying to understand what she was asking of him over the line, but she also knew Jack and before he spoke, she already knew what his answer would be.</p><p>
<em>"Yeah, I'll make the call. But then I am going back to sleep. So I'll text you the number to call if you need anything. Be safe, okay?"</em>
</p><p>There was a point somewhere in what he was saying where Agatha could fill the relief seep into her. It was superficial, at first, and then sank a little deeper into her muscles in a way that caused her posture to slacked the tiniest bit. </p><p>
<em>"I seriously owe you."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Seriously. Safe travels. Update me if you can, yeah? Goodnight Agatha."</em>
</p><p>
<em>"Goodnight, Jack. Thank you again."</em>
</p><p>Agatha hung up the phone and disappeared into the closet as Rio finished getting her things from the bathroom. Once she had dressed and crammed as much as she possibly could into a bag of her own, she emerged, sporting the bag on her shoulder as she caught sight of Rio on the bed.</p><p>
<em>"Cancel your flight, love. We're taking a quicker route."</em>
</p><p>Rio's head lifted, a confused expression so clear and clean across her face. It was likely that the gravity of those words was hitting her all at once, along with every implication they carried with them. All she could do was blink, simply not understanding without explicit indication what it was Agatha was stating so easily. </p><p>
<em>"There's going to be a jet on the tarmac for us in Ontario in less than two hours, courtesy of a friend."</em>
</p><p>Agatha was locked in on her, watching Rio's every movement, almost readying herself for a fight. She already knew Rio well enough to know she would try to offer push back, to say she would be fine, but Agatha wasn't having any of it before Rio was even given the opportunity. </p><p><em>"You're not going alone." </em>It was a fact, an observance of something that simply was and that Rio could not change.</p><p>Rio didn't argue. Instead, she started crying again. Once more, with fervor, Agatha's heart shattered all over again. Seeing the pain there, the guilt, Agatha walked over and dropped to her knees before the other woman.</p><p><em>"It's going to be alright. We're going to get you back to see her,"</em> she offered calmly. She knew it wasn't enough, but she was going to show, not just tell. <em>"But I need you to realize that you don't have to do this by yourself."</em></p><p><em>"Agatha." </em>The way such a squeak left Rio squeezed Agatha tight, an uncertainty that she knew felt impossible to quell. When she kept going, Agatha knew it was a thought she had to stop before it began. <em>"I cannot expect you to just drop everything to do this."</em></p><p>There would come a point when Rio would realize just how serious Agatha was when she said that since her divorce, she had never once done something she had not wanted to do. This was not an exception to that.</p><p>
<em>"Then don't. You don't have to expect it for me to do it. You love her, and I love you, so by extension, I kind of already love her, too. You need to be there with her, and you also need support. It's possible for you to have both at once, if you just let me."</em>
</p><p>While Rio's body had stopped shaking, her eyes were still wet and red as she gave Agatha the strongest nod she seemed to be able to managed. Satisfied that she had conquered this particular battle, Agatha rose to her feet and leaned over to give Rio a soft kiss.</p><p>
<em>"Let's get going. Ontario's about an hour and fifteen from here."</em>
</p><p>Rio pushed to her feet as Agatha turned for the door, but all at once she felt a strong grip on her arm, one that pulled her back and turned her around. Before she could consider how to react, Rio was wrapped around her and clearly seeking comfort. Agatha answered with a firm embrace, keeping her close.</p><p><em>"I don't know what I ever did to deserve this, to deserve you. But... thank you." </em>Rio's voice was so soft that if she had been any further away, Agatha likely wouldn't have heard it. </p><p>She took a steadying breath and turned to place a light kiss to Rio's forehead, whispering sweet sentiments against her skin.</p><p>
<em>"You loved me before you knew me. And now, I will love you until my brain and heart lose their fight to keep you there. I promise."</em>
</p><p>It could have been too much, it could have been not enough. All Agatha knew right then was that it was true, and that was what would always be most important.</p><p> </p>
