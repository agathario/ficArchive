</div>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Rio leaned against countertop of their kitchen, sipping her coffee and trying to wake up.  She looked around her home—quiet now, in the early mornings like this.   She took a sip, letting the warmth spread through her, and stared out at the greenhouse through the patio glass. It was a rare moment of peace in her otherwise chaotic life. In the quiet morning like this—where it is just her, she couldn’t help but think how she never thought she’d be here—<em> have this.  </em>  </p><p>She couldn’t help but marvel at how much had changed, at the life she’d built. To say it had turned out differently than she imagined would be an understatement. Growing up, she’d pictured herself in love, sure, but <em> this </em> ? This life, with <em> Agatha Harkness </em>? It was beyond anything she ever thought she could have.  </p><p>Of course, like any self-respecting lesbian, Rio had always dreamed of being married to wildly hot, older woman. Someone sharp, and sophisticated.  The kind of woman who turned heads wherever she went. But Agatha? Agatha was so much more than she could have dreamed. Somehow, she managed to be both a MILF and a sugar daddy rolled into one—Rio's ultimate wet dream. </p><p>And, God help her, Rio loved every stubborn, fiery, and frustrating inch of that woman. </p><p>Not that it was all smooth sailing. Agatha could be a pain in the ass even on her best days.  And on her worst? Well...let’s just say <em> The Witch of Wall Street </em> wasn’t a nickname handed out lightly. That title alone should’ve been a giant, flashing neon sign for Rio, complete with sirens blaring, screaming: <b> <em> DANGER: DO NOT TOUCH. </em></b></p><p>But Rio? She had never in her life wanted to touch something—<em> someone </em>—as much as she wanted to touch Agatha Harkness. </p><p>She could still remember the first time she saw her. Agatha had swept into the conference room like a storm, commanding attention without even trying. Her tailored plum pants and white shirt had hugged her frame just right, and those sharp blue eyes seemed to pierce straight through Rio when they landed on her. </p><p>Flirting with Agatha had been reckless. <em>Dangerous, even</em>. Rio knew it from the start. Agatha wasn’t just her boss—she was <em>the</em> <em>boss</em>. The one everyone both feared and idolized. A woman with the kind of power that could snuff out a career with a single word.    </p><p>Rio had always been smart enough to recognize danger when it was staring her in the face. But, as it turned out, being smart didn’t mean being <em> smart.  </em>And in a move that should have torpedoed her career, she somehow came out the other side not only with her career intact and thriving but also with the woman of her dreams.  </p><p>It wasn’t easy getting here, though.  </p><p><em> God, no. </em>  </p><p>They’d been through hell and back to get to this version of happiness. The love they now shared wasn’t born from fairy tales or picture-perfect beginnings. It was messy, raw, and real. It started with the intention of just being casual—<em> fuck buddies </em>, nothing more—but somewhere along the way, they discovered they fit so well it scared the hell out of both of them. That fear almost tore them apart. </p><p>And, because no love story between them could be simple, it took a good old-fashioned death threat, a gunshot wound (the scar of which still traced a jagged line across her arm), and the indignity of her eyebrow hair never growing back quite right after.  It wasn’t pretty—they barely survived—<em> both figuratively and literally </em>— but somehow, they’d made it through.  </p><p>They were happy now. <em> Married </em> . Living a life Rio had once thought was reserved for other people—for someone <em> else’s </em> daydreams.  Every day she woke up in Agatha’s arms—there wasn’t a single part of her that didn’t feel grateful for it.  But that didn’t mean it was perfect.  </p><p><em> Not by a long shot. </em> </p><p>Agatha was still <em> Agatha </em>—stubborn, sharp-tongued, and fiercely independent to a fault. And Rio? Well, Rio had her moments too. They clashed sometimes, the way two people with strong wills inevitably do. They both liked control, both liked things done their way, and neither was particularly good at backing down. But somehow, even in the middle of it all, they made it work. </p><p>The hardest part, though? The thing Rio still had to navigate, even now? </p><p><b> Agatha’s emotional walls. </b> </p><p>When they first got together, Agatha had the emotional capacity of a teaspoon. <em> Maybe less. </em> Expressing vulnerability just wasn’t in her wheelhouse, not after a lifetime of being taught to suppress it. Agatha Harkness wasn’t supposed to <em> need </em> anyone.  </p><p>Rio liked to joke that Agatha had upgraded from a teaspoon to a tablespoon over the years, but even now, their emotional capacity wasn’t exactly balanced.  But it was growth, and that's what mattered. </p><p>Rio never held it against her. <em> Not really. </em> It wasn’t Agatha’s fault that she’d been raised by a woman like Evanora Harkness. Agatha’s childhood had left her emotionally stunted, and when Rio finally understood that, it stopped bothering her as much. Instead, it made her fiercely determined to make sure Agatha never felt unloved again. </p><p>Rio never thought she would be the kind of person to say “I love you” too often. She had never said it before, but she always had this preconceived notion that if you said it too often, it lost its meaning.  B<em> ut with Agatha?  </em> She made an exception. <em> Agatha needed to hear it. </em>She needed to hear it every day, sometimes more than once, until the words started to settle into the cracks left by her mother’s neglect. </p><p>And as much as Rio gave, she started to notice something beautiful in return: Agatha didn’t always say the words back. But her actions? They screamed <em>“I love you”</em> louder than words ever could. </p><p>And thanks to her total recall, those memories were crystal clear, like snapshots frozen in time. There were so many—an endless collection of moments when Agatha’s actions whispered <em> I love you </em>without ever needing words. </p><p>But her favorites?  </p><p>Those were etched into her heart and impossible to forget. The nine times Agatha Harkness’s love shined through her actions. And, because Rio loved hearing it too, there was the one unforgettable moment when Agatha broke through her walls and actually said the words out loud. </p>

    <p>Chapter Summary</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>This was so fun to write.  Really loved this one :)</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Rio loved New York. </p><p>Professionally, it was her playground. The city’s relentless pace and cutthroat energy demanded everything she had every single day, and Rio thrived on it. She lived for the challenge and for the satisfaction of holding her own in a place that chewed up and spit out the unprepared. </p><p>Personally, New York was freedom. It wasn’t just the diversity—it was the sheer <em> indifference </em> . You could be whoever you wanted, love whoever you wanted, and the city wouldn’t even blink. Gay, straight, bi, trans—hell, you could walk down the street in a full suit of armor and barely turn heads. The subway alone was proof enough of that. She’d seen things on the A train that would’ve caused a town-wide meltdown back in Texas, but here? <em>Barely a raised eyebrow.</em> </p><p>But even with all the love she had for the city, there was one thing she couldn’t stand. </p><p>
  <strong>The cold. </strong>
</p><p>Growing up in southern Texas, winter was a joke. If the temperature dipped into the low 40s, the town practically shut down. She was used to blazing heat, sunshine so intense it made the asphalt shimmer, and winters that could still pass for late spring. Tank tops in December? <em>Normal.</em> </p><p>This, though—<em> this New York winter </em>—was different. It was the kind of cold that got into your bones, no matter how many layers you wore. It numbed her fingers, turned her nose red, and left her cursing every icy gust of wind. </p><p>Rio avoided going outside in the winter at all costs. </p><p>But here’s the thing—<em>she had a weakness.</em> A dangerous, glaring weakness for blue eyes. And earlier in the day, she had two sets of them staring her down. </p><p>One pair—sharp and amused—belonged to Agatha, who was leaning against the doorframe with her signature smirk that said she already knew Rio was about to cave.  </p><p>The other? <em>Those were the real problem.</em> <em> </em></p><p>Nicky’s blue eyes had that pleading, wide-eyed look perfected to an art form, framed by a pout so devastatingly adorable it should be classified as a weapon. The kid could probably ask her to walk into oncoming traffic, and Rio would smile, step right off the curb, and let a New York transit bus run her right over, <em>Regina George style.</em> <em> </em></p><p><em> God help her, </em> the little menace had her wrapped around his tiny finger—because here she was, voluntarily outside, freezing her tits off, just to watch some obnoxiously large Christmas tree light up.  It wouldn’t even matter if the tree started raining $100 bills. Nothing— <em> nothing </em>—was worth braving this kind of cold. </p><p>But apparently, this was a “<em>tradition</em>” between Agatha and Nicky. A tradition that Rio was officially part of—or more accurately, <em>dragged into like a hostage.</em> <em> </em></p><p>She glanced back at Agatha, who stood perfectly composed, barely fazed by the biting wind, looking like a <em>goddamn</em> Vogue ad in her tailored coat and scarf. Meanwhile, Rio was three layers deep and still shivering.  </p><p>How the hell did they find this look enjoyable? <em> Rio was dying. </em>  </p><p>Each second out here felt like an eternity, and she was willing time to move faster, silently begging the universe to hurry up so she could retreat to the warmth of <em> literally anywhere else. </em> She was miserable, every part of her screaming in protest against the cold, but she kept a brave face for Nicky. </p><p>The kid was having the time of his life, dancing and jumping up and down, his smile so wide it could’ve powered the tree lights himself. Not a single shiver or complaint—just pure joy in the middle of this freezing hellscape. </p><p>Meanwhile, Rio could literally feel her teeth chattering, the sound rattling between her ears like a goddamn jackhammer. </p><p><em>“Oh my god.</em>  You are pathetic,” Agatha scoffed behind her, so aghast and somehow teasing that it made Rio’s frozen nerves bristle. </p><p>The snark hit her square in the back, and Rio was seconds away from unloading on her. She was cold, she was miserable, and she didn’t deserve Agatha’s commentary when she was out here suffering for <em> her kid </em>. </p><p>But before she could whip around and give Agatha a piece of her mind, she felt it—hands sliding around her waist, pulling her back into a solid, warm body. </p><p>The warmth spreading through Rio’s coat was instant, cutting through the icy ache in her bones. But it didn't compare to the fire blazing in her chest. Because if there was one thing Rio learned over dating her these past 3 months, it was this: <b> Agatha Harkness did not do PDA.  </b>   <em> Ever </em>. </p><p>Behind closed doors, Agatha was different. She loved touch—both giving and receiving. In private, her walls would come down, and she’d let Rio in, just enough to make Rio’s heart ache with how rare and precious it felt.  </p><p><em>But in public?</em> The Agatha everyone else saw was untouchable. She didn't to be perceived as <em>soft.</em> New York was always watching, and Agatha had an image to uphold. Affection in public wasn’t just frowned upon—it was forbidden. </p><p>Rio got it. <em>She really did.</em> Agatha’s no-nonsense boundaries weren’t exactly hard to respect most of the time. Rio wasn’t big on PDA herself, so it wasn’t like she was out here trying to hold hands in public or anything. Still, sometimes the urge would creep in—just a small touch, a quick brush of Agatha’s arm or the instinct to rest her hand on her back. </p><p>But every time she did, she’d get <em> the look. </em> </p><p>That sharp, cutting glare that made her feel like she’d committed some grand romantic spectacle—like sticking her tongue down Agatha’s throat in the middle of Times Square—when all she’d done was graze Agatha's back while standing next to her. </p><p>It was maddening, <em>but it was Agatha.</em> And Rio had learned to live with it.  Adding it to the list of maddening quirks that came with loving someone like Agatha Harkness. </p><p>But now? <em>Here?</em> Agatha’s arms were wrapped tightly around her, pulling her so close in the middle of Rockefeller Plaza, surrounded by people. It wasn’t just rare— <em> it was unheard of. </em> </p><p>Rio stayed perfectly still, afraid that if she acknowledged it, <em>even slightly,</em> Agatha would pull away. So instead, she leaned back into her, letting Agatha’s heat seep into her frozen limbs and her heart at the same time. </p><p>Agatha’s voice came a few minutes later, soft and low, just above a whisper by her ear.  </p><p>“Better?” </p><p>Rio swallowed hard, trying to keep her cool, but curiosity got the best of her. Moments like this didn’t just happen with Agatha—they were rare, practically sacred—and Rio couldn’t help herself. </p><p>“You know,” she started, her tone teasing, “this is totally against your rules.” </p><p>Agatha huffed next to her ear, a quiet sound that was equal parts annoyed and amused. But her arms didn’t move away like Rio expected—they tightened just a little more. </p><p><em>“Yeah, well</em>—watching you shiver like a stray dog left out in the cold is borderline torture. <em> Honestly, Rio, </em> all you’re missing is Sarah McLachlan singing <em> ‘In the Arms of an Angel.’ </em> You could have your own ASPCA commercial. <em> ‘For just 10 cents a day, you can save this poor Texas woman from freezing in the streets of New York...’” </em> </p><p>Rio snorted, fighting back a laugh, though her lips twitched into a smile anyway.  </p><p>“You’re such an ass,” she muttered, as the warmth crept into her body in more ways than one. She thought about elbowing Agatha for the mocking, but instead, she leaned her head back against Agatha's shoulder, letting herself sink into heat as much as the moment. </p><p>“You did it because you love me,” Rio mumbled under her breath, just loud enough for Agatha to hear. </p><p>Agatha chuckled, dark and low, the sound sending a pleasant shiver down Rio’s spine.  </p><p><em>“I love your fingers,”</em> Agatha corrected, her voice dripping with that trademark sarcasm. “And frostbite attacks the extremities first. Can’t risk losing those bad boys.” </p><p>Rio couldn’t help it—she laughed, a real, genuine laugh that had more warmth bursting through her chest. </p><p>This woman was <em>absolutely</em> <em> impossible </em>. </p><p>But Agatha didn’t let go. She stayed there, arms wrapped firmly around Rio, surrounded by hundreds of strangers, holding her like it was the most natural thing in the world—<em>like it was something she did every day.</em> <em> </em></p><p>And as the Christmas tree finally lit up, a brilliant burst of color against the dark sky, Nicky squealed with delight, his laughter echoing around them. </p><p>Rio couldn’t help but smile, watching his little face light up brighter than the tree itself. It was impossible not to get caught up in his joy, even with the biting cold. </p><p>Then, she felt it—Agatha’s lips brushing softly against her cheek, a quiet, fleeting kiss that sent another wave of warmth rushing through her. Agatha’s arms tightened around her, pulling her closer like she wasn’t planning to let go anytime soon. </p><p>And just like that, all the cold, <em>all the misery</em> of the night just melted away. </p><p>Rio didn’t have to wonder or second-guess. She felt it—clear, simple, <em> and undeniable. </em> </p><p>Agatha Harkness, with all her rules and obsession with maintaining her image, had chosen this moment to break them. She’d rather hold Rio, here, in front of thousands of people, than let her stand there miserable and freezing. </p><p>Because that was Agatha. Beneath all the sharp edges and perfectly curated image, when it really mattered, she’d toss it all aside without a second thought. For Agatha, <em> this was love. </em>No big speeches or dramatic displays—just holding Rio close, breaking her own rules, and keeping her warm because she couldn’t stand to see her cold. </p><p>And standing there in Agatha’s arms, Rio didn’t just feel loved.  </p><p>
  <em>She knew she was. </em>

  <p><em>Look</em>—Rio knew exactly who she was dating. She wasn’t naive. Five months in, she fully understood what it meant to be with Agatha Harkness, a woman who, quite frankly, had more influence in New York than the mayor. So yeah, Rio was well aware there were perks to dating someone like Agatha. </p><p>They never had to wait for dinner reservations, even at places that had year-long waitlists. Broadway tickets for sold-out shows? <em>Easy</em>. And Rio now had a growing collection of rare, <em>ridiculously expensive</em> plants from Agatha—plants that, combined, could probably buy a decent car. </p><p>Of course, dating a woman as powerful as Agatha had its drawbacks too. </p><p>Rio wouldn’t say she was <em> scared </em> of Agatha. She knew Agatha would rather crawl inside herself and die than hurt someone she loved. But someone she <em> hated </em>? That was another story entirely. Case in point: when Agatha broke her hand punching James Hughes in the face. </p><p>But the thing is...Agatha didn't have to put her hands on you to feel like you were going ten rounds with Mike Tyson. </p><p>Sometimes all Agatha Harkness had to do was give someone <em> the look </em>. </p><p>Thankfully, Rio had never been on the receiving end of <em> the look. </em> She'd been on the receiving end of mild <em>"look"</em> a couple of times, but she never got the full one—<em>thank god.</em>  But she’d seen it plenty—at work, at client meetings, and most recently, when James’s newest girlfriend (RIP Amanda—she’s not dead just no longer there) let Nicky (who was six, <em> six </em> !) watch <em> Jurassic Park. </em> </p><p><em>The look</em>—and the subsequent verbal annihilation James received when dropping Nicky off at Agatha's door during summer vacation had been both terrifying and, honestly, a little awe-inspiring. </p><p>Rio had watched from the couch, sipping her drink and thinking, <em> Please, God, let me never mess up that bad. </em> </p><p><em>And queue</em>...Señor Scratchy’s entrance into their world. </p><p>Rio stopped pacing in Agatha’s kitchen and stared down at the white and brown rabbit in question. He was happily munching on some lettuce in his pen, blissfully unaware that his presence alone had likely dug Rio’s grave.  His tiny black nose twitched as he glanced up at her, and Rio swore the little fluffball looked smug. </p><p>This wasn’t how today was supposed to go. </p><p>Agatha had been called away for some client emergency, leaving Rio in charge of taking Nicky shopping for his birthday. It wasn’t the first time she’d been left alone with him—they spent plenty of time together at Agatha’s home and Rio’s—but this was the first time they’d gone out in public without her. </p><p>Before leaving, Agatha had kissed Rio on the cheek and smirked.  </p><p>“Don’t let him manipulate you into buying the whole toy store.” </p><p>Rio had rolled her eyes.  </p><p>“I can say no to him, you know.” </p><p>Agatha raised one eyebrow, giving her a look that practically screamed <em> Sure you can, </em> before heading out the door. </p><p>And to be fair, Rio <em> had </em> planned to take Nicky to the toy store and let him pick out something reasonable. But then, on the way there, they passed a pet shop. </p><p>“Can we just go in and <em> look </em>?” Nicky had asked, his big blue eyes wide pleading. </p><p>And so they say...<em>the rest is history</em>—and now, here she was, standing in Agatha’s kitchen, staring down at Señor Scratchy while mentally preparing herself for the inevitable fallout his presence would likely cause. </p><p>Agatha’s client emergency must have been bad enough, because she was out late.  Nicky was already asleep, his face still lit with the remnants of a smile. He’d finally gotten his first pet, and he couldn’t have been happier. That part made Rio feel a little better. <em> A little. </em> </p><p>But then the sound of the key sliding into the deadbolt made Rio’s stomach drop like a lead weight. Her head snapped up, and for a fleeting, desperate second, she actually considered making a run for it. But Agatha was blocking the only exit. </p><p>Unless she wanted to leap out the window—<em>32 stories up</em>—that wasn’t exactly an option. Sure, she wouldn’t survive the fall, but was it really any worse than surviving Agatha’s wrath?  </p><p>Rio looked down at Señor Scratchy, and they made eye contact. </p><p>“Well, buddy,” she muttered, “it’s been nice knowing you.” </p><p>She stepped out of the kitchen and into the hallway, figuring she might stand a better chance if she explained everything before Agatha actually saw the rabbit. Maybe, <em>just maybe,</em> she could manage some damage control. </p><p>And as luck would have it, the door opened just as she made it into the hallway, and there was Agatha, stepping through before stopping immediately, seeing Rio waiting for her. </p><p>Their eyes met. </p><p><em>“Hey,”</em> Rio said, her voice a little too high-pitched to pass as casual. </p><p>Agatha’s sharp eyes narrowed.  </p><p>“Is Nicky okay?” she asked, her voice tight with worry. </p><p>Rio nodded quickly, <em> too quickly. </em> </p><p> “Yeah—sleeping, out like a light.” </p><p>Agatha let out a breath of relief, setting her keys and purse down on the table as she walked toward Rio, her gaze locked on her.  </p><p>“Then why do you look like that?” </p><p>Rio froze.  </p><p>“Like what?” </p><p>“Like you’re about to confess to murder,” Agatha said, her eyes scanning Rio’s face like she could read the truth if she looked hard enough. </p><p>Rio opened her mouth, closed it, then sighed heavily.  </p><p>“Look—I’ve got to tell you something, and you’re not going to like it.” </p><p>That made Agatha stop mid-step, her eyes narrowing further. She studied Rio’s face for a long moment, clearly trying to piece together what this <em> something </em> might be. Finally, she tilted her head, her voice low and suspicious. </p><p>“Did you cheat on me?” </p><p>Rio blinked. Of all the things Agatha could have come up with, <em>that was what she landed on? </em></p><p>She couldn’t help it—she actually laughed, the sound a mix of incredulity and disbelief.  </p><p>“Cheat on you? That’s ridiculous!” </p><p>But Agatha’s eyes didn’t soften. Instead, they narrowed further as she crossed her arms.  </p><p>“That doesn’t sound like an answer. That sounds like gaslighting.” </p><p>Rio paused, caught somewhere between being shocked and a little impressed. She hadn’t expected Agatha to actually start picking up the terms Rio threw out during their arguments, but here they were. For all her flaws, Agatha Harkness was nothing if not an attentive listener. </p><p>Rio held up her hands in surrender.  </p><p>“Okay, fair point. I see how you could perceive it that way, but let me clarify.” </p><p>Agatha’s brow arched, waiting. </p><p>Rio took a deep breath.  </p><p>“I didn’t mean it like <em> that </em> . <em>What I </em> <em>meant</em> <em> was</em> that of course I didn’t cheat on you. I said it’s ridiculous because cheating implies thinking you can find something better than what you already have—and that’s impossible for me. <em>Because I already have the best.”</em> <em> </em></p><p>That made Agatha pause. Her lips twitched, just barely, and Rio thought she might have seen the faintest flicker of a smile before Agatha schooled her features again. </p><p>“Nice save,” Agatha muttered, but her arms uncrossed, and she took a step closer, her posture softening ever so slightly. </p><p>“Not a save,” Rio corrected, her voice steadier now. “Just the truth.” </p><p>Agatha studied her for another moment, then sighed.  </p><p>“Fine. If it’s not cheating, then what’s the thing I’m not going to like?” </p><p>Rio hesitated, searching for the best way to approach this. </p><p>“First of all—<em>I love you,”</em> she said cautiously. </p><p>Agatha raised a brow, her lips twitching in a mix of amusement and irritation.  </p><p><em>“Oh, so...</em>weaponizing our love is back on the table? I must’ve missed that memo.” </p><p><em> Jesus Christ. </em> Agatha was on a roll tonight—and apparently, so was Rio. </p><p>That particular jab wasn’t random, though. It came from a recent argument. Rio could barely remember what started it—something dumb, probably—but she could distinctly remember Agatha dropping<em> “I love you”</em> during it <em>as a </em><em>tactic,</em> as a way to diffuse the argument and win Rio over. </p><p><em> And oh, did that backfire on her. </em> </p><p>Rio had launched into a 15-minute rant about how <em> “I love you” </em> wasn’t some <em>get-out-of-jail-free card</em>. Agatha didn’t get to pull those words out like a weapon, wielding them when it suited her, especially after months of not saying it. It wasn’t fair, it wasn’t right, and it wasn’t how love worked. </p><p>She still remembered the way Agatha had gone quiet, her usual sharpness replaced by regret. They’d patched things up, but the lesson apparently stuck. </p><p>Rio groaned, placing her hands on her hips and letting out a breath.  </p><p>“It’s not like that,” she said quickly. “I’m not weaponizing anything—I just... I wanted to tell you it one last time in case I never got to say it again.” </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, intrigued now.</p><p>"Someone is being dramatic."</p><p>Rio could practically feel her patience wearing thin. Taking a deep breath, praying to every deity she could think of.  </p><p>“Okay, so… you know how I was supposed to take Nicky to the toy store?” </p><p>Agatha’s brow lifted, suspicion already creeping into her expression.  </p><p><em>“Yes,”</em> she said slowly, dragging the word out like it was a warning. </p><p>Rio forced a smile.  </p><p>“Right. Well… on the way there, we passed a pet store, and—” </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha interrupted, her voice sharp. “<strong>What. Did. You. Do?”</strong> <strong> </strong></p><p>Rio hesitated, her mind racing for a way to soften the blow, but there was no easy way to say it. She sighed, defeated. </p><p>“He begged me to go in and look,” she said quickly. <em>“Just to </em> <em>look</em> <em>.</em> And then there was this rabbit, and Nicky was so excited, and he named him Señor Scratchy before I could even think, and…” Rio trailed off, gesturing vaguely toward the kitchen. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed.  </p><p>“There’s a rabbit in my house right now?” </p><p>Rio winced.  </p><p>“I mean… technically, it’s Nicky’s rabbit.” </p><p>Agatha blinked, her expression unreadable for a moment, and then she pinched the bridge of her nose, exhaling slowly. </p><p>“You bought my son a rabbit,” she said flatly. </p><p>“To be fair,” Rio interjected, holding up her hands defensively, “it’s a very well-behaved rabbit.” </p><p>Agatha dropped her hand, giving Rio a pointed look.  </p><p>“You realize you’ve just added a live animal to my already overwhelming existence, <em>right?</em> Do you have any idea what this means? The care? The mess?” </p><p>Rio nodded quickly, biting her lip.  </p><p>“I know, I know. But Nicky loves him. Like, really loves him. I swear, you should’ve seen his face, Agatha. He was so happy. And I’ll take care of him. The rabbit, I mean—not Nicky. Well, Nicky too, obviously, but—” </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha cut in. “Stop talking.” </p><p>Rio clamped her mouth shut, watching as Agatha processed. Her arms crossed tightly over her chest, and she turned her head slightly, as though she were considering all the ways she might kill Rio without traumatizing Nicky. </p><p>Finally, she sighed.  </p><p>“Where is this rabbit?” </p><p>“In the kitchen,” Rio said sheepishly. </p><p>Agatha shot her a sharp look as she passed by, and Rio stayed rooted in place, watching her go. She hesitated, her eyes flickering to the now-unblocked door. <em> Freedom. </em> It was right there. </p><p>Then she heard it—Agatha’s low, muttered <em> “Motherfucker.” </em> It wasn’t loud, but it was <em> enough. </em> </p><p>The door suddenly looked very tempting. She could run, avoid the fallout, and deal with the consequences later. But then again, if Rio was going to meet her end, Agatha’s hands wrapped around her neck wouldn’t be the worst way to go. </p><p>With a resigned sigh, Rio turned and walked into the kitchen. She opened her mouth to say something—<em> anything </em>—but stopped dead in her tracks at the sight in front of her. </p><p>Agatha was standing in the middle of the kitchen, the white-and-brown bunny cradled in her arms like a baby. She was gently stroking his fur, a soft, almost dreamy smile playing on her lips. </p><p>Rio blinked, trying to reconcile the image of <em> Agatha Harkness, </em> New York’s most terrifying woman, holding a rabbit like it was the most natural thing in the world. </p><p>“Señor Scratchy, huh?” Agatha murmured, still petting the bunny as though she hadn’t just called him a <em>motherfucker</em> thirty seconds ago. </p><p>Rio blinked again, trying to find her voice.  </p><p>“Uh… yeah. That’s his name.” </p><p>Agatha glanced up at her, the smallest hint of amusement in her eyes.  </p><p>“Nicky named him, didn’t he?” </p><p>Rio nodded, a little unsure where this was going.  </p><p>“Yeah. He said the name just…<em>fit.”</em> <em> </em></p><p>Agatha let out a small, almost reluctant laugh, her gaze dropping back to the rabbit.  </p><p>“Well, he’s not wrong.” </p><p>Rio stared, completely dumbfounded. She’d been ready for yelling, maybe a soul-piercing glare, or even a full-on lecture about responsibility and how much of a pain a rabbit would be. <em>But this?</em> Agatha standing there, holding Señor Scratchy like he was the crown jewel of New York? </p><p>This wasn’t the reaction Rio had prepared for. </p><p>Agatha looked up and caught Rio’s wide-eyed expression, shooting her a pointed look. </p><p>“You’re lucky he’s cute,” she said, her tone sharp but not unkind. With a small sigh, she glanced back down at the rabbit and gently placed him back in his pen. She latched the door and turned, walking toward Rio like nothing out of the ordinary had happened. </p><p>“He can stay,” Agatha said simply, her voice calm, like she was stating a fact. </p><p>Rio just stood there, frozen, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Agatha stopped in front of her, so close Rio could feel the warmth radiating off her, and their eyes locked. Agatha didn’t say anything at first, just studied Rio like she was sizing her up. </p><p>And then, to Rio’s complete shock, Agatha reached up and cupped her face, her hands soft against Rio’s cheeks.  A couple seconds later Agatha tapped her cheek lightly, almost teasingly. </p><p>“You’re also cute,” Agatha said with a smirk, stepping past Rio and heading toward the bedroom. Over her shoulder, she added casually, “You can stay too.” </p><p>Rio stood there, watching her go, as she disappeared through the door. For a moment, the kitchen was quiet except for the soft rustling of Señor Scratchy settling into his pen. </p><p>And Rio just… smiled. </p><p>Because if that wasn’t Agatha’s way of saying she loved her—even when Rio made decisions like impulsively buying a rabbit—then Rio didn’t know what was. </p>

  <p>
  <span>Rio cradled her phone in her hand, pressing it against her ear as she paced back and forth in front of the bed, her abuelita’s voice firing off in rapid Spanish, full of drama and exasperation.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"Y yo le dije, ¡Marco! Vas a terminar viejo y solo si no dejas de actuar así. Pero, ¿crees que me escuchó? ¡No! Se cree un gran Casanova"</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed noncommittally, her lips twitching in amusement. Her cousin Marco’s separation wasn’t exactly a shock. He’d always been the textbook definition of a </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuckboy</span>
  </em>
  <span>, so getting caught cheating was inevitable. But her abuelita? She couldn’t see Marco’s red flags if he was twirling them in her face like an Olympic athlete parading his nation’s colors—home country: </span>
  <b>
    <span>Douchebagistan.</span>
  </b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, Rio just let her talk. Her abuelita didn’t really want advice.  She just needed someone to rant to. Rio played the role of the patient mediator, responding with neutral observations instead of her true feelings. If it were up to her, she’d have Marco’s soon-to-be ex-wife over for drinks to celebrate her freedom.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Es muy complicado, Abuelita,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Rio said, nodding even though her grandmother couldn’t see her. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Estas cosas toman tiempo, ya sabes.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“¡Tiempo!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> her abuelita scoffed. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her grandmother launched into another tirade, but Rio’s attention drifted, her pacing slowing as her eyes landed on the bed.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was there, leaning back against the pillows, her reading glasses perched on her nose as she skimmed through some work files. Nicky was with his dad this week, which meant Agatha had taken to staying at Rio’s place more often.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Neither of them had acknowledged the shift in their routine yet. But at this point, they spent more nights together than apart, alternating between their homes like divorced parents splitting time with their kids—except the “</span>
  <em>
    <span>kids</span>
  </em>
  <span>” were their respective homes.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Rio didn’t mind. Not one bit.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She would never get tired of seeing Agatha: no makeup, silk pajamas that probably cost more than Rio’s entire bed, and those </span>
  <em>
    <span>goddamn glasses.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Torture. Pure, beautiful torture.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her abuelita’s sudden shout in her ear snapped her back to reality.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“¡¿Rio?!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> her abuelita’s shout snapped her out of her thoughts. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“¡¿Me estás escuchando?!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio jumped, fumbling for words. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“¡Sí, Abuelita! Claro que sí.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha glanced up from her papers, a faint smirk tugging at her lips as she caught Rio’s flustered expression. She didn’t say anything, but the knowing look in her eyes said it all</span>
  <em>
    <span>.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned away quickly, her face warming as she focused back on the phone. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“No, no, Abuelita, sigue, estoy escuchando.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her abuelita dove right back into her tirade, passionately detailing Marco’s latest antics.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Somehow, </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span>—her abuelita ranting in rapid-fire Spanish, Agatha lounging on her bed in those goddamn glasses, reading through work files—felt like home.  And Rio’s chest warmed at the thought.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, after twenty straight minutes of passionate venting, her 74-year-old grandmother started to run out of steam. With a few parting words about how Marco needed to get his life together, she let Rio escape.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio ended the call with a sigh of relief and all but collapsed onto the bed beside Agatha, face down, groaning into the pillow. She loved her abuelita—</span>
  <em>
    <span>she was everything to Rio</span>
  </em>
  <span>—but sometimes… sometimes she was </span>
  <em>
    <span>a lot.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your cousin Marco sounds like a real piece of work,” Agatha said, almost absently.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grunted in agreement and then a few seconds later Agatha’s words caught up to her and she froze.  Her head shot up off the mattress and she pushed her hair out of her face so she could stare at Agatha. The older woman was still focused on the report in front of her, casually jotting down a note in the margins like she hadn’t just dropped a bombshell.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio opened her mouth to respond but nothing came out. Her brain seemed to stall. How the hell would Agatha know that? The entire phone call had been in Spanish. It always was—her abuelita refused to speak English, even though she could.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio narrowed her eyes at Agatha.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you know what we were talking about?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stopped writing mid-sentence, her pen hovering just above the page. She froze, her entire body going unnaturally still, like she’d been caught red-handed.  Slowly, Agatha turned her head toward Rio, her face carefully neutral. She opened her mouth—only for no sound to come out.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes narrowed further, suspicion flaring.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Agatha Harkness,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Rio said, her voice rising with exaggerated accusation, “do you know Spanish?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips twitched, the faintest flicker of amusement dancing at the edges of her usually composed expression. She hesitated, closing her mouth as if reconsidering her next move, before sighing and setting the documents aside.  She turned fully to face Rio, her sharp blue eyes locking onto hers. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I may,” she began cautiously, her voice measured, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“and I need you to not make a big deal about this—</span>
  </em>
  <span>but I may be learning it in my spare time.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked, her jaw dropping slightly, as she scrambled up and plopped down with enough force to shake the bed.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>what?</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pointed a finger at her, her gaze narrowing as if to preemptively cut off Rio’s reaction. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Don’t.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Don’t make a big deal out of it.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked, caught off guard. For a moment, she couldn’t think of what to say. Finally, the only word that came out was:</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha grimaced, like she’d been bracing for that exact question.  She glanced away for a second, like she was trying to find the words, before settling back on Rio.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because,” she started, her voice softer than usual, “when you speak Spanish… </span>
  <em>
    <span>you sound different. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Happier. Lighter.” She hesitated, her body language giving way to something more vulnerable. “I like it. And I wanted to understand that part of you better.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio just stared at her, the words sinking in. Of all the answers she’d expected, this wasn’t one of them.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Agatha,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> she said softly, her chest tightening.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Don’t,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Agatha interrupted quickly, waving her hand like she could physically deflect Rio’s reaction. “I told you.  It’s not a big deal.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Rio wasn’t having it. She moved closer, her voice soft but insistent. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re right—it's not a big deal.’ That’s… that’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>huge.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, though the faint blush creeping up her neck betrayed her. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s just a language, Rio. Don’t make it weird.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, her lips curving into a small smile. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not just a language. <em>It’s my language</em> and you learned it because of me.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed, picking up her documents again, clearly uncomfortable with where the conversation was going.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well—it’s good for my résumé, so,” she muttered, feigning nonchalance.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted, unable to contain her amusement. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t </span>
  <span>need </span>
  <span>a résumé. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Your name alone is your résumé.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t look up, but the faintest twitch at the corner of her mouth betrayed her.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grinning, Rio leaned over and pressed a quick kiss to Agatha’s cheek. She barely got away before Agatha swatted her playfully, muttering something indecipherable under her breath.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just so you know,” Rio said, leaning back with a soft smile, “that’s the sweetest thing anyone’s ever done for me.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t respond right away, her attention focused on the papers in front of her. But the slight curve of her lips deepened, and Rio caught it.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sensing an opportunity, Rio couldn’t resist pushing a little.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do I say </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘thank you’</span>
  </em>
  <span> in Spanish again? I seem to have forgotten,” Rio asked, her voice dripping with exaggerated innocence.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a dramatic sigh, the kind designed to let Rio know exactly how much she was testing her patience. She tapped her fingers against the document in front of her, her gaze still fixed on the page even as she spoke.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can thank me by…” She hesitated, pausing as if searching for the right words. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Por... cerrar… la maldita… uh…</span>
  </em>
  <span>” She groaned, waving her hand impatiently. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>¡Boca! Cerrándote la maldita boca para que pueda terminar este informe.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned. It was broken, sure, and Agatha had clearly struggled, but </span>
  <em>
    <span>damn</span>
  </em>
  <span> if hearing her speak Spanish—</span>
  <em>
    <span>even if she butchered i</span>
  </em>
  <span>t—sent a warmth spreading through Rio’s chest.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Noted,” Rio said with a teasing lilt, leaning forward to snatch the report right out of Agatha’s hands. She knew she was playing with fire, but she didn’t care. She moved quickly, straddling Agatha before the woman could grab it back, leaning down until their faces were inches apart.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But for the record,” Rio added, her grin widening, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>gracias</span>
  </em>
  <span> is way nicer.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s glare was sharp, her eyes narrowing dangerously, but her hands came up instinctively to rest on Rio’s hips, her fingers digging in just enough to make a point.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well,” Agatha shot back, her voice low and biting, “I’m not nice.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, her amusement growing into something warmer. And then, because she was here—straddling Agatha—and because Agatha stumbling through Spanish with that gravelly, self-assured tone was doing things to her, Rio rolled her hips ever so slightly.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s sharp glare faltered, her breath hitching so quietly it would’ve been easy to miss if Rio wasn’t watching her so intently.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you are,” Rio murmured, her voice dropping low tease. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She leaned in close, her lips just a whisper away from Agatha’s, as their breaths mingled. Her eyes stayed locked on Agatha’s.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I think you deserve a real thank you. It won’t be in Spanish,” she added, a grin tugging at her lips, “but it’s definitely a language you’re fluent in.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised a single eyebrow, her hands tightening their grip on Rio’s hips. Her expression was unreadable, her sharp blue eyes holding Rio’s in a way that sent a shiver through her. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then, with a low, amused rasp, Agatha spoke.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>“Well—in that case, thank away, <em>mi amor.</em>”</p><p>
  <em>Mi amor.</em>
</p><p>Hearing their words—<em>their words</em>—in Spanish sent a spark through Rio, something deep and warm that she couldn’t ignore. It hit her in a place that left her breathless, like Agatha had reached right into her chest and touched something fragile and real.</p><p>She didn’t hesitate. Rio surged forward, capturing Agatha’s lips in a kiss that was hot, urgent, and full of everything she couldn’t say aloud. </p><p>
  <span>Hours later, Rio was curled against Agatha’s side, her ear resting on her chest. The steady rhythm of Agatha’s heartbeat filled the quiet.   </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sex between them was always</span>
  <em>
    <span> so fucking good, </span>
  </em>
  <span>b</span>
  <span>ut tonight had been different. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t just fire—it was a </span>
  <em>
    <span>goddamn inferno </span>
  </em>
  <span>and Rio knew why. It was because tonight, she let herself speak freely, saying every filthy word, every command, every bit of praise in her mother tongue. And the way Agatha had not only understood but </span>
  <em>
    <span>viscerally reacted</span>
  </em>
  <span>—</span>
  <em>
    <span>God</span>
  </em>
  <span>, it had been more than Rio could handle.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha Harkness was impossible—</span>
  <em>
    <span>maddening in the best and worst ways</span>
  </em>
  <span>—and yet she never failed to surprise Rio. The same woman who could barely say </span>
  <em>
    <span>I love you</span>
  </em>
  <span> in English without practically choking on the words had gone and learned an entirely new language just for her.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t make sense—at least not logically. But it was so undeniably, </span>
  <em>
    <span>perfectly Agatha.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>And God</span>
  </em>
  <span>—if that didn’t make Rio feel like she was falling in love with this woman all over again.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As if she could sense Rio’s thoughts, Agatha’s hands slid slowly up Rio’s back. She wrapped her arms around her, pulling her close, holding her like she was afraid to let go. </span>
  <span> </span>
  <span>And then without a word, Agatha leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to the top of Rio’s head. It wasn’t grand or dramatic, but it was so impossibly tender, a rarity for Agatha, and it said everything Rio had ever needed to hear.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes fluttered shut as she let herself sink into Agatha’s arms, feeling the kind of peace she didn’t think was possible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha made her feel seen in a way that left her breathless. She felt safe in a way she hadn’t realized she’d been craving.  But more than anything, she felt loved—deeply, completely, <em>and unquestionably</em> <em>loved</em>.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And for Rio, </span>
  <em>
    <span>that was everything.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>

  <p>
  <span>Rio Vidal stared out the plane window, the soft glow of the city lights below a nice reminder that she was almost home. She couldn’t believe she’d actually done it—cut her trip short and taken a red-eye back to New York, just to get home nine hours earlier than planned. It wasn’t like Agatha had begged her to return. But here Rio was, exhausted and half-smiling to herself at how utterly whipped she felt. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>Three days.  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>That was how long Rio had said she’d be away. Just three days back home in Texas, celebrating her cousin, Sofia's, wedding. The wedding itself was fine, in that chaotic, small-town way. Her cousin had worn a thrifted dress and cowboy boots and the groom was grinning like a fool from<em> way too</em> <em>much</em> beer.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was charming, really. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Rio had told her about the wedding, Agatha had barely looked up from her laptop. <em>“Send my congratulations,”</em> she’d said, already buried in her latest case.  It was some high-profile trial involving a hedge fund manager and insider trading. She couldn't come even if she wanted to—and Rio knew Agatha definitely did not want to.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But honestly Agatha would’ve hated every second of it if she were there.  <em>Sure</em>—she would suck it up for Rio, but she likely wouldn’t make it easier for her either.  It was probably for the best that she had a trial.  In a town where the fanciest thing on the menu was chicken fried steak? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Yeah, no.</span>
  </em>
  <span> No to mention, the idea of Agatha surrounded by flannel shirts, Lululemon leggings, and pickup trucks was laughable. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that didn’t mean Rio didn’t miss her like crazy.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So now, instead of catching her original flight back in the morning, Rio was on a red-eye, all because she couldn’t stand being away from Agatha for one more night. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>An hour later, the taxi pulled up to Agatha’s building. Rio didn’t bother texting to say she was home early—it was 2 a.m., and with Nicky at his dad’s, Agatha was probably asleep. All Rio wanted was to crawl into bed, bury herself in the sheets that smelled like Agatha, and feel her body pressed against hers.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She slipped quietly into the apartment with the key that had been on her keyring since Vanguard. Agatha never asked for it back, and Rio had used it so many times the edges were beginning to wear. The familiarity of the space wrapped around her like a soft blanket as she stepped inside, leaving her bag by the door and tiptoeing through the dimly lit hall.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Passing Señor Scratchy’s cage, Rio paused, a small smile tugging at her lips. She even missed the little furball. Reaching in, she gave him a quick pat before moving toward the bedroom.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was right—Agatha was asleep. The woman might struggle to fall asleep, but once she was out, she slept like the dead. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t even bother changing into proper pajamas. She tugged her sweater over her head, her t-shirt and bra quickly following, then slipped the t-shirt back on. She shimmied out of her jeans, aiming to kick them to the side, but instead her foot slammed into the edge of the side table with enough force to rattle the lamp.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck me!” Rio hissed, clutching her foot, certain she’d just lost a toenail.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The noise must’ve been enough to wake the dead, because a rustling sound came from the bed, followed by the faint click of the lamp. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then warm light filled the room.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio?” Agatha’s voice was heavy with confusion, but it quickly sharpened into anger. <em>“What the </em></span>
  <em>fuck</em>
  <span><em>?!</em> Are you trying to give me with a heart attack?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio, still hopping on one foot, turned toward the bed, ready to defend herself—but then froze.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was sitting there, her bed hair an absolute mess (as always), but it wasn’t her disheveled look that stopped Rio in her tracks. No, it was what Agatha was wearing.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span><em>There she was,</em> Agatha Harkness, wearing Rio’s orange Texas Longhorns hoodie.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The </span>
  <em>
    <span>same</span>
  </em>
  <span> hoodie Agatha had repeatedly threatened to burn whenever Rio wore it, claiming, and Rio was quoting here, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“That hideous color gives me a migraine just looking at it.”  </span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And of course, the one Rio would never forget even if she could, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“if you ever catch me wearing that hideous orange Longhorn sweater from your alma mater, check me into the nearest psychiatric facility, because I’ve clearly lost my mind."</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha </span>
  <em>
    <span>hated </span>
  </em>
  <span>that hoodie. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, there she was, sitting in bed, </span>
  <em>
    <span>wearing it.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stared, letting her injured foot finally touching the floor again as the pain in her toe faded into the background. Her brain struggled to catch up with what her eyes were seeing.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I, uh, switched my flight to the red-eye,” Rio said, her voice slow and hesitant, as if she was trying to convince herself she wasn’t imagining things.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha crossed her arms and gave her a look, one eyebrow raised.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Missed me that much, huh?” she teased mockingly.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio narrowed her eyes at her. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Nope</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she wasn’t letting this one slide. Not when Agatha was wearing </span>
  <em>
    <span>that.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think you’re in any position to talk,” Rio shot back, pointing directly at the bright orange hoodie and then raising an eyebrow at Agatha.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha blinked, looking down like she’d forgotten what she was wearing. Her nose wrinkled for a split second, but then she straightened her shoulders, her face smoothing into a mask of calm.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was cold,” Agatha said, her tone so flat it could’ve been believable—<em>if Rio didn’t know better.</em></span>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a disbelieving laugh, stepping closer to the bed and shaking her head.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice try, Harkness,” Rio said, grinning. “That hoodie was buried in the </span>
  <em>
    <span>back</span>
  </em>
  <span> of the closet. I hid it under a pile of sweaters because I was afraid you’d actually burn it while I was gone. You had to pass all your own sweaters and move five of mine just to find it.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pursed her lips, her eyes narrowing slightly.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know...it would be a shame that went through all the trouble to catch a redeye flight back home only to sleep on the couch for the night.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio bit her lip, knowing that the threat had about as much weight to it as a feather, as she climbed into bed. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t be silly,” she said leaning forward and kissing Agatha’s frown.  “I wouldn’t sleep on the couch—<em>there's two guest bedrooms.”</em></span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed against her lips, but reached forward and pulled her in for another—<em>a real one.</em></span>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hummed happily into her mouth before Agatha pulled away. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio could see plain as day the brightness in those blue eyes, and the smile that tugged at the corner of Agatha’s lips.  She was happy Rio was home.  And so was Rio.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave her a look, and turned over and shut of the light, plunging the room back into darkness. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Rio’s eyes could fully adjust to the dim light, familiar hands reached out and pulled her down, before wrapping around her and then pulling her back. It was how they always ended the night—Agatha holding her, as if that was where Rio was always meant to be.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, melting into the touch she’d been missing for days. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’d missed </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’d missed </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then her hand brushed against the rough fabric of the old Longhorns hoodie, and Rio couldn’t help but grin. She </span>
  <em>
    <span>had </span>
  </em>
  <span>to say something.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know,” she teased, “you look good in creamsicle orange.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The arms around her tightened, not gently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Say one more word,” Agatha muttered, her voice full of mock and </span>
  <em>
    <span>very </span>
  </em>
  <span>real irritation.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s grin grew, but she held back a laugh. Even she knew when to quit.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I missed you too, my love,” she said instead, wiggling closer until her back was pressed fully against Agatha’s chest.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a moment, there was silence, and Rio thought Agatha had fallen asleep. But then she felt it—a soft, barely-there kiss against the back of her neck. It was quiet and subtle, but it said so much more than words ever could.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha missed her.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But for Agatha Harkness to wear that bright orange, polyester-blend, raggedy hoodie it didn’t just mean she missed Rio.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It meant she loved her too.</span>
  <span> </span>

  <p>
  <span>Rio had a knack for sensing when something wasn’t right, and for the past few weeks, something had definitely been off with Agatha. It wasn’t anything obvious, but Rio had been around her long enough to notice the subtle shifts—the little breadcrumbs that told her Agatha was hiding something.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a lot Rio was still learning about Agatha.  It's kind of like that giant set of encyclopedias her grandmother used to keep before the internet. If you didn’t know something, you’d go to the cabinet, look it up, and figure it out from there. Rio liked to think she was about halfway through the Encyclopedia of Agatha Harkness. She had a decent grasp of the woman now, but there were still entire volumes she hadn’t touched yet.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That said, she knew enough to tell when something was up.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It started three weeks ago. Agatha had been sitting on the couch with her laptop, and Rio had assumed she was working. But when Rio walked around the couch to grab a drink from the kitchen, Agatha subtly—</span>
  <em>
    <span>but deliberately</span>
  </em>
  <span>—angled the screen away from her line of sight. It was small, casual enough that someone else might have missed it. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But not Rio.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few days later, Agatha started getting calls after work. That wasn’t unusual.  They both worked at the same law firm, and calls after hours were par for the course. What </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> unusual was that Agatha, who typically had no problem taking work calls in front of Rio, started taking these ones in her office. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Door closed.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then there was this week.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had started leaving work earlier than usual, which was practically unheard of. Agatha didn’t leave early for </span>
  <em>
    <span>anything</span>
  </em>
  <span>—not even when Nicky was home, and Nicky wasn’t even with them this week.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio had tried to get answers. She’d asked Billy if he knew what was going on. But Billy hadn’t given her much—he never did when it came to Agatha—but he did mention that Agatha’s calendar had some “personal things” blocked off.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And that was it. No explanation, no further details.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sat on the edge of the bed, her fingers drumming against her thigh as she replayed the clues over and over like she was trying to piece together a case with missing evidence. She didn’t have the whole picture, but she had enough to know one thing for sure: </span>
  <b>
    <span>Agatha was up to something.</span>
  </b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For weeks, Rio had told herself to be patient and to let Agatha come to her when she was ready. But this had been going on for nearly a month. A </span>
  <em>
    <span>month.</span>
  </em>
  <span> And Rio couldn’t take it anymore.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just a few moments ago, Agatha had taken another one of those mysterious calls in her office, leaving Rio to stew on the bed, her thoughts spiraling. She knew Agatha wouldn’t cheat—</span>
  <em>
    <span>right? </span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She </span>
  <em>
    <span>never</span>
  </em>
  <span> questioned Agatha’s loyalty before, but all the signs were there. And that gnawed away at Rio’s confidence, fraying it thread by thread.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’d been together for nine months. Rio practically lived in Agatha’s condo, and she’d been working up the courage to talk to her about not renewing her lease in a couple of months. It felt right—</span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> felt right.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But now? Now, that knot of unease in her stomach was impossible to ignore.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, when Agatha walked back into the bedroom a few moments later, acting like nothing was happening, Rio couldn’t hold it in any longer.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want to tell me what that was about?” she snapped, the words sharp and biting before she could stop herself.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha froze mid-step, clearly caught off guard. Her brow arched, a flicker of surprise crossing her face. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you…”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t,” Rio cut her off, standing up so abruptly the bed creaked behind her. Her eyes narrowed as she stared Agatha down. “Don’t play dumb. You’re hiding something from me. Don’t think I haven’t noticed.” </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her voice wavered slightly, but she pressed on. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve tried to be patient—I really have—but it’s starting to get to me. It’s bothering me, Agatha. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Are you…</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her throat closed up, the words catching before they could escape. Just the thought of saying it aloud felt like a punch to the gut. If she asked, and the answer was yes, it would shatter her.  The tears that pricked at the corners of her eyes were unstoppable now, blurring her vision and betraying the hurt and fear clawing at her chest.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha froze for a moment, her sharp blue eyes widening as she saw the tears, and Rio saw genuine alarm flickering across her face.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio…” Agatha said softly, taking a step closer.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio held up a trembling hand, stopping her in her tracks. She needed to say it, needed to get the words out before her throat closed up completely. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just tell me the truth,” she whispered, her voice breaking under the weight of her fear. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Please</span>
  </em>
  <span>. I need to know.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stared at her, her expression shifting into something uncharacteristically tender. She nodded slowly like she was making a decision she wasn’t entirely sure about.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stepped forward, and before Rio could think of stepping back, Agatha reached out and wrapped her hands gently around her waist, holding her firmly but not forcefully.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have been hiding something,” Agatha admitted, her voice quieter now, laced with hesitation. “But it’s not bad—I promise you. It’s just… </span>
  <em>
    <span>big</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest tightened, and her breath hitched. Even with Agatha’s hands on her, she couldn’t shake the nerves coiling inside her. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just tell me,” Rio whispered, her voice shaky and barely audible.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s thumb moved gently against her side, a small, grounding touch that sent a bittersweet ache straight through Rio’s chest. Agatha nodded slowly, her expression softening as her eyes locked on Rio’s.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I show you instead?” she asked, her voice quiet and careful.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked, caught off guard, but after a beat, she nodded, even though she wasn’t sure what she was agreeing to.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Twenty minutes later, they were stepping out of Agatha’s town car on the Upper East Side. Rio stood on the sidewalk, looking around in confusion. The street was calm, almost eerily quiet for New York, lined with elegant townhomes that glowed under the soft streetlights.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why are we here?” Rio asked, turning to Agatha. But before she could get more words out, Agatha was already moving, climbing the steps to one of the townhomes.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stopped in front of a beautiful carved wooden door, its dark stain standing out against the stark white stone framing the lower half of the building. Above, the red brick stretched five stories high, its windows framed in black.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s confusion only grew when Agatha pulled a set of keys from her coat pocket, slipped one into the lock, and opened the door.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned back to Rio, holding the door open with one hand, her sharp blue eyes catching Rio’s. She gestured for her to follow with a slight tilt of her head.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Against her better judgment—or maybe because of it—Rio stepped forward, climbing the stairs and crossing the threshold.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The house was </span>
  <em>
    <span>stunning</span>
  </em>
  <span>. From the entryway, she could see the entire first floor, open and spacious like the shotgun houses back in Texas but on a completely different level.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>To the left was a sleek kitchen with matte black cabinets, warm wood accents, and marble countertops that almost shimmered under soft recessed lighting. A large island sat in the center, surrounded by barstools that looked too fancy to sit on.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>To the right, the living room flowed effortlessly into the dining area. A deep gray sectional was positioned around a modern stone fireplace, and a long wooden dining table sat beneath a minimalist chandelier that cast soft, warm shadows across the space.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the back wall stopped Rio in her tracks—floor-to-ceiling glass panels framed in black metal that Rio knew in the daytime likely let in so much natural light.  There was possibly a patio back there?—Rio couldn’t tell.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio moved forward slowly, her eyes scanning every detail of the house, her mind racing to make sense of it all. Finally, she turned back to Agatha, who stood by the now closed door, her expression calm and unreadable in that perfectly practiced way only Agatha could pull off.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t understand,” Rio finally said, her voice unsteady.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hesitated, something flickering across her face—uncertainty?—before she spoke.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I bought it.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes widened as she looked around the space again, her brain scrambling to catch up. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait—you’re moving… here?” she asked, trying to piece it together.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped forward, giving her a small, almost tentative smile. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was actually hoping we’d both move here.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s mouth fell open, her heart skipped a beat, and Agatha’s smile faltered.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If that’s not what you—” Agatha started, but Rio cut her off, stepping forward and placing her hands firmly on Agatha’s hips.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span><em>“Wait,”</em> Rio said, her voice a little breathless. “You want me to live here—with you and Nicky?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands came up to rest gently on Rio’s shoulders as she nodded, and the faint hint of shyness in her expression was enough to make Rio’s heart stumble.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And Señor Scratchy,” Agatha added with a tiny twitch of her lips.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorted, shaking her head. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Of course—can’t forget him.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned to look around the house again, taking in its sheer magnitude. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha… this place…” She trailed off, overwhelmed.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was beautiful, but it had to cost a fortune. Rio’s stomach tightened as its weight sank in. She loved Agatha’s sugar-daddy status as much as the next girl, but this? T</span>
  <em>
    <span>his was a lot.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t afford to live here—not even with all my stock buys,” Rio said, half-joking, half-serious.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed at that.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry about that.  I paid for it in cash.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio choked, her head whipping around to look at her. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>“You <span>what?!</span></em>
  <span>”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled, the sound warm and light, and Rio found herself liking how it echoed in the space.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If it helps,” Agatha said, her smile turning playful, “you kind of paid for it too.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brow furrowed in confusion. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can assure you I did not,” she snorted.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers played with the hair at the nape of Rio’s neck, her touch soft but grounding.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I bought it with my bonus from the Vanguard win. The partners gave me 15%.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio froze, her jaw practically hitting the floor. She did the math quickly in her head, and her eyes widened. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You got a twenty-million-dollar bonus?” she all but choked on the words.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha grinned, her amusement evident. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“It was a very good year,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> she teased, clearly enjoying Rio’s reaction.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a dramatic groan, her head dropping forward onto Agatha’s shoulder. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I’m going to be sick.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s chuckle was low and dark, the sound curling around Rio like a weighted blanket, melting away the strong feelings coursing through her body. Her hands stroked the back of Rio’s neck before moving up, as her nails dragged lightly over her scalp in that maddening, practiced way that Agatha </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew</span>
  </em>
  <span> turned Rio into butter.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry I kept this from you,” Agatha murmured, her voice soft but full of sincerity. Her lips brushed close to Rio’s ear, sending a shiver racing down her spine. “There was a lot I needed to do to get this place. Then I hired some contactors, and… well, I wanted to surprise you in a couple of days, but—<em>here we are.”</em></span>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio closed her eyes for a moment, trying to steady herself against the pull of Agatha’s voice, the way her fingers kept moving through her hair. How easily Agatha's touch seemed to melt away her defenses was deeply unfair.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It feels kind of right, though, doesn’t it?” Agatha continued, her tone shifting to something softer, something almost vulnerable. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her fingers curled into Rio’s hair, tugging gently until Rio looked up at her. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes locked onto hers, steady and searching. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You and I—we brought down Vanguard together. It was what started us. And I don’t know…” She trailed off momentarily, her thumb brushing Rio’s cheek in a tender, almost absentminded motion.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just felt like using that money to start somewhere fresh with you made sense,” Agatha said, her voice soft, her smile even softer—the kind of rare, unguarded expression that always sent Rio’s heart racing. “Like we were closing one chapter and opening another—</span>
  <em>
    <span>together</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s breath hitched, her chest tightening. It wasn’t the house, or the gesture, or even the absurd amount of money Agatha had spent—it was the thought behind it. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The care. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>The intention. </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha,” Rio murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. She was at a loss for words, so instead, she did the only thing that felt right—she kissed her.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips curved into a smile against hers,<em> and it was everything.</em></span>
  <em> </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“So that’s a yes to moving in, then?” Agatha murmured against her lips, her tone teasing.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled, brushing her lips against Agatha’s in another kiss. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean, it’s a little run down,” she said, her voice laced with playful sarcasm. “Not as luxurious as I’m used to, but I think I can make it work. For you.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed a soft laugh, the sound vibrating against Rio’s mouth. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you for your immense sacrifice,” she retorted her tone just as sarcastic, before pulling Rio into another kiss.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stood in the entryway, kissing like the rest of the world didn’t exist until Agatha suddenly pulled back. Rio’s lips instinctively chased hers, earning a smirk from Agatha.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to show you something else,” Agatha said, her eyes glinting with mischief that immediately set Rio back on edge. But before Rio could ask, Agatha grabbed her hand and tugged her forward, leading her across the home.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio followed, letting herself be dragged to the back of the house, where Agatha stopped in front of the patio doors. Agatha turned, giving Rio a look that immediately made her nervous.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without a word, Agatha opened the door and reached around the frame. Rio heard a soft </span>
  <em>
    <span>click</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and the space beyond the glass suddenly lit up.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t a patio.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It was a massive greenhouse, easily twice the size of Rio's one</span>
  </em>
  <span> at her apartment.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her breath caught in her throat as she took it in, her mind struggling to process what she was seeing. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Construction just finished,” Agatha said softly, her voice pulling Rio from her daze. She was standing slightly behind her, watching Rio’s reaction with a mix of nervousness and pride. “They assured me it’ll be ready to use right away.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stepped forward, her feet moving independently as she crossed the threshold into the greenhouse. The faint scent of fresh soil and wood filled the air, and she could already see the thoughtful details—the custom-built shelving, the irrigation system discreetly tucked into the structure, and the perfect balance of light filtering through peaked glass panels.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s…” Rio trailed off, her throat tightening with emotion.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped closer, her voice quieter now. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s yours. To grow whatever you want. To make it yours, however you like.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned to face her, eyes wide, emotions swirling in her chest. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did this… for me?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tilted her head, her lips curving into a small, knowing smile. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, Señor Scratchy might enjoy it too, but yes—mostly for you.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a shaky laugh, her hand coming up to cover her mouth as tears pricked the corners of her eyes. It wasn’t just the house, or the gesture, or even the sheer scale of what Agatha had done—it was the fact that she </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew</span>
  </em>
  <span> how much this would mean to Rio.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Rio murmured, her voice trembling as she stepped forward, closing the distance between them. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She reached out, her fingers curling around Agatha’s hand. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is… I don’t even know what to say.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha squeezed her hand gently, her smile softening. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then don’t say anything,” she replied, her voice low. “Just tell me you love it.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s laugh came out watery, and she nodded, her chest too tight to form proper words. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love it,” she whispered, her voice breaking. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“I love you.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s expression softened even more as she pulled Rio into her arms and gently kissed her lips. It wasn’t rushed or fiery—just tender, filled with all the quiet love Agatha rarely put into words.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And at that moment, standing there in their new home—<em>in the greenhouse Agatha had built just for her</em>- Rio didn’t have to wonder or second-guess.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She </span>
  <em>
    <span>felt</span>
  </em>
  <span> it. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha’s love. </span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So clear.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So steady.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And completely hers.</span>
  <span> </span>

  <p>
  <span>It was an understatement to say their life was a whirlwind for the next few weeks. Between closing on the new house and the looming move-in date, there was barely time to breathe. They had two places to pack up.  Not that they had to lift a finger—Agatha had hired a professional moving service to handle it. Still, the logistics required Rio to go through everything she owned.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And that turned into an existential crisis of its own.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The problem wasn’t just the volume of stuff Rio had accumulated over the years. It was that nearly everything she owned, Agatha already had—but fancier. Her pots and pans? Agatha’s were top-of-the-line stainless steel, while Rio’s were a hodgepodge of thrift-store finds. Her linens? Agatha’s bedding was Egyptian cotton with thread counts so high it made Rio dizzy. Even her wine glasses, mismatched and charmingly eclectic, seemed laughable compared to the crystal set in Agatha’s kitchen.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio went all-in on her Marie Kondo moment. For days, she asked herself, <em>“Does this spark joy?”</em> so many times, it started to feel like a running joke. By the end of it, she’d whittled her entire life down to just 15 boxes—half of them filled with clothes. Honestly, it wasn’t even enough to justify renting a moving truck.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then she remembered her plants.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time she was done packing those, the truck was more than full.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For a week, Rio felt like she was caught in an endless cycle of packing and unpacking, organizing her plants in the new greenhouse, and somehow still juggling her workload at the office. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It was a lot.</span>
  </em>
  <span> The days blurred together, one spilling into the next without pause.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Today's Sam's birthday—he's bringing cupcakes to class!" Nicky announced, his words muffled as he shoveled the pancakes Rio made him into his mouth.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled at the sight of him at the table, making the chaos feel worth it. Across from him, Agatha hummed at his comment. It was their first proper breakfast in the new house. They were still living out of boxes, but the essentials were unpacked, and the kitchen finally felt functional.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Technically, his birthday is tomorrow," Nicky continued, “but we’re celebrating today because it’s on the weekend.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Yes," Agatha replied, her voice warm, "but you still get to go to his party on Sunday."</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stood to pour herself another cup of coffee, scanning the kitchen for her phone. She realized she hadn’t even looked at it since getting up that morning.  She was making her way back to the table when Nicky continued.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know! It’s like he gets two birthdays! The 12th and—”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <span>November 12th.</span>
  </b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The mug slipped from her hand, hitting the floor with a loud </span>
  <em>
    <span>crash</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Coffee splattered everywhere, the scalding liquid hitting her legs, but she barely felt the sting. Her breath hitched, her vision tunneling as she was no longer in their kitchen.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was back. Twenty years ago to the day.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her legs were pinned under twisted metal, and she could feel the crushing pressure. She could see her father slumped over in the front seat, blood trickling down his temple. Her mother’s pained breaths echoed in her ears, faint and wet.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"Close your eyes, mija..."</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mother’s voice trembled—her eyes thick with tears.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>"Can you do that for me, baby?"</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Rio!"</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <span>Agatha's voice cut through the fog, sharp and steady. </span>
    <span> </span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, hands were on her, pulling her out—not just from the car, but from the memory.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Rio, look at me!"</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked, gasping as the kitchen snapped back into focus. Agatha was gripping her arms, her blue eyes full of alarm, while Nicky stood frozen at the table, wide-eyed and clutching his fork.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I—I'm fine," Rio stammered, her voice shaky as she tried to step back. But her legs felt weak, and she sagged slightly against Agatha, who tightened her hold, steadying her.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"No," Agatha said firmly, her tone leaving no room for argument. "You're </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> fine. Sit."</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha led Rio toward the living room, careful to steer her around the mug's broken pieces still scattered on the floor. Rio’s legs felt shaky, her chest tight, but Agatha’s steady grip didn’t falter. When they reached the couch, Agatha eased her down gently before crouching in front of her, her hands never leaving Rio's arms.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Talk to me," Agatha urged quietly, her voice gentler now. "What happened?"</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio swallowed hard, trying to steady her breathing. Her eyes flicked to Nicky, who was still standing by the table, his face full of concern. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She forced a shaky smile. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay, Nicky. I just... spilled my coffee. Go finish your pancakes, okay?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky hesitated, his wide eyes darting between her and Agatha. After a moment, he nodded, his movements slow and uncertain, before settling back into his seat. He stole a wary glance over his shoulder, clearly still worried.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice dropped low, trembling as she turned to Agatha. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry,” she said shakily. Her eyes flicked to the floor, where shattered pieces of ceramic lay scattered amidst the dark pool of coffee. “That was your favorite mug.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck the mug,” Agatha replied firmly, without a hint of hesitation. She reached up, her fingers brushing against Rio’s cheek, cradling it with a tenderness that caught Rio off guard.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t until she felt Agatha’s thumb swipe across her skin, wiping away wetness, that Rio realized she was crying. She blinked, startled by her own tears.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happened? Are you okay?” Agatha asked, her voice full of worry.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio exhaled shakily, trying to steady herself and find the right words. Her mind was a swirl of emotions, and she struggled to grasp onto a single coherent thought. It had been so long since she’d had a reaction like this. But then again, she was usually more prepared. She had safeguards, routines, and ways to brace herself for today.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But this time, she wasn’t ready. Life had been a whirlwind lately—packing, unpacking, work, the move. Rio barely knew what day it was, let alone the date. The realization had hit her out of nowhere, blindsiding her. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <span>November 12th.</span>
  </b>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The day of the car wreck. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The day her parents died.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And with that unexpected reminder, the fragile walls she’d so carefully built around those memories crumbled instantly. Her compartmentalization failed, leaving the memory to take over her mind.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked at Agatha, her chest tightening as the words caught in her throat.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I... I forgot what day it was,” she whispered, her voice trembling and raw. “I wasn’t ready for it. I was back in the car. It felt so real.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s brow furrowed in confusion for a fleeting moment—until sharp realization flickered in her eyes. The connection clicked, and Rio could see the understanding settle over. Of course, Agatha remembered. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes softened, and without a word, she pulled Rio into her arms. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio buried her face into the curve of Agatha’s neck, breathing her in, letting the familiar scent anchor her. Another wave of hot tears welled up, spilling over, and she knew Agatha must have felt them against her skin because her hold only tightened as if willing to feel safe.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you need, </span>
  <em>
    <span>mi amor</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Agatha murmured, her voice low and soothing as she pressed her lips to Rio’s hair.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let out a shaky breath, struggling to steady herself. It would've been fine if she’d had more time to prepare for the day—for the memories. She would’ve been fine. </span>
  <em>
    <span>But now? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Now, the grief and trauma had blindsided her, throwing her completely off balance. The smell of blood seemed to linger in her nostrils. The faint wail of a siren echoed in her ears. She could still feel the phantom press of cold metal pinning her legs in place.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t focus. Couldn’t function. Not like this.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think...” Rio’s voice wavered, muffled against Agatha’s neck. “I think I just need to stay home today.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t even hesitate as she pulled back to look Rio in the eye.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then you’re staying home,” she said, her tone steady and sure. “I’ll handle everything. Do you feel okay enough to change your pants? Or do you want me to grab you a clean pair?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s heart clenched at the quiet care in her words. It was so thoughtful, and it made her chest ache. She blinked hard, trying to hold back the fresh tears that threatened to spill.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m okay,” Rio said, her voice shaky but forcing a small smile. “I can change.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed, her disbelief clear. She pursed her lips, looking like she wanted to argue but held back—</span>
  <em>
    <span>for now.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’re not back down here in five minutes,” she said, her voice soft but carrying just enough warning, “I’m coming up to check on you.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, giving Agatha’s hand a quick squeeze before standing up on legs that felt like jelly. She wobbled, and Agatha’s hands shot to her hips, steadying her without hesitation.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy,” Agatha murmured, her hands firm but gentle, holding on until Rio found her footing.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m okay,” Rio said again, her voice a little stronger this time, though her cheeks burned from the mix of emotions swirling inside her.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stayed close, her hands lingering for a moment longer, her eyes locked on Rio like she was willing her to remain upright through sheer force of will. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good,” Agatha said finally, her tone softer now. “Remember—five minutes.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, feeling a wave of gratitude that she couldn’t quite put into words, and headed toward the stairs. She could feel Agatha’s eyes on her the whole way. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Upstairs, she managed to change into a pair of sweatpants, her hands trembling just slightly as she pulled them on. She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror—her eyes were red and puffy, her cheeks flushed. She looked rundown but not nearly as wrecked as she felt inside.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took a deep breath, letting it out slowly, willing herself to hold it together. Then, with a little more steadiness in her step, she headed back downstairs.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she reached the bottom of the stairs, she saw Agatha standing there, phone in hand. It was obvious she’d been keeping an eye on the time, probably counting down the seconds.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moment Agatha noticed her, her head snapped up. Those sharp blue eyes locked onto Rio, tracking every step she took. Rio caught the way Agatha’s hand twitched at her side as if she was barely holding herself back from rushing forward.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Rio finally made it to the bottom, Agatha spoke.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I called the partners. They’re not expecting either of us today.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked, caught off guard. Agatha never called into work. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Ever.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha…” Rio started, her voice trailing off in disbelief.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m staying home with you,” Agatha interrupted firmly, brushing a stray strand of hair from Rio’s face. “Go lay down on the couch. I’ll change, and then we can watch that black hole documentary you’ve been wanting to see.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A shaky smile tugged at Rio’s lips at the mention of the documentary—the fact that Agatha remembered.  </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned in, kissing her cheek softly before heading upstairs.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio made her way to the couch and settled in under a blanket. She closed her eyes for a moment, trying to steady herself, to push the painful memories back where they belonged. A few minutes passed, and just as she started to feel the tension easing, the couch dipped beside her.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She opened her eyes, expecting to see Agatha, but instead, it was Nicky—now back in his favorite cartoon-covered pajamas.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nicky?” Rio asked, confused. Her eyes flicked to his outfit. “What are you doing?”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without a word, Nicky snuggled into her side, wrapping his small arms around her.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mom said it’s a stay-at-home day because it’s a sad day for you,” he said softly, his voice calm and matter-of-fact.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest tightened, and she swallowed hard. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to stay, buddy. You’ll miss Sam’s birthday cupcakes.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky shrugged, completely unfazed. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t care about cupcakes.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked, surprised. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really? You were so excited about them this morning.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked up at her, his little face serious in a way that caught her off guard. </span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re more important than cupcakes, Rio.”</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt tears welling up in her eyes as she pulled Nicky closer, pressing a soft kiss to the top of his head. He hugged her tightly back.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, buddy,” she whispered.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nicky just smiled, leaning his head against her arm like it was the most natural thing in the world. They sat there quietly for a few moments, the weight of the day feeling a little lighter with him there.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sound of footsteps made Rio glance up, and she saw Agatha walking into the room. Her expression softened when she saw them curled up together, and without saying a word, she moved to the couch, sitting down on Rio’s other side.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha grabbed the remote, casually fiddling with it in one hand while her other arm draped over the back of the couch. Her fingers slipped into Rio’s hair, stroking gently, a motion so familiar and comforting it sent a wave of calm through her. It was Rio’s favorite place to be touched (besides the obvious), and of course, Agatha knew it.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt herself sinking further into the touch and couch. She watched as Agatha scrolled through Netflix, landing on the documentary Rio had begged to watch last week—the one Agatha had vetoed. This time, though, Agatha clicked on it without hesitation, hit play, and leaned back into the cushions like she had all the time in the world to stay right there with her.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The soft hum of the documentary played in the background, but Rio hardly noticed it. She leaned back into the couch. Nicky was tucked against her side while Agatha’s fingers combed gently through her hair. Their presence was like a living, breathing patronus, keeping the dementors at bay and holding the trauma-filled memory just out of reach.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Today was the 20th anniversary of the day she lost her parents—</span>
  <em>
    <span>her family.  </span>
  </em>
  <span>She’d spent so many years feeling untethered like something vital had been ripped away and left her adrift. But now, sitting here on this couch, she realized something she never thought she’d feel on this day.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t alone anymore.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This was her family now</span>
  </em>
  <span>—not the one she’d lost, but the one she’d found. The one she never thought she’d have again.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t the same, but it was no less hers. And as she sat there, sandwiched between Agatha and Nicky, the ache in her chest didn’t vanish entirely—but it eased. The weight of grief softened, leaving room for something else.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The love she felt in that moment didn’t just make the day bearable.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It made her feel whole again.</span>
  <span> </span>

  <p>Even if Rio didn’t have perfect recall—if she were just a normal person with an average memory—she’d still always remember their one-year anniversary.  It was the kind of night no one could forget. To say that a lot happened over a very short period was putting it mildly.  </p><p>It started with Rio somehow convincing Agatha to return to the <em> Red Ligh </em> t bar—the very place where their relationship had taken off like a rocket a year ago. Agatha, surprisingly, had agreed. And for the most part, she even seemed to enjoy herself. They drank— <em> a lot. </em> With her penchant for bourbon, Agatha had indulged more than usual, and at some point, Rio had even convinced her to dance. Agatha had resisted at first, but a few too many bourbons later, she was moving with Rio on the small, crowded dance floor, laughing in that low, rare way that made Rio’s heart skip. </p><p>Things took a sharp turn when Agatha excused herself to use the restroom, leaving Rio at the bar to grab another round of drinks.  As she waited, she started chatting with a few women who had moved beside her. To her defense, she wasn’t flirting—just talking. But one of the women had leaned in a little too close, her hand touching Rio’s arm as she laughed at something Rio said. </p><p>It was innocent enough—or at least it felt that way to Rio. She had been seconds away from politely excusing herself when she felt it. </p><p>That unmistakable chill. </p><p>Rio turned her head and instantly froze. </p><p><em>Oh, shit.</em> </p><p>Agatha stood a few feet away, her sharp blue eyes locked on the scene. She wasn’t glaring—not exactly—but the way her gaze shifted from the woman’s hand on Rio’s arm to Rio’s face made Rio’s stomach do a nervous flip. It wasn’t anger, but it was close. A warning, maybe. Or a reminder. Either way, Rio got the message loud and clear and stepped away from the touch. </p><p>They left the bar soon after, and what happened next was nothing short of unforgettable. Agatha was like a woman possessed, dragging Rio through every room of the house with a kind of wild, unrestrained passion that Rio had never seen out of her before.  By the time they made it to the bedroom, Agatha grabbed the strap, and Rio wasn’t sure if she should be excited or terrified. What followed wasn’t just good—<em>it was </em> <em> earth-shattering. </em> Agatha didn’t just fuck her that night—she devoured her body and soul until Rio felt like she’d been turned inside out. </p><p>Christmas came early again—<em> twice </em>.  </p><p>Afterwards, it left Rio so breathless that it had her questioning if she was even still in her body.  </p><p>And then, at 2 AM, everything fell apart. </p><p>Rio woke up to a pain so sharp it felt like her insides were being ripped apart. It started as a dull ache in her lower stomach, then quickly escalated to cramps that had her doubling over, clutching her middle. By the time the stabbing sensation hit, she was sure she was dying. </p><p>Agatha, who just hours earlier had been a full-blown sex demon, was now a complete wreck. The calm, composed woman who could command a room—or when Rio allowed it, <em>a bed</em>—without breaking a sweat had crumbled into frantic mess. Her voice was sharp with worry and her hands trembling as she tried to help Rio. </p><p>When Agatha finally managed to get Rio into her rarely used Mercedes, Rio immediately understood why Agatha always had drivers. </p><p>
  <em> It was terrifying. </em>
</p><p>Agatha was an awful driver. Not just bad—<em> chaotic. </em> It shouldn’t have been a surprise, really. The woman had the patience of a caffeinated squirrel, zero tolerance for other's mistakes, and considered most traffic laws as more of a polite suggestion. </p><p>Once they barely arrived, Rio was seen immediately, thanks to Agatha threatening to sue anyone who dared to delay them. Rio was whisked off for imaging, and what happened next would be burned into her memory forever. </p><p>The young male doctor walked in, awkward and blushing, as he tried to maintain some semblance of professionalism.  </p><p>“So, um… it appears your ovary flipped,” he explained, avoiding direct eye contact. “That kind of thing… usually happens after, uh, rough <em> activity </em>.” </p><p>Rio could barely process the words, but what really stuck with her was the look of sheer mortification on Agatha’s face. The same Agatha who had just threatened a lawsuit and bulldozed through every hospital protocol now looked like she wanted the floor to swallow her whole. When the doctor’s gaze darted briefly to Agatha and then back down to his clipboard, his blush deepened, and Rio couldn’t help it.  </p><p>She busted out laughing—even through the pain. </p><p>The procedure was done laparoscopically,<em> thank God, </em> but the doctors decided to keep Rio overnight just to be safe. She was groggy after the surgery, her mind hazy, but she was <em> pretty sure </em> she heard Agatha yelling at someone in the hallway. The details were fuzzy, but the tone was unmistakable—even through the pain meds they gave her.   </p><p>The next morning, after being discharged, they spent the entire day sprawled on the couch, watching an eight-part documentary about an archaeologist uncovering a groundbreaking discovery in Egypt. Around episode 5, Rio felt restless and gingerly got up to grab some water, ignoring Agatha's grumbling behind her about resting. </p><p>“I <em> want </em> to walk, Agatha. You’d spoon-feed me lunch if I let you,” she teased when Agatha shot her a concerned look. </p><p>Standing in the kitchen, Rio sipped her water, the soreness lingering but manageable. </p><p>“While you’re up, there’s a document for you to sign,” Agatha called casually from the couch. </p><p>Rio frowned, confused.  </p><p>“What document?” she asked, setting her glass down. She turned to see a piece of paper neatly placed on the countertop, a pen conveniently next to it. Curiosity piqued, she stepped closer, picked up the pen out of habit, and glanced at the title. </p><p>Her heart stopped. </p><p>In bold, bright letters across the top, the words <b> <em> New York Marriage License Application </em> </b> stared back at her. </p><p>Her brain struggled to process what she was seeing. The entire form was filled out in Agatha’s precise handwriting—all of Rio’s personal details, down to her social security number.  </p><p><em> When the hell did she get that? </em>  </p><p>And at the bottom, in that same elegant script, was Agatha’s signature. </p><p>The only thing missing was Rio’s signature. </p><p>She looked up at Agatha, who sat on the couch with her usual mask of calm indifference—except Rio could see the cracks. There was a nervous edge in her sharp blue eyes, a tell that Agatha couldn’t quite hide from those who really knew her. </p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, then gave a small, almost dismissive wave toward the application.  </p><p>“If you’re going to keep ending up in the hospital, I’d rather not have to deal with people questioning <em> my relationship </em> to you,” she said, her tone clipped but laced with something softer underneath. “That document should put an end to it. No more issues in the future.” </p><p>She leaned back, her expression cool, but Rio could see the tension in her shoulders, the way her fingers fidgeted slightly against the arm of the couch.  </p><p>Rio looked back down at the form, her heart hammering in her chest.  </p><p><em> Is this… a proposal? </em>  </p><p>Rio had always wondered if they’d end up getting married. She’d thought about it more than once, imagining how she might eventually bring it up—testing the waters, gauging Agatha’s reaction. In her mind, she’d always pictured herself doing <em> the asking </em>, planning it out in some grand yet intimate way that would take Agatha by surprise. </p><p>But as Rio stared down at the paper in front of her, she couldn’t help but smile, her heart fluttering in her chest. Of course, <em> this </em> was how it would happen. This was the most <em> Agatha Harkness </em> proposal imaginable. </p><p>No kneeling. No romantic speeches. No asking. Just a document sitting on the counter, already filled out, waiting for her signature. </p><p>It was so reminiscent of the “<em>Relationship Disclosure”</em> form she’d signed almost a year ago—presented with the same matter-of-fact efficiency—that Rio couldn’t help but find it oddly, endearingly romantic. </p><p>Rio bit her lip, trying to keep from laughing. Her fingers curled tighter around the pen as she looked up at Agatha, who was doing her best to look unbothered but failing miserably. The nervous tension in her jaw, the slight crease in her brow were so on full display. </p><p>Rio looked back down at the document, and didn’t even hesitate—she signed it.  Placing the pen back down she walked back to the couch smiling. </p><p>“You know, most people propose with a ring, not paperwork,” she called out to Agatha who was watching her move back towards the living room with a new light in her eyes. </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her voice dry.  </p><p>“Rings are symbolic. Paperwork is binding.” </p><p>Rio snorted, shaking her head as she walked over to the couch, her smile widening. She gingerly plopped down next to Agatha, settling in with an amused look on her face. </p><p>“Judge Marks does marriages on Tuesdays,” Agatha said, matter-of-factly. “I had Billy block off the calendar.” </p><p>Rio blinked, then sputtered.  </p><p>“You want Marks to marry us? Doesn’t he <em> hate </em> you?” </p><p>Agatha’s lips curled into a devilish smirk.  </p><p>“Yes,” she said, her tone dripping with satisfaction. “Which is exactly why it will be so entertaining.” </p><p>Rio stared at her, deadpan.  </p><p>“<em> Wow. </em> A proposal by paperwork and a wedding officiated by a man who can’t stand you. Truly, every little girl’s dream come true.” </p><p>For a brief moment, Agatha hesitated, her smirk softening into something almost uncertain.  </p><p>“Do you… want an actual wedding?” she asked, the words uncharacteristically tentative. “Because if you do, I can suck it up and—” </p><p>Rio cut her off with a laugh, shaking her head.  </p><p>“<em> God, no. </em>Absolutely not.” </p><p>She leaned in closer, her smile warm and genuine.  </p><p>“Tuesday with Marks sounds perfect.” </p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a warm smile, and she reached for Rio’s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze before letting go. She twisted slightly, leaning toward the end table, and pulled open a drawer. When she turned back around, a small velvet box was in her hand.  </p><p>The sight of it made Rio’s breath hitch. </p><p>Agatha hesitated, swallowing hard, before facing Rio and opening the box. </p><p>Rio’s eyes dropped to the ring inside, and for a moment, she couldn’t breathe. It was stunning. A simple gold band, understated yet elegant, but the centerpiece—a square-cut emerald—was anything but ordinary. It was bold, vibrant, and impossibly beautiful, catching the light in a way that made it seem alive. </p><p>Rio had never spent much time imagining what kind of ring she’d want. It wasn’t something she ever thought about. But somehow, Agatha had chosen something so unconventional, so <em> her </em>, that it took Rio by complete surprise. It was perfect—everything Rio had never dreamed of but somehow always wanted. </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. </p><p>“I figured this might also stop you from getting hit on at bars too. Kill two birds with one stone—<em>pun intended.”</em> <em> </em></p><p>She tried to sound dry and nonchalant, but her voice caught mid-sentence, betraying her nerves. It was subtle, but Rio caught it, and her heart melted. </p><p>Agatha’s hands trembled slightly as she reached into the box and carefully took out the ring. For a moment, she hesitated, showing a vulnerability that made Rio’s chest ache in the best way. </p><p>Without a second thought, Rio held out her hand, a silent answer to the unspoken question. Agatha exhaled softly, the tension in her shoulders easing as she slid the ring onto Rio’s finger. The fit was perfect—like it was made for her. </p><p>And knowing Agatha—it probably was. </p><p>Rio let out a breath she hadn’t even realized she was holding, her eyes drifting from the ring to Agatha’s face. Agatha was watching her intently, those sharp blue eyes softened by an emotion she didn’t hide. </p><p>“You’re full of surprises, you know that?” Rio said softly, her voice teasing but thick with emotion. </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, a flicker of amusement breaking through her nerves. </p><p>“I like to keep you on your toes,” she murmured as the corners of her mouth tugged into a small, genuine smile. </p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head as she reached up to cup Agatha’s cheek.  </p><p>“Well, congratulations, my love” she murmured, her thumb brushing lightly against Agatha’s skin. “You’ve officially swept me off my feet.” </p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched, her smirk returning with just a hint of her usual confidence.  </p><p>“Good,” she said, leaning into Rio’s touch. “Because you’re stuck with me now.” </p><p>Rio smiled back, her chest feeling impossibly full.  </p><p>“<em> Stuck? </em> I think I prefer the term <em>‘lucky.’</em>” </p><p>Agatha let out a huff, but it was soft, almost affectionate, as she leaned forward and kissed her. Rio kissed her back, their lips meeting in a gentle, unhurried rhythm before she pulled back just slightly, a teasing smile playing on her lips. </p><p>“Married after only a year of being together,” Rio murmured into Agatha’s lips. “You should see if you can get U-Haul to sponsor you. You’re basically their spokesperson at this point.” </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her lips twitched in a reluctant smirk.  </p><p>“Don’t ruin the moment, asshole,” she retorted, her tone dry, but she was already leaning in to kiss Rio again. </p><p>Rio laughed into the kiss, her heart so full it felt like it might burst. She pulled Agatha closer, the weight of the ring on her finger a perfect reminder of just how loved and wanted she truly was. </p>

  <p>Rio and Agatha did get married on a Tuesday, right in front of Judge Marks. And every time Marks awkwardly avoided looking at them directly, Agatha only beamed brighter, like it was the happiest day of her life. Nicky, of course, was there too, and out of all of them, he was easily the happiest.  </p><p>And then life did what it always did…it went on.  </p><p>Rio had kept her last name. She wanted to build something for herself without leaning on Agatha’s name as a springboard.  Agatha hadn’t changed hers either—how could she? Her entire career, her reputation, her <em>everything</em> was tied to it. </p><p>In the end, they kept their own names. It didn’t matter. It didn’t make them any less married or their commitment any less real. </p><p>Married life, it turned out, wasn’t all that different from how things were before. They just went about their days like always—working, building a life together. They made a house a home on the Upper East Side. Life was busy, but it was good. Honestly? It was <em>great</em>. </p><p>Agatha, Nicky, Rio, and Senor Scratchy—they found their rhythm, their own little world that somehow felt complete. </p><p>And then… their first bump came.  </p><p>Two months after getting married, Rio walked into Nicky’s school office, feeling a flicker of nerves she was determined not to show. She straightened her shoulders, slipping on her best lawyer face. Agatha had warned her that this could happen. It had happened before—just not since Rio had been in the picture. But today, Agatha was in the middle of a trial, James was out of town, and that left Rio to get the call.  </p><p>As soon as she stepped into the office, she saw Nicky sitting on a chair in the corner, his head hanging low, looking absolutely miserable. Her heart clenched, and she wanted to go straight to him, but before she could move, the school secretary stood up and approached her.  </p><p>“You’re Rio Vidal, yes? Nicholas’s…” The woman hesitated, her pause stretching just a little too long before settling on, “...stepmother?”  </p><p>Though she tried not to show it, Rio flinched inwardly at the word.<em> Stepmother.</em> The word felt wrong like it didn’t belong to her. Sure, legally, that’s what she was. But it felt cold, detached like it erased everything warm and real about her connection to Nicky. It made their relationship sound transactional like she was some extra piece tacked onto his life.  </p><p>She glanced toward the bench where Nicky sat, her stomach twisting at the sight of him. He looked even smaller than usual, his shoulders hunched, his expression closed off. He seemed to fold in on himself at the word, and it hit her like a gut punch.  </p><p><em>God</em>, she hated seeing him like that. It tugged at a part of her she didn’t even know existed until now—a raw, aching place in her chest that felt like it might crack open if she let it.  </p><p>As she stood there, her throat tight, Rio realized they’d never really talked about what she was to him. There hadn’t been any conversations about labels or titles since she and Agatha got married. They didn’t need them—at least, that’s what she’d told herself. From the start, the three of them had just fit like they were always meant to be. No words had ever seemed necessary to define what they already knew.  </p><p>But looking at Nicky now, with that word hanging in the air like a weight, Rio realized she might have been wrong. Maybe they did need to talk about it. Maybe he needed to hear what he meant to her. And maybe she needed to say it out loud, too.  </p><p>“Yes, that’s me,” she said to the secretary, forcing her voice to stay calm.  </p><p>The woman offered a tight smile, leaning in as if her next words were some kind of secret. But she wasn’t quiet enough to keep it out of Nicky's reach. </p><p>“Typically, he goes home after one of his... <em>runner incidents</em>,” she whispered, glancing at Nicky, then back at Rio. “We’ll see him in the morning.”  </p><p>Rio nodded, biting back the sharp retort sitting on her tongue. What else was there to say? Nothing that would help Nicky right now.  </p><p>She turned to him, and her heart clenched. He was already on his feet, staring at the ground. She wanted to scoop him up, to shield him from everything, but instead, she softened her voice.   </p><p>“Come on, buddy.”  </p><p>He shuffled forward without a word, his head still down, and they made their way to the car. Rio opened the door for him, waiting as he climbed into his booster seat and carefully buckled himself in. The quiet click of the seatbelt felt heavier than it should have. Once he was settled, she started the car.  </p><p>The ride home was silent. Rio gripped the wheel, her knuckles white as she glanced at him through the rearview mirror. Agatha always let him have his space when he was upset.  It gave him time to work through his feelings before talking. It worked for them, and Rio wanted to honor that. So, she stayed quiet, even though every fiber of her wanted to pull over, turn around, and tell him it was okay, that she was there, that they’d figure this out together.  </p><p>Instead, she watched him like a hawk, her eyes darting to the mirror every few seconds. He stared out the window, his big blue eyes filled with something she couldn’t quite place—hurt, maybe, or frustration.  </p><p>Rio pulled into the small one-car garage, and they climbed out without a word. The silence hung between them. Inside, they slipped off their shoes and coats, quietly going through the motions before entering the living room.  </p><p>Rio paused, standing there, waiting for him to say something—<em>anything</em>. Nicky shifted uncomfortably, his gaze darting everywhere but at her. Finally, he mumbled so softly she almost didn’t catch it.  </p><p>“I want to talk to Mom.”  </p><p>The words warmed and broke Rio’s heart all at once. She loved that Nicky adored Agatha—of course she did—but it still stung that he didn’t want to talk to her. They’d navigated big conversations before, hadn’t they? So why was this different? What was he going through that he didn’t feel like he could share with her?  </p><p>Rio swallowed the knot in her throat and reached for her phone, her chest loosening slightly when she saw a text from Agatha a few minutes earlier: <strong><em>Breaking for recess. Is Nicky okay?</em></strong>  </p><p>She pressed the call button, and the line barely rang before Agatha answered.  </p><p>“How is he?” Agatha’s voice was tight, her worry palpable even through the phone.  </p><p>Rio glanced at Nicky, who stood in the corner of the room, small and sullen, his head still bowed. Choosing her words carefully, trying to avoid making things worse, knowing he was listening intently despite his silence.  </p><p>“He’s processing some things,” answered Rio, before swallowing around the lump in her throat.  “He wants to talk to you. </p><p>“Oh,” Agatha said, her voice laced with surprise, like it hadn’t even crossed her mind that Nicky couldn’t work it out with Rio. There was a brief pause, then a softer, “Okay… put him on.”  </p><p>Rio nodded and walked over to Nicky, holding out the phone. He took it without looking at her, his small hands clutching it tightly as he brought it to his ear.  </p><p><em>“Mama,” </em>he said, his voice small and fragile—the kind of voice that reached deep inside you and pulled at everything you didn’t know could hurt.  </p><p>Rio caught the soft reply from Agatha on the other end.   </p><p>“Hi, baby—what’s wrong?”  </p><p>At that, Nicky looked up at Rio, and the way his eyes met hers made her stomach drop. She froze, her mind spinning.   </p><p><em>Am I the problem? Did I do something to hurt him? Is he mad at me?</em>   </p><p>The thoughts hit hard and fast, twisting her insides into knots.  </p><p>But Nicky didn’t say anything to her. He just looked away again, his gaze dropping to the floor as he turned and started walking toward the stairs, the phone still pressed to his ear.  </p><p>Rio stood there, watching him go, her chest tightening with every step he took. He was heading to his room, and she knew exactly what that meant. He didn’t want her to hear.  </p><p>Something was wrong—<em>really wrong</em>—and Rio couldn’t shake the feeling that it all came back to her.  </p><p>The next ten minutes were absolute torture. She paced the length of the house, back and forth, her nerves on fire. The silence felt deafening as she waited, straining for any sound that might tell her Nicky was done talking to Agatha. Finally, after what felt like hours, she heard the creak of his bedroom door upstairs, followed by the soft patter of footsteps.  </p><p>Rio froze mid-stride, then quickly leaned against the countertop, doing her best to look like she wasn’t an emotional wreck. Her heart hammered as Nicky appeared at the bottom of the stairs and started walking toward her.  </p><p>He was looking at her now, and for a moment, she thought that was a good sign—until she noticed the tear tracks on his cheeks. Her heart shattered into pieces.  </p><p>Wordlessly, he held out the phone. Rio took it, her throat tight as she brought it to her ear, watching as Nicky walked away and slipped into the greenhouse, quietly shutting the door behind him.  </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha’s voice came through the line.  </p><p>Rio startled, gripping the phone tighter.   </p><p>“Agatha… is he okay? Did I do something to hurt him?” Her words came out rushed, almost breathless.  </p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate.   </p><p>“No. You didn’t do anything, okay? He’s upset, but this isn’t on you. It’s… it’s about a Family Tree project they had to do at school. He wrote your name on it, and some kids asked who you were to him, and…” She sighed, the frustration clear in her voice. “Shit, Rio. I dropped the ball on this. I should’ve talked to him about it sooner. This is my fault, not yours.”  </p><p>Rio closed her eyes, relief and worry mixing into a messy tangle inside her.  </p><p>“He and I talked it out,” Agatha continued. “He’s okay now, and he’s ready to talk to you. But, Rio…” She paused, her tone shifting, careful now. “I need to tell you something—so you can be prepared.”  </p><p>Rio’s stomach clenched.  </p><p>“What is it?”  </p><p>Agatha paused and then spoke.  </p><p>“He wants to call you his mom,” she said softly. “Not Rio anymore.”   </p><p>Rio blinked, the words sinking in slowly, leaving her breathless in a completely different way.  She let out a slow breath as if trying to steady herself.   </p><p>“Okay,” she said, her voice a little shaky as she tugged at her lip with her teeth. “How do you feel about that?”   </p><p>Agatha paused on the other end again.  </p><p>“I was going to ask you the same thing,” she finally said, her tone carefully soft.   </p><p>Rio felt a jolt of recognition, the conversation pulling her back to another moment, one that felt burned into her memory. This wasn’t the first time they’d talked about Nicky like this—about what he meant to her and how Agatha felt about Rio being in Nicky’s life. It was different now, <em>sure</em>, but the echoes were the same.</p><p>That morning, after the shooting, when she’d woken up in Agatha’s bed with Nicky curled into her chest, it had been a turning point for Rio. </p><p>She’d always known Agatha had a kid. She’d seen his picture on her desk the first time she set foot in Agatha’s office—the only personal item in an otherwise professional space. In the beginning, when they were failing spectacularly at being just <em>fuck-buddies</em>, Nicky had felt more like an idea than a person—something distant and abstract, a faint outline that didn’t yet have form or substance.   </p><p>And then they spectacularly failed at the whole <em>fuck-buddies</em> arrangement.   </p><p>And then she met Nicky at the park and then she was forced to move in with Agatha temporarily. Then suddenly, Nicky wasn’t an idea anymore—<em>he was real.</em> He was a good kid with a kind heart and a curiosity that matched her own. They bonded almost instantly, swapping fun facts and watching documentaries together like friends. She liked him right away—<em>really liked him. </em>  </p><p>And then the morning after the shooting came. </p><p>She woke up with Nicky in her arms, his small body tucked against hers like it was the most natural thing in the world. In that moment, everything changed. It was like stepping into a different world, one where everything was sharp and vivid as if someone had flipped the switch from black-and-white to full, <em>breathtaking color.</em>   </p><p>Agatha had always been the woman of her dreams. That was undeniable. But Nicky? He was the dream she hadn’t even known she was searching for, the one she never dared to imagine for herself. And yet, here he was—warm and real, breathing softly in her arms—filling a space in her heart she didn’t even know had been waiting for him.   </p><p>“Rio?” Agatha’s worried voice brought her back to the present.   </p><p>Rio swallowed, and her throat tightened.    </p><p>“I think…” she started, her voice catching as she tried to find the words. “I think it’s everything I never knew I wanted.”  </p><p>Agatha paused at Rio’s words, her breath audible through the receiver.  </p><p>“Good,” she said, a soft sigh of relief following. “Because now you have to go tell him that.”  </p><p>Rio swallowed hard, her hand gripping the edge of the counter for support.   </p><p>“Are you sure you’re okay with this?” she asked quietly.  </p><p>Agatha was silent for a moment, the kind of pause that held weight. Finally, she spoke.  </p><p>“It took me by surprise for a moment—just for a moment. But yes, I’m okay with it,” Agatha said, her voice steady and sure.    </p><p>She paused briefly, as if letting the words settle before continuing.   </p><p>“Rio, I wouldn’t be with you if I didn’t believe you’d be a good mother to my son. That’s what you are… and it’s what you’ve been for a while now. This is just us acknowledging it out loud.”  </p><p>Rio blinked back the sudden sting in her eyes, the lump in her throat making it hard to respond. She didn’t know what to say—how to put into words what it meant to hear Agatha say that, to affirm something Rio had been too scared to claim for herself.  </p><p>"<em>Fuck</em>—look, we’re getting called back from recess," Agatha said, her tone rushed. "I gotta go. Go talk to him, okay? He just didn’t know how to voice it, and he was scared of hurting my feelings by calling you mom. I’ll be home as soon as I can. And, Rio...I..."  </p><p>She hesitated, and in the background, Rio heard an unmistakable shout, “<em>Agatha, move your ass!” </em> </p><p><em>“Jesus Christ,</em> why did I take this case with her?” Agatha muttered under her breath before raising her voice, irritation dripping from every word. <em>“For fuck’s sake, Jen</em>—I’m coming! Yell at me again, and swear I will switch sides, only so I can legally beat your ass!”  </p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh softly.  </p><p>She knew exactly what Agatha was trying to say before she was interrupted. </p><p>“I love you too,” Rio said, filling in Agatha’s missing words with her own. She didn’t need to hear it. Agatha had already said it in a thousand other ways. “Go win your case and come home, okay?”  </p><p>There was a pause on the other end, like Agatha wanted to say more but didn’t have the time or space for it.   </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said finally, her voice softer now. “I’ll see you soon.”  </p><p>The line went dead, and Rio lowered the phone, exhaling a slow, steadying breath. She glanced toward the greenhouse door and then moved forward.  She pushed open the door and walked into the warm, peaceful space, heading straight for the far back corner where the flowers were.  </p><p><em>That was his spot.</em> It always had been. She couldn’t count the number of times she’d found Nicky sitting there, cross-legged on the ground, lost in a book, or focused on his coloring.  </p><p>She remembered asking him once why he always sat in that same corner.  </p><p>
  <em>“I like the flowers best,” he’d said simply, his small voice so earnest it nearly undid her. “They make my heart happy when I see them.”  </em>
</p><p>She’d felt something crack open inside her at that, a tenderness so overwhelming it almost hurt.  </p><p>The very next day, she’d added a chair just for him—a cozy wicker that was big enough for him to lay on if he wanted.  </p><p>It became their routine after that. Most nights ended the same way—Rio tending to the plants, and Nicky curled up in his chair with a book propped on his knees and Señor Scratchy nestled in his lap. It was always Rio’s favorite part of her day, the one that had come to mean more to her than she could ever put into words.  </p><p>As she reached the back corner, Rio’s chest tightened.   </p><p>There he was, sitting cross-legged on the in his chair, with Señor Scratchy nestled comfortably in his lap. The greenhouse, as Agatha liked to playfully remind Rio, was just as much Señor Scratchy’s territory as it was hers. That rabbit was a royal pain in Rio’s ass. He had a knack for eating her plants, knocking them over, and shitting everywhere.  </p><p>But for all the chaos he caused, Señor Scratchy was loved—by Nicky, of course, and even by Agatha, though she’d never admit it out loud. The rabbit had become an emotional support animal for all of them, and right now, he was earning his keep in spades.  </p><p>Nicky’s small hands moved steadily over Señor Scratchy’s fur, petting him with gentle, repetitive strokes. It wasn’t much, but Rio could already see the tension easing from his shoulders. </p><p>She stopped a few feet away and waited for him to notice her.  </p><p>After a moment, Nicky looked up, his blue eyes meeting Rio’s. They were still red-rimmed from crying, and his face was streaked with the remnants of tears, but there was something softer there now, something a little less heavy.  </p><p>Rio smiled tentatively.  </p><p>“Hey, buddy,” she said softly. “Mind if I sit with you?”  </p><p>He hesitated for a second, his gaze dropping back to Señor Scratchy, who twitched his nose and shifted slightly in Nicky’s lap. Finally, Nicky gave a small nod, patting the space next to him.  </p><p>Rio lowered herself next to him, the chair large enough to accommodate both of them. She didn’t say anything at first, just watched as he continued to pet his rabbit. It gave her a moment to gather her thoughts, to figure out how to approach this.  </p><p>After a beat, she broke the silence.   </p><p>“You know, Señor Scratchy’s been pretty well-behaved today,” she said lightly. “Haven’t caught him knocking over a single plant.”  </p><p>Nicky’s lips twitched, the tiniest hint of a smile.   </p><p>“He only does that when you’re not looking,” he said quietly, his voice still small but steady.  </p><p>Rio chuckled softly.   </p><p>“That checks out,” she said. “Smart little guy.”  </p><p>Rio stayed quiet, giving him the space he needed. She kept her eyes on him, watching the way his little hands smoothed over Señor Scratchy’s fur in careful, rhythmic strokes.  </p><p>When he finally spoke, his voice was so soft she had to lean in to hear.  </p><p>“I’m sorry for running—and for not telling you what was wrong.”  </p><p>The words hit her with a mix of relief and heartache.   </p><p>“Oh, buddy,” Rio said, her voice low and warm, careful not to let her emotions spill over. “You don’t have to apologize for feeling things, okay? It’s not easy to talk about things that bother us. I get it.”  </p><p>Nicky looked up at her, his big blue eyes a swirl of emotions.  </p><p>“But I didn’t want you to think I was mad at you. I’m not. I just… I didn’t know how to say it. Mama helped me find my words.”  </p><p>He paused, and Rio held her breath, sensing that something big was coming.  </p><p>“You married my mom, right?” he asked, his voice tentative.  </p><p>Rio smiled softly, her chest tightening with a mix of nerves. </p><p>“Yes,” she said, nodding. “Two months ago. Remember? We got pizza afterward. Your favorite—pepperoni and pineapple.”  </p><p>She followed that up by wrinkling her nose in disgust.  Nicky and Agatha were well aware of her stance that fruit did not belong on pizza.    </p><p>That earned a small smile from him.  But then he hesitated again, fidgeting with Señor Scratchy’s ears as if trying to find the courage to keep going.  </p><p>“Kids in my class… and the lady at the front office… they called you my stepmom. Is that what you are now?”  </p><p>The question hung between them, so simple on the surface but carrying so much weight. Rio took a slow breath, her heart pounding as she considered her words.  </p><p>“Well,” she began, keeping her voice calm even as her heart felt like it was going to burst in her chest, “that’s one way to describe it. But how I see it? I’m just someone who loves you and your mom more than anything. And I’m here for you, always. Whatever you want to call me, that’s up to you.”  </p><p>She let the words sit, watching him carefully, her heart in her throat as she waited for his response.  </p><p>Nicky looked down at Señor Scratchy again, his small hands stroking the rabbit’s fur as he spoke, his voice quiet.  </p><p>“You take really good care of me,” he said, glancing back up at her. “You cook for me, and you read me bedtime stories. You watch movies with me.  You help me do my homework…” His lips quirked into a small smile, one that tugged at Rio’s heart. “You do everything Mom does.”  </p><p>He hesitated for just a moment, and then his next words came out firm, leaving no room for doubt.  </p><p>“And I think that makes you my mom—not my stepmom.”  </p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, and she felt the sting of tears threatening to spill. Her chest ached, but in the best possible way, her heart so full it felt like it might burst.  </p><p>“But I already call Mom, <em>‘Mom,’</em>” Nicky added, scrunching his nose the way he always did when he was deep in thought. Then he looked up at her, his eyes bright with a new idea.   </p><p>“What’s the Spanish word for Mom?” he asked, his voice bubbling with excitement.</p><p>And <em>damn.</em> Rio wasn’t ready for the wave of emotion that hit her like a truck. Her throat tightened, and she blinked quickly, fighting back the tears threatening to spill.</p><p>“I—” Her voice cracked, as a new, but familiar ache settled in her chest. “I used to call my mom…<em>amá</em>,” she whispered, the word soft, like a secret she hadn’t said out loud in years.</p><p>Nicky’s excitement faltered, replaced by a cautious look as he studied her, his voice quieter now.</p><p>“Would it make you sad if I called you that?” he asked, unsure but hopeful.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, the lump in her throat making it difficult to speak. She took a deep breath, her voice trembling but steady enough.</p><p>“I think it would make me really happy,” she said softly, a small, bittersweet smile tugging at her lips. “I think it would make my <em>amá</em> really happy too.”</p><p>Her chest tightened at the thought, but the warmth in Nicky’s eyes eased some of the ache. He grinned, wide and bright, and Rio couldn’t help but smile back, even as her emotions threatened to spill over.</p><p>“<em>Amá</em>,” Nicky said, testing the word carefully, like it was something special. Then he said it again, this time with more confidence, his grin widening.  </p><p>“Perfect,” Rio said, her smile widening. “You’ve got it.”  </p><p>Nicky grinned proudly, his whole face lighting up.   </p><p>“It sounds nice,” he said, nodding to himself before leaning his head against Rio’s arm, cuddling into her side.</p><p>“I like it,” he added quietly, his voice soft and full of meaning.  </p><p>Rio’s chest felt like it might burst. She couldn’t hold back anymore—she put her arm around him and pulled him close, holding him tightly. She pressed a kiss to the top of his head as a few tears finally slipped free.  </p><p>“I like it too,<em> mijo,"</em> she said softly, her voice trembling with emotion.  </p><p>Rio held Nicky close, his small weight warm against her side. As she pressed another kiss to the top of his head, her heart felt like it was overflowing. She couldn’t stop thinking about how this—this moment,<em> this life</em>—was something Agatha had given her.  </p><p>From the moment Agatha walked into her life, she’d been giving Rio things she didn’t even realize she wanted. First, a relationship. Then, a marriage. And now… <em>motherhood.</em>  </p><p>Of course, she had always been ready to be there for Nicky, to act like a parent when he needed her. But this? This was different. Being embraced as his <em>amá</em>—hearing him claim her like that—it felt like stepping into a role she hadn’t dared to dream of, let alone hope for.   </p><p>And it was because of Agatha.   </p><p>Rio knew that from the bottom of her soul.  </p><p>Nicky was Agatha’s everything, her whole world. For her to share him like this—<em>for her to trust Rio with something so precious</em>—it said more than words ever could.  </p><p>It said Agatha loved her.   </p><p>Really, <em>truly </em>loved her.  </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>It amazed Rio how her entire life had hinged on a single moment—a seemingly small decision that quietly shifted everything before she even realized it. It all traced back to the day she interviewed at the public defender’s office, fresh out of law school, convinced it was where she’d start her career and make her mark in New York.</p><p>She could still remember the interview, how they had casually asked for her opinion on an active case, like it was just another question.</p><p>Rio could picture it vividly: the weight of the file in her hands, the way she skimmed through it quickly, piecing things together, and then delivered her thoughts with the kind of confidence she hadn’t entirely felt but had managed to project. That moment—so ordinary on the surface—was where it all began.</p><p>Because what she didn’t know at the time was that Lilia Calderu was visiting her husband—the man who ran the office—had walked by at that exact moment she gave her answer.</p><p>She heard Rio, paused, and by the time Rio finished speaking, Lilia had already decided—Rio was coming to work for her firm.</p><p>And then, while at Lilia’s firm, she managed to get assigned a single case changed everything.  It just didn’t launch Rio’s career but reshaped her entire life. She didn’t just become one of the top associates at the firm—she ended up dating, and eventually marrying, one of its partners. And not just any partner. Agatha Harkness, arguably the best corporate lawyer in the city—maybe even the entire country. Not that her ego needed the boost.</p><p>Suddenly, everything shifted again. Rio was living in a $10 million home on the Upper East Side, with a $50,000 emerald ring sparkling on her finger. She drove a $100,000 Mercedes to work every day, and at night, she came home to a son who called her <em>Amá</em> and the woman of her dreams waiting for her in bed.</p><p>And just when Rio thought life couldn’t possibly get better, another moment came along—one she never saw coming.</p><p>Gwen—one of Rio’s coworkers on maternity leave and someone she actually liked—brought her baby to the office to show him off. When the baby started fussing, somehow, Rio ended up holding him. He quieted instantly in her arms, as if soothed by magics Rio wasn't even aware she had, just as Agatha walked by the conference room.</p><p>Agatha nearly tripped over her own feet at the sight.</p><p>That same night, Agatha had whispered—not quite to Rio, but almost to the universe—that seeing her with a baby made her think she might want another one.</p><p>Rio, completely caught off guard, hadn’t thought Agatha would ever want another child. But what surprised her even more was the fact that she wasn’t entirely terrified by the idea.</p><p>And that thought turned into late-night conversations, which turned into appointments, procedures, and far too many strangers getting an up-close and personal view of her vagina. And now, nearly three years after that chance encounter with Lilia Calderu, Rio was sitting in a hospital bed, gripping the rails like her life depended on it, feeling like she was being split in half. </p><p>Their future daughter—who, much like her other mother, had decided to make her grand entrance with all the subtlety of the Kool-Aid Man—was barreling into Rio’s life at full speed, leaving no time for pain meds. </p><p>An hour later—after unleashing a torrent of curses at Agatha in both English and Spanish (who, to her credit, took it all in stride)—Veda Marie Vidal-Harkness came screaming into the world.  As soon as Veda was placed on Rio’s chest, and that first cry filled the room, Rio’s entire world shifted. It was as if the very axis of her existence had tilted, realigning itself around this tiny, perfect being. Nothing would ever be the same—and she didn’t want it to be. </p><p>Rio became dimly aware of Agatha hovering over her, pressing soft kisses to her head and whispering words that barely broke through the haze of exhaustion and emotion.  </p><p>“You did so good, <em>mi amor</em>,” Agatha murmured, her voice steady but thick with awe. “Look what you made. She’s beautiful.” </p><p>And Rio—<em>honestly?  </em></p><p>She was overstimulated.  Completely, utterly overwhelmed. Her body ached, her vagina throbbed with a pain she was pretty sure would haunt her forever, and her newborn daughter was screaming on her chest like she had a personal vendetta against the air itself. </p><p>And then there was Agatha, pressed close against her side, whispering all these incredibly rare, sweet, beautiful things that Rio loved to hear, but couldn’t even begin to process. </p><p>It was everything, all at once. Too much and yet perfect in a way that felt almost unreal. </p><p>Then Veda was taken away to be cleaned up and checked over, and Agatha went with her, leaving Rio alone in the hospital bed. The world that had been so loud just moments ago suddenly fell into a heavy, aching silence. Everything held its breath, waiting for the nurses to come back and tell her that her daughter was okay. That <em>everything</em> was okay. </p><p>And as Rio laid there, acutely aware that this was another moment—<em>a pivotal one.</em> The kind where a single word could send her life careening down a new path. She had never prayed harder for one specific outcome in her life. </p><p>And then, the quiet was broken. Agatha was walking back to the bed, their daughter bundled in a soft purple blanket she bought the moment she found out they were having a girl, her face lit up with a smile that spoke louder than words ever could. </p><p>Rio’s heart clenched. She didn’t even need to ask. That smile told her everything she needed to know. Their daughter was healthy. The path ahead was clear. </p><p>Suddenly, the world came rushing back—noise, lights, everything pressing play again after an unbearable pause. Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha sat down on the edge of the bed, lifting her arms to show Rio their daughter, all cleaned up and impossibly tiny. </p><p>Her gaze caught first on the full head of dark hair, and Rio couldn’t help but laugh softly, tears welling up again. But when Veda’s eyes fluttered open, Rio sucked in a sharp breath. She’d secretly hoped for blue eyes like Agatha’s and Nicky’s—the donor had blue eyes, after all—but instead, she found herself staring into impossibly dark brown ones. </p><p><em>Her</em> eyes. </p><p>Something deep in Rio’s chest shifted, tightening and softening all at once, leaving her breathless. </p><p>“Ten fingers, ten toes,” Agatha murmured, her voice filled with quiet reverence. “Seven pounds, three ounces, nineteen inches long. Lungs and heart sound great.” Agatha’s gaze flicked to Rio, her smile softer now. “She’s perfect.” </p><p>And in that moment, Rio believed it with every fiber of her being. </p><p>They both just stared at Veda for a long, quiet moment, taking her in—the softness of her tiny features, the rise and fall of her breath, the little noises she made. Then Rio heard a sniffle. She glanced up to see Agatha wiping at her cheek, tears streaming down her face even as she smiled. </p><p>Agatha caught her gaze and smiled even wider—and Rio’s heart clenched, hammering in her chest, because she had never seen Agatha look as beautiful as she did in that moment. Tears streaked her face, her eyes bright with joy, their daughter cradled protectively in her arms. </p><p>“I love you, Rio. I love you so fucking much,” Agatha all but choked out, her voice trembling—not from hesitation, but from the sheer weight of the emotion threatening to collapse it entirely. </p><p>Rio’s chest gave a happy, aching lurch, her own smile breaking through the tears she could no longer hold back. They spilled freely now, warm trails down her cheeks as her heart overflowed. </p><p>“Language, small ears,” Rio said with a teasing smile, her voice wobbly with emotion. </p><p>Agatha let out a laugh—a mix of a sob and a chuckle—as her shoulders trembled. She glanced down at Veda, her hand lingering to trace a finger gently along the baby’s surprisingly chubby cheeks before carefully passing her over to Rio. </p><p>“She’s already heard me say a lot worse,” Agatha admitted with a soft grin, her eyes warm and full of love as she looked back at Rio. </p><p>Rio laughed at that, a watery sound, because it was true. <em>So very true.</em> </p><p>They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, the weight of <em>everything</em> settling in around them, when a soft knock broke through the quiet. </p><p>Both Rio and Agatha looked up as Jen poked her head into the room, her expression caught between amusement and exasperation. </p><p>“He is going to self-combust if I don’t let him in,” Jen said with a grin. </p><p>From behind her, a familiar voice piped up, loud and insistent.</p><p>“Aunt Jen, let me in! I want to see my sister!” </p><p>Rio chuckled, and Agatha let out a long-suffering sigh, but both of them nodded. Jen opened the door, and Nicky practically bolted into the room, his excitement radiating off him. </p><p>“Easy,” Agatha said immediately, her tone firm but gentle. </p><p>Nicky froze in his tracks, his wide blue eyes taking in the sight before him. His gaze landed on Rio in the hospital bed, and then slowly shifted down to her arms. </p><p>Rio watched as he processed it, his little nose scrunching up for a moment in thought before he stepped forward hesitantly. Agatha reached out, grabbing him gently and grunting as she hoisted him into her lap, positioning him so he could get a better look. </p><p>Nicky’s eyes went impossibly wide as he stared at the tiny bundle in Rio’s arms. He gasped, a sound of pure awe. </p><p>“We have the same hair,” he said softly, his small fingers brushing at his own dark curls. </p><p>Agatha chuckled, her smile warm and full of pride. Rio’s own smile grew as she nodded at him. </p><p>“Come here, <em>mijo,</em>” Rio said softly, motioning for him to crawl into the open space beside her. </p><p>With Agatha’s guidance, Nicky climbed onto the bed and settled in next to Rio, his movements slow and careful. </p><p>Rio glanced up at Agatha, their eyes meeting for a brief moment. Fresh tears gathered as they shared a look before turning their attention back to Nicky. </p><p>“Hold your arms out, buddy,” Rio said gently. “You have to be really careful.” </p><p>Nicky’s eyes widened with a mix of awe and determination as he held his arms out, his little hands trembling slightly. Agatha steadied him, her hands gently putting them into position, as Rio carefully placed Veda into his waiting arms. </p><p>“This is your sister,” Rio said softly, adjusting Veda so she was cradled securely against him. “Her name is Veda.” </p><p>Nicky stared down at her, his face lighting up with wonder, his expression so tender it made Rio’s chest ache. </p><p>“Hi, Veda,” he whispered, his voice reverent and soft. “I’m your big brother.  You can call me Nicky.” </p><p>And just like that, Rio lost the battle against her tears. They spilled over silently, her heart overflowing as she watched her son meet his sister for the first time. </p><p>Nicky noticed almost immediately.  </p><p>“<em>Amá</em>, you’re crying,” he said, his tone suddenly worried as he looked up at her. </p><p>Rio smiled through her tears, glancing at Agatha, who was watching her with equal tenderness, before turning her gaze back to Nicky. </p><p>“Happy tears, <em>mijo,</em>” she said, her voice thick with emotion. “They’re happy tears.” </p><p>Nicky’s smile widened, the worry on his little face fading as his shoulders relaxed. He turned his focus back to Veda, as if nothing else in the world mattered but her. His gaze was so full of love it made Rio’s chest ache. </p><p>She felt Agatha’s hands slide into her hair, her fingers moving gently, playing with it in the way she knew Rio loved. That familiar motion sent a wave of calm washing over her, and Rio leaned into it, letting herself melt into the moment. </p><p>Her eyes moved over the three of them, taking them in. </p><p>Agatha, the woman who had built a life for them brick by brick, and loved Rio so fiercely that she could feel it in every breath she took. </p><p>Nicky, the boy who chose her to be his mom, who had given her a love she never expected but couldn’t imagine living without. </p><p>And Veda, her daughter—so small, so perfect, a piece of her heart she never knew was missing until now. </p><p>Her family.  </p><p><em>Her everything.</em> </p><p>Rio’s chest tightened as she thought about it. All the moments that had led to this—every twist of fate, every leap, every choice. Each one had brought her here, to this hospital bed, surrounded by the people she loved most in the world. </p><p>She thought about everything still to come—the moments waiting for them out there in the unknown. The joys and the challenges, the hard days and the beautiful ones. Life with Agatha Harkness had never been easy, never predictable, and certainly never boring. Their future? It would be just as messy and unpredictable as the journey that had brought them to this moment. </p><p>But as Rio looked at her family—Agatha at her side, Nicky holding Veda with a love so pure it stole her breath—she knew one thing with absolute certainty. </p><p>Whatever came next, they’d face it together. </p><p>And Rio couldn’t wait. </p>
