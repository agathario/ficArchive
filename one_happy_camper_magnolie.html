<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><strong>One Happy Camper</strong></p><p align="center"><strong>PART ONE - Chapter 1</strong></p><p> </p><p>Trees and bushes rush by her window in an uninterrupted sequence of green. It is the most boring thing she has seen in over a year. Her headphones are blasting <em>Britney </em>from her iPod Nano. It's so loud her mother keeps turning around to look at her only to scrunch her nose in annoyance. Agatha rolls her eyes at it and looks back at the green hell in front of her. She hates these family trips. Every summer, like clockwork, six adults (her mom’s brothers and their wives, plus her own parents) and a gaggle of cousins descend on the same remote cabin or lakeside rental. They’re all obsessed with who catches the most fish for dinner or empties the most beer cans in the shortest frame of time. Agatha, meanwhile, would rather be anywhere else - preferably somewhere with Wi-Fi and zero mosquitoes. This year, she’s packed extra bug spray and exactly zero enthusiasm.</p><p> </p><p>“I need you to be on your best behavior. I don't want Willy's new girlfriend to think we're all as insane as you”, her mother spits while they take a quick toilet break about fifty miles away from the cabin campground, “and tune down the gay as far as you can, I don't want Vicky's girl to feel uncomfortable with you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Vicky's girl?” Agatha frowns and stuff the rest of her Mars into her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Wilbur's new girlfriend, do you even listen to me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not if I can avoid it,” she mumbles and her mother shakes her head.</p><p> </p><p>“She's bringing her daughter, she's about your age and I don't want any complaints, are we understood, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever”, Agatha rolls her eyes and gets up, seeing her father walk back towards them, “can we go now?”</p><p> </p><p>It's another hour until they reach the small campsite near Wilson Lake. It's the same boring place they always go to for one of the longer summer weekends. Her parents like it because after breakfast the men leave to fish and then women all gossip while sunbathing on the shore.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha had been little, she had liked it enough. As the only girl cousin, the boys usually left her alone to play in the water close to where her mother and aunts were sitting. As she got older, they accepted her into their group until she got old enough to figure out boys were generally gross, annoying, and most often downright disgusting to her. So the past years she had usually stayed in her solo cabin to read or do sudokus. When that had gotten too boring, she had started annoying her mother until the weekend was finally over.</p><p> </p><p>Driving past the sign now, Agatha cranks up the music one more time, warranting a slap on the leg from her mother just before they park.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha does nothing to make herself useful. She sits on the trunk and watches her dad unload it while her mother greets her aunt Tammy with that nerve-rackingly high-pitched voice that is entirely fake and stupid. She can see both of her sons already carrying fishing gear down to the pier. Their redneck sunglasses sit tight on their noses when they each lift and arm to greet Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>She can see her father talking to her but simply gestures to her headphones as an excuse to why she can't hear him. In the distance, another car and the two people standing next to it catch her eye. They are both looking her way: an unfamiliar woman and a girl about Agatha's age. </p><p> </p><p>“Take the headphones off now!” Her mother orders, pulling on the cable, while she waves at the two of them “and be nice!”</p><p> </p><p>Rolling her eyes yet again, Agatha stuffs the headphones and MP3 player into her backpack while her mother greets them with a slightly more toned-down version of her ‘friendly’ voice, giving both of them a hug.</p><p> </p><p>“It's so good Wilbur is bringing you, uh- you're gonna love it here!”</p><p> </p><p>While her mother chirps away, Agatha lets her gaze wander from Victoria (who is about her parent's age, tall, a little darker, with black hair and lots of silver jewelry) to who seems to be her daughter. To her surprise, she is already staring back at Agatha with big, brown eyes, chewing on her lower lip, fingers clutching the hem of her leopard-print miniskirt like it’s the only thing keeping her grounded. Her skin tone doesn't help to hide the faint blush on her cheeks. When Agatha finally shakes her hand it is cold with sweat.</p><p> </p><p>“Uhm… I'm R-Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha begins to grin, slow and deliberate, like a cat who’s just spotted a mouse with a limp. That girl is into her, isn’t she?. The wide eyes, the nervous lip-biting, the way she clutches her skirt like it might shield her from whatever was happening inside her chest. Crush at first sight. Oh, the poor thing has no clue what’s hit her. Agatha could’ve told from a mile away. She knows that look, half awe, half panic, like someone realizing they’ve bitten off more than they can chew. <em>Oh, this is going to be so, so good.</em></p><p> </p><p>“Agatha is a year older than you, so we thought it would be nice for you two to share a cabin!” Her mother explains, still annoyingly cheery.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh mom, I thought I could just stay with you?” She stammers and Agatha watches her closely as her glance flicks back and forth between her and her mother.</p><p> </p><p>“The cabins are a little small for three,<em> mi amor</em>,” she looks at her apologetically.</p><p> </p><p>“But mom-”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh don't you worry,” Agatha interrupts her, “we're gonna have so much fun! I promise!” She reaches out and squeezes her arm just above her elbow and watches her jump from it.</p><p> </p><p>If this is already enough to set her off, Agatha knows she is in for a fun weekend. </p><p> </p><p>Her pink duffle bag over her shoulder, she leads both Rio and her mother up the path to the cabins. They sit staggered and in a big semi circle around a large gazebo and a fire pit. In between them, large pine trees stretch up into the sky. Their scent fills every bit of air. The cabins themselves are nothing special. Left of the entrance, two twin beds sit side by side. Right behind them three stairs lead into a slightly elevated area that has two couches and a table in between them, as well as a small fridge and a sink.</p><p> </p><p>“There's only cold water though”, Agatha explains, letting herself fall onto the first of the two beds.</p><p> </p><p>She watches as Rio chews her lip again, remaining in the entryway, seemingly contemplating whether this is the sleeping situation she had envisioned for the trip.</p><p> </p><p>From the outside, someone shouts Vicky's name and she turns around, waving from the door frame. She kisses her daughter on the temple before she runs towards them, leaving Agatha and Rio alone in their cabin.</p><p> </p><p>“So what do you do?”</p><p> </p><p>“I-Im uh… well, I'm in school.”</p><p> </p><p>“For what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Science.”</p><p> </p><p>“What kind of science?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uhm… it's a mortuary science program.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raises her eyebrows and grins again.</p><p> </p><p>“So you'll be an undertaker?”</p><p> </p><p>“They call it <em>funeral director </em>these days”, Rio twirls one of her black strands of hair like an adorable school girl, the other arm protectively in front of her body, “and you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Physical therapy,” she casually muses, looking at her nails, “I just wanna make people feel good, you know?”</p><p> </p><p>A blush spreads on Rio's cheeks once more as she nods, staring at the floor boards.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright,” Agatha gets up and bends over the bed, starting to push it towards the other, “let's push them together!”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, what?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bites her lip so her devious smile doesn't show when she turns her head back at Rio, just about observing how her eyes dart from Agatha's stretched out ass to her face.</p><p> </p><p>“It's just so much nicer! I do this every year. More space, plus it gets cold at night. This way we can cuddle together!”</p><p> </p><p>It's only a half lie. She does push the beds together every year to have more space, but this time is just so she can see the panicked look on Rio's face when the bed frames come together with a loud thud. The sound echoes through the room like a warning, sharp and deliberate, and Rio flinches just as she hoped.</p><p> </p><p>There is a general look of relief on Rio's face when they are called down to the gazebo. The four boys all smell like wet dogs, each of them a can of beer in hand when Agatha greets them all with a half hug and tries not to pull an appalled face. They head for the pier soon enough to get into two little boats to head out to fish, but not before they raid the little buffet the moms have put out, store-bought donuts, cupcakes and crackers with a spicy dip to keep them all somewhat full before dinner.</p><p> </p><p>Swimsuit already underneath, Agatha helps herself to one of the blankets they have brought, winks at Rio and makes for the shore to get some sun. She can see Victoria nudging her daughter and whispering something in her ear, but Rio only shakes her head and looks to the ground.</p><p> </p><p>Fair enough then, Agatha can give her a break. </p><p> </p><p>Her headphones on, she finds a sunny spot in the grass and flips through her iPod to find some late-summer beats. When she looks up, she sees the men getting into their boats. They are so loud, she can hear them over the music. Her cousin Billy, one of Wilbur's sons, waves at her and she waves back, only to realize it's not even aimed at her. A few steps to her right, Rio seems to have made up her mind and sits down on a towel she has laid out for herself. Several books in hand, she has the skirt still on, but now sports a grey bikini top. She waves at Billy before she sits down, carefully arranging the skirt over her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you wanna go for a swim?”Agatha offers, taking one of the headphones out.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh no I'm good, thank you”, Rio shakes her head..</p><p> </p><p><em>Alright then.</em></p><p> </p><p>Gripping onto the seams of her shirt, Agatha pulls it clean over her head, headphones falling off. When she gets up to take off her pants as well, she realizes that her intention has worked out. Rio is looking at her again. So instead of simply stepping out of her pants, she makes an innocent 90-degree turn, her ass now in Rio's direction, and bows down low, wiggling to get out of her jeans.</p><p> </p><p>“See ya!”, she smiles at Rio, now clutching her books to her core, before she makes for the water, knowing full well that if her red swimsuit is making her swimming instructors’ head turn, Rio has already lost the fight. Agatha does not turn around to her, but knowing she is looking makes her skin tingle and explode in goosebumps. The cold water is a welcome shock to her system.</p><p> </p><p>She swims out until she can't stand anymore. It's not far, but the distance allows her to spy on Rio, who runs her fingers through her hair before she looks into Agatha's direction once more only to immediately avert her eyes, staring at the open book that is now sitting in her lap.</p><p> </p><p>It becomes a theme.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha gets cold and emerges from the water, drops of it running down on her, Rio pretends she isn't interested at all, even though Agatha catches her staring when she dries herself up, leaving her hair fluffy and dripping onto Rio's book when she comes closer.</p><p> </p><p>“Aren't you bored?” She tries, honestly curious.</p><p> </p><p>“I have exams next week,” Rio doesn't look up, her glance is fixed on the letters.</p><p> </p><p>“You know we can do some other stuff?” Agatha suggests with a voice sweet as honey, scrunching down to look Rio straight in the eyes. The way she looks back is nothing short of adorable, mouth slightly agape, not a single thought in her brain. Or far too many. <em>Who knows?</em> Agatha puts a cold finger on her sun-warmed arm, tracing an invisible line.</p><p> </p><p>“You had a fly there,” she murmurs, “I think my mom brought a boccia set, wanna play?”</p><p> </p><p>It takes a second for Rio to react.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, uhm, no I'm really okay,” her hand comes up between them almost as if it creates a line of defense as she brushes a strand of hair behind her ear. If she was Agatha's type at all, Agatha would almost find it attractive. </p><p> </p><p>“Too bad,” she winks and goes back to her blanket to enjoy the feeling of the warm rays of sun drying her skin. Cuddled into her towel, she dozes off soon enough, listening to the quiet ripple of the lake and the sound of the leaves on the trees.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha wakes up again, Rio is no longer in her spot. In the hazy distance, she can see the boats returning to shore as the sun makes the waves glitter. Packing up her things, Agatha walks past the gazebo where Rio and the other women seem to be playing a board game. She comes closer to take a peek, standing right between Rio and her mother. It's colder in the shade. She shivers and pulls the towel tighter around herself shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha you're gonna drip on the board,” her mother grumbles and Agatha steps aside, her hips grazing Rio's arm, making her flinch. She looks up to Agatha, then further down. When Agatha follows her glance, she sees that her nipples have hardened underneath her swimsuit and are now clearly visible. A sly smile forms on her lips as she briefly taps one of her hands on Rio's shoulder before leaning down to whisper into her ear, knowing her eyes are still fixed to Agatha's chest.</p><p> </p><p>“I'll quickly go change and shower, just knock if you wanna come up to the cabin.”</p><p> </p><p>Without another look, she walks off feigning ignorance to whether Rio is still looking at her. </p><p> </p><p>Freshly showered, her hair all fluffed up, she walks back down to where a fire has been started about an hour later. The men are back, already gutting the fish and putting them onto the grill along with burger patties and buttered corn cobs. She gives her father a brief hug, her over-sized sweater longer than the shorts she is wearing. </p><p> </p><p>They eat as it gets darker. Agatha listens to the boring fishing stories and gets annoyed when Rio (who sits at the other end of the table) seems to be much more invested in them than her. She sticks to the burgers, watching her mother pull copious amounts of fish bones out of the catch. </p><p> </p><p>After dinner, her uncles re-arrange the benches and chairs around the fire and prepare sticks for marshmallows. She sits down in between two of her cousins and jokes around with them, poking them with her marshmallow stick until her mother scolds her again and she finally holds it over the fire. There is almost something meditative about it, the way the flames lick at the white cube of sugar. She hears her aunt Tammy complain about the smoky smell and how all of her clothes will reek of it in the morning, but Agatha doesn't mind much. She has always liked the scent of burnt things. </p><p> </p><p>“I think that's about done,” Billy comments on it, pulling Agatha out of her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you're right!” She takes it out of the flames and squishes it to see the white mass run out from under the skin. She gently blows on it, letting her eyes wander until they find Rio's face. </p><p> </p><p>She is looking at her again, both hands around her stick, her marshmallow already browning. Agatha wets her lips and pulls the cooling marshmallow skin off the stick, bringing it to her lips. As her tongue darts out again, she looks over to where Rio is staring at her, eyes now wide. She flutters her eyelashes as she begins to eat, chewing on the crispy fondant, then gathering the rest of the marshmallow into her fingers, sucking the sticky substance off of them one by one. She releases each digit with a low pop, then lets her tongue graze over her upper lip where she knows some of the remnants still sit.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh Em Gee, so yummy uncle Fred, thanks for bringing them”, she chimes, never looking away from Rio's deep red face for even just a second. She revels in it, feels how it makes her tense her upper body in pride, her shoulders going back and her chest out. Her nipples grow stiff again as they rub against the inside of her sweater. Somewhere in her belly, she feels a soft tingling.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio be careful, your marshmallow!” </p><p> </p><p>Her uncle Wilbur pulls the stick in Rio's hand away from the flames and blows on the pitch-black candy.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh I'm so sorry!” She apologizes, hastily brushing hair behind her ear again.</p><p> </p><p>“You gotta pay more attention to it”, Rio's mother laughs and helps her daughter to a new stick and marshmallow while Agatha grins at them and starts roasting a new one herself.</p><p> </p><p>The night drags on like that. It's the same every year, at some point her father gets his old guitar out and begins playing music and the more beer people have, the more they join in to sing. There is no chance she will admit it, but it's nice enough as long as her mother is tipsy enough to be amicable. </p><p> </p><p>It's already past midnight when most of the parents leave the group one by one. When Victoria gets up to head back to the cabins, Rio clings to her like a limpet. Agatha follows them at a distance so Rio doesn't notice her until she is already three steps up to their cabin door, letting Agatha walk past her to switch on the light.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets herself fall down on the bed, fumbling for the zipper of her hot-pants while Rio closes the screen door. When she turns around, Agatha is already in her underwear.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing?” she asks, panicking in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m just changing, duh,” Agatha scoffs condescendingly, and makes a point to pull her sweater over her head more slowly than usual, baring her breasts.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio mumbles and turns around, walking to the other side of the now pushed-together bed. She doesn’t say another word, also getting ready for bed until Agatha crawls beneath the blanket. Rio has already switched off her night light, her comforter pulled all the way up to her chin, her back facing Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Just come cuddle if you get cold,” Agatha whispers and scoots a bit closer until she also turns around and turns off the bedside lamp.</p><p> </p><p>The night is quiet enough. At some point her half-awake brain registers that the rest of her cousins are returning to their cabins, stumbling through the undergrowth with little respect to the rest of them. But then that’s about it. </p><p> </p><p>The morning sun wakes her up just past eight, shining through the sheer curtains. Her first glance goes to Rio, who seemingly hasn’t moved all through the night and still sleeps on the very edge of her bed. For a moment, Agatha contemplates spooning her to get a rise out of her, but then she decides to give her a break and instead makes for the campsite showers again to wash off the smoke and nightly sweat.</p><p> </p><p>She fingers herself in the hot steam until she comes with a light, disappointing gasp. She’s had better. Agatha considers it her personal curse that the orgasms she gives herself in solitude are usually never as good as the ones she gets when she rubs one off laying next to another girl. Or having one sit on her face for that matter. Scoffing, she wraps herself into a towel and walks to the back room that has a few benches and a little kid-sized tub. She clips her toenails and applies sunscreen to her legs and arms, wondering whether she should ask her father about going on a quick hike to fight the boredom before he likely heads off to fish. She is so deep in thought, she only notices someone else has walked into the showers when the warm steam comes in through the half open door. She pays it little mind, finishes up and then gathers her things before she walks back through the showers and into the changing room.</p><p> </p><p>Only the sight before her makes her pause.</p><p> </p><p>She glances into the running three-walled shower to see who’s inside, and finds Rio with her forehead resting against her left underarm, pressed against the white tiles. The hot water pours down her body, Agatha knows that because she watches it run over her sun-fucked skin, all the way down where she is gratifying herself with quick strokes up and down her… <em>well</em>, her massive dick. Lightly panting, she has her eyes closed, her black hair sticking to her face. Agatha watches in reverence as her hand becomes quicker, the sounds of her palm against the erect flesh loud enough to hear despite the shower. Rio’s face contorts as tiny, needy sounds come out of her mouth and she presses her eyelids even closer together and pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>It takes thirty more seconds until thick spurts of white cum shoot into her hand and against the shower walls. A silent <em>‘fuck’</em> escapes her, before lets out a deep groan and keeps pumping, smearing her cum against the tip of her cock. Still twitching, it has not finished leaking fresh semen. Agatha watches it drip off of her, gathering on the floor before it is flushed down the drain.</p><p> </p><p>“Wow, I guess someone needed a good wank, huh?” Agatha giggles snippily and bites her lower lip, watching as Rio’s eyes fly open in shock, her fist still wrapped around herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha-”</p><p> </p><p>“No worries, your secret’s safe with me”, she winks, blows her a kiss, and simply walks off, a surge of unfamiliar power and arousal pulsing through her veins. She wraps the towel together around herself before she exits into the cold morning air, heading back down to where their cabin is. It doesn't take long for her to hear steps behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait! Agatha, wait!” She hears Rio's high voice behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Out of pure mercy she turns around.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm?”</p><p> </p><p>“A-are you really not gonna tell everyone? I'm really sorry, I thought I was alone!”</p><p> </p><p>“No, why would I?” She shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her with big eyes, “and you don't have questions? I mean about…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulls her sunglasses out of her wash bag, puts them on and grins widely.</p><p> </p><p>“What is there to ask, Rio? Sometimes the cutest girls have the biggest cocks.”</p><p><br/><br/></p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello campers! Are you ready for our second round? 🤭<br/>Writing this has actually turned out to be quiet therapeutic for me. I never got to try myself out a lot at that age because I was raised in a very conservative household where sex was generally talked about as something bad. Kinda excited these two get to be nasty like that with each other hehe</p></blockquote>

<p align="center"><strong>PART ONE - Chapter 2</strong></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>“Y-you think I'm cute?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins. Of course that's what she takes away from the conversation.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, you're adorable… like a little pet.”</p><p> </p><p>The tiny smile vanishes from Rio's lips.</p><p> </p><p>“You should get dressed”, Agatha motions towards Rio's towel.</p><p> </p><p>“Uhm and it's really alright?”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop asking or I'll tell my mom”, Agatha rolls her eyes and continues walking down to their cabin. She doesn't stop until she is back inside and can lean against the closed door. Only then does she let out a long breath she didn't remember holding.</p><p> </p><p>How on God's green earth does someone so slim and short end up with such a massive dick?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blows raspberry, one of her strands of hair flying up from where it had been in her face. It doesn't matter. In fact it makes it even better. Because now she knows she can get visual confirmation of her little badinages hitting where they are supposed to. Namely right between Rio's legs.</p><p> </p><p>While she gets dressed, she remembers the way Rio had sat on the beach, her miniskirt over her thighs, book in her lap, perfectly hiding… <em>oh my god she had gotten a boner from Agatha undressing hadn't she?</em> Agatha giggles into her fist, putting on another pink sweater and white hot-pants.</p><p> </p><p>The adults have already assembled at the gazebo. Her father is frying eggs and bacon on the griddle while Vicky cuts up tomatoes and cucumbers - the healthiest camping breakfast she has ever seen - sipping coffee from a corny camping mug. </p><p> </p><p>“Good morning, Agatha”, she smiles warmly,” is Rio up?”</p><p> </p><p>“I think she went to take a shower”, Agatha shrugs and helps herself to a bottle of apple juice. Vicky nods and then looks up the path where Rio is stumbling into camp, both hands in the pockets of her jeans. She avoids looking at Agatha and sits down right next to her mother, whispering something in Spanish and putting a piece of cucumber into her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Only when they begin cleaning up again does Agatha get a chance to speak to her alone.</p><p> </p><p>“It's so nice and warm again I was gonna go swimming. Do you wanna come?”</p><p> </p><p>“I can't, I don't want any of the others to see.”</p><p> </p><p>“They’ll all be gone. Put on some swimming trunks under a skirt and take it off just before you hop in.”</p><p> </p><p>“And when I come back out?</p><p> </p><p>“I can go first and get you a towel”, Agatha suggests.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her long and hard.</p><p> </p><p>“Is this a trap?”</p><p> </p><p>“What? No! What kind of person do you think I am? I'm not gonna pull your pants down in front of everyone if that's what you're thinking!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns around, worries someone might have heard. Nobody is paying attention though.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay… okay!” she nods and Agatha grins, gently nudging her against her arm.</p><p> </p><p>When they both change up at the cabin, Agatha risks another look. Rio is turned away, but Agatha can still get a glimpse at it when she trades her panties for her swimming trunks. It’s so long she can see it hanging down between her legs. It swings lightly when Rio wiggles her cute little ass to pull up her swim shorts. She has to re-adjust it when she's got them on, fumbling with it in her shorts until Agatha guesses it sits right.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn't bother looking away when Rio notices her glance. </p><p> </p><p>Her cheeks go pink again, “would you mind!?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickers and puts only her sweater back on, walking down to the lake in her bikini bottoms. It takes Rio a second to feel confident enough that no one is watching until she takes off her dress, revealing the same bikini top from yesterday and loose swim shorts. Agatha lets her go in first, silently huffing at how long it takes her to wade into the cold water. Rio tiptoes forward like the lake might bite, gasping with each step. With a mischievous grin, Agatha dives in beside her, sending a spray of icy water all over her. The shriek that follows echoes across the shoreline, chased by laughter and ripples.</p><p> </p><p>“Should we maybe stay where we can still stand?” Rio asks with a shaky voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh c'mon now, that's no fun!” Agatha complains and swims ahead. When she looks back, she finally sees Rio follow her.</p><p> </p><p>They swim out towards a small island in the middle of the lake, Rio trailing closely behind Agatha. The sun high in the sky, the lake's surface water is so much warmer than the layers underneath. It feels nice when it mixes along Agatha’s skin, almost like a soft embrace. From the island, she can hear birds chirping.</p><p> </p><p>“See? Did I overpromise?” Agatha laughs and keeps threading water with her legs to stay afloat. </p><p> </p><p>“H-how deep is it, do you think?” Rio stammers, looking down to where her feet are visible and flapping through the water. </p><p> </p><p>“I think I read the deepest point is 40 feet!”</p><p> </p><p>“40 feet!?” She gulps and Agatha grins with half her mouth, looking over to the shore where she can see her mother, Aunt Tammy, and Vicky setting up chairs near the pier. All of a sudden, she hears a loud splash next to her.</p><p> </p><p>“OH MY GOD something touched my leg!” Rio yelps, reaching for Agatha's arm below the surface. Agatha is about to console her, when all of a sudden, Rio yelps again <em>(her leg probably brushing some kelp or whatever plant that is growing on the bottom)</em> and she pulls herself flush against Agatha's body, her groin pressed into Agatha's upper thigh. One of her arms comes around Agatha's shoulders, her legs go around Agatha's waist until she almost piggybacks her. </p><p> </p><p>Threading the water even faster now to stay afloat, Agatha grins again, enjoying the way Rio's length feels against her skin. She'd lie if she said she didn't like her like this, clinging to her all needy and scared.</p><p> </p><p>“It's just some plant!” Agatha belittles her, but puts one of her hands on Rio's thigh to hold her in place, so she doesn't sink.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think there are fish in here that attack humans?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh for Christ's sake, Rio! how would I know? I've never seen one apart from the ones the boys catch, and those are tiny!” </p><p> </p><p>It stays quiet between them for a moment. On the lake's surface, calm waves ripple against Agatha's skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we go back again?” Rio whispers into her ear, her forehead pressed against Agatha’s temple.</p><p> </p><p>“We've barely been out.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know but….”</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t swim back alone?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her in agony. With the biggest puppy eyes Agatha has ever seen.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, fine”, Agatha rolls her eyes, “but you have to let go of me first, im not gonna tow you back.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio does it, but Agatha can't help but notice the reluctance.</p><p> </p><p>When they arrive on shore, Agatha makes good on her promise and gets out first, walking past the women to get a towel for Rio. Dripping into the sand, she spreads it out right in front of her, wrapping her right in. Rio looks up to her, a pink shade on the top of her cheeks just below her eyes again, when she feels Agatha's hands on her body through the towel. As for Agatha - she keeps a straight face ignoring the lump that forms in her throat until she lets go of Rio, sure that she has a hold of the towel, and scratches her face, nodding and stepping aside.</p><p> </p><p>Quietly, Rio walks over to her mother who spreads her arms around her and gives her a kiss on the head. It dawns on Agatha that Rio has likely told her about her crush, but probably also about Agatha knowing about the... well. </p><p> </p><p>“Couldn't you have worn the black swimsuit we got you?” Her own mother muses, handing her a small towel, “not everyone needs to see your chest out Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Literally not your decision to make, mother”, Agatha bites back, watching her mother exhale in annoyance.</p><p> </p><p>“I-I'm going up to the cabin to take a nap”, Rio states.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t wait up”, Agatha shrugs and Rio nods, turning around to walk away.</p><p> </p><p>She gets a can of mango-flavored beer from her Aunt Tammy and reluctantly knocks it against her mother's. </p><p> </p><p>She sips on it as she sits on her towel in the sand, looking out onto the surface of the lake, soft waves glittering in the midday sun. Absentmindedly, she lets her fingers dance over the spot on her skin where she had felt Rio’s length pressed against her. </p><p> </p><p>Two cans of vaguely inebriating beer later she has about enough of her mother’s unhinged stories about celebrities she may or may not have seen shopping at their local Peoria Walmart. Gathering all of her belongings, she heads back up to the cabin to look for one of her sudoku booklets. When she opens the door, she sees that Rio is still on her nap, turned away from her on the other side of the bed. She takes off her swimwear before she slips under the covers in a pair of white panties and an oversized sleepshirt. Reaching into her duffle bag next to the bed, she finds the puzzle book and begins solving a blank sudoku. With the sun shining in through the windows, filling the cabin with a cozy, yellow light, Agatha barely notices how her heartbeat weakens, and her eyes flutter shut before she slips into a deep and dreamless slumber.</p><p> </p><p>The sunlight has turned all orange when she slowly comes to again. The air is stuffy, and Agatha can smell her own sweat from under her armpits. The pen is still between her fingers, but the booklet has fallen from her hand and onto the ground. Her mouth is so dry the first thing she does is reach for her water bottle to rehydrate. She gently sits up for it and looks over to where Rio is still sleeping while she drinks. In her sleep, she has turned onto her back, starfishing on her side of the bed. Her head is still turned away, but her right arm is stretched out towards Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>And something else is stretched out as well.</p><p> </p><p>There is a clearly visible tent in Rio’s pink boxer shorts that say <em>adidas</em> in bright red letters down the side. Agatha stares at it before it dawns on her that it does not have to be the <em>morning</em> for someone to get <em>morning wood</em>. She swallows hard, saliva gathering in her mouth. Oh, poor Rio: dead to the world while the cheekiest of her organs is clearly wide awake, practically begging for attention.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha quietly crawls over to her side of the bed, careful not to wake her. She can barely see its outline under the flappy shorts, just that they have begun to strain, the cotton fabric bow-taut over her member. Had it been the same this morning only Agatha hadn't realized? Or had Rio decided to get herself off when she had already been in the shower?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's fingers massage the sheets in her hands, subconsciously suppressing the urge to run a finger along the entire length of Rio's erection. Outside she can hear the boys yell for one another in the distance. As she turns to the window in a reflex to see whether anyone is coming towards the cabin, the bed creaks and Agatha feels something stirring beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Drowsily, Rio looks at Agatha first, then down her body where her pants are tented. Suddenly, she is awake and alert.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god”, she reaches for the blanket, probably to pull it over herself, but Agatha doesn't let her “w-what are you doing?” she stammers with a whiny voice, “Agatha whu-”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you dream about something nice?” Agatha interrupts her in the sweetest, naughtiest voice she can muster. All that’s missing is her putting a finger to her lips, batting her eyelashes.</p><p> </p><p>“N-no I-I didn't dream about anything!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods to the bulge in Rio's pants, “are you sure?” she purrs “bet you dreamed about someone getting you off, mhm?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don't… don't say things like that…”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because it- Agatha-”</p><p> </p><p>Below Rio's stomach, Agatha sees her cock twitch.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, you greedy little thing,” Agatha bites her lip, “this is turning you on, isn't it?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't answer. Her face is pink, her eyes teary, and her lips dry as sand.</p><p> </p><p>“You little perv.”</p><p> </p><p>Another twitch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha repositions herself once more until she sits next to Rio's hips. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to rub you off?” She whispers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's eyes grow even bigger. She opens and closes her mouth, but no sounds come out. It's a tiny nod and then another one that brings a wide grin to Agatha's lips. Carefully, she lets her fingertips glide over the growing erection in Rio's shorts, before she wraps her whole hand around it, slowly stroking it through the fabric. </p><p> </p><p>It is warm and half hard, quickly reacting to her touch. Under her care, it slowly becomes stiff. What Agatha has so far not paid any attention to though, is how girthy and grippy it is next to its length.</p><p> </p><p>It keeps twitching under her touch and so does Rio, a suppressed mewl leaving her lips. Agatha looks at her face, her fingers still running up and down the entire length of Rio’s cock, and realizes Rio is staring at her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Tilting her head, Agatha watches how her face flinches, her lips falling open again just slightly. More tiny groans come out. In her hand, Agatha feels her throb, the fabric over the very tip of it turning dark and damp. Mesmerized by the view, she looks back to her hand having to make longer and longer strokes as it continues to still grow harder under her touch.</p><p> </p><p>“Does that make you feel good?” she whispers.</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm…” Rio presses out, nodding again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer, she just keeps on slowly dragging her hand up and down the pulsing shaft, watching Rio’s lips tremble. She knows it’s too little pressure and too little stimulation to make her come, but then it wouldn’t be any fun if she let her off the hook this easily.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you like it when a girl takes you into her hand?” she whispers.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh-”</p><p> </p><p>“Wraps her fingers all around your meat and squeezes it real good?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm y-yes,” she babbles.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you get the girls in your class to do that too?”</p><p> </p><p>“N-no…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stops.</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“I-I, well no I-I haven’t… you know…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth goes white with amazement. Biting her tongue, she keeps on squeezing and pulling on it, “you’re a little virgin!”</p><p> </p><p>“I just- I just haven’t really liked anyone before…”</p><p> </p><p>Red like a lobster, Rio’s glance bounces back and forth between Agatha and her own body.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm… that’s such a shame…” Agatha muses, “does that mean you want me to go on until you nut?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallows hard.</p><p> </p><p>“Admit it, you wanna come into my hand so bad.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mhmmmmm,” she whimpers, “Agatha I-”</p><p> </p><p>Stopping what she is doing, Agatha climbs over her with one swift movement, lowering her pussy until it sits just an inch over the straining fabric. From Rio’s perspective, there is a huge, dark splotch on the gusset of Agatha’s panties.</p><p> </p><p>“How about I rub it with my pussy?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio only whimpers.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh the poor little virgin can’t even talk anymore,” she looks straight into her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Then, carefully, Agatha lowers herself onto Rio’s groin without a sound. Hovering on her hands and knees, she whips back and forth, agonizingly slowly dragging her folds over the entire length.</p><p> </p><p>Next to her, Rio digs her nails into the bed sheet.</p><p> </p><p>“So I take it, you've never had it in a girl’s pussy then? All warm wrapped around you? Does it even fit?”</p><p> </p><p>“I-I don’t know, no I-I’ve never,” she bites her lip and squeezes her eyes shut.</p><p> </p><p>“But you’ve wanted to, didn’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, mhhm, yes I-”</p><p> </p><p>“You wanted to be inside <em>my</em> pussy from the moment you saw me in the car park,” Agatha grins like a cat that watches a mouse wander into her trap. She ignores the way her blood feels hotter than usual, rushing through her extremities.</p><p> </p><p>“How did you-” Rio’s voice is panicked.</p><p> </p><p>“The way you looked at me?” she pants lightly, still moving her body up and down, adding some weight so Rio can feel it, “the way you have been looking at me.”</p><p> </p><p>The look on Rio’s face is priceless. Like she has been caught with her hand in the cookie jar. </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly it dawns on Agatha, “you were thinking of me when you were fucking your hand in the shower this morning!”</p><p> </p><p>“N-NO I WASN’T!” Rio blurts out but Agatha sees through the lie.</p><p> </p><p>“What were we doing?” she whispers, dragging herself up Rio’s shaft especially slowly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio puts her face in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>“You-you uhm, you were…. You had me in your… in your mouth!”</p><p> </p><p>And all too suddenly that actually sounds admittedly hot to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“So you’d like me to suck you off?”</p><p> </p><p>“NO! It was- it was just a fantasy!”</p><p> </p><p>“So no fucking my mouth then?” Agatha feigns the disappointment a little too well.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not what I-” Rio is interrupted by a whimper again.</p><p> </p><p>Underneath her cunt, Agatha can feel her twitch again. She reckons Rio is getting close. And as much as she wants to see what it looks like letting Rio cream her pants, this is too easy. </p><p> </p><p>“Too bad!” She lifts herself off of Rio and rolls to the side and back onto her mattress, “shoulda said yes and I’d have blown you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wh-what?” Rio’s voice is so high-pitched it might go ultrasonic. She looks down to Agatha’s wet panties.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>“But I-”</p><p> </p><p>“Go take a cold shower or something”, Agatha laughs, not even hiding her own arousal, “worked well enough this morning!”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so mean!”</p><p> </p><p>“No, you’re just needy”, Agatha gets up and casually exchanges her sleep shirt with a dress, skipping a bra, “but who knows! If you’re so keen on it I might let you eat me out some time!”, she winks and is out the door in a second.</p><p> </p><p>She loses no time to run down to the lake shore, filling her lungs with fresh air. She runs a hand through her hair, picking up the pace. She still feels the prickling between her legs <em>(it’s so strong she needs to pull on her panties to make them sit differently) </em>when she reaches the water and walks on, the gravel crunching underneath her shoes. There is something to this - having Rio wrapped around her little finger, holding all the power. It’s intoxicating.</p><p> </p><p>She still thinks about it when it is time for dinner, and she has circuited the lake. Arriving at the pier, she busies herself helping her cousins unload the boats, anything to keep her mind from wandering at this point. She feigns interest as they proudly display their catches, nodding with theatrical enthusiasm as she tosses out exaggerated remarks like, <em>“Oh my gosh,” “Wow… so huge,”</em> and <em>“Good for you for getting that”</em>. Her voice is bright, but her eyes drift, unfocused, toward the trees.</p><p> </p><p>Rio comes back down together with her mother, clinging to her arm until they sit down at the table. Agatha makes a point of sitting opposite her, even if that means she has to sit between her cousins. Rio only looks at her with her head bowed, nibbling on some breadsticks. She doesn’t say a word to her all throughout dinner. It riles Agatha up so much she lets her sandal slip from her foot and makes Rio flinch by running it up between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you have a nice afternoon, Agatha?” her mother asks when she notices something going on.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, napped and then took a walk around the lake”, she nods and bites a chunk off a hamburger her father has served her.</p><p> </p><p>“And the sleeping arrangement is working for you two?” Rio’s mother chimes in, smiling warmly. So even if Rio has told her about Agatha, she’s probably not mentioned the naughty bits. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio snores a bit,” she nods, mouth still full.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a lie, you snore!" Rio alleges and a grin appears on Agatha’s face again. So someone was up longer last night than Agatha had thought.</p><p> </p><p>“If you say so”, she shrugs and Rio looks away again, moving a piece of cucumber around on her plate.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches her closely when they clean up. The others chatter around them, tossing scraps into bins and packing the utensils back up. She gets herself another can of flavored beer without bothering to check the flavor, cracks it open and downs it in a few determined gulps, the fizz hissing against the silence between them. The bonfire hasn’t even been lit yet, but the sky is already bruising with twilight.</p><p> </p><p>“A-Are we okay?” a small voice asks behind her unexpectedly.</p><p> </p><p>Turning around, she looks at Rio, nervously fumbling with her hands. Agatha raises an eyebrow at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Why wouldn’t we be?”</p><p> </p><p>“You…you left. Are you mad with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins and reaches for another can of beer. It’s truly adorable, the flustered look on Rio’s face, the way she brushes her hair behind her ears.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re good,” she says, popping it open and handing it to Rio. She takes one herself and repeats the process, chinking them before she leans in, whispering into Rio’s ear, “to you finally getting a girl to touch your gear.”</p><p> </p><p>She notices how Rio shivers. And really, for a moment Agatha wonders if she should just call it a day, whether she has made her suffer enough for tonight, but then Rio looks so cute sitting between the boys in her jeans shorts and white crop-top while Agatha is huddled into an old crochet blanket. Sipping on the beer can Agatha had handed her, she can see that Rio doesn’t like the taste of it. She is probably counting down the minutes until she can leave when Agatha notices how she puts both her hands on her upper arms rubbing them gently, the boys leaning over her, downright ignoring her to talk to each other.</p><p> </p><p>Without overthinking it, Agatha swiftly rises, circling behind the group so they can continue roasting their marshmallows undisturbed. As she squeezes past her cousin Henry, she offers a quick excuse, barely audible over the crackle of the fire. Then, without hesitation, she sits down in Rio’s lap and pulls the blanket around them both, cocooning them in.</p><p> </p><p>“Warmer?” she asks, looking down to her.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha what-”</p><p> </p><p>“Thought you were cold”, she wiggles and pulls her dress out from underneath her so that only Rio’s shorts and her panties separate them.</p><p> </p><p>“Mhmm-” Rio hums, scratching her neck uncomfortably.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to leave?” Agatha asks, raising an eyebrow to accompany the question that she already knows the answer to.</p><p> </p><p>“No”, Rio mumbles lowly, unsure where to put her arms.</p><p> </p><p>From the corner of her eye, Agatha can see her mother’s stare on her. She pays it no mind. Instead, she leans against Rio so that their breasts touch.</p><p> </p><p>“Could you giggle so my mother doesn't think I am making you uncomfortable?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio forces a grin and nods.</p><p> </p><p>“I bet you’d rather be alone with me right now”, Agatha whispers again, looking straight into her eyes, the chatter around them blurring in with the sounds of the fire. She shifts in Rio’s lap again and feels a bulge forming net to her ass.</p><p> </p><p>“Thought so.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I’d rather they don’t see…”, Rio murmurs, looking past her into the darkening forest.</p><p> </p><p>“So if we were alone, you’d <em>want</em> me to make you hard again?” Agatha moves again, invisible underneath the blanket.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re just gonna leave again when you’ve had your fun so-”</p><p> </p><p>“Who says I would?” She interrupts her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her with big eyes and Agatha giggles.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry but the face you’re making is so cute, I gotta hand that to you”, she winks.</p><p> </p><p>“So… you <em>do</em> think I’m cute?”</p><p> </p><p>It’s probably the bravest Rio has been all day, Agatha will give her that. Catching a glimpse at her family without turning her head, Agatha puts her right index and middle finger underneath Rio’s chin.</p><p> </p><p>“I love how you’re not giving up hope of me answering that question with a<em> ‘yes</em>’.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, but yet again, Agatha can see the sheen of red on her cheeks, Rio’s hard-on now firmly pressing against the side of her ass.</p><p>They sit like that, in quiet, for a while. At least the boys are no longer leaning over Rio like she is invisible. It gets nice and warm too. It’s always been a mystery to Agatha how people like an open fire when it doesn’t actually warm you up, but instead fries one side of your body while the other one freezes. Gently, she feels Rio’s arms come around her waist without any other part of her body moving. Agatha doesn’t look at her. Just lets herself feel them against her tummy.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t move until her father pulls out his guitar again and Uncle Fred starts pouring Captain Morgan into red plastic cups - cheap ones that look like one of his sons swiped them from a college frat party. Rolling her eyes, she looks down into Rio’s face again.</p><p> </p><p>“Imma go back to the cabin, do you want me to leave the blanket so… well”, she motions to Rio’s erection that still hasn’t gone down.</p><p> </p><p>“N-No I’m coming along if that’s okay…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugs, “sure”, and frees herself from the blanket so that Rio can wrap it around herself. She waves into the round, everyone <em>(even her inebriated mother)</em> cheerily wishing them a good night.</p><p> </p><p>The path ahead is dim, lit only by a few flickering lanterns strung between trees, their glow attracting swarms of flies and mosquitoes that frantically fight for a place in the light. The air is thick with the scent of pine. As they reach the bend and turn right to circle around the cabin toward its entrance, she suddenly hears Rio’s footsteps falter, then stop altogether. She pauses mid-step, heart ticking faster, and glances back, the shadows stretching long between them.</p><p> </p><p>“You coming?” Agatha asks over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m still hard,” Rio admits, and Agatha turns around, “I think I might need to get a shower.”</p><p> </p><p>Where Rio stands, the light is too faint for Agatha to properly see, but yeah, there is still a massive bulge in Rio’s hotpants. </p><p>Looking ahead and to the back wall of the cabin, Agatha blinks twice, astonished with her own creativity. She crosses the arms behind her back and walks towards Rio again.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been mean to you today.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowns.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me make up for it and let you get yourself off against my ass.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wh-what?” Rio blurts out.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll lean against the cabin, and you rub yourself against me,” Agatha raises a finger, “pants stay on! I don’t want a mess on my back; I’m not taking another shower today.”</p><p> </p><p>“C-can't we go inside at least?”</p><p> </p><p>“Now where would be the fun in that?” Agatha snickers and takes her by the wrist, dragging her to the cabin wall before she turns around, leaning both her hands against the wood, sticking her ass out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>“Hurry up, I don’t want the mosquitoes to eat me!” Agatha looks back at her and finally, Rio takes a step forward.</p><p> </p><p>It’s adorable, the way she clenches her fists, probably too shy to put her hands on Agatha’s hips.</p><p> </p><p>“Raise my dress,” Agatha suggests in a softer voice.</p><p> </p><p>“A-are you sure?”</p><p> </p><p>“Would I be leaning against the wall like this if I wasn’t?”</p><p> </p><p>She hears Rio swallow, then, a careful hand moves the fabric of Agatha’s dress up onto her back.</p><p> </p><p>“C-Can I touch you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah”, she nods and gives her a smile before she feels a soft hand on her right cheek, tenderly stroking the skin, making it erupt in goosebumps. She drags her fingers between them too, down to Agatha’s clit.</p><p> </p><p>“This isn’t about me,” she interrupts her, “put your hands on my hips, c’mon.”</p><p> </p><p>Sweet, obedient Rio does as she’s told, and two clammy hands come up to Agatha’s love handles before she feels the fabric of Rio’s jeans against her ass.</p><p> </p><p>“Now be a good girl and get yourself off, mhm?”</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Rio seems to have found enough self-esteem that she finally begins to move her groin, slowly rubbing her length against the crack of Agatha’s ass. She begins to whimper, pressing herself against Agatha’s body, small gasps that the nightly air carries to Agatha’s ears. She quickly learns how much she loves them.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s it, such a sweet girl, rutting against me so well”, Agatha encourages her, doing her best to meet Rio’s slow, but uncoordinated thrusts and grinds. It takes her a while to get accustomed to it, but when she finally finds her rhythm, Agatha feels her pressing harder, grinding faster.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that good, hm?”</p><p> </p><p>“Y-ah s-so good Agatha,” she squeaks, “y-you feel really, r-really good.”</p><p> </p><p>“I want you to come really good, okay? Do you wanna touch my tits?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stops for a moment, then leans forward until she is pressed flush against Agatha’s back, her hands coming up to cup Agatha’s breasts over the dress.</p><p> </p><p>“Attagirl, doing so well for her first time fooling around with someone”, Agatha murmurs. She ignores the feeling of her nipples hardening under Rio’s touch, ignores that her underwear is getting sticky, clinging to her clit, begging for attention. </p><p> </p><p>“Y-your breasts are… they are really soft,” she whimpers, burying her face in Agatha’s dress.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah? Do you like having your hands full with them while you fuck yourself against my ass?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmmmmhm”, Rio mewls again and Agatha feels her nodding against her back as she ruts on. Jerking her hips, desperate to find enough friction.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so fucking big, it holds quite a lot hm?” Agatha croaks, thinking of the white streaks of cum that Rio had squeezed out of herself earlier that day.</p><p> </p><p>“I-I don’t really know...”</p><p> </p><p>“It looked like so fucking much…”, Agatha babbles on, half her brain screaming at her that this is not about her, that this is not turning her on, that this is just a game.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thrusts become frantic again, unorganized and jerky. She brings one hand back to Agatha’s hip, rubbing her cock up and down the slit of Agatha’s ass, squeezing her cheeks together. Somewhere in the distance, Agatha still hears the rest of her family humming along to some country song. She squeezes her muscles, so they become harder and moves her ass up and down against Rio' erection.</p><p> </p><p>“Be my good girl and fill your pants up for me good, hm? Blow it all in there.”</p><p> </p><p>She hopes Rio is too busy with herself to notice how coarse Agatha’s voice has become. Her clit is not throbbing. Her pussy is not clenching. This is just a game.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>mhmmmyesokayIwill</em>,” Rio whines.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re doing so good Rio”, absentmindedly, she brings her right hand over Rio’s helping her to squeeze her breast. Her nipple is so hard it hurts.</p><p> </p><p>“A-Agatha I think I’m gonna, I’m gonna-”, she interrupts herself with a quiet shriek when Agatha reckons she comes. A second later, she feels it against her skin as well. Rio’s cock twitches as it pumps spurts of cum into her shorts, coating them in white from the inside. It doesn’t take long until she feels it seeping through as well. Rio’s moans and guttural but quiet. It’s cute how high her noises get. </p><p> </p><p>When they quietly subside, Agatha gently taps her arm and raises herself up, straightening her dress. She still feels the wet spot on her ass cheek and suppresses the urge to run her fingers over it. Awkwardly, Rio looks to the ground, pulling down the seams of her crop top.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh”, Agatha chuckles and links a finger into one of Rio’s belt loops to steady herself while she squats down. Rio steps back in shock, but Agatha doesn’t let her.</p><p> </p><p>“Stand still!” She orders and keeps her still, as she licks her lower lip. It’s hard to see in the shine of the closest lantern, but the fabric around the length of Rio’s cock is clearly dark and wet, soaked in her semen. But Agatha had anticipated that. What she had not anticipated are the thick streaks of milky cum running out of Rio’s shorts and down her thigh. They look like frosting on a drip-cake, plump and juicy.</p><p> </p><p>She fights the urge to lick them off.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><b>PART ONE - Chapter 3</b></p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>It’s still mostly dark when Agatha gently drifts back to consciousness, the edges of sleep clinging to her like cobwebs. The soft glow of her Blackberry screen tells her it’s not even seven. She squints at it, then lets it fall back onto the nightstand with a sigh. Outside, the first birds are beginning to stir, their quiet chirps threading through the morning mist like a lullaby in reverse.</p><p> </p><p>Next to her, Rio is sound asleep on her stomach. Her left hand covers Agatha's right breast, the nipple stiff between her index and middle finger. Rubbing her thighs together, Agatha feels that her folds are wet, sticking together like two fingers coated in honey. They feel thick and swollen, tingling underneath her sleep shorts. </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, she considers just getting herself off like this, with Rio still asleep half on top of her. She can be quiet. And judging from the state of herself, it wouldn't take very long either.</p><p> </p><p>But then they are supposed to have all of their things packed up by eleven. If she remembers correctly, her Uncle Wilbur lives somewhere past Milwaukee, so they will want to head out on time. And it also means she won't see Rio for the remainder of the year. </p><p> </p><p>Which really makes this her last chance to rile her up once more, doesn't it?</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” she carefully pulls on Rio's arm, “hey you little pervy groper wake up!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio mumbles something in her sleep.</p><p> </p><p>“There is no fumbling my tits for free, duh!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio's head jolts up and Agatha grins widely.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh no, I'm so sorry!” Rio squeaks the moment she realizes where her hand had been. She shuffles off of Agatha and back to her side of the bed. It takes her a second to become fully alert, but then her eyes go big as tennis balls.</p><p> </p><p>Propped up against her pillow, Agatha has one hand in her shorts, working herself up against her hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Whu-what are you doing?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her, biting her lower lip.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, have you ever seen a swollen pussy?” she moans.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't answer. She just stares, face red as a lobster again, eyes fixed on the moving hand in Agatha's pants. When Agatha gasps, she swallows.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you like to see one?” She murmurs and finally, Rio nods.</p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Agatha gets up to her knees, pulling her hand back out. It glistens with arousal and Rio's eyes are immediately drawn to it. Agatha hooks her thumbs under the waistband of her pants and slowly pushes them down to her knees, slipping out of them and dropping them by the foot of the bed, looking at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“She's all wet and warm…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpers.</p><p> </p><p>“Here's what's gonna happen”, Agatha lets her left hand wander down again, “I'm gonna fuck myself on my fingers until I come and you can watch”, she lets her index finger glide between her folds, “but you can't touch me”, she gasps over her own pleasure, “and you can't touch yourself either.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? No! Agatha, that's not fair!”</p><p> </p><p>“You should feel lucky I let you little virgin watch at all”, Agatha counters, sneaking her other hand over her breast, squeezing her nipple.</p><p> </p><p>“But last night we-”</p><p> </p><p>“Awww you think because a pretty girl lets you rub your cock against her ass you're no longer a virgin?” Agatha pouts sarcastically. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, we had sex last night, r-right?”</p><p> </p><p>It almost looks like Rio has tears in her eyes. And well, if Agatha was any more gracious she would probably say yes, coming so hard it runs out of your pants probably counts as <em>sex</em>… but Agatha isn't gracious.</p><p> </p><p>“You're so cute”, Agatha chuckles, biting her lip again as she feels herself dripping onto her finger, “but you're a virgin until you've had your dick inside a pussy, everything else is just <em>fooling around</em>, sorry, I don't make the rules.”</p><p> </p><p>“B-but..”</p><p> </p><p>“Dont worry, you'll get there,” Agatha murmurs then lets out a long moan, closing her eyes and slowly dragging her shirt up so far her naked breasts are visible, her nipples both hard and protruding.</p><p> </p><p>The only reaction from Rio is a suppressed whine.</p><p> </p><p>Grinning, Agatha dips two fingers inside herself, letting her hair fall back over her shoulders until she feels it against her ass.</p><p> </p><p>“Mhmm”, she moans theatrically, “uh, it's so good.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wh-what are you thinking about?” Rio whispers.</p><p> </p><p>“You would like it if I said it was your massive cock, huh? And what it would feel like stretching me out?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmhm”, Rio mewls.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha opens her eyes, she can see that a bulge has formed again in Rio's pink shorts.</p><p> </p><p>“Does it swing when you walk?” Agatha whispers and spreads her fingers so far it almost hurts.</p><p> </p><p>“S-sometimes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you ever wear shorts that are so short it peaks out?”</p><p> </p><p>“N-no… I'm not supposed to anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>“I'd wanna see that so bad…” Agatha sighs, working herself up, syrupy arousal coating her fingers, “you, walking around and suddenly the tip of your dick peaks out of your shorts”.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm… okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Fingers all lubed up, Agatha pulls them out again and begins massaging her clit, taking the plump and engorged flesh between her thumb and index finger. She sighs with pleasure. </p><p> </p><p>“A-agatha you… you're dripping…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio's voice is breathless, her glance fixed on the thin streaks of pre-cum running down Agatha's left thigh. Dragging her fingers off her clit, a thin thread of it forms that quickly rips, drops of it landing on the sheet.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah… I do that sometimes when I am really horny…”</p><p> </p><p>“S-sometimes? L-like that happens very often?” Rio stammers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckles and continues massaging the tiny, protruding knob of nerve endings that always gives her goosebumps. Groaning, she looks at Rio through half-hooded eyes. Her nails have dug themselves into the sheet. It has become so taut Agatha wonders if it might rip. She keeps staring at the outline of Rio's twitching erection.</p><p> </p><p>“If you had a condom I'd fucking ride you right now”, she croaks before her mind can catch up to it. Rio reacts with a low whine, looking about ready to hump the mattress instead, looking for any kind of friction.</p><p> </p><p>“I-I…”</p><p> </p><p>“Have you ever gotten to use one?” Agatha looks here straight in the eyes, riding against her own hand.</p><p> </p><p>“I-I tried it once”, Rio looks down, scratching the backside of her neck, “I- uhm I think it was the wrong size, I, well I couldn't get it on…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stops for a second then remembers the girth of it, imagining poor Rio in a narrow Walgreens aisle, looking for the proper condom size and then unsuccessfully trying to get it over her swollen cock that’s too long and thick for it. It makes her cunt twitch and a fresh gush of liquid seeps onto her fingers. It tells her she is close. And she gets even closer when she sees Rio finally rutting against the mattress and she permits it… because it looks so fucking obscene, both her cock and nipples hard for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>It's another whine coming from Rio's throat that sends her over the edge. Her lashes flutter and her eyes roll upwards. Spasms roll though her body, all the way into her toes. If this is what it feels like getting herself off to Rio - what does it feel like clenching around her? She groans as she rubs herself through it and Rio flinches, staring at her in awe. Her eyes are glassy, filled with reverence as if Agatha was some kind of goddess she is worshipping. She lets her head fall backwards, the stuttering in her folds slowly subsiding.</p><p> </p><p>There go her plans of sending Rio home throbbing and unspent. </p><p> </p><p>She hears her whimper once more and looks back at her. Her cheeks are boiling with heat, her knuckles whiter than the sheets she is holding onto.</p><p> </p><p>“Say ‘please, Agatha'.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please, Agatha. Let me come on your tits.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gulps.</p><p> </p><p>“P-please, Agatha. Can I come on your tits?”</p><p> </p><p>“Good girl”, Agatha grins and languidly lets herself fall back against the pillow.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, confused. “W-wait you-you meant that?”</p><p> </p><p>“I can't let you walk through camp like that. I'm not a monster”, she pads her stomach with her left hand, “take your pants off and c'mon up here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinks before her brain seems to process the words properly, “o-okay”.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches closely as she carefully slips out of her pants, her erection springing free. It's the first time she's getting a decent look at it. Three protruding veins wrap themselves around it and it bobs when Rio moves. Agatha has to clench her fists in order not to reach for it.</p><p> </p><p>The sunlight slowly peaking through the window curtains, leaving illuminated stripes on the bed and her body, Rio climbs on top of her, sitting over her hips bones. When Agatha sees the drop of pre-cum on the tip of her cock, she absentmindedly licks her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“It's so big like this…”, Agatha mumbles and sees it twitch to her words before she realizes Rio is wrapped too tight around her little finger she is probably waiting for permission to touch herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you wanna be a good little pet for me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmhm”, Rio murmurs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reaches for her right hand, gathering saliva in her mouth. She looks up at Rio when she spits it into her hand, lubing it up.</p><p> </p><p>“Go fuck it onto my tits then.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio's hand is on her dick faster than Agatha comprehends. She massages it with long, tight strokes, making it even harder in her hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Look at me”, Agatha orders, “you're doing so good, pretty girl. You're so hard and big for me like this”, she whispers, listening to the incoherent mumblings coming from Rio's mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“You like to be praised like this, huh? When someone tells you you're being all lovely and well-behaved.”</p><p> </p><p>Rip nods frantically and Agatha gives her the sweetest smile.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you like better, the praise or the demeaning?” Agatha leans her head on her right shoulder “poor little virgin Rio all hard and pathetic for the first girl that gives her attention.”</p><p> </p><p>It's barely audible, but Agatha hears it nevertheless: the slight increase in pitch and volume.</p><p> </p><p>“So it’s the humiliation then, huh? Do you like it when I tell you how  awful you are? How easy and slutty? You just needed one girl to be nice to youand look at you now… so obedient and well-behaved.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mhhhm, Agatha I-”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Huh? All out of words now? Does it feel good looking at my tits while you jack off? Knowing that that's where your nut is gonna go?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>yesyesyes-fuckthisissogood</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets one of her fingers dance over Rio's thigh and draws small circles with her nail. Wherever she goes, she leaves a trail of faint goose bumps.</p><p> </p><p>“Be a good little pet and cream my tits.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha isn't sure if it is the word pet or the general order that does it. But by the end of her sentence, Rio’ milky white cum starts spurting out of her cock in thick, viscous streaks. The first few hit her chest, frost her nipples like buttercream on a cake. Rio stutters with it, and keeps pumping, milking herself onto Agatha's breasts. Just like under the shower, it keeps coming. Agatha feels like a drop of it lands over her chin, right below her mouth. She still continues watching in awe how Rio's face contorts in pleasure until she goes limp in her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Carefully, Agatha collects the cum on her face with her index finger, making sure Rio sees it. Taking it into her mouth, she tastes the saltiness and groans, feeling her cunt clench again.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha what-”, Rio mewls.</p><p> </p><p>“Well done, sweet girl”, Agatha grins, “coming so hard for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio's glance wanders down from Agatha's face to her breasts, looking at the mess she's made.</p><p> </p><p>“Take off your shirt and clean it up”, Agatha orders.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods quietly, pulling her top over her head, allowing Agatha a peek at her small but round breasts. She feels how Rio begins to wipe-up her cum, dragging the cotton over Agatha's nipples, but Agatha can't help but tear her eyes off of Rio’s chest. The urge to have all of Rio's cock inside of her while sucking on her tits becomes almost unbearable to manage. </p><p> </p><p>She could have her hard again in no time. Three tugs on that thing and it stands hard enough for Agatha to sit on it. But then she really doesn't feel the need to get pregnant today.</p><p> </p><p>So instead she lets Rio climb off of her and finishes herself off in the shower for a second time that morning. When she gets back to the cabin, Rio is nowhere to be seen, likely showering or already having breakfast. She packs up most of her things and takes the sheets off the bed, piling them in a corner hoping the cleaners won't pay attention to the stains. But then honestly, even if they do, she will be long gone.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio isn’t already at the gazebo, Agatha sits down next to her father. Her cousins all look like they’ve had about two hours of sleep and a gallon of beer each. Agatha wouldn’t know. Turns out getting someone to jerk off against your ass makes you sleep like a baby. She listens to them groan about a headache and watches Tammy and her mother pouring them lukewarm orange juice as if they have lost the ability to help themselves.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally comes to join them, the only free seat is next to Agatha. She hesitates, but finally sits down on her hands.</p><p> </p><p>“So did you two have a chance to get to know each other better?”, Rio’s mother asks, handing her daughter a bagel she has already slathered with cream cheese.</p><p> </p><p>“I dunno… we didn’t talk much”; Agatha shrugs and takes a sip of coffee.</p><p> </p><p>“I really hope Agatha wasn’t inappropriate with you”, her own mother reprimands and Agatha almost chokes on the coffee.</p><p> </p><p>“N-no she was really nice to me”, Rio nods, and takes a bite off her bagel without looking at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom, Rio isn’t even my type”, Agatha rolls her eyes, licking the coffee from her lips, knowing Rio is probably looking.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!”, her mother protests.</p><p> </p><p>“What? It’s the truth”, she shrugs and sees Victoria laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I’m glad you two got along so well,” Victoria says warmly. “If you ever want to visit us, just let me know - I’d love to have you. I bet Rio would like that too, wouldn’t you, Rio?”</p><p>Rio nearly chokes on her bagel.</p><p>“Oh my word, Mom!” she sputters between coughs.</p><p>Agatha snickers and nudges her with an elbow. “Relax. I don’t have to come if it’s such a horrifying idea.”</p><p>“That’s not what I-” Rio starts, but the moment she notices everyone’s eyes on her, she shrinks back and swallows the rest of her sentence, cheeks flushed.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t talk to her again until it is almost time to leave. Her duffle bag already loaded into the car, Agatha lays down on her blanket by the lake once more, waiting for her parents to pack up and check them out. Eyes closed, sun in her face, she only notices Rio when she feels her shade on her face.</p><p> </p><p>“I-I wanted to say good-bye,” she swallows hard and bites her lip.</p><p> </p><p>“Bye then!” Agatha chirps cheekily, leaving Rio to think that that’s all she’s gonna say, before she sits up.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s- uh been nice?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just nice? Rio, you hurt me”, she laughs, holding her chest as if someone has shot her.</p><p> </p><p>“Very nice…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiles.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not coming to visit you in Milwaukee just so you can lose your virginity.”</p><p> </p><p>“W-what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Go find someone to do that with, you’re a cute girl, you won’t have any issues I’m sure.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well but what if I… what if I would want it to be you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her long and hard.</p><p> </p><p>“Please don’t fall in love with me or something, that’s just gonna hurt you.”</p><p> </p><p>Originally, Agatha had planned to say that with a little more confidence. The way it rolls off her tongue is not as smooth. She hopes Rio doesn’t hear it.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not in love with you!”, Rio blurts out.</p><p> </p><p>“Good”, Agatha nods and gets up, seeing her parents coming back down to the gazebo. Rio picks a fallen leaf from her hoodie.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I hug you to say goodbye?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pouts as if she has to think about it.</p><p> </p><p>“No touching my ass though”, she opens her arms and Rio steps into her space, circling her waist with hers, “can’t send you back to your parents with a hard-on”, she adds with a chuckle and feels Rio respond in the same way. Her nose in Rio’s hair, she smells the pine trees off of her for the first time. Somehow her hair must have sucked the smell up over the weekend. Or perhaps Agatha has just not paid attention so far. The single strands tickle her face. On her back, she feels how Rio’s fingers dig into the fabric of her hoodie. It feels nice… to be <em>craved</em> like that. Nobody has to see that she closes her eyes for just a moment, the lake in front of her and the trees in her back.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t talk to her parents on the car ride home. Only when the battery on her iPod drains does she take her earphones off. Her mother notices immediately.</p><p> </p><p>“Such a nice girl, Vicky’s daughter, hm?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah”, Agatha answers, looking out of the window to see the pine trees pass her by.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p>Victoria Vidal cannot, under no circumstances know, that her daughter has a Facebook account.<br/>
She is a huge opponent of all things social media (or the internet, generally). She cares little that it makes it easier and cheaper to call her relatives in Puerto Rico, or that she can use it to look up the opening hours of  her favorite hairdresser online. It is and will always be a dangerous space that she would rather her daughter not participate in.</p><p> </p><p>But then Rio is old enough to make her own choices. She might still be living at home (and that does come with rules) but her phone is hers and hers alone. So whatever she does with it is up to her. And Rio would have rather kept that faceless account of hers a secret (she hasn’t even uploaded a profile picture) but then it’s hard to keep things private when one’s mother catches one wailing on one’s bed on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Over a <em>read</em> but unanswered message nonetheless.</p><p> </p><p>So as Rio soaks her mothers blouse with thick tears and snot, she eventually does find out about the secret account that really only exists for the purpose of reaching out to Agatha, with her hundreds of friends and two boys in her profile pictures that carry her on their shoulders on some beach somewhere far away.</p><p> </p><p>“Ay, mi amor. I can’t understand you if you keep sobbing like that, did somebody say something mean to you on that website?”</p><p> </p><p>“No mom,” Rio cries, “sh-she isn’t answering… sh-she read my messages but she isn’t answering.”</p><p> </p><p>Her mother caresses her back, strokes it gently.</p><p> </p><p>"Who now?"</p><p> </p><p>"A-Agatha."</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to write to her, we can call her any time, I have Evanora’s house phone number.”</p><p> </p><p>“NO! Mom I can’t, that’s not cool, she’s gonna think I’m just some loser!”</p><p> </p><p>“But she knows you’re not a loser, you two got along so well at the lake, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“W-well why isn’t she answering me then?” Rio’s words are still interrupted by snorts. It gets so bad she develops a hiccup.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe she is just busy, mi amor,” her mother hands her a pack of tissues.</p><p> </p><p>“I-I texted her a week ago, and then again today, mom. She wants nothing to do with me!"</p><p> </p><p>Her mother sighs, gently running her fingers over Rio’s shoulders as her daughter continues to cry over the girl she shared a cabin with for two nights. Her opinion will remain that social media is a cesspool in modern society.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha does not text back that Sunday, and neither the following week. Rio reaches out once more with a small, <em>hope you are doing alright</em>, but this time her message remains unread. She can still see all the pictures Agatha posts that week, and the silly messages random people leave on her profile. And she finds herself wanting an anonymous dislike button, so she can react to all the flirtatious emojis and lyrics random girls and boys leave for her. </p><p> </p><p>(Her mother suggests leaving one herself, but what does her mother know?)</p><p> </p><p>It takes another three weeks until she hears from Agatha. And it isn’t an answer to her previous texts. By then, the trees have all gone yellow and the first snowstorm of the year has colored the streets white for a night.</p><p> </p><p><em>Are u coming 2 that ski thing?</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio is in class, <em>Advanced Chemistry for Morticians</em>, when she sees the message pop up on her laptop while she is taking notes. It sits in the bottom right corner of the screen with an audacity Rio has issues to fully grasp. She still clicks on it before a second has passed.</p><p> </p><p><em>What ski thing?</em></p><p> </p><p>Five dots appear, signifying that Agatha is typing.</p><p> </p><p><em>That dad won. In CO.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio suddenly feels very stupid. But then Agatha adds something.</p><p> </p><p><em>Maybe talk to ur mom.</em></p><p> </p><p>Roo stares at words, then watches the grren dot next to Agatha's name turn gray, signifying that she has logged off. At least the chat shows that she doesn’t come online again for the remainder of Rio’s school day. And yes, Rio thinks about texting her once more, asking her how she is, but she is so afraid of not getting an answer yet again, that she leaves it.</p><p> </p><p>Her mom is kneeling on the floor, doing laundry when Rio gets home. She asks her about it immediately.</p><p> </p><p>“How do you know?” Her mom asks, and sounds somewhat disappointed. </p><p> </p><p>“Uhm… Agatha asked me about it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh are you still on that terrible app?” Victoria asks, sorting through Rio's underwear to the dismay of her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom! The trip?” she rips a red g-string from her hands. Her mom doesn't need to know she has those.</p><p> </p><p>“Ay Dios mio, Rio. It was supposed to be a surprise for you,” she sighs, “Willy’s brother won it. Something about the new car they bought, it was a… raffle?”</p><p> </p><p>“They won a ski trip in a raffle?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, a family trip.”</p><p> </p><p>"Who wins a ski trip in a raffle?”</p><p> </p><p>"Them apparently... must have been a fancy car I reckon."</p><p> </p><p>Rio thinks about the old Toyota her mother drives, before another coin drops. “And we’re all invited?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, just them and us. It's three rooms and we felt it made most sense to take you girls.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio's eyes go wide. “Wait, does that mean I have to share a room with Agatha again?” She points to herself.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you got along fine! Last month I had to comfort you because you missed her so much!”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah but-”, she doesn't know it of course but her face goes bright red.</p><p> </p><p>“Didn't you say she knows? Was she giving you a hard time about it?”</p><p> </p><p>Now of course Victoria Vidal doesn't understand the duality in that statement. But Rio's eyes blow wide at it, afraid that she has been caught, that her little secret has come out. Because yes, her mother knows that Agatha knows. But her mother doesn't know that Rio doesn't just <em>miss</em> Agatha but that she is madly in love with her. And her mother also doesn't know of the things Agatha would refer to as ‘fooling around’ rather than ‘having sex’. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio? Was Agatha picking on you?” Bless her. She looks so concerned.</p><p> </p><p>“No mom, she wasn't picking on me. She was very… nice to me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well then that sounds like we're gonna have a fun trip, won't we?”</p><p> </p><p>And really, apart from when they leave for their four days in Colorado, that's all that Rio is told. They possibly tell her more about the hotel and the snowboarding and skiing lessons and the amenities, but all Rio thinks of is that in less than a month she has to face Agatha again. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha, who has the prettiest nose she has ever seen.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, who is the last thing Rio thinks of before she falls asleep each night.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, who is the only person Rio ever thinks of when she wakes up hard and takes care of it in the shower.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, who won't properly text back in their Facebook messenger chat, and who specifically told her that she wasn't interested in anything that surpassed the weekend on the lake.</p><p> </p><p>How is she gonna share a room with her for four long days again? How is she even going to look her in the eye when she has probably been with a dozen other people since their last time together, that morning before leaving? </p><p> </p><p>Rio sobs into her pillow again that night, almost physically feeling the cracks in her heart. They physically hurt, because as much as she wants to see Agatha again, wants to bury her face in her hair at night when she is sleeping, it won't help the heartbreak, will it?</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, after sitting o the edge of her bed for a long while, she feels brave enough to text Agatha back, not expecting an answer.</p><p> </p><p><em>They told me last night, guess I’ll see you in Colorado?</em></p><p> </p><p>It takes Agatha exactly two minutes and thirty-three seconds to answer..</p><p> </p><p><em>Neat </em>💦</p><p> </p><p>That's it. That's all Rio gets. One word and an emoji she has only seen being used in one context. That’s what she’s left with, Agatha goes offline and Rio’s head spins. She looks at the message again when she opens up her laptop in class. The blue drops stare back at her, daunting like both a threat and a promise. What is she supposed to do with this? How does Agatha expect her to make sense of it - if there’s even any meaning at all? Maybe this is just Agatha’s way of messing with her. After all, they’ve barely spoken about anything that happened on the lake, except for Agatha insisting it had all been meaningless to her and that it was not going to happen again.</p><p> </p><p>And still. After class, Rio finds herself sitting in her local CVS parking lot, staring at the revolving doors. </p><p> </p><p>Because what if it does mean that Agatha is not averse to repeat it all? Or potentially even more. Rio feels both awful and excited at the thought. And maybe there is a little bit of shame too, regarding the level of her excitement. Because yes, the thought of feeling Agatha’s hand around her again, her breath against Rio’s ear, her voice whispering things that almost make Rio come untouched is intoxicating.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t have a lot of courage, but she’d rather embarrass herself now than regretting a missed opportunity later. So she locks her car and walks in, going straight to the aisle she has so far always walked through especially fast, only to realize she has no clue what she is looking for. And suddenly she wishes, she hadn’t always turned her mother down when she had offered to shop for condoms together. At least that potentially would have given her at least an idea of what to buy now.</p><p> </p><p>“You look a bit lost, honey. Can I help you somehow?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face turns bright red at the sound of the store attendant's voice right behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“I-I’m okay!”</p><p> </p><p>“Just let me know if you need any help.”</p><p> </p><p>And technically she does, Rio realizes. And now that she's here, she might as well ask, right?</p><p> </p><p>“How do you know what size you need?” she blurts out, swallowing hard. </p><p> </p><p>The woman just smiles, “oh your boyfriend can get these print-out measuring tapes-“</p><p> </p><p>“It’s about seven inches!” Rio interrupts her, unable to look her in the eye, “maybe a little less.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman smiles kindly. “I’d go for the Large ones then, if not Extra Large,” she nods, pointing to the size she’s referring to.</p><p> </p><p>“Th-thank you,” Rio stammers.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t reach for the boxes until the store attendant has disappeared into the next aisle again, but ends up getting both, just in case. Thankfully, the store has a single self check-out till, saving her from an additional interaction regarding her shopping.</p><p> </p><p>At home, she hides them in the depths of her wardrobe even before she takes off her shoes. She doesn’t need her mother asking about what she’s gotten herself from CVS. She briefly thinks about sending a picture of them to Agatha, but then remembers that she is too shy for that kind of stuff. Plus, she still isn’t sure about Agatha’s intentions anyway. </p><p> </p><p>So she sits it out - waiting for November 30th, the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. She checks the Facebook chat too often, only to be disappointed when there are no more texts from Agatha. They spend Thanksgiving with her mom's family. In the evening, she sees Agatha posting a mirror selfie of herself in a sleek black dress, pouting into the camera. Later that night, it makes her ruin her sheets when she comes after three pumps while looking at it.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn't get nervous about seeing Agatha again until the hills and mountains of Colorado appear behind the small airplane window, and the captain announces their descent. As Rio folds away her table, she feels her fingers tremble and swallows hard. Somewhere below, the Harknesses have already landed and are waiting for them to be picked up by a driver to bring them to their hotel. Somewhere below, the girl of her dreams is probably listening to music on her iPod, annoyed that she has to wait around for them. It makes her feel torn and ripped into three different directions: Her little heart has so many feelings inside of it, she fears it might burst on the next beat. Secondly, and for whatever cursed reason, Agatha has the ability to turn her on at any given moment, and by God - Rio wants her to (<em>so so bad</em>), but then what if she does something wrong? What if she embarrasses herself or someone catches her pining for Agatha? Or even worse, what if Agatha loses any and all interest in this and Rio has to go on living without her? She swallows hard at the thought.</p><p> </p><p>At the baggage carousel, Rio pretends not to see her suitcase until it’s circled around twice and her mother finally points it out. She lags behind her and Willy, dragging her feet until there’s no avoiding the Harknesses anymore. They’re already visible from a distance: Evanora in towering heels and a sleek black coat that screams money, Sebastian beside her, peering at his watch through those oversized glasses.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lounges on a bench, legs spread wide, her crop top riding up well past her belly button. Her skin is so pale it practically glows - Rio can spot it from yards away. She looks away, focusing instead on the slow roll of her pale green suitcase as she approaches the group. She stops beside her mother, who’s giving Evanora a tight hug, one of those loud, performative ones Rio knows too well. Her mother doesn’t actually like Evanora, but she always makes an effort. </p><p> </p><p>Rio however, chooses to stare down at her shoes, frozen in place. When she finally dares to look up, Agatha is grinning at her - so wide, so sharp, it’s as if she might turn into the Cheshire Cat if she isn’t careful. Rio feels her cheeks go hot in an instant.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi Rio,” she chimes and jumps up, hugging her with one arm, pressing her front to Rio’s. Rio doesn’t move. She doesn’t return the hug, she just tries to keep herself together. Finally, she manages to put her hand on Agatha's side as Agatha shifts, running her nose past Rio’s ear, her warm breath on Rio’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>“H-hi,” is all Rio manages to press out, her hand cramping as she yanks it away from Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“So good to see you again,” Agatha smiles viciously before she winks at her and Rio fights the urge to hide behind her mother.</p><p> </p><p>The drive up to the hotel isn't fun. It’s one of those vans that has singular seats on each side with a walkway in between. Of course the parents pile in first and make it all the way to the back so that Agatha and Rio take the front ones directly behind the driver. Agatha goes from full-on ignoring her to staring her down, scrutinizing her with innocent eyes without even so much as uttering a word. Rio endures it, folded hands wedged between her knees. She pretends to not notice and stares out of the window, watching the rough Colorado skyline pass her by as faint stars glimmer in the darkening firmament.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and her sit in the lobby in silence while the hotel staff greet the adults, taking pictures with the lucky raffle winners. In a mission to distract herself from Agatha’s bare belly, Rio takes special note of the window view: Mountain ranges stretch out before her, unmoving in the dark. The snow on their tops reflects the moonlight, making it glitter. </p><p> </p><p>She lets herself sink deeper into the soft armchair, erasing Agatha from her peripheral view for a moment. Of course Agatha notices and leans forward, smirking, before she gets up to walk over to the parents. It is then that Rio notices that the pants she is wearing have something written on them. It makes her mouth go dry. The sparkling word “<em>Naughty</em>” stretches in a soft semi-circle over both of Agatha's butt cheeks. Rio momentarily puts her jacket over her groin. Just in case. </p><p> </p><p>And it's probably a prudent decision, because she just can't look away. It's like her eyes are glued to Agatha's behind, rocking gently with every step she takes. She has never felt the need to have her face buried underneath someone. But that need is suddenly there, hot and sharp. She wonders if any amount of begging will get her there. Probably not.</p><p> </p><p>She deliberately walks ahead of Agatha after they’re handed their room keys, using the moment to put a little space between them before dinner. When Rio steps into the room, she exhales slowly: It’s got two separate beds. Because while a part of her aches to curl up beside Agatha again, to feel that quiet closeness before sleep, the more rational part of her knows better.</p><p> </p><p>“So, do you wanna push them together again like last time?” Rio doesn’t notice her stepping into her space but suddenly her breath is warm again on Rio’s cheek again.</p><p> </p><p>“I-I can sleep in my own bed!” She fights her off, stepping to the side.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh c’mon!” Agatha lets herself fall onto the mattress open-legged, “it was so much fun at the lake.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio just blinks at the sight, Agatha leaning back on the twin bed, legs still spread as if she is waiting for Rio to come closer. </p><p> </p><p>“Or are you too afraid of waking up hard again like some needy little virgin?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio almost winces, but at least her brain comes up with a suiting rebuttal, “y-you didn’t even reply to any of my texts! Why would I want to sleep in a bed with you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raises a brow, “yeah, I couldn’t let you think I’m easy.”</p><p> </p><p>“W-what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Like, had I answered you would have thought I’m easy to get… and I’m not!” She stresses.</p><p> </p><p>“B-but it made me think you didn’t like me at all!”</p><p> </p><p>“Never said that. Just that I don’t want you to fall in love with-“</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not in love with you!” Rio shouts, “I’ve been with lots of other girls since we met!”</p><p> </p><p>“Good!” Agatha shrugs, face not giving away what she is actually thinking about any of it, “then I see no reason why we can’t push the beds together?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gulps, but Agatha is already bending over to push the beds together, shoving the “<em>Naughty</em>” right into Rio’s face again. She has to physically remove herself from the room to ignore it. This is gonna be a long weekend, isn’t it? Specifically if she has to pretend that she is not harboring any soft feelings for Agatha at all. Or that she is, in fact, no longer a virgin. Because no matter how enticing it feels that she might get to be with Agatha again, the anticipation is nearly killing her. How come Agatha holds all the reigns in this? Well, probably because she doesn’t want it as much as Rio. If she can afford not to answer texts for weeks, she probably has girls and boys lined up left and right. Rio’s breath trembles. She doesn’t want to even think about Agatha being with anyone else. </p><p> </p><p>Deep in thought, she barely notices Agatha coming closer again. “So. How have you been?” Agatha suddenly stands behind her, arms crossed, leaning against the door.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine?” Rio lies, focusing on putting her things into the small bathroom cupboard. She doesn’t hear how Agatha closes the distance between them and doesn’t notice her perfume until she is right behind Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whips around, her elbow catching her cosmetic pouch, bringing it to a fall.</p><p> </p><p>It happens in slow motion. All the cosmetics she had neatly piled over the condoms - her lipstick, the dry-shampoo, her conditioner tumble out first, landing on the floor with loud thuds. When the pouch itself hits the tiles, all of the condoms scattered over the bathroom floor, perfect pink and black squares (a total of twenty-four, twelve per pack) right by Agatha’s feet. Of course she bends down to pick one up, and of course it’s one of the XL ones.</p><p> </p><p>“Were you hoping for some kind of orgy?” Agatha grins and puts the corner of the package between her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face goes bright red. Cold embarrassment flushes her veins, almost making her heart stop. Words claw themselves up her throat but don’t make it out at first until she finally manages to squeal and defend herself, getting on her knees to collect them all as if Agatha could unsee them.</p><p> </p><p>“N-no no of course not! They-they didn’t have smaller packages and I didn’t know which size!” She stammers.</p><p> </p><p>“How do you not know which size?” Agatha snickers, not even making an effort to help.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t answer, she bites her lip and stuffs handfuls of them back into her cosmetic pouch. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks up.</p><p> </p><p>“Lots of girls you said? You haven’t used one yet, have you? You’re still a goddamn little virgin, admit it!” she raises a finger, glee in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“No I-I … I mean I,” Rio stutters, looking back down, reaching for one next to Agatha’s foot, but Agatha is faster and steps on it, towering over Rio with her crotch almost exactly in Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“I told you to find someone to do it with, didn’t I? Why didn’t you? Can’t be that hard - pun fully intended since I know how hard it gets,” she shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha please c-can I just put this one back-”</p><p> </p><p>“Why did you buy them if you wanna put them back?” she grins.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, please…”</p><p> </p><p>“God, I’ve missed hearing you beg,” Agatha sighs and releases the condom, allowing Rio to finish picking them all up. Of course the words go right to Rio’s groin, of course she feels herself twitch. She prays it won’t be visible under the thick skirt.</p><p> </p><p>“Be good during dinner and I might let you touch my tits again later.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio just stares at her as she walks away to change into a black dress (pretending she doesn’t notice how Agatha strips down to her underwear). </p><p> </p><p>‘Being good’ during dinner had sounded relatively straight forward, but objectively it’s a nightmare. Agatha sits down across from her, next to her father, which means Rio takes a seat right next to Agatha’s mother. Her perfume almost gives Rio a cough - she smells as if she has bathed in it rather than sprayed some on. She also keeps making awkward small talk until they arrive at Rio’s education and job prospects. Agatha snorts when her mother’s eyes go big even though Rio barely mentions the kind of school she goes to.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean… it sure sounds like a trade with very good job security,” she summarizes after sipping on her wine. </p><p> </p><p>“The stick up your ass is getting longer by the minute,” Agatha smirks and pushes her tongue into her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” Her mother hisses threateningly, but Agatha just rolls her eyes, letting herself fall further back into the chair as her father tries to steer the conversation elsewhere.</p><p> </p><p>The new angle seems to give her new ideas, because as the soup arrives moments later, Rio feels something coming up her leg. At first it simply feels as if Agatha is shifting under the table and her foot accidentally brushes against Rio’s shin, but when she drags it all the way up, Rio notices that it is too soft for Agatha still wearing her heel. Rio forces her glance onto the soup bowl, pretends not to feel Agatha’s toes wiggling against her thigh before she moves to the edge of her chair so she can slide her foot all the way in between Rio’s legs, immediately rubbing it against Rio’s crotch. In reflex, Rio looks up just to find Agatha grinning as she wipes soup off her upper lip with her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>“How do you like the soup?” She asks with a sweet voice. Everyone at the table nods and praises it as Rio’s hand cramps around her spoon, unable to move with Agatha’s foot rubbing against her penis, making it twitch in anticipation. She stifles a squeak as she feels her blood flow being redirected and wishes she had the courage to enjoy the feeling, to relish in what other people might call foreplay. </p><p> </p><p>“How’s your soup, Rio?” Agatha whispers with the sweetest, honey-like voice. </p><p> </p><p>“F-fine,” she manages to press out.</p><p> </p><p>“I usually don’t like pumpkins, but I guess it’s the season,” Agatha rasps her toes caressing Rio’s growing length. For a moment, Rio debates just shoving her foot away, but the noise and shuffling it would cause, make her abandon that thought. She isn’t going to come from this, is she? She sure hopes she isn’t desperate and touch-starved enough for that. It is, however, going to be visible if Agatha keeps going. Even with the skirt it will be difficult to hide and she-</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, for Christ’s sake, can you sit properly for once? You’re not in a lounge chair!” </p><p> </p><p>The speed at which Agatha retracts her foot and sits up properly at her mother’s command should be studied. She even looks… a bit flustered, doesn’t she? There is a rosy shimmer on her beautiful cheeks. Or is that just the dim restaurant light? Rio makes a mental note to find enough courage within herself to confront her with it later. Because so far… this has all been just fun to Agatha, right? Right?</p><p> </p><p>When dinner is finished they walk back to their room in silence. The parents stay behind for a glass of whiskey at the bar after proposing to meet again for breakfast at 8 AM to see what to do with the day. Thankfully, her body has managed to retrieve enough blood from her groin by then that she manages to get up without a visible erection.</p><p> </p><p>With every step, Rio keeps gaining a little more self-certainty to finally start a conversation, but she is literally stopped in her tracks and almost runs into Agatha when she suddenly decides to stand still.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s go to the Sauna!”</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha points at a wooden sign that points to the nearby stairs.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s open for another half hour, let’s go!”</p><p> </p><p>“But don’t we need our bikinis?”</p><p> </p><p>“The hotel brochure upstairs said it’s a European sauna,” Agatha chimes and bites her lower lip.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her, puzzled “what does that even mean?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leans in, whispering into her ear, “Europeans go into the sauna naked…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shudders, but somehow manages to retain some sort of composure, “w-what about robes?”</p><p> </p><p>“They’ll have them down there, c’mon! Or do you want me to go alone?” Agatha raises an eyebrow.</p><p> </p><p>Yes. It would probably be the more prudent decision to let Agatha go alone. Or maybe call her bluff (<em>because Rio is half sure Agatha would not go to the sauna on her own</em>) but… there are only so many hours she gets to spend with her this time. On the lake she had counted them all from the moment Agatha had first smiled at her, this time she had abstained from doing so so far. Plus, with a place so public Agatha would surely not try anything overtly compromising. The idea of seeing Agatha completely naked for an extended period of time is what finally wins her over. No matter how wrong it feels.</p><p> </p><p>So she lets herself be dragged downstairs, passing the indoor swimming pool and Spa area until they arrive at a cupboard with towels and folded robes. Agatha hands her one of each before they enter the changing rooms. Rio wraps a towel tightly around herself, clothes neatly folded in one of the open shelves. Agatha just chugs hers in, picking up her panties twice because they keep falling out. She’ll never understand how someone so graceful can be so messy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets her enter the sauna on her own, heading off toward the bathrooms. As Rio opens the door, a wave of heat rushes over her face, thick and chokingly dry. The air is heavy with the scent of warm wood and a hint of cinnamon. Inside, the light is dim and golden, filtering through the steam that curls lazily in the corners. She feels the wooden benches, unsure if they are too hot, but then decides to sit down in the farthest corner. It takes her a moment to relax, her lungs only adjust slowly to the hot air, but when they do, the hot steam begins to feel like a gentle embrace. She leaves the towel on. She doesn’t need a stranger to see her naked. She’s been through enough in one day.</p><p> </p><p>When the door quietly creaks, Agatha slips in stark naked (of course) and places her towel next to Rio, humming a cheerful tone. Rio looks, but avoids Agatha’s eyes. Agatha’s breasts are still as white and full as she remembers them. The warmth has made her nipples soft and flat, unbothered (unlike Rio).</p><p> </p><p>“This is nice,” she chirps and leans back, side-eyeing Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm,” Rio tries not to look at her so obviously any further, focusing on her folded hands instead.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you not like it?”</p><p> </p><p>“I-I would rather not someone walks in.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh don’t worry about that!”</p><p> </p><p>“H-how? Maybe someone else drops in before they close.”</p><p> </p><p>“No… I turned the sign around so it says they are close for the day,” Agatha mumbles, carefully letting a finger glide over Rio’s upper arm. She almost jumps at the touch.</p><p> </p><p>“Wh-what? Agatha what if the staff sees?”</p><p> </p><p>“I also put out one of those yellow cleaning signs. I don’t think anyone is gonna walk in here for the foreseeable future.”</p><p> </p><p>The way she flutters her eyelashes should be illegal. And the way she bites her lower lip as well.</p><p> </p><p>“Wh-what for?” Rio babbles, even though she’s relatively sure she knows the answer. And it really only takes Agatha one swift movement to come to sit on top of her, straddling her with her legs.</p><p> </p><p>“You look cute from this angle,” she snickers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is speechless. Her brain really tries its best to come up with a meaningful response, but the only things it manages to produce are fragments of words and embarrassing sounds.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been so cold all day… I thought I’d be nice to be warm together…” Agatha’s voice is sweet, dripping with honey. Rio knows that voice by now, has dreamed of it, thought of it countless times. It renders her practically defenseless as Agatha carefully folds her fingers under the towel, tugging on it until it comes undone, lazily falling to Rio’s sides.</p><p> </p><p>“Awww looks like the blood that normally fills your brain has elsewhere to be…” she chuckles and Rio swallows hard, looking down on herself where her cock is leaning to the side, not quite hard yet but certainly eager to be.</p><p> </p><p>“You always get so excited when you see me naked, I thought that would wear off…” she lets her thumb ghost over Rio’s left nipple. The sound that escapes Rio’s lips is disgraceful.</p><p> </p><p>“Pathetic little pet.”</p><p> </p><p>Her cock twitches visibly.</p><p> </p><p>“Still into the degrading I see?”</p><p> </p><p>Finally, <em>finally</em> her brain comes up with something that may entirely be a lie (but at least it’s something).</p><p> </p><p>“NO!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grins, “are you sure?” Her hand sneaks between her legs, her fingers gathering what Rio presumes is her own arousal, before she uses the same hand to wrap around Rio’s pounding member. She gasps when Agatha’s fingers encircle it firmly, each of them warm, each of them pressing down on the flesh.</p><p> </p><p>“Because it would be just such a shame, you know?” Agatha smiles and lazily begins to tug, teasingly letting it slip out of her fingers and picking it up again and again each time. It causes Rio’s heart to skip a beat in anticipation every time Agatha picks it back up.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmmmm,” she suppresses an answer, the heat making her dizzy.</p><p> </p><p>“You look so adorably helpless every time we have fun. Like a lost puppy that needs to be told how to be good.”</p><p> </p><p>“I-I’m good I swear,” Rio mewls, feeling more and more heat pool in her belly. A single drop of sweat rolls down her forehead as her body reacts to the heat.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah you were so good last time when you fucked your load onto my tits… such a good girl, so well behaved.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio bites her lips and nods. Between her legs, Agatha is slowly speeding up her pumps.</p><p> </p><p>“Gosh you always get so hard and big so quickly…” Agatha mutters.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Hmmmmitjustfeelssogood</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah? Does it feel good when a girl rubs your cock for you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nods again. More eagerly this time.</p><p> </p><p>“You know I sometimes think about what it looked like when you came that morning, all that white stuff on my face and nipples.”</p><p> </p><p>“Y-you do?” Rio whimpers, trying to concentrate, but then her gal de falls on Agatha’s breasts again, perky now, her nipples dark and large.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah… mostly when I’ve got three fingers inside of me and a vibrator to my clit-“</p><p> </p><p>Rio can’t stifle the groan that escapes her.</p><p> </p><p>“Awww… does that turn you on? Thinking of me fucking myself?”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Mhhhhhm-yes.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah of course it’s does… what a little, horny virgin you are, Rio.” She makes sure to roll it off her tongue like it’s a song - Rio is convinced of it. Her brain tries to record it so she can play it back next time when she isn’t lucky enough to have Agatha gratifying her, working her cock in a way that makes it ache and leak all over her fingers. When Rio masturbates, it’s always quick. First of all, because if her mother ever finds the door locked with Rio inside, she’ll know immediately why it’s locked - so Rio can’t even risk that. And secondly… she comes embarrassingly quick. But Agatha … Agatha takes her time with it, uses just enough pressure to build her up, but not enough to make her come. It makes Rio mad instead.</p><p> </p><p>“Pl-please Agatha,” she whines, tears in the corner of her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Please what?” Agatha’s cheeks are rosy and shiny from the heat.</p><p> </p><p>“Please c-can I come?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh you’re such a good girl for asking,” Agatha pouts, “but no.”</p><p> </p><p>In an instant, she releases the grip on Rio’s cock and instead brushing through her hair, stretching her upper body in a way that make Rio want to suck on her nipples before she realizes the gravity of Agatha’s words.</p><p> </p><p>“Wh-what?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s our first night here, I can’t let you off the hook that easy. Besides, it says outside not to be in here for longer than ten minutes at a time, so let’s get you a cold shower.”</p><p> </p><p>What Agatha really gets up, Rio stares at her, flabbergasted and desperate.</p><p> </p><p>“B-but-“</p><p> </p><p>“No, get up,” she takes her by the hand, pulling her up and Rio barely manages to put the towel over her groin before Agatha drags her to the door and into the shower.</p><p><br/>

<br/>
</p><p> </p><p><span>The cold shower is colder than Rio had expected. Agatha steps under it first without flinching, so Rio doesn’t fight it when she pulls her under. When the first drops hit her skin, she screeches so loud Agatha has to hold her hand over her mouth (which doesn’t help the situation - her eyes roll back into her head and her cock twitches one last time before the shock sets in and it finally goes limp again).</span></p><p> </p><p><span>She tries not to watch Agatha while she showers, long strands of mahogany hair clinging to her wet skin like vines crawling up a forbidden tower. When she dries her hair, Rio stretches her face into the warm stream of air, feeling for the atoms that glide over Agatha and then up to her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Later, when the room is only lit by Agatha's small bedside table lamp while she works on another one of her Sudokus, Rio imagines what it would feel like to rest her head on Agatha's chest and feel Agatha's skin under her cheek, her ribcage rising and falling with every breath. She falls asleep on the thought and when she wakes up again, the room has gone completely dark and Agatha has turned away from her. She shifts under her blanket and scootches closer until her forehead is against Agatha's shoulder blades. Even if Agatha wakes up like this, with Rio snuggled against her, sleep gives her enough plausible deniability. It had worked in the cabin, so why should this be any different?</span></p><p> </p><p><span>So she suppresses the urge to wrap her left arm around Agatha’s waist and focuses on the quiet humming of the mini bar and the tiny snores that escape Agatha ever so often and drifts back to sleep.</span></p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p><span>It’s the alarm on Agatha’s phone that wakes her next, small rays of pale sunlight fighting against the curtains and winning. The bed beside her is cold but unmade. Half asleep, she hears a steady flow of water coming from the bathroom, the door slightly ajar. Drowsily, she raises her head, feeling between her legs and noticing that God has been kind and not blessed her with a half-hard surprise. At least that’s something. She rolls over to Agatha’s side of the bed, sniffing her cushion, eyes steadily on the bathroom door. It smells just as nice as her hair had smelled last night.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha is naked (of course) when she steps back into the room, hair in a high bun, lips bright red.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Morning,” she chimes, her breasts bouncy.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hi,” Rio says and clears her throat.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thought I’d let you sleep a little longer.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uhm, thank you.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not for that,” Agatha blows a strand of hair out of her face and puts on a tight pair of white pants, “you might wanna get ready by the way, your mom texted they are getting ready to go to breakfast. She wanted to know if we’re still getting along and if I’m being nice again to you.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wh-what? How do you know?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Saw your unlock pattern last night,” she shrugs and points to Rio’s phone, charging on the floor.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha you can’t just use my phone!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why? Got any nudes on there?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“N-no! Of course not!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shame,” she shrugs again, “missed opportunity.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why would I even have pictures like that?” Rio slowly gets up, turning away from Agatha before she takes off her bottoms.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why not? Have you never sent a pic of your gear to someone? It’s fun!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Have you?” Rio deflects.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“All the time,” Agatha’s answer comes fast and her voice seems unusually high. Rio frowns.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Who to?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh you know… just some friends.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What friends?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha moans and pulls a sweater over her head, “just from school, what do you care? You jealous?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No! Of course not!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can send you some. So you have something to wank to at home.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I-I’m okay… thanks,” Rio mumbles. As enticing as it sounds, she doesn’t need to give Agatha the gratification.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Suit yourself then!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>As they walk to the elevators, Rio gets stuck again on Agatha’s high-pitched voice. Why had she sounded like that? Like she was lying? Why would she lie about this entire thing and fake pride over sending someone nudes. Rio takes a good look at her while they wait for the elevator to arrive. It all seems a bit strange. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She quickly forgets about it when they arrive at the breakfast buffet, her mother already waving to them from one of the tables. She sits down next to her, far away from Agatha this time and lets her mother give her a kiss on the head (which she hopes Agatha won’t see, she doesn’t need to be teased about her mother sometimes treating her like a pre-schooler).</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Did you sleep alright?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Mhm,” Rio mumbles, looking at her mother’s plate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And I presume everything is going alright with Agatha?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah no everything’s great,” she reaches for her mother’s orange juice and ignores the doubt in her face.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sometimes Rio wonders if her mother knows. Knows that Agatha is maybe more than a friend, but less than a lover. And that despite that, Rio cannot remember ever being in love with anyone else like this. If she knows, she doesn’t say so - but then who wails over a friend like Rio wails over Agatha? And perhaps it helps that Agatha is so blatantly uninterested in her whenever they are surrounded by people, indifferent to a fault. Rio is sure her mother has no clue what friends with benefits are (and really, Rio herself isn’t even sure if that would be what Agatha would call it). So maybe she just sees this as an intense longing for a friendship. Besides, Rio has yet to tell her mother that she cannot stand boys, neither their stench nor their demeanor. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She lets out a quiet sigh before she lifts herself out of the chair to get breakfast.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>She leaves it to the parents to figure out what to do with the day. The hotel offers skiing and snowboarding rentals, something Agatha seems to be immediately excited about, but it quickly becomes clear that one has to book the rental a day in advance. Instead, the concierge offers a guided birdwatching tour to them. Agatha moans at the suggestion, but the decision is made as soon as Agatha's mother finds out about the complimentary champagne at one of the view points.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha takes forever to get dressed, so much so that Rio wonders why she is even coming at all. Instead of waiting for her inside, sweating in her thick jacket and snow boots, Rio heads downstairs to wait in front of the hotel where Willy and her mother are already testing their newly acquired digital camera. With them is a young woman, maybe a few years older than Rio, dressed in a cute red jacket, with sunglasses on the tip of her nose. When Rio comes closer, Will hands her the camera to take a picture of him and Rio's mother.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh thank you so much Jessica, Rio, come say hi!” Her mother waves when they are done.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nice meeting you” she shakes Rio's hand, “I'm your guide today.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh nice,” Rio smiles and buries her hands deep in her pockets right after, making sure they are warm.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>It takes another ten minutes for Agatha to arrive, launching straight into a sharp exchange with her mother about her time management skills. Once they set off toward the trail, she deliberately lags behind, even though Rio walks at the head of the group. She glances back now and then to make sure Agatha is still with them, but each time, her look is met with cool indifference, masked behind the reflective shield of Agatha’s sunglasses.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>It's a sunny day with the top layer of snow melting and then freezing again into an icy layer as they walk. Jessica soon begins to explain the local geological history, pointing out the different mountains and hills by name. For the lack of anything better to do, Rio listens to her and Willy's follow-up questions. It's interesting enough. Agatha, on the other end, doesn't seem to be interested at all. Though Rio notices that by the time they get to the clear-blue lake, she is no longer being ignored, but rather stared down whenever she dares to look in Agatha's direction. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>When they reach the first look-out, a small beach by the shore, Jessica sets down her backpack next to Rio and bends down to rummage through it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Okay folks, this is our first bird spot. We are looking for Snow Geese. They will be completely pale white so keep your eyes peeled while I get you your binoculars!” She hands the first one to Rio and a second one to Agatha's father before Evanora and Victoria get another one each.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How do I use this?” Rio asks when Jessica walks back over to her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you see the jetty over on the other side?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio nods.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Point it that way and move slowly until you find the jetty,” she explains and adjusts the focus wheel for Rio, “tell me if it is getting any sharper.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uhm yeah it's pretty good now.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sweet, now if you slowly move left,” she gently moves Rio's body, “until you see them over there.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>It takes a second for them to come into view, but then a whole flock appears on the lake's shiny surface, dipping their necks into the water.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh wow they're right there!” Rio chimes and Jessica laughs warmly right next to her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, they take a break here before they migrate further South, but they really enjoy the water here before it freezes.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There are so many of them!” Rio marvels and tracks a chattering pair as they slowly make their way through the crowd. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ha ha, glad you like it!” Jessica replies cheerfully and pats Rio's shoulder before she leaves her be, and assists Evanora with the binoculars.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio continues to watch the geese, careful not to move too fast so she won't lose them. She hears steps next to herself, but pays no attention to them at first, thinking it's just one of the others trying to look at the same group of birds. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you having fun?” Agatha's voice is sharp and pointy, like a knife fresh from the whetting. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uhm,” Rio turns her head in reflex, “they're really pretty.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The geese?” There is something mean in Agatha's voice. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Y-yeah… what else?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh nothing,” Agatha pretends and pushes her sunglasses back up the bridge of her nose, "didn't take you for a bird watching loser, that's all.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>She walks away without another word. Rio watches her as she flips her long, brown hair over her hood and realizes that it's even longer now than it had been at the lake. Agatha makes no effort to get herself a pair of binoculars, she just crosses her arms and kicks a pebble around the shore and finally into the lake.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jessica lets them keep the binoculars as they walk on, following the gravel trail around the lake. At least this time Agatha doesn’t loiter behind them but quietly stays next to Rio, eyes ahead. It quickly becomes awkward, the way Agatha treats her like she isn't even there but matches her speed perfectly. After a quarter of an hour the silence becomes too annoying.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“D-did you even look at any of the birds?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just one. Red-bellied Robin,” Agatha still won't look at her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, I didn't even see that.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hm, weird I could have sworn you were looking at it quite a lot.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio furrows her brow. Okay maybe then this isn't the best topic. Rio looks back at the lake, somewhat hoping a better conversation starter might pop into her head… but it doesn't. Even worse, it makes her realize how little she actually knows about Agatha. So little she's not even sure what topics Agatha actually likes to talk about. None but one.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So how did you get into Sudoku?” The moment it’s out her mouth Rio realizes how deeply stupid that question is. Nobody gets into Sudoku, right? It's just a puzzle to pass the time. To her surprise though, something lights up in Agatha's face.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Figured out I was good at it.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There was one in the newspaper my mom couldn't crack. Took me ten minutes,” she shrugs, “bought one of those little magazines the next day only to realize they were too easy.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh so you do the really hard ones?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha raises a brow and cracks a laugh.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Apparently so.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio blushes and looks back to the gravel underneath her shoes instead.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The magazine I usually get sorts them into ten levels, one is the easiest, ten is the hardest. I usually do 9ers and 10ers.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wow…” Rio games, "you're so smart.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha snorts and rolls her eyes, “stop it, that's disgusting.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I mean it,” Rio tries.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>There is something soft underneath the exaggerated look of disgust in Agatha's face. It shines through, no matter how hard she tries to hide it. Rio doesn't call it out though, it seems too fragile for its own good.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You just don't hang with a lot of smart people,” Agatha shrugs, but the insult comes out quieter than she had probably intended. Rio decides not to answer, but instead stuffs her hands deep into her pockets, as their group turns away from the lake, following another trail up into the forest. It gets steeper and steeper, climbing up a ridge, and Agatha quickly lets herself fall back against while Rio sweats, but steadily follows Jessica and Wilfred at the head of the group. She listens to Agatha's mother huffing about not needing another workout for a week, but when the path finally levels again, the views are worth it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wow this is amazing!” She hears her own mother behind her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Welcome to The Treetops, our very own bird-watching platform and second stop for the day. We usually get great views of the lake here, and if you are lucky you might even get to see a Bald Eagle!” Jessica chimes with routine and guides them to a railed, wooden platform a few steps ahead. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The men immediately start looking through their binoculars, while the moms take a seat on a wooden bench, resting their legs. When Rio looks around, Agatha is nowhere in sight so she assumes she is still on the trail.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ready to look for some birds of prey?” Jessica laughs next to her and nudges Rio's arm.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh… sure!” Rio smiles and takes the binoculars to her eyes, scanning the trees for birds. Behind her, Jessica walks over to Wilfred and Agatha's father. Rio hears her point out an area, but doesn't pay enough attention to catch it. When she spots movement among the trees, it’s a squirrel leaping from one branch to the next. Rio watches it for a while, her gaze trailing its erratic path as it pauses, twitches, then darts forward again, as if chasing some invisible thread. Just as she begins to turn away, the squirrel freezes, its tiny body taut with attention. It cranes its neck upward, and Rio follows its gaze to find another squirrel perched a few feet higher. In a blur of motion, the first one scampers down the trunk and circles back, nuzzling its companion. The two begin to chase each other, spiraling up and down the bark, their movements effortless, synchronized, full of a joy that feels foreign.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio’s shoulders sink. The corners of her mouth twitch into a frown. Something in her chest tightens  as she watches them for a while longer, until their rustling fades into the canopy. Then she exhales, slow and quiet, her chest full of unexplained loneliness.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So, anything to see?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>She wishes it was Agatha, but it’s just Jessica’s voice. She still removes the binoculars and turns to her. She is holding two glasses of what looks to be sparkling wine.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No not really,” Rio shrugs.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We can try again after this,” Jessica smiles warmly and hands her one of the glasses.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio doesn’t care for alcohol much, but she still accepts it, listening to the clanking sound, when Jessica chinks their glasses. She immediately regrets taking a sip, but swallows the stinging fluid nevertheless, trying not to pull a face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As she sets the glass down on the weathered wooden guardrail, the glint of Agatha’s white jacket catches her eye, stark against the muted tones of the forest. Agatha has taken a seat on the bench beside Rio’s mother, though her body is angled toward Rio, painfully deliberate and unmoving. The sunglasses remain perched on her face, but they do nothing to soften the weight of her gaze. Rio doesn’t need to see her eyes to feel it, that cold, unwavering stare, sharp as glass and just as brittle. A silence stretches between them, taut and humming. She swallows hard, averts her eyes only to check a moment later if Agatha is still looking at her. She is, her face rigid.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Suddenly, Rio feels the wind-chill blowing up from the forest onto the exposed plateau. She leaves the binoculars roped around her neck but doesn’t raise them to her eyes again until she hands them back to Jessica half an hour later when thick, grey clouds begin to roll in. Agatha has her arms crossed in front of her body, and even though the sun is quickly hiding she leaves her sunglasses on. The only thing Rio sees when she looks at her is her own defeated frown. She still walks back down next to her, her nose burrowed into her scarf, protecting it from the icy air. Agatha ignores her, doesn’t even turn her head. The silence feels like a threat, its sharp teeth forcing their way through Rio’s skin. She keeps trying to come up with something to say, but none of it seems appropriate.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The hotel is already in sight when Jessica waits for the adults to pass her on the path and Rio to catch up. She kindly offers both her and Agatha to join again the next day in case they want to try seeing an osprey or a hawk.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yeah sure,” Agatha chimes, but Rio can hear the ridicule in her voice. She just nods with a half smile and tries not to flinch when Jessica pats her side.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Thick snowflakes begin to fall by the time they walk through the lobby. Agatha waits with an empty face while Rio’s mom cleans the remaining snow off her jacket. For a moment Rio debates asking whether she can come with her to their room in an attempt to avoid Agatha, but then her mother sends her off telling her that they have booked a couple massage and that she will call her later about dinner.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>So really, there is nothing left to do but follow Agatha. She hears her own blood rushing through her ears, her stomach suddenly feeling very hollow. Logically, Rio’s brain tries to tell her, the worst case scenario is that Agatha keeps ignoring her or possibly shouts at her about whatever is bothering her, and then they can make up, right? But then that would be logical And Rio isn’t exactly great at logic when it comes to Agatha.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha holds the door just long enough for Rio to step inside, then slams it shut with a force that rattles the frame. The lock clicks hard. Rio barely gets her boots off before Agatha’s jacket hits the floor. Her own hands fumble with her zipper, breath caught, pulse hammering. Agatha’s already crossing the room, eyes locked on her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are disgusting,” she hisses, shoulders broad, standing and inch taller than Rio.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wh-what have I done?” Rio feels all color drain from her face, her heart pounding even louder now.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are so ridiculously needy, it's hideous. You don't have an ounce of shame, do you?” Taking off her scarf with one swift pull, Agatha takes a step towards her, “are you so desperate to dip it in, that you chat up straight girls now?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha, what do you mean?” Rio's voice is reduced to a squeak as she comes another step closer, quickly towering over Rio.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Get on the fucking bed,you greedy little freak.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wh-what?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you know what’s good for you, you get on your belly right now!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio gulps. She can feel the bed frame against her shins. When Agatha raises an unruly eyebrow, it automatically makes her fall back.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s not your belly.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio turns around in an instant,only to feel Agatha’s cold hand yanking down her zipped up pants. Her skin burns where Agatha’s nails scrape it, catching both her jeans and underwear at once until they sit right under the swell of Rio’s ass, her soft member falling out onto the sheets. She wants to turn her head so she can look at Agatha and ask what this is all about, but instead she feels a hard slap coming down on her left buttcheek. She flinches and stifles a squeak.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Laughable,” Agatha murmurs and follows it up with a second slap.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha I-“</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are an embarrassment! Who the fuck gets hard over a few fucking geese?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I-I didn’t, I swear!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha ignores it, her hand comes down on Rio’s ass again.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Such a slut. So fucking easy, I really have no clue how you’re still a virgin when you’re like this.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Underneath her, Rio feels how her cock twitches once and then a second time. Out of reflex, her butt lifts up in Agatha’s direction. It triggers a hollow laugh.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Awwww, are you sticking your ass up for me now?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“N-no I was just-“ she is cut off when Agatha hits the same patch of skin again. The way it stings makes her moan. Even though she’d really like not to prove Agatha’s point, it feels so </span><em><span>so</span></em><span> good.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Looks to me like you’re being needy again…” Agatha lets a finger graze the tingling skin, “just a needy little girl, so desperate to get fucked.” Her voice is a mere whisper, almost drowned out by the squeaking of the bedframe behind Rio. It takes her a moment to realize that Agatha is shuffling onto the bed until she is hovering above Rio.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Say that you’re not gonna embarrass me like that again!” She slaps her butt again, the sound bouncing off the walls.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hmmmmm I won’t!” Rio mewls against the sheets.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Say you won’t flirt with-” Agatha stops for a split second, “say you won’t flirt with obviously </span><em><span>straight</span></em><span> girls ever again!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I won’t, I swear!” She whines through the sting of the next slap. Beneath her, her penis has slipped between the two mattresses from Agatha’s movements. The faint stimulation makes it pulse as it grows harder.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hmmm… I love it when you’re obedient for me.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Instead of another slap, Agatha carefully caresses the searing flesh, she lets her whole hand ghost over the skin, her pinky slipping between Rio’s buttcheeks. When it grazes over her butthole, Rio flinches and groans, face against the mattresses.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh. My. God.” Agatha giggles and does it again, “does that mean you like to have your hole full?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha!” Rio tries to protest in embarrassment, but her body has other objectives. Fully erect, she can’t help moving against the sheets, feeling both mattresses rubbing against it, almost choking it warmly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So you don’t want me to fuck you then?” Agatha asks with the most innocent voice imaginable.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>And really Rio has maneuvered herself into a checkmate here. She can let the embarrassment win and hope that when she gets up, Agatha won’t see how hard she is (which, let’s be honest, is impossible) or she can admit it. Because really, Agatha already knows. Because if she didn’t know, she wouldn’t be fumbling with the tender, swollen muscles that keep Rio’s butthole closed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>So all Rio does is shake her head. That way at least she doesn’t have to admit it verbally. But Agatha doesn’t let her get away that easily, won't let her get away that easily.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Beg for it,” she whispers and only then does Rio fully comprehend that Agatha’s lips are next to her ear, her body now fully bent over her back, “beg for it or I’ll leave you hard and leaking like I did yesterday.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio presses her eyes shut. She can feel herself throb in the tight space below.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Okay please,” she sniffles - and because she already knows that that won’t be enough she adds, “please Agatha, fuck me.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good girl,” Rio can hear her grin while she removes her hand only to suck on her fingers, which Rio surmises from the audible </span><em><span>pop</span></em><span> when Agatha releases them from between her lips.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The anticipation nearly kills her when Agatha runs three fingers over the fold of her butt gently moving them in a circular motion. When she finally drags her nail over the wrinkly hole again, Rio grinds against the bed, desperately seeking more friction. Above her, Agatha snickers and finally works the tip of her finger in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>It nearly makes Rio scream. It stings, but it stings deliciously, mixing in with wild, smoldering pleasure. Her eyes roll back behind her eyelids as she humps the bed, alternately pushing herself against the sheets and Agatha's finger. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sucking me right in,” Agatha hums and lets her finger sink in further, “my good, little pet, do you like it? Having my finger up your ass?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Hngmmmmyess</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Feels good, huh? I could take it away from you any moment, do you understand? I decide when you get this, not you!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio frantically nods against the sheets and groans as Agatha begins to slowly wiggle her finger, hitting the nerve endings that sent jolts through Rio's body. She almost wishes it wouldn't feel this good. So good she never wants Agatha to stop. So good she can't imagine ever doing this with any other girl. What if nothing will ever compare to this moment? Agatha's hot breath, smelling faintly of chocolate, against the tip of her ear, her weight on Rio's spine, her voice whispering the exact things Rio likes to hear?</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This isn't gonna take long for you, is it?” Agatha mumbles and Rio realizes that she must have been making obscene noises. She just feels so wonderfully full, pumping her cock into the narrow slit between the beds, imagining it's actually Agatha underneath her, tight and warm.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Oh, what she would give for that.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Just one time.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Just </span><em><span>once</span></em><span>.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>She thinks of sucking on Agatha's pulse point, feeling her hard nipples rubbing against her skin, hearing those tiny, sweet sounds below herself. Rio almost sobs into the cushion at the thought, all while Agatha is still buried inside of her to the knuckle, pumping it in and out slowly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh poor little virgin Rio… you must be so hard you’re almost bursting, hm? You’re such a pretty sight when you’re all needy and desperate to come.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio’s movements grow frantic, making the sheets rustle. Absentmindedly, she notices that she has been drooling onto the bed - a wet patch has formed around her cheek. Goosebumps erupt on her legs, spreading up and down like a piano player playing the entire length of the keys. She howls Agatha’s name and hopes she won’t be able to make it out between all the grunts and groans.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“C’mon I wanna see those sheets get messy,” Agatha coos, “I bet your load is all gonna drip down onto the floor, won’t it? I’ve never seen someone come as hard as you.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio doesn’t come from the dirty talk. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She also only partially comes from the stimulation around her cock. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She comes from the feeling of Agatha’s soft lips on her shoulder. It’s nothing but a peck, dry and unassuming. But it makes her cry out so loud she wonders whether it will be audible in the next room. When Agatha’s mouth leaves her skin, her cock begins to pump thick spurts of warm cum into the sheets. She squirms and wiggles, heat rising in her cheeks so hot it almost subdues her. Agatha continues to work her finger as she quietly pants into Rio’s ear. It only makes her twitch harder, so hard she starts to feel the moisture of her own cum on her belly, the creamy substance smeared onto her skin.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When you’re done, I might grind my pussy on your back, press your face into the pillow,” she whispers and Rio prays she means it.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“P-please,” she moans as she lazily humps the bed crack.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you want any chance at ever seeing me naked again, you better not run off with some weird bird chick again.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I—I promise I won’t!” Rio mumbles, turning her head just enough to catch a glimpse of Agatha’s face. She does, and something unusual flickers across it. Agatha’s eyes gleam, her features are softer than usual, as though a quiet warmth has risen to the surface. It lingers there, unspoken, a hush of feeling that makes Rio’s breath catch.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Go clean yourself up then,” she switches back to her usual self,  “and better hurry, I’m not gonna wait for you.”</span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><b><strong>PART TWO - Chapter 3</strong></b></p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p><span>It doesn’t take Agatha very long to finish. With one hand in Rio’s hair, the other one on the bed, she grinds herself against the skin on Rio’s back, cussing and swearing whenever she seems to hit the right spot. Rio has only two things to focus on: Agatha’s groans and not suffocating with her face on the pillow. And the main problem with that is that in order to hear better, she has to turn her nose further into the cotton as she draws heavy breaths, her hands tearing at the bedsheets. She is still soft between her legs, but the longer Agatha keeps using her to get off, the more she feels her insides tingle, gearing up to get her hard again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>In the end, Agatha comes with a howl, Rio feels her pussy jitter over her spine and pushes herself up into it to give Agatha a little more friction.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Fuck,” she moans and let’s herself fall onto the bed next to Rio, full breasts with perky nipples all exposed, one hand resting on Rio’s left ass cheek. Her hair is a mess, far too long yet glorious and wild all over the pillows. It almost glimmers in the lonely light of the bedside table lamp.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio shifts under her touch, praying it won’t alert Agatha to move her hand, but it doesn’t. Instead, she closes her eyes and readjusts it so that her palm sits in the very center again, goosebumps forming underneath her fingers.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Jesus, I sure hope they don’t wanna go on another fucking hike tomorrow,” she mumbles and scratches her nose with her other hand.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“We don’t have to join if we don’t want,” Rio responds and watches Agatha’s head turn towards her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Oh I know exactly what you wanna do instead,” she snickers, but it has less bite than usual. Rio still turns red.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“N-no I meant we could just… do our own thing?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Agatha furrows a brow but quickly rolls her eyes when Rio’s glance darts down to her nipples again, suppressing the urge to take them into her mouth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Let’s see what they say over dinner,” Agatha points the the gap between the twin beds, “we should take these off and call room service to get fresh ones.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Wh-what? No Agatha, what are we gonna tell them? I don’t want anyone to see!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Jesus, Rio! It's a hotel, they will have cleaned worse things off their beds. I’ll tell them we spilled some yogurt,” she shrugs and squeezes Rio’s butt cheek, “we’ll take the sheets off, leave a tip, and go to the pool so they won’t even see us.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio doesn’t like the idea very much. She generally doesn’t like the idea of anyone knowing about her being sexually active. And she hates the feeling of someone else having to clean up after her. But then she can see the dark spot even now that the lights are low. It’s not just gonna dry off, and sleeping in her own cum… well, it doesn’t exactly sound very enticing either.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>She still feels bad about the poor soul cleaning up her mess when she watches Agatha swim laps in the indoor pool, not even the twenty dollar bill they leave on the bed can change her mind. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>She is in one of her swim skirts again, legs dangling over the edge, submerged to the knees. The water is warm, but still her thighs are covered in goosebumps. The smell of chlorine is calming and the light so warm it makes the darkening outside vanish behind the windows. They are alone save for the one woman that gets up from her pool-bed to walk over into the sauna just after they arrive. Agatha has her hair up in a messy bun, singular strands wet stuck to her neck as she goes back and forth as if it’s her post-coital ritual.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>(Well,perhaps it is. Rio wouldn’t know, since Agatha still refers to it at most as </span><em><span>jerking off to each other</span></em><span> - explicitly not </span><em><span>sex</span></em><span>.)</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Stop looking so gloomy,” she complains when she reaches Rio’s side of the pool, holding on to the edge.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I’m not gloomy.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“You look like I killed a kitten.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>This time it’s Rio’s turn to roll her eyes. Agatha retaliates with a splash of pool water, but when Rio shuffles away to avoid getting soaked, putting some distance between them, Agatha stops and falls silent. It takes Rio a moment to realize she might have interpreted it as annoyance, when all Rio is really trying to do is avoid needing a shower before heading back up to the room.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Earlier was… good, right? Not… too </span><em><span>much</span></em><span>?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio doesn’t think she has ever heard Agatha speak in a softer, more careful voice. It’s deeper than usual, and yet all of a sudden seems so much younger. She isn’t looking at Rio, her eyes fixed on the windows behind them, her chin in the water.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“uhm…it was really nice.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“You know, I don’t really think you’re a slut,” her voice gets even smaller, she almost swallows that last word.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Yeah I-I was wondering if you actually did think that,” Rio admits and begins to fumble with her fingers until Agatha wraps her hand around them. It’s clammy and cold and already wrinkly from the water. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I don’t,” Agatha reassures her, “I really don’t.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“It… still sounded good. At the moment, I mean.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Agatha’s lashes flutter in the prettiest way, “o-okay.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>And then, for just the quarter of a moment, everything seems to be alright. A little cut-out from heaven smelling of chlorine and pine tree sauna oil - Agatha’s hand on hers, her glance attentive and unguarded. Of course she has to immediately ruin it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I mean,we’ll never do it again, so it’s good to know I didn’t overstep and traumatize you.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio’s first instinct is to believe it, gullible as she can be, so her eyes go wide as saucers before she sees the mischievous grin growing on Agatha’s lips.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Unless you really, really want to, of course,” she pushes herself off the pool wall, “can’t let all those condoms go to waste!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Oh my god, Agatha!” Rio shouts after her, but she is already half out of earshot.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><br/><br/></p><p><span>Dinner passes without any noteworthy occurrences. They eat at the same table, sitting opposite each other once again, but this time Agatha’s foot does not end up between her legs. Instead, the parents discuss work and their plans for Christmas, but Rio only pretends to listen as topic blends into topic over tartar and venison ravioli. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“You’re being awfully quiet,” Agatha’s mother nudges her daughter after a while.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I usually talk too much for your taste,” Agatha replies without looking at her mother as she dramatically rolls her eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“So all good with the room sharing arrangement then? Did they at least give you twin beds?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Agatha snorts but doesn’t answer when she stuffs her mouth with another ravioli, the tip of her tongue wiping white sauce from her lips. </span><em><span>You know, I sometimes think about what it looked like when you came that morning, all that white stuff on my face and nipples. </span></em><span>Rio has to swallow hard before she manages an answer.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Yeah. It's, uhm, fine” she shrugs, feigning ignorance.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Oh that’s so nice, do you get to have some nice sleepover chats?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Fantastic ones mom,” Agatha smiles and winks at Rio.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>They finish the rest of dinner in a gentle lull. It’s mainly the parents that keep the conversation going, chatting about tomorrow’s plans and the hotel’s odd carpet choices. The soft clatter of cutlery and the low murmur of other guests fill the gaps and soon drown out the table conversations. When the plates are cleared, they all linger for an awkward moment before again agreeing it’s time to call it a night and to meet again at eight for breakfast. As they walk upstairs instead of taking the elevator, Rio can't help but stare at Agatha's behind, gently swaying right in front of her face. </span><em><span>She's doing that on purpose isn't she? </span></em></p><p dir="ltr"><br/><br/></p><p><span>When Rio comes out of the bathroom later, Agatha has already slipped underneath the blankets though Rio can still see the straps of her silky, red negligee over her rosy skin. She has her nose in another sudoku magazine, chewing on a pencil. How someone can look this cute and hot at the same time Rio will keep unraveling for the rest of her life. If she was allowed, she would crawl over the comforters, bow her head and beg to bury her head between Agatha’s legs until either of them passes out. If she was allowed, she would kiss every inch of Agatha’s body, below her feet, the hollow of her knees, along her entire spine. Something inside of her screams for it, fights tooth and nail for the upper hand. It’s likely what’s left of her courage, and if she gave in, she’d have had her lips on Agatha’s already.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Stop staring you perv,” Agatha mumbles and flips Rio’s blanket over. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Under the covers, she quickly turns away to avoid looking at Agatha any longer. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><em><span>Please don’t fall in love with me or something, that’s just gonna hurt you.</span></em><span> </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>She’d been very clear about that, hadn’t she? Perhaps none of this had been a good idea. Perhaps she should have just stayed home instead of letting herself become attached to Agatha like a moth attracted to the shine of a forbidden light. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio doesn’t notice how fast she falls asleep, but when a part of her becomes conscious hours later, she feels the illusion of an arm wrapped around her and a warm body against her back, silky fabric against her shoulders and a warm and steady breath against her ear. When she blinks, the room dark and quiet, it's already gone. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><br/><br/></p><p><span>Over breakfast, the parents bring up another snowy hike, but Agatha immediately shuts it down - she’s already decided to borrow a snowboard instead.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Oh isn't that dangerous?” Rio's mother raises a brow, sipping on her coffee.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Mom I-I was gonna try it out too? Maybe?” Rio intercepts her, even though it feels strange.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“But Rio, you've never skied or snowboarded in your life,” her mother replies concerned.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I'll teach her,” Agatha quickly leans forward, "I'll look after her, I promise.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio's heart skips a beat, the knife and fork in her hands suddenly feel heavy.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I really don't know if-”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Mom please,” her own courage surprises her once more, and her mother raises both hands in defense, letting the topic rest.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>It’s a bit of a challenge finding the right clothes and utensils to borrow at the ski station attached to the hotel. A young woman helps them, snickering as she measures Rio to find the best fit. Rio politely smiles at her and answers her quips until she meets Agatha's disapproving glance and immediately tightens her lips, waiting to try on a pair of snow pants and a skiing jacket. When she has put them on, she feels like the Michelin Man, waddling towards Agatha, who has already donned a tight, black snow suit with a silver waistband.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I look hideous,” she whispers, stumbling towards the door.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“You look cute, get over it,” Agatha gives her a soft slap on the butt that makes Rio flinch and grind her teeth. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>When they step into the cold, the snow is packed and uneven under her boots, and the slope ahead looks steeper than she expected. People are already zipping past on skis and snowboards, shouting to each other as they go. It’s busy, louder than she thought it would be, and everyone seems to know exactly what they’re doing. She hesitates, unsure where to stand or what to do with her hands. The whole place feels like it’s moving too fast, and she’s already behind. The snowboards look dauntingly big when Agatha carries them over from the rental shed, one bright green and one light purple. She hands her the green one as if Rio is supposed to know what to do with it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“M-maybe this wasn’t such a good idea after all, I-I mean I could just watch you?” She stammers and looks at the slopes ahead, steep descents that other skiers and snowboarders are already traversing at higher speeds than Rio feels comfortable with.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Awww are you scared?” Agatha whispers into her ear in a way that makes the tiny hairs on Rio's skin stand up.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“N-no of course not!” She lies, shrieking away to see Agatha's smug grin.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Well then chop chop, we're not wasting anymore time,” she points to a bunny hill that is already being used as a training slope by several children and their parents. When they arrive on its highest point, Agatha helps her fasten one of her feet on the board. Rio nervously bites her lip, feeling the slippery snow underneath the board.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Feeling okay?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Uhm… I think so,” she mumbles, both of her hands in the fluffy fabric of Agatha's jacket.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Alright, bend your knees a bit, and the only thing I want you to focus on right now is balancing and finding out if you want to go left foot forward or right.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“O-okay?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>When Rio doesn’t move and just stares down to her feet, Agatha looks at her with a brow raised, “well you gotta move on your own”, she points at Rio’s foot.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“C-can I hold on to you?” Rio asks sheepishly and Agatha rolls her eyes but puts her hands snug on Rio’s waist. It’s so tight Rio feels the individual fingers through the jacket.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“That good?” She asks with pointy lips.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Hmmh,” Rio affirms, feeling her cheeks get warm and rosy as she holds on to Agatha’s arms.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Now use the loose foot to get yourself moving, I’m gonna move with you,” she orders and with a shaky foot, Rio pushes herself off from the snow, slowly sliding downhill, while never letting go of Agatha. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Now put your other foot on the board as well,” Agatha keeps directing her and together they make it down to the bottom of the bunny hill. With a pounding heart and just a little bit of pride, Rio goes a second time without holding on to Agatha like a cat afraid to be dropped into water.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Well done you,” Agatha chimes and winks at her when she gets back down on her own. But much to Rio’s dismay, she is no longer alone. Two boys with broad boards and reflective snow masks are standing next to her, eyeing Rio with snide, condescending grins.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“So do you wanna come up there with us? It’s a fun downhill run,” one of them asks as if they have been speaking before Rio’s arrival. It immediately makes her tummy churn with envy. She still bites her lip, watching Agatha look up the slopes. She isn’t really considering this right? Abandoning Rio on the practice hill and galavanting off with those two boys? Had they been flirting with her while Rio had hoped Agatha would see how well she was going down the slope on her own? Had Agatha been flirting with </span><em><span>them</span></em><span>?</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Uh no thanks, maybe later?” Agatha shrugs to Rio’s relief. But then what does she want with them </span><em><span>later</span></em><span>? Why is she even talking to them at all? Rio barely notices how she chews on the soft flesh of her cheek until it becomes all tender and wobbly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Are you sure?”, the other one asks and then adds with a mean grin, “we can always get your friend a babysitter.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio almost physically feels the sting of it, sharp and sudden, like a slap of wind against bare skin. The pride she’d been clinging to, thin and fragile, melts away, leaving behind a hollow ache. Her cheeks burn, not just from the cold but from the humiliation. She lowers her gaze, suddenly aware of how clumsy her stance must look, how out of place she is here. Agatha is wasting her day like this, trying to teach Rio how to not fall off a snowboard instead of enjoying her last day in the snow. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Agatha rolls her eyes and flips them off, unlocking the snap on Rio’s board so they can walk up the hill again together. It doesn’t feel good anymore though. Rio clutches the board to her side, suddenly feeling the wind-chill.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“You’re gonna try with both feet fastened to the board now,” she declares and makes Rio step on the board, “it’s literally the same, just safety wheels off.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Y-you know you don’t have to do this right? I’m not gonna be able to go up on the big mountain any time soon, you can just go and-“</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Oh shut up for Christ’ sake,” Agatha huffs and fastens the second buckle. Rio feels like she might burst into tears any moment. She should have just gone with her mom, she should have just not tried something reckless and hideous like snowboarding! </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Agatha mumbles something below her but Rio barely listens. She’s never been good at not taking things to heart. Her eyes become wet and blurry, her nose fills with snot. This is stupid, she should just go and get changed and let Agatha have some fun. So she wipes off the tears that are just about to spill onto her cheeks and looks towards the hotel, ready to take off. But Rio forgets that she is already buckled into the snowboard. When she moves her upper body, it begins to slide in the snow underneath her. She yelps, but Agatha has already let go of the board, watching in shock as Rio slides away from her and down the hill with increasing speed. Rio turns at least once, trying to get her back straight to gain at least some sort of control over where and how fast she is going, but it is useless. Shrieking, she topples over falling face first into the snow, scratching the palms of her hands. She keeps sliding downward, her jacket riding up her back, exposing her rump to the cold snow.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>The first thing she hears when she raises her head is laughter. Wet patches on her face, she raises her head to see, but of course it’s the two boys that have been trying to convince Agatha to go with them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Top performance Miss Piggy,” one of them yells and snorts, “peak entertainment!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>The tears come back to Rio’s eyes and she is about to visibly sob, when something swiftly enters her field of view, so quickly none of them see what’s coming. Agatha’s fist lands in the shorter boy’s face before he even realizes she is there. It sends his glasses flying as she shakes her knuckles and moves on to the second boy, kicking him between his legs.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“You fucking idiots,” she screams and shoves the second one into the snow. He lands on his ass and screeches like a cat, “you are so disgustingly unfuckable and don’t even know it! You dare laugh at someone who’s way beyond your league! Fuck off now or I’ll tear out your intestines and strangle you with them!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio’s eyes go big as the two of them get up, one with a bloody nose, the other one holding both hands over his crotch. They keep staring at Agatha as they waddle away through the small crowd of other skiers that has gathered around them. Agatha doesn’t turn back around to her until they are out of eyesight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Are you alright?” Her voice is suddenly sweet and soothing. She comes to kneel next to her in an instant. All Rio wants to do is to kiss her silly. Generally, that's been all she wanted to do lately. She feels the warmth in her cheeks when Agatha puts her hands on the sides of her face, thoroughly searching for injuries.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Uhm I-I think so,” Rio stammers, suppressing the searing urge to throw herself into Agatha's arms letting the tears flow. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Show me your hands,” Agatha asks and Rio raises her palms, showing angry looking wounds to Agatha. It's only then that she begins to feel the sting.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Agatha sighs and opens the buckles on Rio's snowboard, “let’s go clean that up,” she extends a hand to Rio to help her up before she picks up both snowboards to return them to the rental.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>It takes Rio a second to get out of her snow suit. She whimpers when she drags her open hands through the jacket, whines when Agatha helps her out of the trousers, suddenly feeling the places she landed on a little more.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Upstairs, Agatha makes her sit on the edge of the bathtub as she cleans the wounds on her palms with water then with an antiseptic spray they had given her at the front desk in a first-aid kit. Rio sobs lightly as the spray bites her raw skin, flinches when Agatha pads it dry again to put a small bandage on.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I have no clue how this works so bear with me,” she mumbles without looking at Rio as she wraps the strips of gauze around her hands, fastening them with a knot.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“T-thank you,” Rio whispers when she is done, packing up the first-aid kit again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Your mom is gonna kill me when she sees that,” Agatha sighs and pinches her nose.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“No! No it was my fault, I-I was just clumsy,“ Rio reaches for one of her hands.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Maybe next time we get you a proper instructor.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio likes the sound of </span><em><span>next time</span></em><span>. That there might be a next time. Because it means that this isn’t the last she will ever see of Agatha when they all leave for the airport tomorrow. Because it maybe means Agatha still would like to see her again. Right? </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Anyway,” she shrugs, “what do we do with the rest of the day? It’s barely lunch time.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I-I could use a nap,” Rio murmurs, looking at the bed and suddenly feeling how the tears have made her eyes dry and tired.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Go on then, imma take a shower first,” Agatha shrugs.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Under the duvet, Rio listens to the sound of the shower turn on and somewhere in her hazy mind imagines that she is a drop of water, gliding down the curve of Agatha’s breasts, onto her sides and then down her legs. She presses her nose into the pillow, resting her hand over her length without squeezing it. She thinks of all the condoms in her toiletry bag and how she’ll not even get to wear one now that she has ruined the mood. She slips into a light sleep and later feels how Agatha climbs onto the bed next to her. Outside, the light slowly fades. She wakes twice, each time immediately thinking she should not waste their time like this, but falling back asleep soon after.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>When Agatha finally tugs on her arm to wake her up, the sky outside is pink.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Oh no, how long did I sleep!?” she shrieks awake and sits up.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“A while, my mom is asking when we want to meet for dinner?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Were you here this whole time?”, she croaks, “you could have gone out to snowboard!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“It’s fine,” she lifts the sudoku magazine from the nightstand, “I was busy and you looked cute while you slept.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio’s eyes become shiny, she looks back down onto the blanket, “don’t say stuff like that.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Stuff like what?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“That I am cute when we both know you’re just trying to be sympathetic.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I’m not being sympathetic, you look cute when you sleep,” Agatha huffs and sits back on the bed. Rio rolls her eyes and looks out the window above the desk.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Thanks for… sticking up for me… with those boys.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Don’t even waste another thought on them, they were useless shitheads,” she waves it off.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“It still… meant a lot,” Rio admits, fumbling with her fingers.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Yeah whatever,” Agatha shrugs and lets herself fall back onto the foot of the mattress, forcing Rio to look at her. She is wearing grey shorts and a crop top that has ridden up so far that the curve of her breast is exposed. Rio quickly makes herself look away and Agatha smirks, stretching so that even more skin becomes visible.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>They stay like that for a while, comfortable in the silence that stretches out between them as the room turns golden and then blue. As time passes, Rio wonders if there is any way to approach the topic of seeing each other again, maybe texting more often, maybe being… </span><em><span>something</span></em><span>. It sits on the tip of her tongue for a while as she looks for the right words that might not scare Agatha away. She rehearses a dozen versions in her head, each one sounding too eager or too desperate. Agatha seems perfectly at ease beside her, tracing idle patterns on the duvet with one finger, unaware of the small storm gathering in Rio’s chest. It all feels so fragile, like speaking too soon might break whatever softness has settled between them. So Rio waits, hoping the right opening will present itself, hoping she’ll recognize it when it does. But then it’s Agatha who is first to speak.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“So did you wanna try that whole losing-of-your-virginity-thing again?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio’s eyes go wide at the question, “wh-what?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I mean it’s our last night, we have to go to dinner at some point, if we wait until after we might be too tired.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio could never be too tired for it, but fair enough.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Y-you mean we could…?” She tests the waters and Agatha rolls her eyes.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I mean you brought a gazillion condoms, I can’t really let you go home without using one, can I? I’m not </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> mean.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio’s tongue suddenly feels swollen and unable to move. Something else stirs though.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“So?” Agatha raises her eyebrows when Rio doesn’t answer.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Uhm I… I mean if you like… really want to?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“No guarantee I can get that thing inside though,” she chuckles and gets up, walking into the bathroom and coming back with Rio’s toiletry bag, throwing it onto the bed.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I-I think it has to be hard for me to put one on,” Rio stammers.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>A vicious smirk appears on Agatha’s lips, “alright, come here,” she taps the edge of the bed. When Rio sees her kneel, all air suddenly leaves her lungs.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“C’mon, let me suck you hard,” Agatha beckons when Rio doesn’t move, “be a good girl.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>And that about does it. Rio shimmies to the foot of the bed and sits down with Agatha between her legs. She gently hooks her fingers underneath Rio’s waistband and pulls on her sweatpants until it falls down over her knees.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Uh… so naughty, going commando,” Agatha licks her lips. Rio wants to reply something, apologize even, but Agatha already has her half-hard member in her hand, carefully tugging on it as she wraps her right hand around it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I have a feeling we’re gonna have you hard and leaking in no time,” she whispers before she leans down, her tongue darting out to lick the tip.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio feels dizzy with want. Her hands become cold with sweat as heat pools in her belly and she feels herself harden. She moans when Agatha begins to suck on her cock, wrapping her lips tightly around it never breaking eye contact. Her mouth is so wet and warm, teeth scraping lightly mixing pleasure with a little bit of pain. It’s paradise, Rio realizes, and she doesn’t think she ever wants to leave it. She lets herself fall back on her hands and watches as Agatha swallows more and more, slowly moving back on forth. Rio can feel it become red and hard, feels how a bit of precum runs out. She watches Agatha lick it off with the tip of her tongue, smiling and brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. She looks gorgeous like this, cheeks pink, eyes watery from the strain against her throat. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Do you like hearing how big you are?” Agatha replaces her mouth with her right hand for a moment, providing a different kind of stimulation.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio mewls.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“You’re so fucking big and leaky, you can’t wait to be inside of me, can you?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio bites her lips and shakes her head.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“You’re gonna be so good for me and let me fuck myself on your cock, yeah?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Y-yes please, please!” she begs.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Agatha takes her cock into her mouth one last time, squeezing her lips so hard it makes Rio groan. She reaches for the bag and zips it open. She doesn’t check which size she pulls out, just rips it open in an instant. But when she looks at the translucent condom, she suddenly realizes she has no clue what to do with it.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“H-how do I…?” She looks at Agatha.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Well how am I supposed to know?” Agatha frowns, licking her lips, making a tiny string of spit disconnect from Rio’s cock.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I thought you might have done this be-”, Rio stammers, but Agatha interrupts her by ripping the condom from her hand.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Can’t be that hard, can it?” she shrugs and places it on the tip. She begins to wiggle it down, stretching the thin layer of latex over Rio’s pulsing length. If feels so fucking good. The way Agatha handles it, pumps the condom down, brushing the tip of Rio’s cock again and again. Her eyes roll back at the feeling. She feels her body getting cold and then unbearably hot before she stutters a weak </span><em><span>Agatha</span></em><span> and reaches for her shoulder. A second later her cock twitches, spurting viscous ropes of milky cum into the condom. She whines, her arms feeling shaky. Below, Agatha still holds her cock in her hand. The condom is still so loose, that Rio’s cum slowly seeps out of it until streaks of it drip onto Agatha’s fingers.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Did you just…” she asks quietly, eyes fixed on the flinching member in her hand.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I-I oh my god,” Rio stammers, putting one hand over her mouth.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“So you literally come now from me touching you?”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“It-it just felt really good the way you… the way you…” she whines. Agatha is never gonna let her live that down right? Being so horny she comes from a bit of sucking and tugging?</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Well I was kinda sure you’d pump twice and come, but I did not anticipate this,” Agatha chuckles. But it’s not mean, it’s almost warm and… caring.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I-I am so so sorry!” Rio promises, “I-I can totally look after you too, I’m not just-just taking!”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“How about we clean this up first?” Agatha winks and slowly strips the condom off again, gathering it and the leaking fluid in her palm. Rio listens to her as she turns on the sink, before she returns back with a moist towel and hands it over.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I-I mean it’s really a compliment to you and your skills you know, I-I guess you just have more practice than I,” Rio babbles as she cleans herself off, Agatha watching from beside her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Oh um… totally, yeah I guess,” she shrugs and reaches for her phone when it vibrates, “it’s my dad, they’ll go get dinner now and want us to come.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Oh…” Rio sighs, a little discouraged. She would have given a lot to get a different kind of dinner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“It’s fine, I’m okay, let’s maybe go down before one of them decides to come up here,” she laughs and puts a hand on Rio’s upper thigh. It’s warm and comforting and Rio fights the urge to hug her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Later, when they are back in bed, with only Agatha’s nightlight shining down on her magazine, Rio tentatively tries once more to apologize, but Agatha just shrugs it off.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Like you said I’m just too good at what I do,” she winks. It makes Rio’s chest flutter warmly. Oh it would be so nice if they had just one more day together. Not one wasted like this. And after all of it, she stills goes back home a virgin (well at least to Agatha’s standards). It’s unfair when there are so many things she still wants to try, so many things she wants to tell her. Rio watches as Agatha turns her head back to her sudoku, slightly chewing on her pen. Her face looks much rounder like this, with no makeup in only the dim light. Her lips are even more plump than usual. She fights the urge to run a finger over them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>With much unspoken, she turns away to close her eyes. She could always tell her tomorrow morning. Tell her that she has never met anyone like Agatha, that she feels like she is floating on air whenever she thinks of her. That she doesn’t like the thought of going back home again, without knowing when she will get to see her next. How she would like Agatha to promise to call or maybe just text regularly. In the end, she falls asleep without making a resolution.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span><br/><br/></span></p><p><span>They oversleep, naturally. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s mother wakes them by knocking sharply on the door, her voice carrying through the hallway with far too much energy for the early hour. They scramble around the room in a half‑awake panic, grabbing clothes from the floor and sweeping toiletries into their bags. By the time Rio climbs into the van she is flushed and sweaty, her sweater inside out and her shoelaces trailing behind her like loose ribbons.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Agatha’s mother immediately launches into a lecture about the importance of setting alarms and being responsible when travelling with family. She directs most of it at Agatha, who responds by turning her bare, sleepy face toward the window, pretending to be absorbed in the passing scenery. The more her mother talks, the more determined she seems to ignore every word. Rio sinks into her seat, still catching her breath and mourning the chance of talking to Agatha again privately and having a proper breakfast before the flight.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>They are about thirty minutes behind schedule when they arrive at the terminal, the parents lifting their bags onto the self check-in bag belt. Agatha has her arms crossed in front of her chest as she watches them, holding onto their boarding passes while she listens to music. Rio trails behind all of them as they walk through security and then towards the gates. She’d not imagined it to go like this, she’d hoped there would be more time, that she would get more time to come up with something to say. Time runs as they walk through an airbridge in search of a Dunkin to get coffee for Wilbur and Rio’s mom. When the line turns out to be especially long, Agatha rolls her eyes and walks off towards a seating area next to the windows. </span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Mi amor, we’ll have to go to our gate as soon as we get the coffee, if you want to say goodbye to Agatha you might wanna do it now,” her mom gently touches her shoulder when she catches Rio staring in her direction.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“And please tell her to come to our gate as well, I’m not gonna come looking for her if she isn’t there by boarding time,” Evanora adds, interrupting her study of the menu.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio nods quietly, feeling her heart beating in her chest a little more with every step she takes. Her empty stomach rummages as she walks around a corner and sees Agatha leaning against a wall opposite the windows.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Hey,” she greets her, when she gets there.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Hey,” Agatha takes off her earphones.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“We… we need to board soon.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Agatha nods quietly.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I uhm…”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“This was nice,” Agatha interrupts her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Oh?” Rio’s lashes flutter.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Yeah, was nice seeing you again… and everything.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio swallows hard, “same.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Good.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Yeah.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I kinda wish we had another day,” Agatha adds, avoiding looking at Rio.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Do you?” Rio asks and hates herself for the excitement in her voice.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Would have been nice to… you know, try again. It was really cute seeing you … well.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Rio bites her lower lip and looks down onto the floor. Unsure what to do with her hands, she folds them into one another just to unravel them again.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Don’t like…make me all hopeful when we both know I’ll go home now and you won’t text back anymore,” she whispers and it is all she can manage, the furthest her courage is willing to stretch. It at least makes Agatha look at her.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“I’m not… good at this.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>A man brushes by, heading for the next gate. Above, a scratchy voice calls for several passengers to board their flight to Albuquerque. A kid screams somewhere behind them.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span> “But… do you like me? Maybe a bit at least?” Rio presses out, her voice squeaky and small.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>Agatha doesn’t answer. She chews on her lip, maybe stalls for time. It works - because even though the parents can’t see them, Rio can hear Evanora yelling for her.</span></p><p><span>“I probably need to go,” Agatha suggests and Rio’s shoulders deflate. When she looks up there is something unsure and uncertain in Agatha’s face. Her cheeks are still puffy and a red speck is forming on her forehead. She looks utterly pretty.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>And then she leans in. Completely without warning, her hands still holding onto her bag instead of reaching for Rio. Their lips still meet. It’s clumsy and dry and awkward. She tastes of cherries and lavender, that's the first thing Rio realizes, although it might be imagined and entirely untrue. Perhaps it’s just the feeling Agatha gives her translating into smell and taste. Her nose brushes Rio’s as she kisses her a second time, Rio wants to reach out, wants to pull her in close and hold her there so she can’t escape. But Agatha is already leaning back.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>“Uh… bye,” she mutters and then she runs off around the corner.</span></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p><span>When Rio follows her, all she sees is her own mother waiting for her in front of the Dunkin.</span></p>

<p align="center" dir="ltr"><strong>Part Two - Chapter 4</strong></p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr">It's still dark in her room when her phone starts blaring with her daily alarm. Outside, the sun hasn't risen yet, an unfortunate symptom of the season. People sometimes assume that because she is studying to become a mortician, she likes the darkness, that she is into tattoos and gothic aesthetic and Evanescence and so forth. It's a presumption Rio is finding very tough to shake. She raises her eyebrows at the thought and stuffs her pink Hello Kitty pencil case into her lilac Nike backpack before she heads into the bathroom to get ready for her day.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">It's become a habit not to check her phone before she has had something to eat. Not every morning needs to revolve around whether Agatha has found it within herself to send her a text before school. It's simply a form of self-preservation at this point. However, that doesn’t mean her heartbeat swells to a crescendo as soon as she sits in her car and allows herself to take her phone out of airplane mode. Impatiently, she keeps dragging the top of her screen down, waiting for it to log onto the network. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">There are no new messages.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio swallows and bites down on the back of her tongue. She checks the Facebook chat as well, just to make sure Agatha hasn’t reverted to using that as her preferred form of communication, but no, there’s nothing new since the blurry picture of her new lipstick last night. She slouches into her seat, switching off the screen. At the east end of the street, a fine sliver of yellow is finally creeping over the horizon. At least she won’t have to drive in the dark on her last day of school then. When her engine roars, choked by the cold, her radio comes alive as well, and Rio withstands the urge to check her phone until she arrives at her school’s parking lot.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Agatha doesn’t text until after Rio’s second period. She is about to get into her lab coat when her phone dings with the sound Rio has specifically assigned to her. The way she scrambles to unlock the screen is embarrassing. Thankfully nobody cares. She turns to the wall (why, she doesn’t know, because Agatha only ever jokes about sending intimate pictures but never actually goes through with it). It’s a mirror selfie, Agatha in her sleep shorts, long hair falling messily over her shoulders, her face shrouded by her phone. Wish I could have stayed in bed, is the caption underneath. Innocuous as usual, platonic to a tee. Rio takes two breaths (so Agatha won’t make fun of her texting back too quickly) and then replies.</p><p><b> </b></p><p align="right" dir="ltr"><em>Same ❤️</em></p><p><em><b> </b></em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Fucking hate school today.</em></p><p><b> </b></p><p align="right" dir="ltr"><em>You always hate school.</em></p><p><em><b> </b></em></p><p dir="ltr"><em>At least it’s my last day before Xmas.</em></p><p><em><b> </b></em></p><p align="right" dir="ltr"><em>Mine too</em>.</p><p><b><br/><br/></b></p><p dir="ltr">“Miss Vidal, are we ready to join the class?” </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">She instantly looks up. Mr. Merchant is holding the door open, eyebrows perched up in silent scolding. She stuffs her phone back into her backpack before she takes it into the lab room, ready to embalm another rodent. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Standing over the small, dead weasel, she wonders whether it is ever going to change. Not once has Agatha addressed the kiss at the airport. Only seldom does she make any sexual innuendos, and she never flirts. Well - almost never. That one night she’d gone out with friends Rio had gotten a picture of Agatha in a skimpy black skirt and revealing top. Wanna sit on ur face, had accompanied the image. Rio had only seen it the next morning. Her sorry ass had replied with You look very nice. After that Agatha had simply asked what she was up to that day. By now, Rio has come to realize that she is likely in what people on TV describe as “the friendzone”. Apparently that’s what it’s called when you are romantically interested in someone who is very desperately trying to show you they aren’t, but still want to keep you as a friend.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio sighs and gets a strange look from her lab partner currently cutting into the weasel. She just shakes her head and bites her lip.</p><p><b><br/><br/></b></p><p dir="ltr">She carries the thought with her over Christmas, sends Agatha a cute picture of herself in her tight red dress on Christmas morning before they head out to brunch with her mother’s sister’s family. It doesn’t elicit the desired reaction. Agatha just asks her where the dress is from. She sips on a bit of wine for dinner on Boxing Day, gathering enough courage to send a simple Miss You as the sky turns pink and then blue. It’s already late and Rio is half asleep underneath her blanket, watching an ER re-run when Agatha finally answers.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">It’s a heart. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">A little pink heart, right underneath Rio’s message. Nothing further. It makes Rio’s lips fall open. In her throat, she feels her pulse quicken involuntarily as her mind goes into reeling mode. Not once has she gotten a heart in reaction to a text or picture, not once has Agatha ever replied anything remotely sweet, let alone romantic. Wait - is she reading too much into this? Maybe this is just a mindless acknowledgement, and the heart emoji was already in Agatha's favorites when a thumbs-up wasn't? Rio stares at it, almost waiting for it to disappear again.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“You alright mi amor?” Her mother asks drowsily from the other end of the sofa.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Y-yeah, no, I'm fine.” Rio nods and puts her phone away.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">It's early morning when she looks at it again, daunting on her bedside table. She reaches for it, the hairs on her bare arm standing up in the uncomfortable cold of her room.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">It’s still there and suddenly makes her heart feel even more heavy. Does it mean Agatha misses her too? That the weeks spent apart have haunted her as well? Pulling the blanket back over herself until only her nose sticks out, Rio remembers what it had felt like sleeping next to Agatha. She pushes one hand to the empty side of her bed, where Agatha has never slept. And still, she pretends if she just pushed forward another inch, her finger tips would brush against the brown locks of Agatha’s hair. She pretends to faintly smell Agatha’s shampoo, envisions her sleeping body lifting and lowering with every breath. It becomes so real, Rio has to suppress the urge to snuggle closer. With her hand still stretched out, she drifts off back into sleep, the last thought on her mind daring and courageous as she considers simply calling Agatha in the morning, just to hear her voice.</p><p><b><br/><br/></b></p><p dir="ltr">Sleep makes her forget, of course, and when she wakes up, Agatha has already sent her a picture of her morning coffee in a tall, fancy glass that is half filled with ice. Rio grins at it, because who if not Agatha Harkness would order her morning coffee with extra ice between Christmas and New Year’s.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">The “in-between” days stretch on like that: Little messages with virtually no content, Agatha ranting about being excited to finally come back home from her grandmother’s house on New Year’s Day, Rio sending her a picture of a cute dog she meets on a quick walk. Wilbur teases her about sprinting to her phone every time it vibrates, but Rio knows he means no offense (after all, he picks up her favorite Ben &amp; Jerry’s when he comes home from Walmart on the 29th). Eventually, Rio finds herself searching for a subtle way to ask Agatha if there is any chance they could meet once the new year begins. She has carefully measured the distance between them on MapQuest: there are about six hours between them. They could meet somewhere in the middle - maybe have lunch, go see a movie and drive home again the same day. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Or not. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">There is a cute little Inn with decent rates close to a lake in the middle of the woods. It would only add about thirty minutes to the drive. Online, the pictures promise cozy rooms with Queen beds and a big fireplace in the breakfast room. They usually get lots of snow in January too. Even if Agatha could not chip in, Rio knows she would be able to afford a night or two, she had checked her balance (just in case). Well, if that was an option. And it likely is not.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">She sighs, closing the laptop on her lap and setting it down onto the floor. Maybe next time Agatha says something kind she can make the suggestion, see how Agatha reacts to the notion of potentially seeing each other again. Her words from the airport echo in her mind, that quiet confession that she would have liked to stay another day. Rio thinks of it while she takes a bottle of orange juice from the fridge and fills her glass. It distracts her so much, she barely hears her mother running into the kitchen, shouting in Spanish into her phone so fast Rio has trouble understanding. She looks for pen and paper and rushes into the living room where Willy is watching a recorded game.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“No, no, no, a ver, espérate, necesito saber el nombre del hospital y la dirección. ¡Dime cual es la dirección para poder ir directo desde el aeropuerto!” Rio hears her screech into the telephone before she disappears.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“What’s with her?” He gets up and walks towards Rio.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Uhm… something with a hospital,” admittedly, Rio’s Spanish is not what it used to be, especially not when her mother is so agitated. Both Willy and Rio just keep looking at Victoria in silence until she finally hangs up and turns around to them with a concerned expression on her face.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Tia Amanda had a heart attack.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">It takes Rio a moment to remember her mother’s severely overweight and diabetic aunt. It’s been at least a decade since she’s seen her.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Oh no.” Willy nods, seemingly as unable to come up with a proper response as Rio.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I need to go!”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Go?”, Rio frowns, “go where?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“To the hospital!”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“The hospital in Puerto Rico? It’s New Year’s Eve tomorrow, Victoria. What do you mean?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I’m going to the airport to catch a flight, you’ll drive me!”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I thought we had plans? Is there even a flight today?” Willy raises his hands. The man has a point, they have a booking at Victoria’s favorite restaurant for tomorrow, one she made months ago. But all he gets for his remark is an irritated face before Victoria storms off, cursing in Spanish.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">She makes him drive her to the airport forty-five minutes later. Rio watches from the porch as Willy carries her suitcase through the snow. She barely gets a kiss on the forehead before her mother hops into the car and they drive off.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Their house feels empty without her mother in it. With a sigh, Rio lets herself fall down on the couch. She pouts at the thought of spending New Year's Eve alone. She likes Willy about enough, but they have never really spent any time alone together. She looks at the clock, listens to it tick. Worst case scenario - she goes to bed early. There is no way she goes to the party the other students in her cohort are planning at the dive bar in town. And it’s not like she’s got any friends that don’t already have plans. With a sigh, she drags herself to the shower, washing her hair to kill some time until Willy comes back home.</p><p><b><br/><br/></b></p><p dir="ltr">It's already dark when he does. He has two cartons of pizza in his hand and places them on the kitchen aisle.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“She got onto the last flight, but it's to BQN, so someone has to pick her up,” he moans and opens the first carton.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Thanks,” Rio mumbles and helps herself to a slice of tuna and jalapenos, watching the cheese pull strings as Willy pours himself a glass of coke.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Listen, Rio, I know this isn't how either of us thought we'd spend New Year's, but I've been thinking on the drive.” Rio looks at him curiously, both cheeks full with pizza,  “my sister and her family are at our parents’ house right now. My brother had thought about coming, so the house would have been full, but they are snowed in so they aren't going anymore.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">It takes Rio's brain a second to catch up with Willy's ramblings while she chews on a piece of mozzarella. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Uhm your sister as in Mrs Harkness?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Willy frowns, but quickly answers, “uhm yes, her. Agatha is there with them as well, I’m not sure if you two are still in touch?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio tries to prevent her eyes from going wide with excitement, “oh, just, once in a while?” It comes out as a question and with way too high a pitch. Thankfully, Willy doesn’t notice.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“So I know it’s late, but if you’re up for it, we could have this pizza and then leave? It’s about a four hour drive, if that isn’t too much for you.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Too much? When she gets an unexpected chance at seeing Agatha in the morning? Perfectly disguised as a family visit out of necessity (because really, no one could want her and Willy to be by themselves for New Year’s, they wouldn’t know what to do with each other).</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“N-no that sounds good!” she nods (maybe a tad too eagerly) and Willy gives her a smile of approval as he grabs a slice of pizza.</p><p><b><br/><br/></b></p><p dir="ltr">The air is cold, peppered with lonely snowflakes when they load up the car just after eight. Rio has packed a single pink gym bag for the two nights Willy plans to stay. It contains mostly comfy clothes, but also a black dress with a nice cut-out. She doubts she will get an actual chance to wear it but who knows. Agatha might like it. The bag also contains her toiletries and a small satchel of condoms. Rio had tossed it between her hands a couple of times, wondering if bringing them would jinx any chances she might even get at another kiss. But then she had thought of the heart-emoji and the way Agatha had taken her into her mouth and tossed the satchel into the bag. Better safe than sorry.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">It’s a quiet drive when they leave their street behind. It takes them a while to get onto the A39. By then, a thin layer of fresh snow has coated the roadside. In the light of Willy’s truck, more and more snowflakes dance through the night, thick like tiny, chubby sheep. Rio doesn’t dare messing with the radio. It plays quiet country music that almost puts her to sleep. Whenever her eyes threaten to flutter shut, she shifts her body a little so she at least gets to try and pretend that she is a watchful copilot.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Would you like me to drive for a bit?” she asks, when finally a sign announces a service station just two miles ahead of them.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Oh no,” Willy waves it off, but still exits the highway to get a coffee and use the restroom.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio waits by the car, feeling the weight of her cellphone in the pocket of her down jacket. She knows that Willy had given his mother a call just after they had loaded the dishwasher, but she isn’t sure if anybody had told Agatha. For all Rio knows, she could be out and about with friends, or her grandmother had not deemed it necessary to let her other guests know. In any case, there is no message from her on Rio’s phone. Chewing on her lower lip, she wonders whether she should give her a warning, a quick heads-up that she is on the way when they haven’t even discussed the kiss, or seeing each other again, or all those times they have not had sex.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“My sister just called,” Willy casually says when he gets back, “she got Agatha’s bed ready for you.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Wh-what? Where is Agatha gonna sleep?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“There is a pull-out couch in my father’s office,” he waves it off, “don’t worry about her.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio chews her lip so hard it breaks and bleeds into her mouth. So Agatha knows. She knows and hasn’t texted. What if she sees this as an ambush on her quiet New Year’s Eve, with Rio barging in uninvited?</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“We’ll probably not get there until one,” Willy looks at his watch when they are both back inside the car, “they’ll probably be asleep by then, I hope that’s alright with you?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio nods. It’s probably better to face Agatha in the morning rather than now anyway.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Their drive takes them down even more country roads when they eventually cross the state border. The area is heavily wooded, only now and then does Rio see lights in the distance, lonely farmhouses with singular windows still illuminated late at night. Sipping on his coffee, Willy mentions landmarks from his childhood when they go past one. A farm that used to belong to an uncle, a lake they would sometimes fish at and that he takes his sons to when he can. It makes Rio remember that he has his own family, and it makes her grateful that after all he has still chosen to not leave her by herself. She wants to ask how things are working out between him and his ex-wife, but then she is too shy to be nosy. So she tries to at least actively listen to the short stories about his childhood.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Willy is proven right when they finally pull into a long, wooded driveway that doesn’t look at all as if it is leading to a house. It takes a few seconds until it comes into view. All lights are turned off except the one on the porch. He parks right next to what must be the new Harkness car, the one they won the Denver retreat with. Willy asks her to close her door quietly when he gets out, stretching his legs before opening the trunk.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">The front door is unlocked. He lets Rio in first, turning on the hallway light. It smells like parsley and burnt wood. The narrow walls still have Christmas decorations, countless picture frames showing black-and-white images of the family. When they have taken off their shoes, Willy quietly walks her up to the second floor, showing her what must be her designated room. It is small but warm, with a single bed standing against the wall. The feeling of relief that is her first reflex quickly turns into honest dissapointment. There will be no sharing a bed with Agatha this time. She lets out a silent sigh, tired of punishing herself for the thought. There is nothing wrong with it all - isn’t there? Wanting to be close to Agatha, snuggling with her, being touched by her? It’s not like Agatha isn’t enjoying it.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Already in her pyjamas, Rio walks over to the small bathroom Willy has lit for her. The night hangs on her bones like a heavy curtain and somewhere under her left temple a vein pulses, announcing a headache. She quickly rinses her face and brushes her teeth before she heads back into her room, noticing a door that is slightly ajar. The light only illuminates a few inches, but it looks like an office. When Rio realizes it might be right where Agatha is sleeping, she speeds across the hallway, switching off the light, hoping she hasn’t woken her up.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Her fatigue quickly pulls her under until the ticking of a clock is the last thing she hears.</p><p><b><br/><br/></b></p><p dir="ltr">It is also what wakes her. At first the sound of it steals itself into her dream (one she won't remember later) until Rio wakes enough to realize that there is light coming from behind the curtains. Carefully, she pushes her comforter aside, digging her toes into the soft carpet. Between her legs, she can feel herself half stiff, just limb enough to ignore under a cold shower. If she were home, she'd get rid of it thinking of Agatha, but for varying reasons the thought of doing that here gives her itchy goose-bumps.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Her tired eyes find a stack of towels on a small desk underneath the window. She takes them, realizing that the outside is all white and covered in snow under a grey sky. Thankfully there is nobody in sight when she sneaks into the bathroom, rustling noises and faint music coming from below. She locks the door as soon as she gets in, releasing a breath as she carefully puts her clothes and towels onto the floor.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">The water is cool yet soothing. Rio lets it trickle down her body, gently breathing in and out to cope with the chills. It quickly works though. As her muscles contract, she feels herself growing soft again, relief flooding her bloodstream instead.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">But then suddenly there is a loud pounding on the door, someone hammering against it with their first. Rio almost shrieks in shock, grabbing onto the shower curtain.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“No jerking off before breakfast again!” a sweet voice screeches.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Of course.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Of course it's Agatha. Rio can hear her giggle even from inside the door before she takes the wooden stairs, each step creaking loudly. It takes a second for the vein in Rio's throat to no longer pulse with anxiety. She hasn't even looked at any of these people in the eye yet and already feels embarrassed. When she is done showering, she carefully sticks her head back out into the hallway. It's probably ridiculous because she is fully dressed, but then it would not be a surprise if Agatha had come back just to wait for her and tease her some more. She thankfully hasn't so Rio takes her clothes back into her room before she quietly starts walking down the stairs. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">There is still music coming from further in the back of the house, along with clattering noises. When she reaches the bottom of the stairs, the smell of cinnamon wanders into her nose, causing her mouth to water. It's just past nine, according to the old grandfather clock Rio had not noticed between all the pictures the night before. She tries to make as little noise as possible when she tiptoes into the direction of the noise. It leads her into a cozy living room area with three couches pushed together opposite a TV over a fireplace. Willy is sitting on the one below the window, reading a newspaper. He raises his hand in greeting and points to the open doorway.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“She's in the kitchen.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio swallows hard, catching herself fumbling with her fingers. The single heart-emoji comes back to her mind and then the kiss. All of a sudden she isn't even sure what kind of greeting is appropriate now with the way they have left things off. When she steps into what looks like a humongous farm kitchen, Agatha is the only one in it, working on a counter and turned away from Rio.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“H-hi,” she clears her throat and steps closer. Next to Agatha, something is bubbling on the stove, sizzling in a pan full of oil.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Were you wanking again?” Agatha greets her, turning around and throwing all of her glorious, brown hair back so that it hits her shoulder like a whip. Rio doesn't fail to observe that she is already wearing make-up, a light blush and some eyeliner. It only momentarily distracts her from Agatha's hair, but her brain fails to process the teasing for just a second too long.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“N-no I wasn't! Did you really have to announce it to everybody though?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Agatha snorts, “Willy is the only one here, and you can't hear anything from upstairs from here.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio relaxes her shoulders, “still.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Oh my God, I wouldn't have done it if I thought anybody would hear,” she rolls her eyes and brushes her hair back over her shoulder. As if on auto-pilot, Rio reaches out to help her with a strand she misses.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Perv,” Agatha smiles. And no matter how mean the word is, her voice is soft underneath it, as if she is trying to uphold a facade that is slowly not cracking with deep rifts, but fading like the morning fog.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“What are you making?” Rio takes a deep breath.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Apple fritters. Apples grow out in the pasture and we picked them in October.” When she hands Rio a sliced piece of apple, her fingers glisten with the sugary juice. Rio watches Agatha licks it off without a show, like its stickiness is actually bothering her. It still makes Rio's heart do funny things. But really, when has anything Agatha ever failed to make her heart flutter?</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio reverently bites off a bit, watching Agatha add more fritters into the pot. It’s sweet, but tangy still, as if it’s not ready to give that up yet.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Heard your mom ditched you for New Year’s?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Uh, one of her aunts got sick or something,” Rio swallows the apple mush suddenly afraid of an ulterior motive to the question, “i-is it okay that I’m here? I didn’t want to intrude!”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Agatha raises a brow at her, “I don’t mind.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio lets that sit for a moment. She said ‘mind’ - no ‘care’. And then she adds something quietly that makes Rio’s heart stumble.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I didn’t think I’d get to see you again so quickly.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Maybe there is hope. Maybe there is hope for them after all. Whatever they are or want to be. Rio knows her cheeks are heating up again, they must be as rosy at the apple peels on the counter. If Agatha notices, she doesn’t say so.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I’m really happy,” Rio tries and is proud of how the words come out without a stumble, “I’m really happy to be here.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Agatha doesn’t look at her, just nods, moving the apple fritters through the pot, dipping them under so they soak up more oil. Rio watches the bubbles for a moment and feels her mouth water at the smell. It is then that she hears the front door open at the other end of the house, Agatha’s parents and grandparents pouring in, complaining about the snow on their shoes.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Over breakfast, she is introduced to Dr. and Mrs. Scratch. They each shake her hand and call her sweet girl, excited to meet someone new. Evanora complains about Agatha choosing to fry the fritters instead of baking them in the oven (‘they would have been so much healthier, now look at them, all covered in grease’) as she stuffs two forks full into her mouth, all covered in powdered sugar. Rio marvels at Agatha’s snippy comebacks (there is no world in which she would be this quick-witted), but the two of them stop their argument when Grandma Scratch scolds her own daughter for being too loud this early in the day. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Within the hour there is only a single fritter left. Agatha places it on Rio's plate without looking at her, when she and her father clean up the table. A warmth grows in her chest when she nibbles on it, watching Agatha scurry in and out of the kitchen. Behind her, the grandfather clock strikes eleven. She glances out the frosty window. Perhaps she could convince Agatha to go on a little snow walk, just the two of them, as soon as this is done. Maybe out there in the snow she'd find a bit of courage to tell Agatha all the things she's been meaning to say. At least nobody else would be listening. And nobody could interrupt them. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">The adults’ conversation blends with the quiet music still playing in the living room as she idly twirls her spoon in her cold cocoa, but their voices only register when Willy pushes back his chair.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I don’t appreciate such chaotic mornings,” Agatha’s grandfather grumbles when Willy hands him the newspaper, “especially when there is a guest.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Then you shouldn’t have had three children,” Evanora comments, rolling her eyes and looking at her wrist watch, “do we have a bit of bubbles for tonight?” she directs her question at Willy.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“How would I know?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Well I thought you might have gotten some on your way here.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“No, I did not stop at a liquor store along the interstate, sweet sister,” he sarcastically grins.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Oh for Christ’s sake,” Evanora spits and gets up, all while Rio is still chewing on the fritter.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“If you want to head to town you should go now,” her husband suggests, “would you like me to drive you?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio wonders if she should volunteer instead, leaning to her right so she can try to see Agatha in the kitchen. Their glances meet, but Agatha just shakes her head, eyes blown wide in annoyance. She beckons her over instead, so Rio quietly slides off her chair, taking a few more plates into the kitchen, while the Harknesses debate over which store to drive to.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I think we got better things to do than this don’t we?” Agatha whispers, drying a plate with a towel.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s brain doesn’t catch up for several moments, in fact, she stands there batting her lashes like a useless puppet for longer than she would like to admit. Apparently so long, it causes Agatha to backpedal.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Oh shit - I mean, well I thought you still wanted to… like that’s why you’re here, aren’t you?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Oh. Oh.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“What? No! No I-I mean I’m here for you, n-not just- I mean that’s not wh-”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Instead of letting her finish, Agatha grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the small back door that opens onto the porch. There is no hesitation in her movement, only a sharp urgency that Rio barely has time to register. The moment the door swings open, the cold slams into her face, stinging her skin and stealing the warmth from her lungs.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Outside, the countryside lies buried under a thick blanket of white. Fields stretch out in every direction, softened and muted against the grey sky. At least half a foot of fresh snow must have fallen overnight, smoothing the hills and weighing down the branches of a few nearby trees. Rio blinks against the brightness, her breath rising in thin clouds. Agatha’s grip is still firm on her arm when she speaks.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I just think we should just get it over with?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Over with what?” Rio wraps her arms around herself in a futile attempt to keep herself warm.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Well,” Agatha swallows, “the whole sex thing.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Well, that sounds odd. Odd and uncharacteristically unsure for Agatha Harkness, the girl that let Rio dry-hump her not even six months ago against the back wall of their cabin when anyone could have walked past. Agatha Harkness, the girl that put a “cleaning in progress” sign  in front of a sauna door, just to not let Rio come after getting her rock hard. A frown sneaks onto Rio’s forehead.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Wh-why would you ‘get it over with’?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">She sees a strange struggle in Agatha’s face and gathers she is deciding between truthfulness and another quip. The truth seems to win this time.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Because… well you’re only here until tomorrow, right? And … and I’d rather not try tomorrow morning in a rush in case it’s gonna hurt.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Little clouds of breath are forming in front of Agatha’s face. Rio wants to come so close she can suck them all up, breathing the same air as Agatha. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Wh-why would it hurt? Did it hurt for you the first time?” Rio asks, thinking she might know the answer is either yes or no.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Evidently, the tips of Agatha’s slippers become ferociously interesting to her, because all Agatha does is stare down at them as she hides her hands in her elbows. She looks like a scared, injured vixen that has been forced into the corner of her cage.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“You don’t know, do you?” Rio whispers with a surety in her voice that she considers uncommon for her, “you haven’t… had that kind of sex yet either, have you?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">The air smells clean, almost metallic, and the sky hangs low and pale above them.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“N-no,” Agatha admits with her cheeks blooming, her eyes still averted.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Uhm so… did you ever do any of the things we did with someone else?”<br/>(And yes, Rio hopes the answer is no, even if she knows it likely isn't.)</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I mean obviously not quite… there was some fumbling with a girl from my class…”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“A-and did that go anywhere?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“What do you mean?” Agatha frowns, but finally looks up to Rio.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Like… are you guys together?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Oh my god, no, no that was last spring! There hasn’t been anyone since… well since you.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio nods and tries to hide the way her heart skips at that. Her skin erupts in goosebumps, whether it is from the cold or Agatha’s confession, she isn’t sure. Likely a combination. Out on the field, the wind picks up, it howls through the atmosphere. Agatha looks unsure, eyes now glued on Rio, probably searching for an answer, an affirmation, anything to tell her that what she has just confessed to is okay, that is not one-sided. When Rio realizes it, she wants to pull her into a tight hug. But it also feels daunting, almost as if she has been passed the torch, as if this is now her decision to make. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Well, nothing changes, if nothing changes.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“It’s uhm… getting cold. Should we maybe go back inside?”, she suggests instead and wants to slap herself across the face right after.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Is uhm, is that not okay?” Agatha asks in a hurried voice.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“What?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Not having been with anyone… I-I mean, have you?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio shakes her head, “NO! No, it’s fine, it’s- I’m… I’m like, really glad.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">It brings a smile to Agatha’s lips, “okay.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I mean we can stay here if you’d rather-”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Oh no, it’s freezing,” Agatha huffs, but the smile hasn’t left her face, “c’mon I wanna show you something.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio nods and opens the swing door for her, letting Agatha step inside first. She motions for  her to follow and walks ahead through the kitchen and into the dining room and then upstairs. For a moment, Rio believes she is taking her to the office where Agatha sleeps, but instead she takes Rio into the narrow hallway next to the bathroom before she reaches for a hidden hook pole that Rio had not noticed when she had taken a shower earlier.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Careful,” Agatha gently moves her with a cold hand, before she raises the pole to hook it into a small loop unassumingly hanging from the ceiling. When she pulls on it, a narrow ladder, maybe a foot wide, unfolds like magic. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“After you,” Agatha quietly prompts her and places the pole next to the small shelf again, where it almost vanishes in the shadows. Rio nods and carefully climbs the stairs, holding onto the sides of the ladder, until she reaches the very top of it. The space in front of her is dark, except for some daylight coming from a small window on the left. When she feels Agatha climbing up below her, Rio crawls onto the floor to make space. It only takes Agatha a few seconds to follow her. As soon as she sits next to Rio, she pulls the ladder up until it is fully folded into itself, closing the hatch. In the pale light, Rio can still see her soft cheeks, plump and beautiful. She’s always liked that Agatha has gentle curves, while Rio is slim; that her breasts are round while Rio’s are small, and that her butt is shaped like a pear where Rio’s is flat. One day, she oughta tell her.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Ta-da!,” Agatha whistles and reaches for a small switch right next to the hatch. Suddenly, the attic illuminates with golden light - thousands of little fairylights wound around nails and flung over the beams. The space is somewhat long, but not very wide, definitely too shallow to stand up. Right underneath the ceiling window lays a mattress that fills the space’s width exactly. A messy blanket and two cushions rest on top of it. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“This is where you sleep?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Always. I found it when I was twelve, my granddad helped me clean and set it up. He also insulated it a year later.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Wow,” Rio mouths in quiet marvel. It’s incredibly cozy and even though the house must be decades old, it still smells of wood.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“See I thought… Well, we don’t usually take it slow. But maybe this time we could? My parents don’t know I still sleep here so no one will come and disturb us.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">So they are here for that.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I-I have my condoms downstairs.” Rio swallows, hoping she won’t immediately get hard from the mere thought of pressing close to Agatha again.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I uhm, “Agatha turns around and reaches for a backpack previously hidden in the shadows, “I took the liberty to get some when Mom said you were coming for New Year’s,” she pulls a small, sealed package of condoms from the depths of the backpack.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">It’s presumably a little ridiculous, but she can’t remember a time when she has felt more wanted, more accepted, more cared for.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I-I would really like to kiss you again,” she blurts out, feeling her knees strain from the way she is sitting.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Oh… sure,” Agatha nods and carefully places the box next to the mattress, “should we maybe get on the bed? It’s a bit more comfy.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Yeah,” Rio smiles, feeling her heart in her throat.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Little, invisible needles prickle her skin when her lips find Agatha’s, a sharp bloom of sensation that makes her whole body flare awake. It isn’t chaste this time, not dry or hurried, nothing like the shy brushing of lips at the airport. Agatha still tastes faintly of apples and cinnamon, like something warm pulled from an orchard at dawn.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio’s left hand finds Agatha’s shoulder out of sheer need, a need so strong she fears she might burst into flames if she does not get to touch her. Agatha’s fingers slip up along Rio’s waist in return, slow and searching, like vines learning the shape of a trellis. Something inside Rio opens at that touch, quietly, helplessly, like a blossom that has waited through too many cold mornings and finally feels the first honest warmth of the sun.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">She makes a pact with herself in that suspended moment: If anyone ever asks her where and with whom her first real kiss happened, she will tell them this: In an attic, right under the pale blue winter sky, on a pink, worn out mattress that has carried her lover through too many nights of sleep. Tiny sounds escape Agatha’s lips, labored and lovely. Rio feels her shuffling closer until their bellies touch, just before Agatha topples her over and they land on the mattress, with Agatha’s full weight on her body. Her hair falls around them like a curtain, no, like the leaves of drooping willow branches in spring. Rio wonders whether she is feeling the growing bulge in her pants with the way Agatha rubs against it, until she understands that it is on purpose. It makes her pant in agony. Because none of this is just for fun any longer. Agatha isn’t doing this to rile her up or to assert dominance, knowing she has the higher ground, knowing it isn’t affecting her as much as it is affecting Rio. No, she is doing it because she wants to. It’s a silent admission that this is about her pleasure too.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Carefully, Rio slips a hand in between the two of them, reaching for the spot between Agatha’s legs. She isn’t sure how much Agatha actually feels through her clothing, but her moans grow louder, her kisses turn messier. Soon, she is jittering above Rio, her nails digging into Rio’s flesh.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Okay, okay, stop. I-I don’t just wanna hump your hand,” she stops her with a shaky voice. Her face looks marvellous like this: all rosy and puffy.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“A-Are you sure? Do you think you are…”</p><p dir="ltr">“Wet enough?”, she raises an eyebrow, “yeah Rio, I’m pretty sure I am wet enough.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio nods silently, looking around for the box of condoms, but quickly gets distracted when Agatha begins to lift up her top, taking it off with one swift motion. She wears a pretty red bra underneath, but Rio has no time to appreciate it, because it comes off quicker than the shirt. She swallows hard at the sight, perfect perky breasts with hard nipples staring her down. For no money in the world will she ever admit how many times she has gratified herself to the thought of them and the memory of her cum all over them.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“C-Can I kiss them?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“You can, but you better be inside of me when you do!” Agatha rips the box open and takes one out, “uhm, I guess you better do it yourself this time?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">It makes Rio grin, “sure.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Wait!” Agatha halts her when she tries to hook her fingers under the rim of her sweatpants, her hard length now clearly protruding, “can I?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Agatha’s unfamiliar insecurity almost sucks the air from Rio’s lungs. She nods, of course, because she will not live to see the day where she won’t beg Agatha to touch her. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Gentle hands carefully slide off both her pants and underwear in one and place them next to the mattress. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“M-maybe don’t touch it, I’m already not going to last very long inside of you,” Rio mumbles, suppressing the urge to wipe the pre-cum away with her t-shirt. Opposite her, Agatha slouches her shoulders. Something pensive settles in her face.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I’m sorry if I have ever made fun of you in a way that really hurt you,” she sighs.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“N-no you didn’t!” Rio reaches out, both hands on Agatha’s arms, her heart sinking a little, as if a long boarded-up door is finally opening, “Besides… it’s not like I didn’t like it… I always thought sex was rather… quiet.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Agatha snorts.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“I like your dirty mind,” Rio puckers her lips, “I think I like being told what to do. Which doesn’t mean you always need to tell me what to do…” broadening her shoulders, she reaches for the condom in Agatha’s hand and is greeted with a provocative smile.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Here is how we’re gonna do it,” she takes a deep breath and rips the condom wrapper open, carefully rolling the latex over herself, focusing on it with a scientific approach, “you’re going to sit in my lap and you’re going to lower yourself on me. That way you control the pace, and I hopefully don’t hurt you and maybe I won’t come in like five seconds.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Another snort. A rather beautiful one.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“You like telling me what to do now, don’t you?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“No, not really… but you can always go back to bossing me around later,” Rio suggests, placing her arms around Agatha’s waist, “do you wanna try?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">She nods and shuffles closer, settling her knees around Rio’s thighs. Rio fights down the urge to moan when Agatha wraps her hand around her penis probingly, trying to adjust it in relation to her opening. Instead, she tries to focus on the expression in Agatha’s face, tries to observe the way her breath hitches, the way the flush on her cheeks seems to have a life of its own.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“You are so pretty,” she mumbles when Agatha lowers herself. She moves a hand to her clit, three lovely folds that are plump and full and slowly start wrapping themselves around Rio. When the tips of her fingers touch them, Agatha moans and lets herself drop a little further.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Fuck… you are … you are so big,” she pants, “bigger than I thought.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Closing her eyes, Rio tries to focus more on rubbing circles in the right places than the warm and tight feeling of Agatha stretching around her.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Don’t-don’t stop, Rio. It feels really fucking good,” she lets her head fall against Rio’s, mouth open, eyes closed. She looks like a goddess in ecstasy.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Y-you’re almost there,” Rio stammers, “don’t rush yourself though.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Instead of letting herself drop any lower, Agatha lifts up a bit, mewling with the movement. Rio lets out a simultaneous, eager groan and feels herself pulse. It takes a lot to fight the urge to immediately push Agatha down again, repeating that sensation of being squeezed and milked. She doesn’t have to wait long though and this time, Agatha lowers herself almost all the way, so far that Rio feels herself hitting her cervical wall.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Fuckfuckfuck, Rio. This is so good, fuck, lemme do that again,” she raises herself up one more time and all of a sudden Rio feels like she is being used (and gloriously so), like Agatha is using her for her own pleasure, and really she has never thought of a sweeter purpose in life. So she keeps rubbing her, keeps breathing in the musky smell, keeps watching Agatha raise and lower herself. With her mouth, she catches Agatha’s right nipple and begins to suck on it. It only makes Agatha moan louder and repeat her motions faster. </p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Rio reckons it’s as close to heaven as she’ll ever get. She is disproven when Agatha’s sighs grow completely frantic, her movements sloppy, and she bites down hard into Rio’s neck, stopping herself from screaming. Around her length, she feels a new kind of squeeze, one that comes in waves. And then she is disproven again when Agatha goes somewhat limp, entirely sinking down, taking all of Rio inside of her. She comes with a sudden shriek, eyes wide open, staring into the deep blue of Agatha’s irises, realizing that she is being watched, that Agatha is hazily fixating on her, observing her pleasure. A dry heat shoots up her spine as if she’s being injected with something. It makes her shiver.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Guess that means we’ve both finally lost our virginity now, have we?”</p><p dir="ltr">Rio rolls her half-open eyes, “I don’t care where and when I lost my virginity, as long as it’s with you.”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">She expects a snippy remark, a quip maybe, but instead she watches Agatha’s eyes grow shiny before the girl presses herself against her, arms locking fast around Rio’s shoulders, nose burrowed into the warm crook of her neck. She holds her like this, steady and careful, kissing the skin just behind Agatha’s ear, pretending she doesn’t notice the soft wetness gathering against her neck. It’s as if something has finally cracked open inside Agatha, something so soft Rio hadn’t been sure she’d ever get to it. In quiet assurance, she moves her hand up and down Agatha’s spine. She contemplates asking whether she is fine, but then - why ask, when you already know the answer? Some truths live too close to the surface to be spoken aloud.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Is it greedy if I say I wanna do that again like right now?” she sniffs after a while, hands still around Rio’s shoulders.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">Oh and Rio knows no better way to pass the time.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">After she has cleaned herself up with her own pants (Agatha promises to put them in the wash so Rio won’t leave for the bathroom), she kisses Agatha’s belly until she giggles and stoops lower until she moans, hand tangled in Rio’s hair, almost ripping it out when she comes. They lie under the mattress, giggling, as the sky turns dusky until Agatha lazily wraps a hand around Rio’s half hard length, first stroking it gently, then with more rigor, whispering obscenities into Rio’s ear.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“Poor little Rio, all hard and desperate to pump her cum all over my hand, huh?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">She doesn’t last long after that. And it’s a wonder she doesn’t immediately get hard again when Agatha licks it all off, hand between her legs, before she holds on to the beams and lets Rio finish her while she rides her face.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">They drift into a short slumber right after, Agatha’s head on Rio’s shoulder, the comforter lazily flung over them. The warmth between them settles like a fresh linen sheet, the kind that forms only when two bodies trust the space they share. Only half aware of her surroundings, Rio dreams of feeding a flock of snow geese with ripe, red apple wedges. The birds gather around her like living snowdrifts, their wings brushing her shins as gently as petals falling from a wind shaken branch. Looking down, her feet are bare in the snow, but they are never cold. Every time she opens her eyes, the sky has grown a little darker and the fairy lights glow a little brighter. They shimmer like tiny, magic blossoms waking at dusk.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">But eventually, it is Agatha that wakes her, drags her back to reality and away from the geese. Rio’s conscience surfaces slowly, like a fruit rising through cool water, reluctant to break the surface. For a moment she clings to the fading warmth of the dream, and to the even warmer weight of Agatha beside her, wishing she could stay in that soft, suspended place a little longer.</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“That day at the lake, when we first got to know each other, what did you think of me?”</p><p><b> </b></p><p dir="ltr">“That you were the prettiest girl that I had ever seen. And at the same time, that you were so far outside my league, I would make a fool out of myself for even trying to get your attention.”</p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">“Funny,” Agatha mumbles, “I thought the same when we said goodbye,” she looks up to Rio, meeting her eyes, “maybe you were meant for me.”</p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p><p dir="ltr"> </p>
