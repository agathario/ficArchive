     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Billy tells Agatha to run into Rio’s toxic embrace and Agatha decides to eventually do just that.
     </p>
<p>
      Except Rio isn’t toxic, not really, but what does the kid know about these things?
     </p>

      *All things belong to not me, and the general disclaimer.

<blockquote>
<p>
      Edited: Chapter 4 is the sex.
     </p>
<p>
      There may be sex? Multiple chapters, not sure how many. The first is short, more of a teaser really. We’ll see what happens and where the story takes me.
     </p>
<p>
      I haven’t written like this in well over a decade, almost two. Here’s hoping I’m not too rusty.

<em>
      “Time to go into the light, or Rio’s toxic embrace, or wherever you deserve to spend eternity.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The words echo in Agatha’s head hours, days, weeks later. She can’t shake the notion, the very thought, of Rio’s embrace being toxic.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness is the only being that Rio Vidal, Death herself, has ever been in love with. The only being that has ever really seen or understood Rio, understood Death. Rio bent the rules for Agatha. Would give her the entire world if she could, but couldn’t give her the one thing that they both wanted the most.
    </p>
<p>
     Their son. Not in a
     <em>
      living
     </em>
<em>
      happily ever after
     </em>
     way at least.
    </p>
<p>
     While very alive and very human Agatha had hated and detested Rio for centuries, even if they had met up on multiple occasions during that time; Ghost Agatha had more of an understanding now. She couldn’t face Nicky yet. She had to redeem herself, however that would manifest.
    </p>
<p>
     She was, however, ready to face Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     While others’ had seen them as toxic at times, had seen Rio as toxic, she wasn’t. Not really. She showed Agatha the care that she had never received growing up. She cared for Agatha. Gave Agatha more time, borrowed time, with their son. Rio was the only stable, constant thing, in her centuries of life. Fitting, as she was Death and Agatha caused so much of that herself. Most importantly, Rio saw her.
     <em>
      Te Veo
     </em>
     .
     <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had wrestled with going to Rio. With calling her. Seeing her beloved’s face again, for weeks. She decided that it was time that she do exactly what her pseudo-son had told her to do.
    </p>
<p>
     Go into Rio’s
     <strike>
      toxic
     </strike>
     inviting embrace. If she would still have her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha manifested herself into a clearing, much like the one the coven had gathered in that night. The night Rio had proclaimed that Agatha was her scar. She was getting very good at the ghost thing and smiled to herself. She closed her eyes and took a deep, shaking breath. She could do this. She was Agatha Harkness. The Purple Witch. One of the two most powerful witches in history.
    </p>
<p>
     Surely she could face her wife.

<em>
      Rio, my love, come to me.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It rang in her head, the subtle call from Agatha. She felt herself being pulled and tried to resist it. Agatha had said herself that she didn’t want to see her when she died. In fact, Agatha had kept her eyes closed so that she didn’t look Rio in the face, in the eyes, as she accepted Death’s Final Kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood in the void, feeling that call with her entire being. Her heart. Her black heart that hadn’t beaten since her estranged wife had been taken into the ground, pulsed. Rio gasped with surprise as she felt it flutter back to life as she muttered a curse.
    </p>
<p>
     She did not want to answer Agatha’s call. She was hurt, wounded by the last words Agatha had said to her. Her wishes that she would never see her again.
    </p>
<p>
     She had agreed.
     <em>
      Okay.
     </em>
     She was screaming and writhing in pain from the finality of it. She knew Agatha was a ghost. Something she hated. Something the purple witch had done just to piss Rio off one last time.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Come to me, my love.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha called again, and the pull was even stronger. Death knew that she couldn’t resist going to her. She had never been able to resist Agatha, not in life, and apparently not in death. She knew she would answer that call sooner or later, and she might as well get it over with. Whatever fresh hell Agatha Harkness was going to give her, she would take. She always had and always would.
    </p>
<p>
     _____
     <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     The air around Agatha grew still and cold. She heard a light rustling and knew that Rio had joined her in the clearing. Agatha smiled as she slowly opened her eyes to see the woman she loved standing ten feet in front of her. Every fiber of her ghostly being sparked. A flood of grief, desire, heartache, longing, and an epic love washed over her as she took in Rio’s skeletal form. She had expected to see her like this. Knew she would be in her true form. The ghost and the skeleton.
    </p>
<p>
     They stared at each other for what seemed like years, when Agatha finally spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     ”We need to talk.” She tried to say it calmly, even though the words sounded stupid. They weren’t the ones she had originally planned - they just fell out of her transparent mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     ”You fucking think?” Death growled, not opening her mouth. “I hate ghosts.” She added.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew she would say that, but it still stung to hear those words directed at her. For all the hate that she could direct at Rio, she couldn’t fathom her actually hating her back.
    </p>
<p>
     After all, she didn’t really hate Rio.
     <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     “Then give me a more solid looking body.” She replied, knowing what the sight of her as a ghost was doing to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     She winced. She could absolutely make Agatha appear solid. Give her a more natural looking form. It would be slightly breaking rules, but she didn’t give a fuck about that. Not right now. Not when the only thing she wanted to do was run into Agatha’s arms and stay there forever.
     <br/>
<br/>
     Maybe Agatha was the toxic one in this relationship.
    </p>
<p>
     ”Only because I’m distracted by literally seeing through you.” Rio replied as Agatha returned to her solid, human-like, form. She herself transformed back into her human form. It was easier that way. More personal.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chewed on the inside of her cheek, trying to will the words to form. She had practiced what she was going to say, but now, standing in front of Rio, she wasn’t sure how to say them.
    </p>
<p>
     ”You said we needed to talk, so talk.” Rio responded after a few beats. She was anxious and hated the feeling. She hated feelings in general, at how messy they were. Agatha was the only being that could make Death anxious.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gathered her courage, her strength, as she took a deep breath and stepped towards the beautiful woman in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said some things…” she started.
    </p>
<p>
     ”That were incredibly painful? That were completely uncalled for? That cut the very fabric of my soul?” Rio unleashed. She had planned to let Agatha speak. To hear her out. Yet the words flowed freely instead.
     <br/>
     “You called me evil. You hurt me, and not in the way I enjoy. You said you didn’t want to see my face after you died. Why did you call me? To hurt me again? I love you Agatha, but you don’t want it or me. You made that very clear.” She stopped then. Knowing she had conveyed only a sliver of her actual pain.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said
     <em>
      when
     </em>
     I die.” Agatha whispered, tears already falling down her cheeks. She didn’t know she’d still be able to cry, and it surprised her. She looked up into Rio’s eyes and continued. “I didn’t want you to see me die. I didn’t want you to reap my soul. I was so hurt and had so much pain and rage towards you.” Her words got stronger, louder, as she put all of her feelings into them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio returned her gaze and took a few steps towards her. Only a few feet remaining between them.
     <br/>
     “And now?” She responded, much softer this time and without the bite her previous words had held.
    </p>
<p>
     Pain and love washed over Agatha’s face as she replied, “I missed you.”
     <br/>
<br/>
     With that, she closed the gap in between them, wrapping her arms around the other woman’s waist and pulling her close, as she pressed her lips against Rio’s.
    </p>
<p>
     She brought her left hand to Rio’s cheek, her right arm pressing their bodies together. She cupped her jaw as she parted her lips against her loves. Rio kissing her back instinctually. Her lips worked against Rio’s mouth, her tongue sliding against hers. She moaned into Rio’s mouth as she responded, gripping her face harder. Rio brought her hand up and wrapped it abound her wrist, the other wrapping in Agatha’s hair.
     <br/>
<br/>
     It was more passionate than their last kiss, if that was possible. While the last kiss had been a goodbye, this was an apology, an acceptance, a hello, and an act of being forgiven all at the same time. Agatha put her entire soul into that kiss. Conveying the words she could not speak. Rio understood everything that Agatha was trying to convey, and responded in kind. Finally, she pulled away from Agatha, still holding her close, as she pressed their foreheads together. Her breathing was ragged, even if she didn’t need to breathe, it felt like the thing to do at the moment.
     <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     “Well. That was certainly a talk.” She breathed, as her brown eyes met piercing blue ones. “We should actually use our big girl words.” She added.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned back, not breaking eye contact. “I love you.” She responded, “I know you did what you had to do. You gave me time I wasn’t supposed to have. I still can’t face him, yet. I want to, eventually. I want us to be together. I was, not a good wife…” her lip quivered as her voice trailed off.
     <br/>
<br/>
     Rio stroked the purple witch’s cheek while waiting for her to continue. Tears escaping from both women.
     <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     “I just wanted a chance to say goodbye. To him, to you. You took him in the middle of the night and disappeared.”
    </p>
<p>
     ”I thought it would be easier that way. I wanted to cause you the least amount of pain as possible.” She continued, “I love you too, and I had to do it, and I’ve hated myself for it ever since. I only wanted us to be together. You’re not a bad wife, you were a human grieving.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, pulling Rio in for another kiss. When they broke apart, she looked at Death in the eye once more. “Where does that leave us?”
    </p>
<p>
     A smirk came across Rio’s face as she replied, “In a clearing in the woods.”

     “In a clearing in the woods.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had returned Rio’s smirk. They had always had the playful and sarcastic banter. Especially after tender moments of revealing feelings. It was their way. The way they cut the emotional tension, often inserting the sexual tension that was always around them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Brat.” Agatha remarked. Death’s face went soft as she cupped her witch’s face and whispered, “Only for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was true. Death, the ultimate top, was complete putty for Agatha. As if Agatha was created solely for Rio, and she for her. The way she could control the cosmic entity, make her come completely undone. They still needed to talk things through. Centuries of hurt. Centuries of coming together and running away. It was no wonder they had become toxic to each other, especially in the eyes of others. It was one of Rio’s greatest regrets, the other being the complete lack of communication they had about their son. She planned on changing that. She never wanted to be seen as toxic again. Granted, she had been the one that wanted Agatha back. The one that had always been there, waiting for her lover to return. Waiting for the forgiveness she so desperately craved.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t until she was forcefully backed up against a tree by Agatha, that Rio came out of her thoughts and back to the present. Agatha’s mouth moved against hers hungrily, her hands sliding up her bare stomach towards the clasp of the cape she wore. Rio put her hand against Agatha’s chest and pushed gently as she broke the kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” she breathed, trying to recover from the kiss and gather her thoughts before Agatha could take her against the tree. The witch looked at her, eyebrows knitted in confusion. “Agatha,” she continued, “I want this. I want you, but I don’t want to fall into old habits. I don’t want this to be a short lived thing, where we make love and a few months later, you run again. I want us to be us again. Wives. Not estranged lovers that fuck every decade.” She looked at the ghost, searching her eyes for emotion, answers.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked back into Rio’s eyes, seeing the hurt that she had caused over the centuries. Had they been toxic through the ages? Yes. Had she been the main cause of that? Maybe.
     <br/>
     “Well, I’m dead, so I can’t exactly escape you, being that that’s your gig and all.” She replied with a slight smile. Rio directed a pointed look at her, dropping her arms and dislodging from the tree, away from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m serious. I’m tired. I’m ready for you to come home, Agatha. To me. Eventually to our son,” she saw the worry flash across Agatha’s face, “when you’re ready.” She added quickly. She knew Agatha still had business to take care of before she was ready to see Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     “Weren’t you the one that started with the sarcasm?” Agatha responded, looking at Rio and already missing the feeling of her body against hers. She saw the look Rio returned and sighed. “Did we not seal that with a kiss? Rio, my love. I know you did what you had to do. Nicky was sick and I refused to come to terms with that. I understand that now. I needed a place to direct my anger and you were the easiest target. It was so much easier to hate you. When you didn’t return, my heart completely shattered. I didn’t get to say goodbye to either of you. Every time I saw you, it was easier to connect in our grief than to truly discuss anything. Even though you did try, and I was the one that ended up leaving. Every time. I wanted you to hurt like I did. Wanted to inflict that pain on you.”
    </p>
<p>
     The tears had returned. She had hated sharing her feelings. Hated showing that vulnerability. She was Agatha Harkness. One of the most powerful beings in the world, and still was, even in death. Just as Rio was putty for Agatha, she gave herself completely to Rio. They saw each other for who they really were, scars (literal and metaphorical), flaws, ugly warts and all.
    </p>
<p>
     “I want to be your wife again. To do it right. Again. The one Death comes home to. I assume that we can still make it work this way, in death.” Her eyes were slightly pleading, not knowing exactly how this would work. She could touch Rio and be touched by her. Was this solid form permanent or merely temporary due to Rio’s disdain for ghosts?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. Satisfied with Agatha’s words. The explanation and apology.
    </p>
<p>
     “If ever there was a love that could transcend death, it’s ours.” Rio replied through her own tears. She walked back towards Agatha. Now that she had more of an idea where they stood, she needed to be close to her. To kiss her, to fall into bed with her. To give herself completely to the ghost witch.
    </p>
<p>
     “You would have been able to make your body solid on your own, eventually.” Rio added, as she wrapped her arms around the older woman’s waist once more. “You can keep the form. Like you told Billy, you’re a quick study.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha feigned a gasp. “You heard our conversations? You creep.” She knew Rio automatically heard her, that she hadn’t intentionally been spying. They were just that connected and Death knew all.
    </p>
<p>
     With that, she kissed Rio again. Tenderly, lovingly, trying to undo the hurt and the past. The kiss grew heated, quickly. Their hands desperate to touch the other’s bare skin. Rio was pinned against the tree again, her legs wrapped around Agatha’s waist, the other woman holding her there with ease.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha broke away from Rio’s lips and started to trail kisses down her neck, hands moving up to remove her cloak. Rio shook her head then as she whispered, “As much as I want you. Everywhere. All of the time.” She fisted Agatha’s hair as the woman bit down lightly on her neck. “I don’t want our reunion to be quick and dirty up against a tree.”
     <br/>
     She snapped her fingers and they were in Agatha’s bedroom, in the same position, with the wall taking the place of the tree. Agatha was wearing the robe she had had on the day Rio had blasted through the door, and Rio, ever the romantic, was wearing a matching one.
    </p>
<p>
     “Welcome home, baby. Take me to bed.” Rio grinned. Agatha gave her a mischievous smile, spun them around and gently lowered her wife to the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Gladly.”

     “Welcome home, baby. Take me to bed.” Rio grinned. Agatha gave her a mischievous smile, spun them around and gently lowered her wife to

     their bed.
     <br/>
     “Gladly.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been waiting, rather impatiently, for this moment. She had almost had
     <strike>
      hate
     </strike>
<strike>
      detest
     </strike>
     rage sex with her when Rio had first shown up and blasted the door off the hinges. Comfort sex on The Road. Farewell sex at the end. All of these would have terribly traumatized the kid, as he had been present all of those times. In hindsight that was probably the only reason they hadn’t.
    </p>
<p>
     It was finally the right time for them to come back together and actually make love. Not the fleeting flings and passionate, but temporary hookups they had had over the centuries. As broken as Agatha had been she had never stopped loving the original Green Witch. Rio had always been there, waiting for Agatha to return, to be with her again. She knew that it would be permanent one day. That they would live and be together again, like they had been all those years ago.
    </p>
<p>
     The time had finally come. Agatha had forgiven her and she had forgiven Agatha. They would eventually reunite with their son, when Agatha was ready, but right now it was their time. Time to reunite as wives, lovers, soulmates, the Skeleton and the Ghost.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laid Rio on their bed, undressing her as she did so. It had been roughly ten years since the last time they had been together. That had been different. It had been yet another moment where they had met, fallen into bed, and Agatha had bolted shortly after. As had been their way.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was not going to bolt this time. She had returned to Rio’s loving embrace for good and she planned to show her everything. How much she loved her, missed her, cared for her, and just how terribly sorry she was for not staying with her in life. She was very grateful for the solid body.
    </p>
<p>
     She straddled her wife’s naked body as their kissing turned even more heated, her long dark hair cascading around them. She took her own robe off then lowered herself down, pressing their bodies together as she slotted her thigh in between Rio’s legs, against her already wet sex. Rio gasped as she grabbed the back of Agatha’s head with one hand and kissed her deeper. Teeth clashing, tongues swirling against each other. She cupped her ass with the other hand as she started to grind against the thigh in between her legs, causing them both to moan at the continued contact.
     <br/>
     Agatha raised up slightly and slid a hand from Rio’s shoulders, down to her breast, stroking lightly before pinching her nipple and eliciting a gasp. Agatha broke away from her lover’s lips, trailing kisses down Rio’s exposed neck, her collarbones and down to her other breast. She dragged her tongue across smooth, silky skin before circling the hardened nipple, mimicking how she was manipulating the other nipple with her fingers. Rio gasped as Agatha bit down and pulled slightly before releasing the nipple with a pop.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmm, someone’s excited.” She smiled, looking up at the woman writhing underneath her, feeling the wetness grow against her leg as Rio tried to get more friction.
     <br/>
     “Getting impatient?” She added, as she brought her head back up and kissed her again, swallowing the moans of the woman beneath her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Baby, please.” Rio breathed. “It’s been so long. I need you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had wanted to take her time, to savor Rio. Make her beg. She didn’t want to risk making her too sensitive though, and they had eternity together to do anything and everything. She could speed things up now and slow them down later. The decision made, Agatha snaked a hand in between their bodies and trailed it over where Rio wanted it most, taking place of her thigh and causing her breath to hitch. Agatha smiled as she kissed her again, sucking her lower lip in between her teeth and nibbling lightly. She moved her fingers between Rio’s folds, quickly moving to her clit and tracing circles around it, the way she knew would drive her crazy. Rio rocked her hips in rhythm with Agatha’s fingers as the ghost worked her clit. Agatha knew exactly what Rio liked and what she needed. She started rubbing harder as Rio moved her hips faster. She moved her hand and slid two fingers inside of Rio and curled them. She began working against the spot that would make Rio come undone, as her moaning grew louder. Agatha responded with a moan of her own as she felt Rio begin to clench around her. She placed her thumb back on her clit, working her there as well and pulling more moans and whimpers from the woman beneath her. She pumped harder as she trailed kisses to the base of Rio’s throat and then over to her ear. She lightly bit her earlobe and whispered “Come for me my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     At that, Rio turned her head to the side and captured Agatha in a bruising kiss, using one hand to hold the back of her neck as the other grasped her back and she dug her nails in. Agatha felt Rio release around her fingers and moaned as Rio gave a shout as she fell apart. Agatha worked Rio through the orgasm and then another before pulling her fingers away and running her hand back up Rio’s body. Her hand was grabbed and she gasped as Rio broke their kiss in order to take her fingers into her mouth, licking her juices off each one while looking into Agatha’s eyes and then releasing them with a pop. She smiled up at the purple witch, kissing her again before grabbing the back of her thighs and tugging.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew exactly what Rio meant and moved to straddle her face. Rio wrapped her hands around Agatha’s hips and pulled her down to her mouth. She was already dripping from pleasuring her wife and her anticipation was growing. Rio slid her tongue through Agatha’s folds before focusing on her clit. She alternated between licking and sucking as Agatha’s hands twisted in her hair, pulling her closer and rocking against her face. Rio slowly inserted a finger into her wife, curling it forward as she continued sucking and licking her clit. Agatha moaned and moved faster, fucking her wife’s face and finger as Rio added a second and then third. Agatha cried out as she moved faster, clenching around Rio’s fingers and feeling her moan against her clit as she came hard on her face. Rio continued licking her wife, cleaning up after her and working her through the climax.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slowly dislodged herself and laid beside Rio, turning her face toward her and kissing her passionately, tasting herself on her lips. When she broke the kiss, she cupped Rio’s face with both hands and looked deeply into her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “To answer your question from a few months back, I DO want you. I’ve wanted you since the first time we met and I will always want you. You are mine and I am yours. For eternity.” Agatha said, before kissing her tenderly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, “I missed you, my love.” She gently tucked a lock of Agatha’s hair behind her ear before gently pushing her onto her back as she wrapped an arm and a leg over her, laying her head on her shoulder and nuzzling her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her on the forehead and held her. “I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     They held each other for what seemed like hours, enjoying the way the other felt before Rio kissed Agatha again, passionately. She pulled back, smiling mischievously. “Round two?”
    </p>
<p>
     They spent the night reclaiming each other before falling asleep in the other’s
     <strike>
      toxic
     </strike>
     loving embrace.
