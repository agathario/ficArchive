<em>
<b>LOS ANGELES</b>
</em>
<em> — </em>
<em>
<b>Agatha Harkness</b>
</em>
<em>, fresh off her Oscar-bait co-starring turn in </em>
<em>
<u>
<b>Red Raven</b></u>, has been spotted several times now out to lunch </em>
<em>with director </em>
<em>
<b>Rio Vidal</b>
</em>
<em>. Are these, as official word has it, business meetings? Simply friendly get-togethers? Or are these cozy </em>
<em>tête-à-tête</em>
<em> rendezvous a sign of something deeper?</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio scoffed as she scrolled past the news item, then scrolled back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Option A," she muttered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Of course the press and the public wanted it to be far, far more than it was. They couldn't go five minutes without assuming any well-known alpha and omega seen in vague proximity to each other must be a couple. It was an old-fashioned sort of assumption, and Rio wondered if it bothered Agatha as much as it bothered her. They were not friends, precisely, but they had a civil soon-to-be working relationship that, hell, might <u>become</u> friendship during or after filming, but they would never be more than that.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The car rolled to a stop, and Rio took a deep breath before even considering getting out. She did not want to be here today, to get chewed out over fucking pre-production delays that were not her fault. She was, however, looking forward to the table read just after. Now that they had the cast nailed down, it would be fantastic to finally have them all in one room going over things. Especially Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She had been the hardest get, at first because she was not considered leading lady material yet by the folks at the top. Later, when <em>Red Raven</em> came out and she basically blew everyone out of the water with her performance, it had been tough because suddenly everyone wanted her. And why would they not? She had talent, heart, skill, and beauty. She had done her turns in comedy, drama, everything really. She was what they needed for this film, and Rio was sure of it.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When the driver came around and opened the car door, drawing her out of her thoughts, Rio growled softly, then felt awful as she saw the young delta cringe back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sorry, Will," she sighed, gathering up her things and struggling out of the car.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's okay, Ms. Vidal. We're chill."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shaking her head, Rio laughed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, so, after you take me home later, I shouldn't need the car the rest of the day. Why don't you get a jump on your day off tonight and go see that gorgeous guy you've had your eye on? And take the car. Impress him."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You mean it?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure, dude."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks! Oh, hey, you need any help getting..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I got it. Thanks, man."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Settling the strap of her main bag a little more comfortably across her body, Rio huffed out a breath and started the slow hobble into the production office. The moment she was through the door Richards was swanning over, acting like he owned the place.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Well, he did own the place, but...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio! How's everything?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uhm, let's see. My leg is still screwed up, I spilled coffee all over my kitchen this morning, the press is a piece of shit, and I'm like a day from going into a rut that my emergency meds won't cover. How's everything with you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, it... I suppose it could be worse. Ready for the read-through later on?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"As I'll ever be. 'scuse me a minute."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Holy shit she was glad it was a Friday and she would have the weekend free.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Ducking down a small side corridor, Rio slammed into the restroom. Her leg hurt like hell, and her head was spinning with the flood of chemicals that her body was pumping to prepare for rut. It was days like this she really wished the basic suppressants worked for her. Digging through her bag, she found her pain meds and dumped a couple into her hand—and about five more down the drain.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Oh well. She needed them less lately. Tossing the dose in her hand into her mouth, she dry swallowed and immediately regretted it, bending down and turning on the tap to actually drink directly from the source. That done, she straightened up and saw in the mirror that she looked like a wreck. Hair a mess, bags under her eyes, her eyes themselves just a little glazed and bloodshot in that halfway-to-rut look.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Reaching down to her hip bag, she fumbled for one of her emergency packs. She popped out the no-touch swab, wiped down her preferred injection site—which she had chosen as an edgy 20-something and now regretted outside of certain scenarios—and then jammed the injector home.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit," she hissed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Immediately she started to feel a little more calm. Checking that the injector had closed up and capped properly, she rolled it back up in the pack and tossed the whole thing in the trash, then rifled through her main bag for a comb to get her hair in order.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once she had herself somewhat presentable and under control, she slopped everything back into her bag, grabbed her cane, and sighed as she made her way back out to the vestibule.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There, sitting across from the reception desk, was Agatha Harkness.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey," Rio instinctively chirped.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The young actress startled in her chair, and when she looked over, the director thought her eyes looked a bit teary. That she was exuding the same nervous overripe melon scent she had the first time they met also tipped Rio off that something might be wrong.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You're sorta early," Rio said, approaching slowly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, I... I was... I wanted to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Calm down, okay? Nervous?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded as Rio sat down, leaving a chair between them.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"The imposter syndrome is strong," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I get that. I do. Guess we all go through it. Trust me when I say, though, that you're gonna be great. We wouldn't have cast you if we didn't think you were right for the role."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's just... I mean, I still worry so much that maybe whatever work I've gotten is all based on my name, ya know?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, that's a bit I'll never get, but Agatha, you're talented. Maybe some folks'd want you in their projects because you're a politician's kid, but we want you in <em>Young Allies</em> because we know you can do this. We know you're the one for the lead."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The nervous scent was a little lighter now, but Agatha was still visibly uneasy. Standing, Rio nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Come with me a minute?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha practically leapt to her feet to follow the director to the restroom corridor. They stood just within the mouth of the passage, still visible to anyone passing by, and Agatha slumped back against the wall.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Listen," Rio said, "this is gonna be a great experience. Your first lead? That's a huge deal. It's natural that you're nervous; hell, I've directed eight films and <u>so</u> much television, and I get nervous every time."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup. Is there anything I can do for you to help you feel better? Anything at all. Is there something special we can set up for you, or something..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No. I... It's better if I just go through it, I guess."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. That's your decision. But if there's ever anything..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just... What if I don't fit with the rest of the cast? Everyone else in the cast is so experienced, and a lot of them have worked together before, and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They're all great folks, okay? They'll all love you, I guarantee it. And if there is a problem with anyone, if you get nervous, whatever, you can come and talk to me, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. Now hey, I know you been in here before, but lemme give ya the grand tour. I know you haven't seen the cool stuff."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">By 'the cool stuff,' Rio of course meant the elite coffee machine up in the head honcho's office. She showed Agatha all over the building, noting as she did the omega's hesitance to enter the common spaces that exuded strong alpha smell. That was classic, rather old school etiquette training for omegas. No one in this building, anyway, abided much by them other than for safety reasons.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once they reached the office with <u><em>REED </em></u><u><em>RICHARDS</em></u> scrolled across its imposing doors in big, tacky gold lettering, Rio went in, turning back when she sensed Agatha not following.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mon in."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But this... It's an office belonging to an alpha. It's a private space."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Reed doesn't care. This is his office. Not like I'm at his house, diving cock first into his mate's nest."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha's eyes went wide, and Rio knew she had way overshot with the remark.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry. We just... We talk real casual around here. I know it's bad stuff, and I really do try not to say that shit..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I've heard my sire say worse," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can I get you a coffee?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You don't have to."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want to, though. I'm gonna have one. I gotta have, like, at least three cups before noon or my nerves are shot."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha still refused the coffee. When they left the area, Rio noticed her walking much further behind now, head down, shoulders a little hunched.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, look, I know you're scared," Rio said, dropping back to fall in step beside Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm just so nervous that this is a fluke. I know you guys hired me because of the <em>Red Raven</em> reviews..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uhm, maybe some of them did, but I wanted you because I saw that movie and I've seen a lot of your other work and I could not imagine anyone else in the role of Veronica."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked up, and her blue eyes were almost luminous.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Your confidence in me... It's very flattering."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, well, maybe you deserve flattery. You're a great talent, Agatha. I can see you doing big things in this industry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then Agatha blushed, and Rio's heart throbbed. Unfortunately, that was not the only thing that throbbed. Looking away quickly, Rio gulped down half of her coffee. Externally she hoped she was projecting an image of ordinary calm competence.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Inside, she was arguing with her alpha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Pretty, pretty omega.'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Yes, she's a very nice looking young woman.'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Looks soft.'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'I </em>
<em>wouldn't know.'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Would probably birth strong, healthy pups.'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Nope. Not going there. No mating, no pups. Not even any fucking.'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'But pretty!'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Can you not even manage to simply appreciate the aesthetics of beauty without wanting to rail the beauty?'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Mate.'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Never. No mate. No pups. It's not allowed for us to have that.'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That shut up the more primitive part of her brain as usual. Rio had decided after the horror of her twenties that she would never be in a relationship, would never sire children, and would be perfectly content in her solitude. The primitive alpha drive part of her brain <u>hated</u> that.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Probably because a more conscious part of Rio still wanted all of that stuff. A partner. A family. But her own atrocious childhood and the awful things a decade ago had shown her that this was not something she should think of as a possibility.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, are you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Feeling Agatha's hand on her arm, Rio turned sharply. She must have looked upset, even angry, because instantly the omega cringed away hard enough to bump a shoulder against the wall. Then she was almost crouching, head down, hands locked at the back of her neck.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sorry! Sorry. I... I'm sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha... Agatha hey, no. No, I'm sorry, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio could not easily crouch down, so she dropped down to sit on the floor, cursing softly at the pain in her leg for a moment before gently reaching out to rub Agatha's back. The initial touch led to further cringing, further attempts to make herself small, and Rio felt horrible. By now nearly everyone was aware through things said passingly in interviews and at parties that Agatha had a less than pleasant childhood. She never outright said the word 'abuse,' but people deduced that was part of it. A few times during the casting process, the omega had mentioned, almost jokingly, being 'halfway cracked up' due to trauma. Everyone had laughed thanks to her tone.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Now, Rio understood that whatever had happened was no laughing matter.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, it's okay. You didn't do anything wrong, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Fuck, was this girl going to be able the pressure of taking on a leading role? She had projected an aura of confidence at all the prior meetings, other than some initial fear or nervous scents. But this...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey. Hey, c'mere," Rio said softly, coaxing Agatha to unbend a little.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm sorry, I... Just I thought you were angry and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm not angry. I was just sort of distracted and you shocked me back to reality a little. It's okay, I promise."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I, uh... I have some... Pretty strong fear of upsetting alphas. I'm working on it, I swear. My therapist..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Look, it's fine. Think you'll be okay later on at the table read and all? Lot of alphas in the room."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Probably. I just... Fuck, I should just give up on all of this, shouldn't I?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Give up on..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"On having a career. My mother was right. I'm an idiot and I can't make it and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, you made it this far. And I think you can make it even further. Just gotta work on this stuff, you know?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can you... Can you help me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There was such fear and confusion in Agatha's eyes, and Rio immediately wanted to do anything she could to help.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure. I'll back you up, help you out. I know the ropes around here, so I'd be glad to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Would you keep me safe from the other alphas?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Nothing to keep you safe <u>from</u>, Agatha. A lot of them are all bluff and bluster. They'll act all badass and intimidating, but they won't do anything."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"A lot of them doesn't mean all."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, no. There are shitty folks everywhere. I can warn you about who to avoid, how to get around..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm asking you to scent me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The directness of the words shocked Rio so much that she was certain she had heard wrong.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, what?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just... Now and then, during production. That way, people will think I belong to you, and they'll leave me alone."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Scenting isn't inherently sexual or anything. People do it for family and friends all the time."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know that. But if I do that for you, even though it isn't a sex thing, people are bound to <u>think</u> it is. That could look questionable. It's bound to start stories you slept your way to the top or something."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, please, those are already in full circulation. I gained a little weight once and the tabloids decided I was pregnant by some alpha producer I've never even met."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio shook her head, vaguely remembering hearing about that.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please," Agatha said, "I just want to feel safe. Accepted. Just through this production. After that, hell, we never have to see each other again, maybe."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We'll probably see each other around at parties and stuff. And what if we end up working together again one day?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We'll ignore each other at parties and have a polite working rapport."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">This was madness. Absolute insanity. To even consider scenting this woman...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Think it'll really help you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah. I... I really do."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. Help me up?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha drew herself up to her full height, then offered a hand to raise Rio from the floor. Steadying herself, Rio looked along the hall, then nodded and waved Agatha along to follow.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"In here. Empty office. C'mon."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They made their way inside, and Rio closed the door behind them, leaving them in near darkness bar the trickle of light under the door. Rio fumbled for a switch, tried it, and got no response from the overhead lights.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Back up slow," Rio said.<br/>
"There's a desk a few paces behind you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">In the dark, she heard the shuffle of Agatha's feet, the slight bump as the actress backed into the desk, and then a sigh.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do we... How will we do this?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There was a small, soft sound of cloth shifting. Rio moved toward it slowly, unsteadily. Presently, she bumped into Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. I'm gonna sit on the desk so I can put my cane down. Then, you stand in front of me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Got it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They accomplished that maneuver, and Rio spread her legs slightly so that Agatha stepped between her knees. Raising her hands, she found Agatha's shoulders.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll scent you on the upper neck and behind the ears, okay? But not too close to the big bad zones, right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha laughed, and Rio wondered idly if that type of education about scenting safety was still in use for kids these days.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ready," Agatha said after a moment.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Her scent was nice. Faint blueberry, verbena, and a strong base of lavender. There was a hint of the nervous overripe melon scent remaining, and under it a waft of a sort of sweet cream smell.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It almost seemed like a shame to scent Agatha, to mix their aromas, to cover the softer, sweet scent over.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Are you sure you want this?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I am. I do."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Carefully, Rio slid her hands up along Agatha's shoulders. When her fingers brushed over the parts of Agatha's blouse that covered the omega's primary glands, Agatha moaned softly. Rio skimmed right on up to rub her wrists against the higher part of Agatha's neck.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just relax. Let alpha help."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio felt off phrasing things that way, but maybe it would help calm Agatha. The actress let out a little whimper, a sound of deep need, and Rio let her wrists slide up further to scent behind the ears. Agatha leaned even closer into her touch, and Rio moaned.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My good omega. Such a good girl, letting alpha keep her safe. Such a good, good girl."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Alpha," Agatha gasped, "I... Oh, alpha, let me thank you. Let me take care of you, alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha's hand was on Rio's thigh, and from the way Rio felt, the emergency suppressants were definitely not working. Fuck. She should pull away from this, should get out of here. But Agatha's hand had wandered, was now stroking over the growing length in Rio's trousers. The subtle sweet cream undertone Rio had sensed in the girl's scent was stronger now, headier.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'Shit! I'm tri</em><em>pping her into heat!'</em> Rio thought.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Fuck, they had to get out of this. Had to go and be away from each other a while.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, take out your phone," Rio said, scenting command as she blurted out anything to shift the situation.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Take out your phone."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio felt Agatha's hand leave her thigh and heard the sounds of items clattering. A moment later, the glow of a phone screen lit the little space between them. Rio could see Agatha's face properly. The pupils of the soft blue eyes were blown wide, and the omega's nostrils were flared, drawing in great breaths of Rio's scent.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, we need to stop now, before something happens. Step away, all right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha backed up four steps, then bowed her head.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry if I was bad, alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, Agatha. You weren't bad. I... This was my fault. You need to go, okay? There's a restroom at the end of the corridor. Go in there and collect yourself, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's okay. Just go and take a sec. Just breathe. Do you take the kind of suppressants with an emergency dose if..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, yeah. Yeah, I do."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Might wanna take that. Be a good girl and do so now, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah. I will. I promise."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio shut her eyes as she heard the omega leaving the room. She could not take another emergency shot yet, and she was wound up as hell.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She decided to just sit, trying to catch her breath. She would wait a bit, then head on to the restroom and splash some cold water on her face and try to make it through the rest of the day.</p>

</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Vidal, what the fuck is going on?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio spun quick to her left and saw Reed Richards bearing down on her. Instinct brought her into a slightly hunched stance, ready to fight in case it came to that. Fucking rut was creeping up on her like a wildfire.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Vidal, I just passed our leading lady on the stairs and she reeks of you! What the hell..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She's scared, Richards. This is a big thing for her, jumping right into the lead of a big picture so soon in her career."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So you decided to fuck her, or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She asked me to scent her. She's nervous around alphas and she... She thought this way she'd feel safer. It's just scenting. Nothing else."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Vidal..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's nothing! Look, it's not unheard of to scent someone to make them feel safe."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, your loved ones. You've barely known Agatha Harkness three months."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So? She's important to the production. You want her flipping out and running away? You want this to be the production that drives off a major talent?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The producer shook his head, sighing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. But you don't fucking lay a finger on her except to scent her if she needs it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Look, man, you know I don't even do hookups. She's safe as anything around me. Why would you assume..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Because you can't control your damn ruts and that makes you a liability!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I fucking control myself! I got my shots, I meditate..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And right this moment you smell like you're ready to plow the first thing you see!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Because this is the one rut of the year that happens regardless. It'll be fine. I'll get through it this weekend."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Look, at least put on a scent patch before the read-through, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Already planning to."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio watched the producer stomp off along the corridor toward his office. Richards was a huffy asshole sometimes, but a good producer to have on your side. Hopefully, Rio's explanation had been enough. If anyone else had questions...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Well, she'd pawn them off on him.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The actual meeting with Richards and the other higher-ups was not so rough as she had expected, though she saw a few looking askance at her throughout. Rio simply smirked. Richards had asked her to put on a patch before the table read, not before the meeting. Was it dangerous to be in a room full of other alphas and a few betas and gammas in her current state? Probably, but then, she had always been a risk taker. Of course, she also recognized that her behavior at the moment was classic coming-up-on-rut bravado. It was probably classically meant as a way to show off to other designations in hopes of gaining a mate, but for Rio, it was letting off some of steam in the most assholish way possibly. Everyone needed a hobby.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As soon as the meeting was over, Rio hurried down the corridor to the restroom again. She splashed a little more cold water on her face, applied a scent-block patch over one of her primary glands, and then ducked into a stall.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She had been half-hard pretty much continuously since scenting Agatha in the office, so she treated herself to a quick jack off there over the toilet, totally not thinking at all of Agatha. Not imagining those gorgeous blue eyes or those soft hands or any part of that delicate scent—especially not the notes of sweet cream that probably indicated the omega could be ready for breeding.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck, fuck, fuck," Rio grumbled, loosing her spend and then wiping up and flushing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The sweet cream smell was probably just exposure to Rio's oncoming rut. Shit, she had nearly broken through poor Agatha's suppressants.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'Good smell,'</em> Rio's inner alpha grunted as Rio paused at the sink to wash her hands.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio would never have a partner, a mate, and even if she were going to, Agatha Harkness was not an option. The younger woman was out of her league in a big way.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Glancing at her watch, Rio realized that, by now, she could administer another shot. She pulled another pack out, set everything up, and once more jammed an injector against her right primary gland. It burned a little more this time, but she felt the drug kick in quick. Disposing of the pack, she grabbed her things and hobbled out of the bathroom.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Returning to the empty office where she had scented Agatha, she pulled out her phone and switched on the flashlight.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Of course, the desk they had been at was bare. Smooth, flat surface. She could have taken off her jacket, folded it up to serve as a pillow for Agatha, then laid the omega on the desk and bred her quick and deep. It would have felt good. The omega, in the moment, probably would have welcomed it.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'And imagine how safe she c</em><em>ould be with my whelp gro</em><em>wing in her belly,'</em> Rio thought, and it wasn't even her alpha thinking, but just her, and she felt disgusted by herself.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She had a mate once. She failed that mate, failed their unborn child. She would fail any mate or offspring because she was not meant to have a family. She was not made for it.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Tucking her phone away, Rio left the office fast to head downstairs. The table read would be starting soon.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">In the conference room, most of those necessary were already filtering in for the read. Rio spotted Agatha immediately, standing quietly in a corner, a cup of the office swill that passed for break room coffee in hand. That would not do. It simply would not.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Parker," Rio barked, catching the attention of a passing gofer, "go speak with Ms. Harkness and ask her what sort of coffee she'd like that's not the ancient shit from the front desk. Then get it for her. My orders."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The delta nodded and scurried over to Agatha. Rio kept an eye on the conversation, smiling a little when Parker gestured across the room and Agatha's gaze tracked along to meet her own. Agatha smiled too in return, and spoke to Parker rapidly before the fellow turned and disappeared through another exit</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, Rio, how do we think this one's gonna shake out?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Turning, Rio saw Alice Wu-Gulliver smirking up at her. The rock star had been cast in the film primarily by dint of her long friendship with Rio.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's gonna shake," Rio said, "I can tell you that much. Especially with you writing the score."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I like it's my three lines in the bar scene that'll really draw the audience. Well, and my sex scene with the cute lead."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rnnn."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's that for?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's what for?" Rio asked, her gaze having been drawn back to Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You nearly fuckin' growled at me, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I did not."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah you did. What, you thinkin' of cuttin' the sex scene?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No," Rio grunted, "'scuse me, Alice."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The conversation was suddenly drawing a tight knot of tension up in Rio's shoulders. She sidled away across the room, nodding hellos where necessary and being delayed with chatter a few times. At last, though, she made it to her goal. Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, you feelin' better?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah. I took my emergency pill and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean you feel safer since I scented you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, so much better. Thank you, alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, look, just... Just call me Rio around here, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Immediately Agatha looked down, trembling.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She gnawed at her bottom lip, and Rio wanted to reach out, to tip her face up and kiss her softly and then pull her into a protective hug. Maybe scent her a little more to reassure her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Fuck, I can't be thinking that way!'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Carefully, Rio slipped a hand down to the small of Agatha's back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You didn't do anything wrong, okay? Just want us to be casual. You're safe. I promise, I won't get mad at you. I'm a nice alpha, and for the duration of production, you can think of me as <u>your</u> alpha, in a sort of pack leader sense. I don't hurt my pack members. If there needs to be discipline or anything, I'm very reasonable. Please, never be scared of me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked up at her, smiling, unshed tears brimming in those beautiful blue eyes. Oh, how Rio wanted to kiss her and hold her until those tears were gone.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>De nada</em>, <em>Ágata.</em> Just relax. We'll have a good read of the script. Why don't you circulate, talk to some of the others? I'll be right here to make sure you're safe."</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio suffers through the start of her rut.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're sure it's okay if I take the car for the night?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure, Will. No problem. Have a good time on your date."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio waggled her eyebrows at William and tried not to laugh when the young man blushed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks a lot, boss."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, kid, think nothing of it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once William had headed out, Rio decided it was time for her to head to bed. With sufficient sleeping pills, she might sleep through most of the next day, thus not directly having to deal with the first wave of her rut. She would wake up a mess, but she would just be able to dream through a knot or two.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She had cut down her food and drink intake past noon to lower the risk of being awakened by toilet needs, but she had eaten a small snack an hour ago so the sleeping pills would not hit too hard.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Grabbing the bottle of pills, she grumbled her way to the bedroom, already feeling her cock make its latest appearance of the day. Fuck, what she would not give for a companion during her rut. Of course, there were sex workers who could be hired for such purposes, but that had never been her style. She had been alone with her occasional ruts for a decade now, and that was best.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"There'll never be another you," she muttered, shuffling past the photo that still sat on the dresser.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Their wedding day. It had been beautiful. Flowers everywhere, all of their friends at the time present to support and celebrate them. The only problem had been the officiant, really, though at the time they were both too far into his scam to see that he was a problem. They had not yet realized they were basically in a cult. Once Rio had realized, had tried to pull away...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Well, that had cost her everything.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Standing by the bed, she popped open the bottle and dumped four pills into her hand. Tossing them back, she dry swallowed, then capped the bottle and flung it over to land on the dresser, striking against the photo frame with a soft <em>schuud</em>.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Her cock was swelling to full size, sore with need. She tilted her cane against the nightstand and flopped onto the bed, groaning and rolling onto her front. She had changed into comfortable clothes as soon as she got home, choosing loose gray-green sweatpants and a tank top.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Fuck she needed someone. Just someone to fuck for the night. Well, the weekend. Just this once couldn't hurt.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck. Oh, fuck."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She wished she had kept anything of her mate besides just a few photos. Clothes or something. Something that could be sealed away and might still retain scent. It was harder by the day to conjure up a real memory of the scent. There were other memories, of course, that Rio could call up, but the scent fading from her mind is what really hurt.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'We will find a new mate,'</em> her alpha blurted in her mind, <em>'good mate to take care of us. To protect pups.'</em></p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'She </em><u><em>was</em></u><em> good!'</em> Rio mentally raged against her alpha.<em>'</em><em>She did take care of me! She wanted to protect our baby.'</em></p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Arguing with the gnarly, primitive part of her brain never helped. That would just lead her down the usual spiral of self-blame for not being able to fix things. She had failed to protect her wife and child. She had failed to pull the person she so deeply loved away from an awful situation.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">But before all of that, when they were first together... Oh, they had been something special. Every day had been a new adventure. Every night had been the fire of passion. When they had mated, it had been like the sweetest kind of soul music. When they conceived their child, somewhere in the midst of a rut and a heat that overlapped totally, Rio had felt a sort of ecstasy she never knew before, feeling both a deeper connection to her woman and truly in tune with her alpha for the first time.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She tried to remember that time, to feel that ecstasy again. Hot nights, sheathed deep in her mate, her omega, thrusting hard, knotting, knowing she was breeding her woman, helping to create life. She tried to recall those sounds, those smells...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">But those thoughts were quickly shelved. Instead, her fevered brain conjured up a fantasy to fall asleep to, her imagined connection with Agatha in that empty office. She rutted desperately against the mattress, imagining she was driving her cock into Agatha's needy, slick cunt, stretching it open. She could hear the delectable wet sounds, could almost feel the tightness swallowing her up. Oh, to rut Agatha, to pin her gently down and slide into her, fuck her deep, knot her, breed her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck, such a good girl," Rio groaned, "so good for me, taking me so deep, taking all of me. It's okay, sweet girl, alpha's here. Alpha's gonna breed you good and full. Oh, fuck, Agatha, I'm gonna..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio came with a half-choked roar, whole body tensing, feeling the first cum of her rut pump and pump and pump out into her sweatpants. The sensation of the release made her suddenly giddy, mind drifting, and she fell asleep well before her knot could even begin to shrink.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She slept hard, blackness interspersed with dreams of various sorts, mostly erotic memories or half-memories.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Her first time, with a rather older woman who had been a motivational speaker at a youth camp Rio attended in high school.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Sleeping twice with a girl she met at a restaurant she worked at during her brief college experience.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">A blowjob she had gotten in a club bathroom her second week in L.A.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">A voyeuristic incident at a party in Brentwood.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The first time she slept with the woman who became her mate.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The last dream, the one she woke from, was of Agatha; not the fantasy of the office, but a wholly new scenario.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">A bedroom somewhere, a nest really, all softness and warm light and a big bed strewn with beautiful cushions and blankets and smelling richly both of Agatha's scent and one Rio knew to be her own. They were together in the bed, and Agatha was so beautiful and Rio wanted so much to protect her, and then they were making love—not fucking, not rutting, but making love—and Agatha was clinging to her, kissing her, begging to be bred, almost weeping over how badly she wanted to stay with Rio and to bear Rio's child. All Rio could do in the dream was apologize because there was no way any of that could happen.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio woke in tears, the bed a mess of sweat and cum and a little blood where at some point she had badly scratched one of her arms. It was noon. She had slept 19 hours through and she needed to piss like a racehorse. Scrabbling for her cane, she knocked it to the floor.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit. Fucking shit."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Too annoyed to try and grab the cane from the floor, Rio decided it was a day to try unaided weight bearing over distance. She made it to the bathroom, relieved herself, then slopped into the shower and got it running almost too hot. She liked it that way on the first day of a rut. It actually seemed to help drive out some of the brain fog temporarily.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">By the time she had scrubbed herself down pretty well, her cock had put in another appearance, wanting to be sated. She jacked off quick, trying to skirt around the thoughts her brain was directing her toward and failing miserably. Groaning, she finished her shower, put some antiseptic and bandages on her clawed arm, and staggered to the kitchen.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Someone had been here. Early. Someone had left a fresh apple pie under the pie cover on the kitchen island and a bunch of wrapped sandwiches in the fridge with a note.</p>
</div><div align="center">
<p dir="ltr">
<b>
<em>
<u>EAT</u>
</em>
</b>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Just that one, simple word, but Rio would know the handwriting anywhere. Lilia. The woman who had been like a mother to her since she came to California. The one who had been there for her most after everything fell apart.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Sitting at the island, Rio unwrapped and ate one of the sandwiches. Lobster paste on rye with bread-and-butter pickles. Perfect.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And this is why it's worth giving some people keys," Rio muttered as she finished off the sandwich.</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio receives a gift.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Feelin' okay, boss?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">William was watching her from across the den. He had a book in hand but clearly had not been reading.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm good, kid," Rio lied, focusing her attention back on the notes in front of her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ya know, boss, I've been meaning to say, at 23 I'm hardly a kid."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I'm not really much of a boss, am I? I mean, I'm more like, what, an older sister?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I drive you, help around the house..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"In exchange for room and board and use of the car whenever it's free and as much money as you need whenever you need it, plus of course regular pay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That got him and made him ponder a while.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They had met three years ago at a party. William had been some shit beta producer's badly abused arm candy, and Rio had been the only person at the party to speak to him or treat him like a person. Something about him had projected a familiar aura. In some muddled way, he reminded her of parts of her younger self, and even more of her lost mate. She had been shocked when the boy showed up on her doorstep a week later, terrified because the man he had been with had finally gotten dangerous enough to really scare him and to injure him to the point of needing more intensive medical care. He had remembered her, found her contact in his abuser's phone, and fled to her begging protection.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">At least he had not begged her to scent him.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Still, William was a part of her pack, if one liked to think of things that way. He was the youngest, so he was sort of the pup. Rio and the others she considered a part of her extended family counted William as one of them. Lilia outright called him her son, just as she called Rio and Alice her daughters.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Staring at the notes, Rio shook her head. She was a couple of days out of her rut, but she had managed to screw up her leg again over the course of Saturday and Sunday, not using her cane as she should, and so she was sort of laid up for the moment. Still, she could not focus. There was a lingering tiredness, and some worry over the production ahead. After the table read, one of the better established stars in the cast, Erik Lehnsherr, was making a fuss, claiming there had been script changes he was uncomfortable with. He would not say what the alleged changes were, or why they bothered him.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio figured the guy was holding out for a salary renegotiation or something.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Got it," William suddenly said, fumbling out of the armchair and making for the front door.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio had not heard the bell or any knocking. Shrugging, she stretched, setting the notes aside.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Whoa, boss, check it out!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">William returned, bearing a large flower arrangement that made Rio sit up and take notice.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Your guy send you that?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Nope. Apparently, it's for you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">He plopped the arrangement down on the coffee table. Canterbury Bells, agrimony, and baby's breath. Fabulous.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Is there a..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, card. Here."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">William handed over a tiny envelope, and Rio stared at it a while before daring to open it. When she finally did, the little card that slipped out felt like the weight of galaxies somehow once she saw the message.</p>
</div><div align="center">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>I can never thank you enough</em>
</p>
</div><div align="center">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>Agatha</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Who's it from?" William asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, one of the folks on the new film. Just thanks for stuff, I guess."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oooh. Anyone I'd know?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha Harkness. Our leading lady."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Holy shit, Agatha Harkness? Like, daughter of semi-disgraced Senator Evanora Harkness, Agatha Harkness?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Like talented actress and soon to be major movie star Agatha Harkness," Rio groused.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, but, I mean..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mon, Will, she's not responsible for anything her mother's done."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know, I know, but... Look, can I help it if all anyone talks about is that stuff?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, come on. People talk about her work, don't they? About her looks? All the other stuff people discuss about actors?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure, but Agatha Harkness..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She's really nice, dude. If you knew her, you wouldn't think for a second about her mother. If you knew Agatha even a little, all you'd be able to think of is her."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">William's eyes went wide, hand flying to his chest. The room suddenly smelled wildly of burst sloes, and Rio rolled her eyes.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Someone's got a crush!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I do not have a crush, William. I am incapable of having a crush. I am crushless."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, Crushy McCrushface. Look at you, over there, crushing on <u>the</u> Agatha Harkness."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uhm, I'm <u>the</u> Rio Vidal. Maybe she has a crush on <u>me</u>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, do you think she might? Oh, that's so exciting!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"William Thomas Kaplan, I swear, if you start doing that little skippy-clappy thing next..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I would never! Now, excuse me while I go and fetch a yogurt."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">William barely got out of the den before he was skip-clapping his way toward the kitchen. Rio rolled her eyes again and looked down at the card, then over to the flowers. It really was a nice thing, a thoughtful thing to send flowers. Rio wondered if she ought to send some back, or write some old-fashioned thank you note or something. Or maybe she should call. A call would be good.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Unless a call would be too much.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio was half tempted to ask William, but the last thing she needed was her brother-figure endlessly giggling like a school kid over her imagined crush on Agatha Harkness. She loved that guy, but oh, his matchmaker tendencies. A part of her was almost hoping this relationship with Eddie or Teddy or whatever the guy's name was, would work out. At minimum, it would keep William too busy in his free time to try and set her up on dates and shit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She put off calling Agatha until that night, when William was asleep out in his apartment over the pool house.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She felt nervous as hell about hitting the call button, even though she had gotten Agatha's number when they first met. It was a matter of work then, but to call her now in thanks for a gift that was clearly out of gratitude for a very intimate act seemed more.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just fuckin' do it," she grumbled to herself, jabbing her thumb against the phone.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Maybe Agatha was already asleep and would miss the call. Maybe she was somewhere without her phone, or at a party or busy or on a date or...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Hello? Rio?"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, Agatha. Hi. Just, uh... Hi."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Hi."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uhm, you sent me flowers. Really nice flowers. Thank you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Yes, I... Well, I wanted to thank you. For, you know, helping me."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course. You know, I'd... I want to help the people I work with. And since you're so new in this kind of role, I... Well, I want you to be comfortable. We all want you to be comfortable."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"I haven't felt quite so comfo</em>
<em>rtable with anyone else yet, but I'm sure I'll get there."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's what we hope for. You doing all right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Pretty well. Had a little shake</em>
<em> up today..."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What happened? Do you need anything, or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Oh, my mother called, trying to lure me back to Massachu</em>
<em>setts. I'm sure she wants me for some political event or something, but I've told her I won't do that </em>
<em>anymore. I've never really shared her politics anyway, and..."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Haven't you? I thought most kids start out thinking like their parents."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Well, I th</em>
<em>ink like my father. Why my mother ever sired pups on someone even m</em>
<em>ildly left of center..."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You have siblings?" Rio asked, catching the plural.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Well, had. They would all have been older than me. Four boys who showed signs of possibly being future omegas, so my mother had them gassed at birth."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She <u>what</u>‽"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Oh, it was back before they reformed the whelp laws, so, what, more than 32 or 33 years ago."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wow, Agatha... Shit, I'm so sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"It... Well, I've dealt with it mostly. Now sometimes I think how Mother used to quite openly say after I presented that she wished the even older laws were still in place, and I sort of laugh about it."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Holy shit! She... She said that to you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Mm-hmm. All the time. Thank goodness for school. If I'd had to be at </em>
<em>home all the time, </em>
<u>
<em>someone</em>
</u>
<em> would have ended up dead."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio let out a short laugh, but then caught herself and reeled in, not wanting to be offensive. She was pleased, however, to hear that Agatha was laughing too, quite robustly and with a little snort sprinkled in here and there.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, at least you're out here now, well away from her. Here, you can be whoever you want to be, and she can't say shit."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Oh, I've accepted that to most people, I'll always be </em>
<u>
<em>her</em>
</u>
<em> daughter."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not after this film, you won't. After this, everyone'll know you on your own merits."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"You have that much confidence in the film?"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And you. I have an awful lot of confidence in you, Agatha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The other end of the call was quiet for a while, and Rio was a bit worried, but finally, Agatha spoke again, her voice quite small.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Thank you, alpha. I do not deserve your confidence, but thank you."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You deserve everything," Rio declared, suddenly feeling ragingly protective.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"I'm... I'm glad you liked the flowers."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They're beautiful, and you clearly chose them with care."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"I did. I wanted you to know how thankful I am for what you did, and I wanted you to like them."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I absolutely got the message, and I love the flowers. Thank you so much."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"You're welcome."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's late, and we'll see each other tomorrow. Are you going to bed soon?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Already in bed. I was almost going to sleep when you called."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, no, I'm so sorry I disturbed you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"It's all right. I think I'll sleep better now that I heard your voice. Thank you for calling me, alpha."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good night, Agatha, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Please, will you... Would you call me..."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good night, omega."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Thank you, alpha. Good night."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As the call ended, Rio felt her chest and throat constrict, and she stood fast from her place on the sofa, fighting back unbidden tears.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, so, we have a problem."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio groaned and hobbled over to the AD.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's up, Wade?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Lehnsherr won't leave his trailer."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, for the love... Have they tried asking, like, super nicely?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We've tried everything."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Has he even been through hair and makeup?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, he's all geared up. Now he's in his trailer and won't speak to anyone but you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"For crying out loud. FINE. Ugh."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">With a deep breath, Rio realigned and stumped along after Wade, her crutches nearly slipping a few times in a spot where something sweet-smelling had been spilled on the floor.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Someone clean that up!" she barked, scenting strong command.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When they reached Lehnsherr's trailer, a skinny boy with hair so blond it was almost white was pacing around nearby. The moment he saw Wade and Rio approaching, he stormed toward them, face twisted in outrage.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Who are you?" the boy shouted.<br/>
"Someone else they've sent to annoy my father? He'll speak to the director only!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The boy reeked of burning tires, and Rio popped back a few paces.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I AM THE DIRECTOR!" she roared.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Instantly the boy stopped, head bowed, and the burning tire smell dissipated in favor of an odor of warm milk.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'm sorry. I'll get my father."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As the boy disappeared into the trailer, Rio looked to Wade, who shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Guy takes his pups everywhere he goes," Wade said."Officially, the boy is his assistant. We didn't let 'em in at the table read."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Explains why Lehnsherr was extra pissy that day, I guess. How many more kids are there?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just one I think. A girl."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, at least there won't be a damn stampede of Lehnsherrlings."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When they had waited about five minutes for either Lehnsherr or the boy to step out, Rio made her way to the trailer and used the end of one crutch to bang on the door.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Erik Lehnsherr, get out here! Production is underway and you're needed on set!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The door of the trailer banged open so quickly that Rio nearly toppled backward to get away from it. She felt Wade barely catch her up by the shoulder.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What, am I expected to follow the orders of a lamed female?" Lehnsherr bellowed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio pulled herself up straight, spinning half toward Wade.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Have someone get Reed on the horn, will ya? Have 'em tell him we're gonna need to recast the grandfather role pretty quick..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Now just a moment," Lehnsherr said, and stepped down out of the trailer.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Balancing herself back on one crutch again, Rio pointed the other at Lehnsherr's chest.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Look, man, I dunno what your problem is..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My problem is being expected to shoot the first scene on the first day opposite an untested omega female under the command of a female director who..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, you listen to me, <u>Gamma</u>, and you listen good," Rio growled."I don't like to make things about designations, but I am an alpha  and you <u>will</u> work happily and calmly under my direction. If you refuse, fine. Reed'll handle it. But I can guarantee you he'll replace you way faster than he'll replace me, and not because of designation."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Pulling onto both crutches, Rio lunged into the actor's personal space, scenting rage and command and basic unholy fury.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I am a director with five hit films, two okay films, and one flop film under my belt, plus scads of television. You are a washed-up has-been who hasn't been in a hit since 1972. And as for Agatha Harkness, our young leading lady, she is far from untested. In two years fully in the industry, she's shown more talent, more skill, and more ability to develop and grow than you can imagine."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Feeling suddenly winded and shaky, Rio dropped back again and turned, beginning the trek back to the set.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If you wish to keep your role, Lehnsherr, you have 10 minutes to be on set, starting now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She made it, with some help from Wade, back to the set, collapsing into her chair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Someone get me Agatha," she said, "so I can make sure she's at least ready."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">A moment later, Agatha was there, all ready for the scene.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, you look like a leading lady," Rio said, smiling.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hope so. Are we ready to shoot?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Your fellow performer for this first set-up is being a bit difficult. He'll be here, or we'll move on."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you, Rio, for this. I know you pulled really hard for me to get this role, and I... Thanks for what you said on the phone too. About having confidence in me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks for being someone who inspires such confidence. Now, do you feel safe?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I think so. Mostly."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's making it only mostly?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just regular nerves, I guess."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you want help? Anything I can do..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha blushed, looking around nervously.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Would you... Just scent me a little?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You sure?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You don't have to if..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want you to feel safe, okay? Safe and prepared for the day. From now on, I'll check on you first thing, but for now, lean close like I'm whispering to you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled and leaned in, and Rio delicately scented her just behind the ear.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good girl," Rio whispered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you, Alpha," Agatha whispered in return.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Go get ready. I'll be right here, I promise."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Lehnsherr made a grand entrance to the set just before the cut-off, and everyone welcomed him like some grand old star. He put on a hokey good-with-the-crew show and then went to his mark, ready for the scene. Of course, once they started shooting, he blew his lines multiple times, and other little issues lead to six takes. Agatha was shaky on the first couple of takes herself, but by the third, she was handling it like a champ. Rio genuinely felt proud of her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">By the end of the day, Rio felt decidedly out of it, but she had kept it together. Just after they finished the last shot on the schedule that day, Wade popped up at her elbow.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So, uhm, Agatha would like to speak with you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She's back at her trailer, right? She already had her end-of-day."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup. Just says she'd like to see you for a minute."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. Lemme finish up here and I'll handle her."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There were a dozen little things Rio could find to do, that she needed to do, but at the end of it all, she made her way out to Agatha's trailer. As she had at Lehnsherr's earlier, she knocked with the end of a crutch. This door opened much more slowly, and there was Agatha, just the woman herself, in her regular clothes. She looked really pretty, and terribly young.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, good, I wanted to see you before we all split for the day. Can you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I can probably..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Let me help."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio backed up so Agatha could descend from the trailer, then help support her clambering up in.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How'd you hurt your leg?" Agatha asked once they were both inside.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, I tore some stuff up last month. Charity sports thing. It was a minor fix, but I was on a cane for a while..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I remember."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And then last weekend, at home, I tried to get around without the cane for a while. Then I tripped on the cane and sprained the absolute shit out of my ankle."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, that's awful!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Eh, I got lazy and sloppy. Happens when I'm in... Uh, when I... It happens."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha sat and looked up at her, one eyebrow raised.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So you <u>we</u><u>re</u> in rut when you scented me the first time."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, nearly. Sorry about..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, no. Perfectly natural. Sit, please."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Carefully, Rio lowered herself onto the sofa.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't you take suppressants?" Agatha asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They don't work on me. I've tried every basic shot, pill, patch, implant, almost since I presented. Best I've got is emergency shots that can hold stuff off a while. I have one full rut a year the shots won't stop."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And that was..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup. Sorry, really. I know I must've almost tripped you into heat, and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, no. It... These things happen. Truthfully..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha scooted closer.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It was a little exhilarating. Thought maybe I was about to have my first time right there in that office."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's eyes went wide.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"A girl as pretty as you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I've had offers, but... Well, it's never felt right. Never been that spark, you know?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded. She knew.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So listen, Agatha, did you wanna talk to me about something to do with production, or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"In a way, yeah. Look, I... I know I've thanked you so much for agreeing to scent me, and... Would you be willing to help me with something else?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, it depends."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Look, I... I already know the press around me is changing because I'm in a lead role. I feel really awkward now sometimes in public because of the paparazzi and everything."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Want me to talk to the producers about getting you with a better publicist, or getting you some security, or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want you to help me. I trust you, I like you. Just until we're done with this film, with production and promotion and everything..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What can I do to help?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked very serious and smelled very nervous.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want you to pretend to be my alpha. Like, in a couple way."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio felt her heart skip several beats and thought she almost felt the moment most of the blood flow in her body was redirected to a single bothersome area.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, I'm flattered, like incredibly flattered..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh come on! Everyone knows you're not the type for relationships and stuff, but it would just be for a little while. Spend some extra time together on off days, be seen out and about together. You've got a hell of a growly rep with the press, so they'd probably mostly leave us alone. Plus, think what it could do for promotion of the film. Hot, talented powerhouse director takes innocent young ingenue under her protection in every way. The press will eat it up."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio shook her head and laughed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Spoken like a publicist."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You know it would be so good, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Would be kinda funny," Rio shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So let's do it. Just for a while. When it's all over, oh, you could dump me in some big, public way."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shouldn't you dump me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What, and leave all the sympathy for you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How about an equal dumping? Amicable parting, so we could still be friends."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, I could do that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"When do you want all this to start? And how do we pull it off without pissing off the extant press machine around production, my little PR expert?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Let's have dinner together tonight and talk about it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, well... Well, I mean, I guess we could. You could come to my place."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Perfect! We've known each other for a few months now, and there's already been speculation. This'll really make their heads spin!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio knew this was the dumbest idea in the history of dumb ideas, but something about it amused her too much to pass up. She also could not help but realize, as she popped back up onto her crutches, that the tired, cloudy feeling that had been plaguing her all day was mostly cleared up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Maybe this would be good for her, in a way.</p>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Right this way," Rio said, letting Agatha enter the house first.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wow! Oh, you have great taste."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks. I had some help picking stuff out, but mostly it's me. Me and Will."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He's the one who..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup. He drives for me and helps around the place, but he's really more like a little brother."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Does he live..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Out back. I have the place to myself, mostly, though we hang out together. And I have friends over sometimes."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You mostly live in here alone?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah. It just... I'm a solitary kinda person."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, then, this whole little plan could get me seen as a miracle worker," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mmm. Or maybe we'll find each other so irresistible you really will work a miracle on me," Rio chuckled.<br/>
"Kick your shoes off, huh, and let's go talk in the den."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"D-den?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha scented suddenly nervous.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Don't use that word in the sense other alphas do," Rio explained, "so you're more than welcome."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Right. Okay.'</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio clumped off toward the den, and after a moment she heard Agatha padding along after her. Lowering herself onto the sofa, in the middle portion of the big U-shaped sectional, she unstrapped the orthopedic boot and raised her injured leg up onto the cushions. When she saw Agatha standing nervously in the doorway, she smiled and waved her over.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mon in and sit. If we're playing at this whole couple thing, you might have to seem comfortable in my home."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha entered slowly, smelling so nervous, and she came to the sofa but knelt on the floor beside it, head down.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you for allowing me in your den, Alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Told you, Agatha, it's not that sort of den. Besides, I'm not that sort of alpha. Come up here and sit with me, okay? Like a good omega."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio really did not want to seem commanding or threatening right now; this whole situation was already so screwy and odd. All she wanted was to sit and talk a while to Agatha. Maybe they could talk through some of the issues the actress had around alphas and work on them. Sure, Rio was no therapist, but maybe she could get Agatha to understand that omegas were allowed to be confident and make their own way in the world. After all, had Agatha not been making many of her own choices so far?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Projecting a scent of reassurance, Rio reached out and gently squeezed Agatha's shoulder once gently.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mon, sweets. Sit with me, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked up at her, blue eyes slightly bleary, face a little flushed, and stood, taking up a throw pillow from one of the ends of the U. She sat right near Rio's injured foot, slipping a hand cautiously under the ankle and lifting, then sliding to sit with the injury propped on the pillow on her lap. Rio watched her go through the action, breathless, then sighed and relaxed as a scent of fresh caramels filled the air.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Let me take care of you," Agatha said, her voice soft and low.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you," Rio nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They sat there a long time in silence. Distantly, Rio could hear William in the kitchen, making dinner. Thinking of him, she finally spoke again.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How far do we take it?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmm?" Agatha hummed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do... Do we tell anyone? About pretending to be together?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No. I don't think we should."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. So everyone can think we're together some way."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh-huh."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded slowly. She seemed suddenly sleepy or something, and Rio felt not sleepy, but perfectly, peacefully calm. This was not the fog and tiredness of earlier in the day. This was nice. This was comforting and homelike. Hearing footsteps approach, she reached down and took up Agatha's hand that had been resting lightly on her shin. Agatha looked at her and smiled just as William entered the room.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, boss, so... Oh, did I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's up, Will?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm getting dinner started, and I was just... Wondering if you're gonna want to eat in here or the kitchen or where?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, uh..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Looking at Agatha, Rio brushed a thumb over the back of her hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Where would you like to eat, sweetheart?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can we eat in here?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. You heard the lady, Will. In here is fine."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Got it," William nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rather than leaving, he stepped closer and leaned over the back of the couch to whisper to Rio.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Boss, you okay? You look sort of stoned or something."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm great, Will. We're great."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As William straightened up, he glanced to Agatha, and Rio saw his eyes go a little wider. His scent changed too, a sort of tinned salmon smell that he tended to emit when particularly and deeply curious. Backing away, he nodded and scurried off to the kitchen.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You don't have to hold my hand when we're alone," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Want me to stop?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, I don't."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Then I'll carry on. It's nice. You have soft hands."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They should probably be talking about this whole pretending-to-date thing, but instead they were just sitting, staring at each other. Rio felt heat in her gut, soft and pulsing, not the frantic burn of a rut, but the gentler warmth that signaled a more ordinary arousal. She deeply, deeply desired to take Agatha to bed. Not in a rough, fast, get-it-over-with kind of way. She wanted to take this beautiful woman and kiss her, touch her, tease her. She wanted to be gentle and easy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Could I rest until we have dinner?" Agatha asked softly, and Rio smiled at her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course. Lie down if you want."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio was sorry to feel Agatha move, to have her injured foot resting on just the pillow, but Agatha smiled at her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can I rest my head on your lap, Rio?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure. Sure you can."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">So Agatha moved to one end of the U and lay down with her head on Rio's lap.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I think we can make this work," she murmured.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We can," Rio assured her, "and we will."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">For a moment, it seemed like Agatha was asleep, but then she opened her eyes and smiled at Rio again.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Kiss me?" she asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you want me to?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"For practice."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha slid a bit off of Rio's lap, pushing herself up on her elbows. She was pretty, head thrown back, skin almost glowing under the warm lamplight, and Rio leaned down the little bit necessary and kissed her chastely.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Soft," Rio sighed after.<br/>
"All of you is so soft."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're soft too."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Am I?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm. Kiss me again?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And so Rio kissed her again. It felt good. It felt like home, somehow, and Rio supposed that was because this <u>was</u> her home, but some part of her wondered if it was more.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmm?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're really beautiful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Feeling herself blush, Rio turned her face away. Agatha relaxed, lay her head back on Rio's lap, and reached up to touched Rio's cheek.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're beautiful, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And you're beautiful, Agatha," Rio whispered, looking down at the omega</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you," Agatha said, and her eyes did not seem so hazy anymore.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">This felt so odd, so wonderfully confusing. Rio felt her own head clearing a bit, and she sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, are you certain we should do this? I know you said you trust me..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Everyone says you want to be alone. I know you won't try anything. Won't hurt me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course I won't hurt you, but what if we do actually fall for each other?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That only happens in movies, silly."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well we work in movies, silly. What if I fall for you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You won't. Playacting isn't really doing. You don't have relationships."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I have. I can."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Everyone knows you don't."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I have had them. I had a mate, once."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha shifted slightly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You did?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She died," Rio nodded, "and our baby too."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Oh, I'm so sorry. I never... I didn't know."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't talk about it much."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I should go, shouldn't I? Fuck, I'm such an idiot."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You can stay. I'd like you to."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr">"But this... I'm so stupid, so useless, so..."</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey," Rio growled, "no talk like that. You're good. You're talented and so bright."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha went very still.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry, Alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's all right. But listen, as long as this all goes on, I'm your alpha. I won't let anyone in my pack talk down about themself. You can think it, of course, but I don't want to hear you speak so ill of yourself. You are amazing, Agatha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Pulling away and sitting up, Agatha looked at Rio.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can... Can I kiss you again?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If you'd like. For, ya know, more practice."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio expected Agatha to lean in and kiss her again lightly. Instead, the pretty omega moved to straddle Rio's lap.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Alpha," she breathed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">This kiss was hot, yearning, and Rio groaned, taking tight hold of Agatha's hips. Thrusting up, she felt herself start to get hard, and she wanted it to happen. She wanted something with Agatha. Anything. Meanwhile Agatha was riding down against her desperately, hands on her shoulders for leverage.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thought you wanted to rest," Rio laughed coming out of the kiss.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, not now. I wanna... Fuck, I'm sorry..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't be. Oh, shit, you feel so good. Smell so good. I haven't... Go a little slower, babe."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was panting, gasping, rubbing just right against Rio's bulge.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Is... Is it all right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's fine," Rio slurred, pulling Agatha into an embrace.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That scent was on the air, that sweet cream scent that Rio recalled from Friday.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmm?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, do you feel all right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I feel amazing."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Suddenly, Agatha stiffened and let out a little moan. The sound triggered something in Rio, and her hips bucked hard up twice as she spilled in her jeans. Agatha was slumped down against her, whimpering, and the sweet cream scent was still strong.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay?" Rio panted.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Very. Fuck."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Feel comfortable?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I feel boneless."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wanna lie down again?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hold me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio scooted down so she was stretched out, Agatha on top of her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Some practice, huh?" Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, at least... We can seem absolutely comfortable with each other. Fuck, did we... Did we really just dry hump like teenagers?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I think we did," Agatha said, and laughed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's phone buzzed, and she tugged it from her pocket. William had messaged her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>Shld i serv or r u 2<br/>

</p>
</div><p dir="ltr">Laughing, Rio thumbed a quick message in reply.</p><div align="right">

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not a problem?" Reed growled.<br/>
"This could be a hell of a problem, Rio!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How? Plenty of directors date actors. Plenty of them get together during filming."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure, but Rio, Agatha's a delicate case, given her family connections and history..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please could you not talk about me like I'm not here?" Agatha asked, voice shaking.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Reed looked shocked, and instantly he was putting out a reek of offense. Rio reached over and took Agatha's hand, at the same time putting out her own scent of reassurance.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sorry," Rio said to Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I'm not," Reed said.<br/>
"Young lady, we're taking a chance on you as the lead in this film. You've proven so far capable of the basic requirements. The dailies show you making great progress with your performance. But there are so many delicate factors to be considered, especially publicity-wise..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's about my mother, isn't it? Mr. Richards, I've made it clear time and again that I don't support my mother's beliefs or policies, and I fail to see how my becoming involved with Rio could be a problem when..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You will speak when spoken to!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She fucking speaks when she wants!" Rio spat, standing quickly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, you need to back down and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No! You got a huge chunk of the funding for <em>Young Allies</em> because I'm attached as director, and it's a project I'm proud to be connected with. But if continuing production means Agatha being treated like shit, then you can fire me here and now and find someone else to direct."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's not..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha and I are being careful and responsible about dating each other. We're not doing anything crazy or dangerous, we're being discreet in public..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't call this discreet!" Reed barked, sliding his phone across the desk.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It was that damn photo again: them out to lunch together two weeks ago, a week after they had started 'dating,' stopped outside the restaurant, hand in hand, sharing a little kiss. They had done it because they knew the paparazzi were watching and it seemed like a fun idea. Since then, it had been everywhere.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's a kiss, Reed. You and Sue were photographed doing more than that in public when you were first together."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes, well, you started this little relationship without informing me or studio PR or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck, what are you, my dad?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I helped get your career off the ground after that mess out in Calabasas, Vidal! Without me..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You were hardly the only one to help me get started, Richards, and I have plenty of contacts without you!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Looking to Agatha, Rio nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Babe, get your bag. Let's get out of here."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha grabbed her purse and stood, taking Rio's hand and letting herself start to be led from Reed's office.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wait!" Reed called, and he actually vaulted his desk to follow them.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why? You can't handle us making our own decisions, so..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't want it to end like this, Rio. We've been pals almost a decade now. Seriously, I just want to be sure everything'll work out in the best interest of the film."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why wouldn't it?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, you know. Does Agatha here know about your condition?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"The suppressant resistance? Yes."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It was one of the first things Rio told me about when we started dating," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well then, you know the risks of Rio suffering a breakthrough rut..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I haven't had a breakthrough rut in seven years, Reed," Rio sighed, "and I had my one a year just before Agatha and I started seeing each other."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And we're not having sex yet. I want to take things slow, and Rio's been very respectful of that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Look, Agatha, we just can't risk you, say, winding up pregnant with a large percentage of filming left so that..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mr. Richards, as I said, Rio and I aren't having sex yet. If and when we do, we'll take whatever precautions are necessary to avoid any problems."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just because I have suppressant resistance doesn't mean I can get her pregnant by kissing her or something," Rio added.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Reed sighed and backed off.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fine. Fine. But will you allow the studio PR to handle some stuff and arrange things?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio looked to Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You okay with that, sweets?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If you are," Agatha shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Great. Arrange a meeting whenever, Reed, but not today. We got a thing to be at."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What sort of thing?" Reed asked as they left his office.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"A thing!" Rio replied, ushering Agatha into the elevator.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The moment they were descending to the ground floor, Rio laughed bitterly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Richards is such a clown."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, would we really have walked out and risked you getting fired?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No way he fires me. This picture needs me and Reed knows it. And no way I'd risk your job either."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You stood up for me in there. Protected me. Thank you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's a good alpha for?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So what's this thing we have to be at?" Agatha asked as they stepped out of the elevator.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Lunch. My place. Want you to meet the squad, if you feel safe."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Squad?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rest of the pack, so to speak. You know Will and Alice. You need to meet the matriarch."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm... I'm gonna meet your mother?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio laughed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not my mother exactly, but she's like one. Lilia Calderu."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<u>The</u> Lilia Calderu?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup. She took me under her wing when we happened to meet not long after I got out here. She's how I met Alice, too. She's like Mama for me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, well, then she won't be Mama for me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio paused at the top of the steps in front of the building and looked at Agatha quizzically.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why not? She'll love you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Maybe, but she'll be my mother-in-law, if you think about it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled and took Rio's hand again, and Rio laughed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, yeah. Makes sense. C'mon, let's get to the car."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio stumbled a bit near the foot of the steps, and Agatha caught the back of her jacket to steady her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Easy, my big, brave alpha. You and that cane aren't exactly a dynamic duo."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ah, she tries to take me out, I'll just have her recycled into part of a skateboard deck or something."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit, if you take up skateboarding, you'll probably actually just start to lose whole limbs."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, I've been skateboarding since I was a kid."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Things were quiet in the car until about halfway to Rio's place, when Agatha delicately trailed her fingers over the back of Rio's hand where it rested on the seat.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hnn?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What did Reed mean by the mess in Calabasas?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, that... That's some old shit. Nothing to worry you, <em>cari</em><em>ño</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled a little.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What was that last bit?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just another love word," Rio said with a little wink.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Even if they were doing this all as a show, after that first night, it felt proper to use the right sort of words with Agatha. To call her sweets, sweetheart, babe, or any number of little endearments. In public, in semi-private, or even in total private. Sure, since that first night they had kept things very proper and cool in private, but still.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Okay, so Agatha had stayed over that first night and they had shared a bed—the bed in the guest room, of course—but they had been clothed and nothing had happened besides a little semi-conscious mutual grinding around three in the morning.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And there had been the incident not long after they left the restaurant at which the infamous kiss photo had been taken. They had gone back to Rio's house and spent the afternoon chilling in the den. Since Agatha had begged, at one point she had been allowed to sit between Rio's legs on the sofa while Rio reached around and touched her, only very lightly, through her leggings. And sure, maybe by the end Agatha was pushing Rio's hand against herself harder, begging for more, and Rio was hard as steel, and maybe after Agatha came, Rio also came, but they had been fully clothed so what was the big deal?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They were not even fuck buddies. They were masturbation pals at best.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You know," Agatha said once they pulled up to Rio's house and William had left the car, "after all of Reed's concern, I wouldn't half mind you taking me upstairs right now and breeding me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah? Think we need to go that far?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I wouldn't be averse to you putting a baby in me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio laughed and reached over to stroke Agatha's thigh.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Be careful, sweets, or I might consider it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They headed into the house, and Rio kissed Agatha on the forehead.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wait for me in the den, okay? Wanna talk to Will about lunch."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can I help?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're my sweet princess, okay? I want you always to relax here."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked up at her, tearful.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why are you so good to me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Because someone has to be. Now go wait, okay? Alpha's orders."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Watching Agatha go to the den, Rio smiled. The omega always entered the room so carefully, with a sort of awed reverence, and she never really did relax there until Rio joined her. Still, it was clear she was grateful for gentle treatment, and that made Rio both deliriously happy and terribly sad. Agatha was someone who clearly was not used to even simple kindness.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio was determined, in whatever time she might have with the younger woman, to remedy that.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Stomping off to the kitchen, Rio found William well into the process of starting the meal. Normally, he did not do all the cooking around the place, but he had a flair and a knack for it, and he had easily fallen into the roll whenever Agatha was around.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't know what we'll do around here when that nice boy you've been dating finally snaps you up, Will," Rio said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, you'll manage. Besides, it's not like I'll never be back here, even if I do move in with him."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What if he won't share you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, you're my family. He gets that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio went over and hugged William crossbody, like the big sister she was, and then ruffled his hair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, go on," he said, "and play with your lady."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Think I will," Rio sniffed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She made her way to the den and, as she stepped inside, saw Agatha at one of the bookcases, running her fingers along the spines.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"See anything you want to read?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Immediately Agatha turned and bowed her head, slouching slightly like a child caught doing something forbidden.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry, Alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, no, don't be," Rio said, and went to hug Agatha with her free arm.<br/>
"You can always read my books if you're here. You can even borrow some if you want."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you want to just sit and read before lunch?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha shook her head no.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wanna snuggle?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That got a nod.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How do you want to snuggle?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can you lie down and hold me like that first night? Ya know."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Laughing, Rio kissed Agatha's forehead.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr">"Don't suppose you'd like an encore of what we did before that, huh?"</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Could we? I could really use the stress relief."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, you... You want to?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck yes."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"All right. Awesome. Lemme just get into position and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Jeans off," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio turned back to her and then slumped down on the sofa.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wh-huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Jeans off."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, you sure? Cause then if you're grinding down on me through just my boxers, I might get kinda chafed from..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, I'm taking my jeans off too."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Great. Chill. So, no jeans."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The first twitch of arousal hit her like a rocket, and she groaned as she leaned back and popped the first few buttons of her fly. Across the room, meanwhile, Agatha had already dropped trou, and the sight of her panties made Rio groan again, cock twitching further to life.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The main rational part of Rio's mind had no idea why she was not pumping the breaks on what might turn out to be a very questionable idea. Of course, that part had to contend with her regular libido as well as her alpha. The libido tended to take partial charge at the sight of any pretty woman, and the alpha was currently gnawing at the bars of its enclosure at the thought of even being within close proximity to an attractive and probably reasonably fertile omega.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Scooting herself back on the sofa, Rio settled in and then beckoned Agatha over with a smirk.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Give us a kiss?" she said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha moved fast to straddle Rio's lap, and they fell into an almost bruising kiss. Rio almost felt as if her soul might leave her body with the gravity of the contact.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, Rio," Agatha whispered, "oh, inside, please..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The sweet cream scent that seemed to indicate something about her arousal, which Rio's brain had started to associate with some sort of pseudo-heat for the omega, was heavy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Would... Would you really let me in?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"In a heartbeat."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That answer seemed to almost magnetically draw Rio's hips up, her cock continuing to throb to life.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit," Agatha hissed, "I feel you. Feel you growing."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"All because of you, <em>cariño</em>. Fuck, you're so hot."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio literally could, through the very thin layers of fabric between them, feel the extreme heat of Agatha's cleft, and she could look down and see the dark, wet patch on Agatha's panties that indicated the omega's arousal. Agatha's own base scent seemed stronger, thanks to the copious slick she was producing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Huh?" Agatha breathed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can... Can I feel you? Can I put my hand..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes. Touch me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Cautiously, Rio slipped a hand down the front of Agatha's panties to circle a finger deftly around Agatha's clit. When Agatha moaned and slumped forward against her, Rio grinned.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please?" Agatha sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha just whimpered and shifted around, grinding herself harder against Rio's hand, then kissed Rio hard.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'Would be very good mate,'</em> Rio's inner alpha thought, and Rio found it impossible to argue.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Cum inside me," Agatha said quietly, and Rio nearly spilled then and there.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Instead, however, she slid her hand back a little more, pressing Agatha's clit with her palm while tracing a fingertip just around the entrance. She would never enter Agatha in any way without permission, but she could tease.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Would you like that?" Rio asked.<br/>
"My cock in you, filling you up?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please! Please, I... Please, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, but remember, we can't do that yet. Even if we might, we have to wait, sweetheart."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha straightened up, forehead against Rio's. Her eyes were very clear and bright, her breath coming in little gasps.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want it, please," she sobbed.<br/>
"I want your baby growing inside me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That set Rio off completely, hand moving a little more unsteadily, along with her hips, as her cum roped out messily into her boxers. As she finished, she felt Agatha cum too, moaning, slick absolutely soaking Rio's hand. They would both need fresh clothes before lunch; luckily, Agatha had started leaving a change or two at Rio's place, so that was possible.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">For now, however, Rio slid down, Agatha on top of her, then rolled slightly so Agatha's back was against the back of the sofa.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry if I was bad," Agatha whispered, half-breathless.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, beautiful, you were wonderful. Amazing. Such a beautiful, beautiful girl you are."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Bringing her hand up, Rio licked it thoroughly clean of Agatha's juices, savoring the flavor, salty-tangy with a sweet kick at the end and smelling so richly Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Who's scenting who now?" she teased, and then kissed Agatha to let her have a taste.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio pulled a blanket from the back of the sofa over them and felt Agatha nuzzle under her chin.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I know I'm not good enough to bear your children," the omega muttered, half-asleep, "so don't worry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio frowned. She wanted to tell Agatha how untrue that was, how if Rio suddenly decided that she again wanted a mate and children, she would want Agatha to be that mate, and would glory in the happiness they might have and how wonderful the children could be.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Of course, poor Agatha was already asleep now, and Rio was tired herself, so the words went unsaid.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They napped for half an hour before two messages jangling through on Rio's phone woke them up. One was from William, informing them that lunch would soon be ready, and the other was from Alice, letting Rio know that she and Lilia would be arriving in another half hour.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mon, sweets," Rio said, "let's wash up, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha got up grumblingly, gathering her discarded jeans from the den floor and tromping up to the guest bathroom to wash and change. Rio followed after and went to her own bathroom—oh, how her alpha complained, whining that they should go with Agatha and <em>tend to mate</em>—and cleaned herself quickly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When they met again it was in the doorway of the guest room. Agatha had dressed neatly in a pale lavender blouse and a cream linen skirt, Rio in green cotton slacks and a cream button down.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Holy shit, we've started coordinating," Rio laughed, then regretted the laugh when Agatha cringed back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you... Should I change?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, <em>cari</em><em>ño</em>. No, you look beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want you to be proud to be seen with me. Especially among your friends."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I could not be prouder, Agatha, than to be seen in your company."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As they headed back downstairs, the doorbell chimed. At the bottom of the steps, Agatha moved behind Rio as if to hide.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're safe, omega. Come on and we'll greet our guests. I'll be right with you all the time, I promise."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It was Alice at the door when Rio answered, and Rio gladly pulled the gamma inside, hugging her tight for a moment, then noting happily that Agatha hugged her too. They already, despite few meetings, had a good rapport even here, which the director in Rio thought would bode well for their brief scenes together in the film.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Peering out to the walk, Rio smiled. There she was, making her way like a queen without attendants: Lilia Calderu. Actress, singer, agent, and general ruler of a very certain L.A. social scene. The woman who, when Rio had been a wild 21-year-old working as a barback at a slightly seedy jazz club, had taken the young alpha under her wing. The same woman who, when 23-year-old Rio had emerged from the cult barely stable emotionally, had accepted her back into the fold and had led the attempt to go and get Rio's mate and unborn child out as well.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That had not been managed, but it was not Lilia's fault.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio! Oh, my little Rio, come give me a big hug!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Mamá</em>," Rio said, and stepped out to hug the older woman close.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, now, where is this pretty girl I've been seeing on all the gossip blogs and things with you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Come in, come in and you'll see her."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was still just inside the front door, talking rather shyly to Alice. That conversation was over the moment Lilia spotted Agatha and rushed to embrace her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ah, what a pretty little thing! Agatha, yes? Oh, I can tell you'll make Rio very happy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She makes me happy already," Rio smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha's eyes went wide when Lilia hugged her, but a moment later Agatha was practically melting into the hug. Even when it was Lilia who pulled away, Rio could see Agatha try to cling for a moment longer.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, my dear," Lilia said to Agatha, "you are stunning. Certainly you and Rio will have gorgeous children."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked a little teary-eyed, and Rio grabbed her hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's still a while away, Lilia. Come on, let's go and have lunch."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Lunch went well, for the most part. Lilia and William dominated the conversation at first, but Alice always tossed her two cents in, and soon enough Agatha was fully engaged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Oh, she was witty. She was sharp. When Lilia asked her questions about her family and childhood, she hauled out her usual humorous skirtings of her trauma.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh no, you see, my mother was so busy," she explained, "that there were time I almost thought she would have to hire two or three new staffers to keep up with me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Were you a bit of a wild child?" Lilia asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"To hear Mother tell it, I was. She had not the time nor the patience to beat me as often as she would have liked."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That brought a lull to the conversation, but when Agatha laughed in a way to indicate that clearly she was joking, everyone else joined in, but for Rio, who smiled but brought a gentle hand up to rub Agatha's back for a moment.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">After the meal there was time spent together in conversation in the den. Agatha sat right by Rio on the sofa, snuggling into her side, clearly feeling peaceful and at home. A few times Rio, unthinking, turned her head aside and kissed Agatha's forehead, getting a happy smile in return.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'This could work,'</em> Rio thought.<br/>
<em>'I could keep her safe. I could not fail this time. I could make her happy, could give her all that she deserves in this world.'</em></p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">But there was always rationality to break through, to remind Rio that she had sworn never to endanger another mate. She did not know how to be a good partner, how to be part of a family like that. The closest she would ever have was her little pack; maybe at least Agatha could be a part of that.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"I really enjoyed lunch and everything. You make me feel so included."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio was sitting on the end of the bed in the guest room, casually watching Agatha get ready for bed, and she smiled at the omega's words.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want you to feel safe and included," Rio said.<br/>"I want you to know there's always a place for you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha came and knelt in front of Rio, looking up with something like adoration on her face.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you, Alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio winked at her and then motioned for her to stand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You said something earlier today, and I wanted to talk to you about it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh?" Agatha sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"When we... After we had our little session of stress relief, as you were falling asleep, you said you're not good enough to have my children."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just meant... I mean, you... I'm only..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hush. Let me say what I must."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio held Agatha's hands, smiling up at her a moment.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're so beautiful, Agatha. You're talented and intelligent and witty. Someone would be lucky to have you in their life forever. To win your heart. Your devotion. Someone strong and brave who can make your world wonderful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Looking away a moment, Rio sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Never for a moment think yourself unworthy, Agatha. If between the two of us either is unworthy of the other, I'm unworthy of you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's not true, Rio, that..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It is. It is true. Maybe one day you'll know. You'll understand. But for now, know that you are worthy of anything. Everything. That if I were to want someone to be the mother of my children, you would be first on the list. Hell, at this point, you would <u>be</u> the list."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Bringing Agatha's hands to her lips, Rio kissed each palm.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Someday you'll find someone, Agatha, who can be with you. But if they don't treat you with the respect and decency and love you deserve, then..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio trailed off and released Agatha's hands, only to feel them grip the sides of her head and gently tilt it up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Would you do something for me, Rio?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Haven't I proven I'll do anything for you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha giggled, smoothing Rio's hair with her hands.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Will you sleep in here with me again tonight?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If you want."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Will you hold me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If you want."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha dropped her hands to Rio's shoulders and pushed lightly, driving the alpha to lean back half-reclined. Smiling, Agatha straddled Rio's lap as she so often had done down on the sofa.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Will you actually have sex with me? Break me in, so to speak?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm on suppressants. We can use a condom too. Please, I just want my first time to be with someone gentle."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio swallowed hard.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll... Let me up a second. Need to get my phone."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why? Photographic evidence?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Need to order an emergency condom delivery."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So you'll..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"To make you happy, princess, I'll do it. Besides, it's not like I haven't thought about it. You're really beautiful, and... Well, let me go get the phone."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once Agatha shifted off of her, Rio hurried to grab her cane and make her way out and down the hall to her bedroom. Her phone was mostly charged, so she grabbed it from the dresser and carried it into the bathroom. Scrolling through the delivery app, she stared at the selection and found herself falling quickly into choice paralysis. She had not had any need of condoms in over a decade, and she was concerned about getting a good kind. With a worried whine, she went back to the guest room.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Which ones do we want?" she asked, tossing the phone onto the bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't know," Agatha shrugged, "I've never had experience with them, so..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, okay. Here, lemme..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Taking up the phone again, Rio found a variety pack and ordered that, along with a probably not-entirely-necessary bottle of lube and, for plausible deniability, a box of crackers.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And now we wait," she said, setting the phone on the nightstand and plopping herself down on the bed beside Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmm, how shall we ever pass the time?" Agatha grinned.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, we could plan the logistics of... And you're on top of me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha looked lovely, hair all loose and wild, wearing nothing but her blouse and undergarments as she once more straddled Rio and started to grind.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, sweetheart..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What? Don't you need a little gearing up?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure, but... Fuck... You're so wet already, aren't you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mmm. Wet for you. For my sweet, sexy alpha. Can't wait to feel you inside me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You sure you've never done this?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I've watched a lot of movies. A lot of sex scenes."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, then you <u>defini</u><u>tely</u> need an education."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Then I'm lucky I'll have such a good teacher," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She leaned down and kissed Rio hard, which in fact led Rio to start getting hard.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can I see?" Agatha asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"See what?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You. Your cock."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, you'll see it soon enough."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But I could maybe help it along a little more if I could see it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Growling softly, Rio rolled them both over so she could thrust her hips down against Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You want my cock?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes," Agatha said, but now she sounded worried, maybe even frightened.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweets, we don't have to do this unless you want it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want it. Just nervous."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't be. I'll be really gentle, okay? Just know, as much as you have no experience, I haven't had experience in a long time."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's okay. We'll make it work. Now, can I see your..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Reaching between them, Rio shoved her shorts down.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr">"That's your..."</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm. Doesn't seem like much now, but gimme a minute and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio trailed off, head slumping down against Agatha's shoulder as the omega took hold of her cock.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's so warm, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Bl-blood flow."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you get very big?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not too big. Average, I guess."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Like, seven inches last time I measured? But that was years ago."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Seven‽"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's not so much. And it doesn't get very thick. And I don't knot out of rut, so..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Seven inches."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We can stop, sweetheart. We don't have to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The doorbell rang.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll go get that," Rio rushed, tugging her shorts back up and rolling out of bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As she hurried down the stairs, a part of Rio hoped Agatha would change her mind. There was no way she wanted to hurt the girl, to cause her pain or something. Even as receptive as aroused omegas tended to be, the first few times still took some getting used to. Besides which, Rio was fairly certain she would be a bit hair trigger, given the length of time since she had last actually penetrated anyone.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">But as she opened the front door and leaned out to get the delivery, she sort of hoped they might do something. Even if it was a little kissing and touching, it was nice to have someone to do those things with. Anything would be beautiful, especially with Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She went a little slower back up the stairs, leaning on her cane heavily. Nerves were getting the best of her. Should she just lean into the guest room, say she was tired, and leave it at that? At the door, she paused, taking a few deep breaths, then knocked at the door and peered inside.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was stretched out on the bed, waiting for her...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Completely nude.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's breath caught in her throat and she stumbled in, the hand holding the bag trembling. Agatha's legs were spread, and Rio could see the shine of copious slick already on the omega's upper thighs; the air was heavy with Agatha's own scent and with that beautiful sweet cream sub-scent that must mean <u>something</u>, though Rio had not deduced what yet. It was something to do with arousal, but it was not Agatha's slick.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Whatever it was, it made her alpha go wild.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Make pups? Fill pretty omega with pups?'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'No, we're not gonna knock her up.'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">But Rio wanted to. Fuck, she wanted to go and make love to Agatha and cum inside and hope to hell it took. She wanted to love Agatha, protect her, make a life with her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">No. No, not allowed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Never.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're so beautiful," Rio choked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't lie," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm not lying. Swear I'm not. You're gorgeous. I... Do you want to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Will we go slow?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course, princess."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio felt herself getting rapidly hard, and so she closed the door and stumped across the room, dropping her cane, the bag, and her shorts at the bedside before crawling over on top of Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It... It's big," Agatha said, reaching down and getting a firm grasp on Rio's cock.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's okay if you're scared. We can just go to sleep."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No. I want this. I know you'll be careful with me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio kissed Agatha sweetly, touched her gently to try and be reassuring that yes, she fully intended to be careful. The alpha in her led her to kiss and nuzzle down along Agatha's neck, to nose at the primary glands, which made the omega shiver, her grip on Rio's cock going a little tighter.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Like that, <em>cariño</em>?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Agatha gasped, wriggling slightly, "Rio, I need you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm here. Right here, Agatha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, fuck me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Slow, sweets. Slow."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There was a moment where Agatha was bucking up, trying to find any way to get Rio's cock in her, and Rio had to roll away, scrabbling around in the bag and pulling out the box of condoms.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Be my good girl," Rio said, "and let alpha take the lead."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Ripping the box open, Rio grabbed a packet from within.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wait, please," Agatha said, "let me touch you a little more?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Promise to be good?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I promise. Please, let me..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Back went the box onto the floor, and Rio delicately split open the packet and left it to sit a moment on the nightstand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What do you wanna do?" she asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha reached over and stroked Rio's cock firmly. The alpha's eyes fluttered closed for a moment and she groaned, thrusting up, seeking more.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck. Good omega, making your alpha so ready. Good, good girl."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please can we go without the condom first? Just to see?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, sweetheart. No."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio scented strong command and felt Agatha pull away. Opening her eyes, she turned toward the omega and pulled her close.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can't have you full of my pups when we still have a movie to finish," Rio said, and toned down the command scent.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's okay. Here, you can help put this on."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio grabbed the condom packet and dumped the contents into her palm. She got it started on herself, then let Agatha take over rolling it down.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good girl. Shit, you have the softest hands. Love feeling you touch me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you, alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The rubber itself was a fairly thin one, so there was still some good sensation as Agatha continued stroking Rio's cock. Everything felt a bit dulled down, but that was probably good, since Rio felt like otherwise she would go off at any second.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can we... Can we have the lights off?" Agatha asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If you feel better that way, sweetheart..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just don't feel... I... I don't want you to laugh if I look funny when we..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I will never laugh at you, Agatha. But if you want the lights off, we can do that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Awkwardly, Rio twisted around and reached for the light switch by the headboard. She got it, slapped it down...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then heard Agatha gasp and giggle.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, are you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It... You... Oh, shit, this is weird."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Looking down her body, Rio saw the object of Agatha's amusement.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, so, next time, taking way more note of which condom I grab. Glow-in-the-dark..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, it'll make things easier to... To find," Agatha laughed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mere," Rio rasped, and pulled Agatha down on top of her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They kissed a while, Rio's cock trapped between them, and Rio reached down to play with Agatha's clit idly. When she did a certain rub-circle-press, Agatha moaned and Rio felt slick splash down from Agatha's cunt onto her hand and legs. Oh, her omega was sensitive and needy. Well, not <u>her</u> omega.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Fuck it. Her omega for now.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Alpha, please, I need you. Please?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Take what you need, sweetheart. It's okay. My good girl can take whatever she needs."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio groaned when Agatha lifted up and straddled her. She had liked the softness of Agatha pressed on top of her, the closeness of feeling each other. But then she felt Agatha grab her cock, holding it steady and lifting up further to begin to sink down on it. Reaching out, Rio stroked Agatha's thighs.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Go slow, <em>cari</em><em>ño</em>. No rushing, okay? We have all night."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Her eyes had adjusted to the dark, and she could see Agatha carefully trying to line everything up, could see and feel the moment her tip was perfectly notched between the omega's folds, and oh, the sensation when she was pressing inward.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck, Agatha, sweetheart... Fuck."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was gasping now and then, sliding down so slowly onto Rio's cock until suddenly, with a little huff, she settled all the way.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit, sweetheart, you okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Uh-huh. Oh. Oh. You're inside me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hurt?" Rio rasped.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just... Different. Full."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We can stop if..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, please?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Inside was so tight, so warm, and Rio almost regretted the condom, because she wanted to feel Agatha's slick all over her, coating her cock.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart, you feel so nice," she whispered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha moaned, rocking slightly, lifting her hips slowly then dropping back down.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio... Oh, Rio..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm here," Rio said, and pushed up onto her elbows to watch Agatha ride her in the dark.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was beautiful, and Rio felt something blossom in her chest. The affection she had developed for the younger woman would, she suspected, not easily be dropped after a few months.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'Wanna keep her,'</em> Rio thought, and raised herself to fully sit up and wrap her arms around Agatha's waist.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She reached down and flicked her thumb over Agatha's clit at the same moment she managed to capture a rosy nipple in her mouth. When she sucked gently, she heard Agatha moan and felt faint fluttering around her cock. One of Agatha's hands was at the back of her head, holding her there, and the closeness of it all made Rio's mind race.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio? Harder," Agatha panted, and her free hand was gripping Rio's wrist, trying to speed up the movement's over her clit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It only seemed right to oblige, to press harder and circle faster as Agatha rode down on Rio's cock a bit more roughly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Close," Agatha grunted, and Rio felt her start to tense up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Relax, princess. Deep breaths and relax. There's my good girl."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha shivered, rocking down hard on Rio's cock, crying out softly. Rio held on to her, feeling her cunt flutter and clench in an irresistible way that stoked a low burn in Rio's gut and eventually brought her shuddering through her own climax.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck, Agatha, tight," Rio groaned.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Flopping back with Agatha on top of her, Rio reached down to hold on as she softened and slipped out of the omega. As she peeled the condom off, she still managed to get some of her spend on her hand and thighs, and she sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Lemme up for a bit, babe," she said, and felt deprived once again when Agatha rolled off of her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Knotting the condom, Rio tossed it onto the floor and scrambled out of bed. She went and washed up in the guest bathroom, not wanting to take any chances in the night.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When she returned, she found Agatha lying very still, watching her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Did I do it right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, sweetheart. You were beautiful. Perfect."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Are you mad at me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Because I wanted to do that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Cariño</em>, I'm not at all mad. I feel really good. Do you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, and when Rio was back in bed, the omega snuggled close.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm glad if I made you happy. Feel safe still?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. Good. All I want is for you to feel safe."</p>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They went, at the behest of the studio PR machine, to some pretentious industry thing. Some art thing with bad champagne and bad hors d'oeuvre but nice enough art. Rio looked at some of the stuff, thought of maybe buying some, but in the end she was too distracted, not by the networking opportunities, but by how beautiful Agatha looked: light makeup, hair in a carefully arranged messy-neat updo, dress a purple so dark it seemed nearly black with little flashes of iridescent beading.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It looks nice," Agatha said when Rio stepped up behind her and commented on her gown, "but the bodice has some structuring I really hate. Don't know why I picked this one."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What if I take you home," Rio offered, "and arrange it so you don't have to wear anything too structured for a while?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As she said that last part, she let the arm that was around Agatha slip a little, hand going to rest on the omega's lower abdomen, pressing lightly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Agatha whispered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They both knew what they were doing. The move was calculated. Let the press who were here see that, snap a few photos, and fire up the gossip machine. There would be headlines probably within the hour speculating about a bun in the oven.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They went back to Agatha's after. This was not as common for them as spending the night together at Rio's, but in some ways Rio enjoyed it very much. She liked being around Agatha's belongings and seeing the way her omega—yes, her omega for the time being, she had fully settled into that—lived. The place was cozy, tidy-yet-casual. Everything in it was so Agatha. So lovely.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once they were alone, their good clothes traded for comfy things—Rio had begun keeping a few items at Agatha's as part of their little exchange—they relaxed on Agatha's bed and watched some television until Agatha switched it off. She smiled up at Rio in her irresistible way.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You got the condoms?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course. You gave me half the box."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just making sure. As much as you beg me to breed you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, I know we need to be careful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know you know, sweetheart," Rio smiled, scooting down on the bed and kissing Agatha gently.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Will you mount me?" Agatha asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If that's what you want."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Just being in this warm bed with Agatha already had Rio half hard, and when Agatha sat up and pulled off her shirt, more blood flow in Rio's body refocused itself. When Agatha squirmed around and removed her sweatpants, all bets were off, and Rio found herself practically tearing her own clothes off.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I have to have you," Rio growled, pulling Agatha to her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck, yes, you can have me any time you want me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Oh, the heat of the moment. The perfect coalescence of want, need, give, take. Rio thrust desperately between Agatha's legs, felt the beautiful sanctity of soft skin and pooling slick and all that warm desire. She knew they needed to stop right now, to take a half second to prepare, and she released Agatha from her grasp.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Condom."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Right," Agatha nodded, and smiled as she reached over and grabbed two packets from her nightstand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"In case you think you've got two rounds in ya, sailor."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, I can definitely go as many rounds as you want, sweetheart."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio snatched away one of the packets, started to tear it, then paused.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You feel okay?" she asked Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I feel fine, but I'll feel even better once you're in me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">For a moment, a delicious sense of irresponsibility took hold, and Rio laid the packet aside.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wanna feel me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Bare?" Agatha asked, smile widening just a touch.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, you do always ask."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You mean the three times we've fucked?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Every time, at first, you ask me to go in raw, just to feel. Do you... I mean, if you don't want..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I do. Fuck, I do. I want you in me. Just you, Rio. I know it's crazy..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Totally a stupid idea."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But I <u>am</u> on birth control..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio grinned.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Caution to the wind?" she murmured.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Giggling, Agatha leaned in and kissed her, then moved over to get into position. Rio took a deep breath and got up to kneel behind her omega, looking down and seeing that Agatha's folds were absolutely soaked. She would probably slide in with no effort at all.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure you want this?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck, I'm as sure as I've ever been. I need you, Alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha wiggled her hips in the most tantalizing way, and Rio groaned, grabbing them and thrusting forward to let her cock slide along the beautiful slick heat of Agatha's cleft.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Holy shit," Rio sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It had been so long. She had almost forgotten how good any of this could feel. Carefully, slowly, she steadied herself and slipped inside.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh... My... Fuck," she breathed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She bottomed out fast, not meaning to, meaning to go even slower but being drawn in by the hot, soft, wet pull of Agatha's core. Leaning over the omega's back, Rio sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, sweetheart?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want you to never, ever leave," Agatha moaned.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Pretty inclined to stay myself. Agatha, you feel so good. You feel perfect."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They just stayed that way for perhaps a minute before Agatha's hips shifted. Rio thought she was pulling away, that it was time to pull out and put on the condom, but instead of drawing away, Agatha ground back in a tight circle.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio? Please?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What, my sweetheart?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, can we... Can we just..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You want this?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm. Please."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Something in Rio's mind snapped softly over, and she unbent her body, pulled back her hips slightly, then pushed back in. Fuck, it felt so right. So sweet and good and right.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What if I... I don't pull out in time?" she whispered, her thrusts picking up speed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio... Oh, fuck, you feel so good... Fill me up. Please, please."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Why not? Why not take the chance? Rio knew how she felt about Agatha, and she had a sense that Agatha's feelings for her might be similar. They could do this. They could take this in the other direction, make it fully real, be together. They could be a couple, could have a family. Agatha would be a wonderful partner, an ideal mate...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">No. No, she could not do this. Could not risk failing again. Could not, could not, could not.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She was so close, so close, she could feel Agatha's cunt desperately quivering around her, heard Agatha moaning against the pillows. Rio knew the burn in her gut, felt everything aligning, she could not do this to the woman she... Loved? Yes, loved, wholeheartedly loved. They had already taken this risk, been careless, but maybe birth control would cover what they had done.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio pulled out a fraction of a second too late, feeling the first of her cum spill deep in Agatha, groaning and tugging free to see more land just around the entrance to Agatha's cunt, the last of it splattering across the pale skin of the omega's ass and lower back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck!" Rio grunted, angry at herself, wanting to run away but knowing she could not abandon Agatha in this moment.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was very still, but now Rio could hear that her moans had turned into sobs.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart. Oh, shit, sweetheart, I'm sorry. Here, c'mere."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio moved to lie down and pull Agatha to her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry I'm bad," Agatha whimpered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, my princess. You're not bad. Oh, my sweet, beautiful girl. You're never bad. Shhh."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I shouldn't have your baby. I'd only hurt them."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hush. You won't hurt a baby. Hush. Listen, you're on birth control, so you probably won't have to worry. You wanna get a backup pill in case? I know we can get it delivered. Do you want me to do that?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah. I'm sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's okay, Agatha. Shh. Okay. Do you want to clean up? Get my spend off you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You go take a shower and I can get the pill sent."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Another little nod, but then Agatha pressed herself deeper into Rio's arms.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I wish I could have your babies, Rio. They'd be wonderful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Any babies you have will be wonderful, 'cause you'll be their mother."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once Agatha had cried it out a little longer, Rio walked her to the bathroom and watched her get in the shower, then went back sat on the edge of the bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck, I'm a fucking asshole."</p>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay," Wade called, "we're gonna take that again! Reset!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As everyone shifted back into place, Rio nodded. This would only be the third take, and really more than anything it was for safety. The first had been passable, the second had been great. Luckily, even with all the background stuff, the scene was quick to reset. Once it was all back to start, Wade and Rio nodded to each other. Peering up from the monitor, Rio saw Agatha in the doorway, saw Alice waiting at the bar.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Action!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">1, 2, 3. Boom, boom, boom. Everything was near perfect. Agatha approached the bar, Alice sidled over, Agatha showed slight indifference but then interest by Alice's second line. By Alice's third line, Agatha was definitely already prepared to go home with her. Hold. Hold.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Cut!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded to Wade, gave him a thumbs up. This one was good. She was very glad they had gotten this bit really nailed down in so few takes; it needed an aura of freshness.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Also, watching it film made her alpha do angry laps in her head, and that was bothering her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Other person touch omega? </em>
<em>
<u>Gamma</u>
</em>
<em> touch omega all soft like making love?'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shit, was she even gonna make it through the filming of the hook-up?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Well, at least she could credit all of this, including the fake relationship with Agatha that was shading far too real, with one thing. For the first time in six years, Rio was back in therapy. It was actually helping her through a lot of things. The guilt that lingered over what happened to end the life of her mate and child (which she knew was not her fault but <u>still</u>) and missing Janine and regretting not being there when Violet was born. The anger and self-loathing over not being there to protect them, to get them out.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She knew she would never be really over them, but she was starting to feel lighter about some things. She still kind of wanted to go to whatever place that fucking cult leader was locked up in and kick his ass at minimum, but generally she was feeling lighter. Of course, reliving some of the shit in therapy again meant that she was back to some gnarly old nervous habits, but so far that was fine. She was not going wild with things. She had work to do. She had Agatha to reassure and protect.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The sex stuff between them was still ongoing, but they were being a lot more careful. No more risky shit. They had fucked up two weeks ago, but it was all good. Everything was fine. Things were gentle between them, and easy. It was beautiful, whatever they had, but after their mistake, Rio knew there was no way she could admit her feelings. There was no way because then Agatha would think there could be more.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And why can't there be?" Rio's new therapist had asked when she brought up the whole mess of being in love with a perfect, beautiful girl she would never mate or sire pups on.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'Because I'm a piece of shit,' </em>Rio thought, <em>'and b</em><em>ecause Agatha deserves far more than me.'</em></p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They got through the day, and when it was all said and done, Rio and Agatha went back to Rio's place together, as they so often did these days. Agatha was quiet all during the drive, and even once they settled on the sofa in the den, she seemed perhaps upset. Rio stroked her hair and kissed the top of her head.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart, what's wrong?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, we... You've done so much for me, and I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha sighed and looked away.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's about tomorrow. What we're shooting tomorrow. The sex scene. I... Rio, we're so far down this thing that I'll feel like I'm cheating on you. I know it's just acting but..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you wanna cut the scene? Or most of it? We can try to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No. I mean, it's pretty integral to the tie-up of the plot."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Look, this is all gonna be fine. It'll be closed set, just you and me and Alice and absolutely necessary crew, including the intimacy coordinator. If you need anything, we've got you covered, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know. I just... Rio, I'm... I love you. Not just as a friend."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio felt her heart sink. She had known it was possible that Agatha might reciprocate her feelings, but now...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know you don't feel the same way. I... You told me once you lost a mate and a child. Maybe that's why you can't fall in love, because you'll feel you're betraying them, or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, I'm in love with you. Deeply in love with you. It... There are things, though, that make it difficult. Some of it is about what I lost. Sweetheart, I just... I can't bear to think about how I could fail you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fail me? How could you ever? You've done so much already to keep me safe, to protect me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Remember the mess in Calabasas? The thing Reed mentioned when he was hacked off about us dating?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... It was... I was in a cult. Like, a small one, but a cult. I tried to leave, and a week later I went back to get my mate. She was supposed to be two weeks from giving birth to our baby, but she gave birth two days before I went back. The guy who was running the cult, he... He snapped. A few people had left besides me, and there was trouble with the cops over drug stuff."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio trailed off, and she felt Agatha cling to her more tightly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What... What happened?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"The day I went back with some friends to try and get Janine—that was my wife's name—was the day the leader went and killed everyone in the house."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, shit. Oh, Rio, I'm so, so sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I had to identify Janine's body. Someone who'd been in the house but hidden when the killing started confirmed the baby was ours."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Did... Did your baby have a name?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio choked back tears.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We were gonna call her Violet. That's what... What's on the stone, on the grave where she's buried with her mother."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The tears fell then, and Rio let out a few sobs. Agatha held her, rubbing her back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm so sorry, darling. I can't imagine... I... Oh, Rio, I'm sorry."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I can't risk I would fail you and our children like I failed them."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You won't, Rio. You won't. You were so young then and unsettled. It would be different now. We could make it work."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... If I lose you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You won't lose me, Rio. You won't lose me unless a day comes when you don't want me anymore."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That... I could never stop wanting you, Agatha. I just..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What if something happened and you hated me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Impossible. I love you so much, I do."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I love you. So why shouldn't we be together? Why shouldn't we try?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want to. I do, Agatha. I want you. I want us to be together, I want a life with you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So let's do it. Please. Let's be together."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Even with what happened? With my past?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's your past, darling. For now, let's think about the future."</p>
</div>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio and Agatha stayed up late talking, setting parameters and boundaries for their new relationship. In the process Rio did not take a couple of emergency shots. This might not have been a problem, but she was on the edge of a preventable rut.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Preventable if she took her shots fairly regularly in the lead up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When she woke in the morning, itchy and annoyed, she explained her mistake to Agatha, who cuddled her into a better mood. She took a shot as they got ready for the day, and then Agatha hugged her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Will that help most of the morning?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Should. I can take another at lunch, or a bit earlier if I need, and then one before we leave set. Should get me back on track for this cycle."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What if you... Just didn't take the last couple?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart, if I miss another shot today, I could well go into rut tomorrow."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Which is a day off, right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, I mean, it's the weekend."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So take the weekend off. Have a little rut."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Princess..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll be here. Use me. Take me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, rut is... It can get pretty wild. I've never knotted you, it..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want it, Rio. I want all of you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You'd almost definitely get pregnant, even with your birth control."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So the thing I want every time we fuck?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We're so close to the end of filming. It won't hurt."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It was tempting. So much time had passed for Rio with no partner to help satiate her during her rut. No love, no tender affection. Just humping into toys and pillows and mattresses. Agatha would be sweet during, would caress her and make her feel loved. Besides, more and more lately, she had been haunted by the thought of how good Agatha would look pregnant.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If I do this..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If <u>we</u> do this," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If we do this and you get scared at any point during the weekend, or if anything hurts..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You'll know, trust me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And you... Really want to have a baby? <u>My</u> baby?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha snorted out laugh.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, maybe I shouldn't tell you this, but the first time we ever met, that first lunch months ago, all I could think while I looked at you was 'Fuck, I want to have her babies.' I didn't say anything at the time, being polite, but..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure it wasn't omega brain?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, it's possible, but more likely it was because you're devastatingly gorgeous. And the feelings in that direction have only grown since you've been so kind, so gentle and protective. I love you, Rio, and I want you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio pressed Agatha up against the bathroom door.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're ready for me to breed you, huh? Gonna be my good little omega?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes, Alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The softness of her tone made Rio's heart race.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I won't hurt you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It was not, of course, a good morning for Rio to be half rutted up on set. The scene they were primarily focusing on was incredibly complex, intimate, delicate...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And it heavily featured Rio's omega pretending to have sex with someone else.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Of course her rational, objective director brain could handle this. She had directed sex scenes before, though never, of course, featuring anyone she was dating. Still, she could be detached, could observe and give notes and just go with the flow.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The part of her brain that was a few hours out from establishing her relationship with one of the performers in the scene had some feelings of concern and jealousy, but they were easily shoved down. This was a scene. Alice and Agatha were acting, going through carefully planned moments and actions. It was all very chill.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's alpha, meanwhile, absolutely did not like this. No way. Someone else was touching her omega, kissing her omega, appeared to be fucking her omega...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The shot before work quelled the beast a little at first. As lunch approached, however, thing got tough. Thankfully, they had a lot of what they needed by the break, and Rio was fully ready to head for the nearest bathroom and take her shot. Then, Agatha approached.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Will we have lunch together in my trailer as usual?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded at her, eyes wide.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. I'll just go ahead and wash up a little first. Hate to smell like someone else while I have lunch with my big, strong, handsome alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's alpha went wild.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Omega clean for make pups! Gogogo make pups with omega! Make omega so happy! Be good to her! Make no one else touch her like that!'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio stood quick.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Lemme walk with you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It was not easy, but Rio stayed calm while Agatha cleaned up in the trailer. She managed to politely accept their lunch order when it arrived, then laid the food out on the little table and sat to wait. The moment she saw Agatha again, however, she huffed out a breath and went to her, pulling her close.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mine," Rio grunted.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mmm, all yours," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She still had a little too much smell of others on her. The chirpy delta intimacy coordinator. A hard-scenting beta PA.</p>
</div><p dir="ltr">Alice.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mine, mine, mine," Rio repeated.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It might help if you'd scent me, Alpha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Might help if I breed you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The words escaped Rio with a little growl. The rational part of her was embarrassed, but the rest...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, Alpha," Agatha breathed, "breed me. Make sure everyone knows I'm yours."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's mind shifted a bit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you want..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, my love, take me," Agatha whispered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They moved to the little couch, the spot that was just big enough for a quick lie-down, and Rio sat, keeping Agatha in front of her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You don't have a call back to set until two set-ups after lunch," Rio said, "so will you promise me one thing?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mm-hmm," Agatha said, running her fingers through Rio's hair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"When we finish here, I want you to stay lying down for about a half-hour if you can. We'll cover you up, I'll put a pillow under your hips, and that way, maybe we get a little head start, huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, I love you so much."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you too. I love you, and I'm gonna take care of you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Hooking her fingers in the waistbands of Agatha's sweatpants and panties, Rio tugged them down carefully, then held Agatha's hand as she stepped out. The smell of Agatha's arousal was strong and Rio groaned, leaning forward to rest her forehead a moment against Agatha's belly. Nosing down, she nuzzled her way through the soft curls of Agatha's mound, then nudged her nose in at the front of Agatha's cleft.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio," Agatha sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Feel safe?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So safe."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio spread her carefully with two fingers and flicked the thumb of that hand over her clit, then leaned down to lap at the swollen bud firmly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio. Rio!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Slick gushed out of Agatha's cunt and she whimpered, wobbling slightly so that Rio caught her and stood, easing the omega down onto the couch, sliding a cushion under her head and another under her hips.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Want me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, now! Need you so much."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shivering, Rio toed off her shoes and shucked her jeans and boxers, then knelt between Agatha's legs.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck, such a pretty pink pussy," she muttered, stroking her cock a few times, then leaning down and sliding right in.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Make sure you breed me deep," Agatha moaned.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"All the way, <em>cariño</em>. Alpha's gonna make sure that seed goes all the way."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Growling low, Rio started fucking, relishing the soft heat and the wet sounds.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My omega," she rasped, "gonna be full up with my baby growing in you. Gonna breed you so good, <em>mi amor</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, please... Ah! Fuck, Alpha, wanna be full. Please!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio plowed in and out roughly, leaning down to press a lingering kiss to Agatha's lips.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Marry me? Whenever you want, <u>if</u> you want..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes. Rio, yes. I'll marry you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Love you. Fuck, I love you. My beautiful girl, my good girl, Agatha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio. Rio, you're so wonderful. So beautiful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck. Fuck, I'm... I'm gonna..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Come on, beautiful. Give me all that seed. Pump me full."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Love you..." Rio gasped out, slamming in hard and relishing the sensation of filling Agatha with her load.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you!" Agatha rushed, pulling Rio hard down on top of her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They lay like that for several minutes before Rio carefully slid out, still panting.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. Okay. Are you okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm great. I'm amazing. You?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Excellent. Whoo. Okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Reaching down to the floor, Rio grabbed Agatha's panties and sweatpants and helped her ease them back on. As she was reaching for her own lower garments, Agatha grabbed her wrist.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wait. Let me... Clean you up."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Princess..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio smiled and moved to brace herself so that her rapidly softening cock was over Agatha's face. Watching Agatha lick and slurp it clean nearly made Rio hard all over again, but she restrained herself, then finished redressing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Lemme wash my hands, and then I'll feed you lunch."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh? Feeding me lunch?" Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Only the best treatment for my sweet girl," Rio smirked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio washed up and, true to her word, came back to feed Agatha, holding her sandwich and cup for her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I feel like a lazy ass," Agatha teased once.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not lazy, just well bred," Rio said with a wink.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When they had both eaten, Rio kissed Agatha and stood, pulling a blanket over her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Comfy?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Absolutely the most comfy ever," Agatha assured her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. Remember, you just stay lying down for a while."</p>
</div><p dir="ltr">"Got it."</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Leaning down, Rio kissed Agatha's forehead and stroked her belly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"See you in a few, <em>mi amor</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hnn?"</p>
</div><p dir="ltr">Agatha grabbed Rio's hand and smiled and she squeezed it lovingly.</p><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I can't wait to know I'm having your baby."</p>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The rest of the afternoon went reasonably well, though Rio got twitchy as time passed. The day ended early, everyone very pleased with the footage they had gotten, and Rio was entirely ready to head out for a weekend of rut...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then Reed showed up and called her aside.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, you've been doing a hell of a job on this, I gotta say."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks, Reed. Everyone's bringing their A game."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're ahead of schedule, everything's ticking along, and the dailies... Gotta say, you were always so right about casting Agatha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Told ya she'd be great."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yep, I foresee great things for her."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No doubt."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"In fact, there's a project coming up next year that..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, Reed, I'd love to stay and chat, but I <u>really</u> gotta get to some stuff at home, okay? Promise, first thing Monday, bright and early, we'll talk about whatever."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As soon as it seemed like Reed was willing to let her go, Rio took off and headed for the car. Agatha was already waiting for her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I cannot <u>wait</u> to get you home," Rio growled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh? Is there something going on?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Kidding, kidding. Everything all set for the weekend?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Lemme just... Hey, Will?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, boss?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You do that big grocery shop I asked you for?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yup. Got it all in. <u>And</u>, since you were so curious, I'll be off with friends all weekend, so..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sounds good, man. Real good."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio settled back for the ride home, keeping a possessive hand on Agatha's thigh the whole way. They were real now. They were going to give in to the feelings and the thoughts and let it all happen. Agatha wanted her, wanted her in spite of everything. Agatha wanted to be with her and love her and be loved by her. Agatha wanted to marry her and have her children.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She would not fuck up this time. She would not cut and run, then fail everything.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As soon as they were home, Agatha excused herself upstairs to bedroom. Rio wanted to go with her, but found herself dispatched on a quick errand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can you bring me some things?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want a few pillows and a sheet or blanket from your bed."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Is that..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And maybe that green pillow you like to rest your head on down in the den."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. I can get those. Okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio rushed off and gathered the requested items, then carried them back to the guest room. Agatha took them at the door, not letting her enter just yet.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just go and drink a bottle of water and wait, and I'll get you when I'm ready."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio nodded, having now an inkling of what Agatha was up to.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You take your time, <em>cariño</em>. I'll be ready when you are."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Down in the kitchen, William was rushing around, preparing things and shoving them into containers.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, so, I've made a couple of quick things for you and Agatha to have this weekend. Some pre-prepped meals I did this morning, some crudités, lotta protein..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"William, do you assume Agatha and I can't cook for ourselves?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No, but... May I speak frankly?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Always."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Boss, you smell like a rut bar on a Saturday night, and I've seen this morning and this afternoon how you've been with Agatha. I've also handled a few years of you needing to be fed during ruts. You'll need all of this for the times between... You know."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio puffed out a breath, then laughed. To think, she had thought they were managing at least a little discretion.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks, Will. You're a good dude."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The delta shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just part of the job," he said, putting the last containers in the fridge and heading out to his apartment.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio grabbed a bottle of water and leaned against the kitchen island to wait. What had happened at lunch made her nervous, and the weekend ahead made her even more so. It had been so long since she rutted with anyone. What if she was too out of control and she hurt Agatha? She would never forgive herself.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'Just have to try to stay calm,' </em>she thought <em>'and maybe let Agatha be on top.'</em></p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She had nearly finished the water when Agatha entered the kitchen. The omega was dressed in just her favorite silky, flowing, dark purple robe, and she looked beautiful. Rio just wanted to pull her into an embrace and hold her forever.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well," Agatha said, grabbing her own bottle of water from the fridge, "would you like to come and see my handiwork?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If you wanna show me," Rio nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, my darling, I plan to have you in that guest room for most of the weekend, so you better come and inspect it now before rut brain hits and you just start pounding me on every flat surface in the house on the way up."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I don't wanna <u>inspect</u> it so much. You make it sound like you think I'm gonna pass judgment."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha moved to join Rio at the island.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, I was... I've never done this before. Nested for a mate, I mean. I just want to know you like it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweet girl, I will like anything you do. I'm the world's biggest Agatha Harkness fan."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Smiling, Agatha moved into Rio's personal space.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Are you really?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, babe, I am number one. I'm top of the list."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mmm. Hope you'll be on top of me soon."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That what you want? Want me on top of you, splitting your pretty pussy open and filling you up?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha whimpered and threw her arms around Rio's neck.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Alpha, please," she sighed, "let me make you happy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, we're gonna make each other real happy, sweetheart. Real, real happy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio just held Agatha close, stroking her hair, nuzzling against her neck.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My pretty, pretty girl," Rio sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">This felt so good. Just a weekend alone to rut her woman. To breed. Still, there were painful thoughts clawing their way to the surface.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Feel like I'm gonna lose my mind, Agatha. Can I say one thing now? It's so dumb and probably awful..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Say whatever you need, my love."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... If you get pregnant, I'll love any baby no matter what, but... But I hope... I kinda hope we have a son first. I don't know if... If I can handle..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know, my love. I know. Here, come on up to bed, okay? We'll take care of each other."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha slipped away a little, taking Rio's hand and leading her to the stairs. The sweet cream scent is strong, enticing. All the way up to the guest room, all Rio could think was that this moment lead to forever. To marriage. Babies. Life.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The first thing to hit her about the room was that the sunlight entering through the windows seemed muggy, somehow, and soft. Normally this room just had vertical blinds, but now there were soft lilac sheers as well, blurring and fuzzing the light, making the air somehow seem smoky.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The bedsheets, layered over with the blanket from Rio's bed, had been turned down, and all the extra pillows were placed just so all over the bed, intermixed with a few garments that Rio recognized as her own. It was a haphazard nest, thrown together in three quarters of an hour, but it looked comfortable. It would be a sweet place to spend this weekend.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I might've put a few extra items on the shopping list this morning," Agatha said, gesturing to the sheers.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's good, love. You made it so nice for us. Thank you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha blushed, turning her head a little aside to hide behind her hair. Rio brushed the hair back, smiling.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't hide from me, pretty girl. Please? You never have to be shy with me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, today... When you asked me to marry you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I meant it, Agatha. I did. Did you mean it when you said yes?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I did."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio was the one to lead the way to the bed. She smiled and untied Agatha's robe, then pushed it off her shoulders. She could just see that Agatha was shivering.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Scared?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No," Agatha said, "I'm excited."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. Lie down for me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha crawled onto the bed, settling in the middle, arranging herself with a pillow under her hips—specifically the green pillow from the den.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck," Rio breathed reverently.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Stripping off, she climbed onto the bed and settled down so her head was between Agatha's legs. The smell was intoxicating, the rich redoubling of Agatha's own scent in her slick interlaced with that maddening sweet cream fragrance. She was absolutely sopping wet, and Rio did not hesitate to move forward and swirl her tongue through Agatha's folds. The musky-sweet taste of Agatha seemed like a blow to the last rational thoughts in her head, and she grunted, plunging her tongue into the omega's cunt as far as she could.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha gasped, fingers twisting through Rio's hair. The little tugging sensation made Rio feel even wilder, and she desperately went on, lapping at Agatha, plunging two fingers in all the way and curving them along soft walls as she thrust them in and out. She sucked hard at Agatha's clit, briefly daring to graze it with her teeth, then pulling away to kiss it and to tease it with the tip of her tongue. Agatha was whimpering, hips twitching up slightly at each little touch.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Alpha? Alpha, please love me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio looked up at her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm loving you, sweetheart. Getting you ready for more, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Pulling her fingers nearly all the way out, Rio folded a third against them and then shoved back in rough, at the same time going back to sucking, more gently this time, on Agatha's clit. Scissoring her fingers apart slightly, she heard Agatha moan, felt a soft fluttering along the walls of Agatha's cunt, then felt it clench tight once, twice, before a spurt of fresh slick shot forth, coating Rio's hand and chin. Rio kept working, trying to coax another climax or two from Agatha, wanting to give the omega so much pleasure, to prove she could be a good, loving alpha and make her mate feel wonderful. The second followed quickly on from the first, perhaps was even an aftershock of it, and it brought another little wave of slick.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio? Rio, I need... Please, I need you to hold me," Agatha begged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Quickly, but carefully, Rio pulled her fingers free, kissed Agatha's clit once more, then crawled up over the younger woman.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm here, sweetheart. I gotcha. You're so beautiful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio used her slick-drenched hand to stroke her cock a few times, kissing Agatha passionately as she did.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You ready for me?" she asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please. Please, I need you inside."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Already panting with need, Rio lined up and slid in, easily bottoming out. Agatha groaned, arms tight around Rio's neck.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck yes."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">With that assurance, Rio instantly began to thrust, tiny little motions at first, barely drawing back before thrusting back in. Occasionally she stopped at full depth and simply ground her hips in a slow circle, wringing a soft moan from Agatha and feeling the omega cling to her tighter for a moment.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So pretty, my soft girl," Rio muttered, not even really thinking, just letting the words tumble out.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They were so close in this moment, so warm, so together. To Rio it felt as if their bodies were fully in sync, skin to skin, breath to breath. Agatha's cunt was clutching at her cock so perfectly,, and Rio shivered at the thought of filling Agatha for the second time in a day.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So good, Agatha. So good, so tight, so hot. My perfect girl, so ready for my seed, so ready to have her belly filled with my baby. Fuck, you are so perfect. Mine. My mate."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was kissing her, rocking up against her as if Rio's cock could somehow go deeper. Rio felt the real lust hit her, felt her knot begin to swell just at the entrance of Agatha's cunt on one pull back. She smirked, kissing Agatha's cheek.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ready? You ready for all of me, sweetheart?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes. Please, Rio, knot me. Knot me and make me yours."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Her knot popped in so easily, still swelling, still growing to be ready to plug everything tight, and Rio could feel Agatha's cunt stretching, then clamping, wanting, accepting.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mark me?" Agatha breathed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Positive."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">With a rough chuckle, Rio dropped her head, traced the tip of her tongue over the slight swell of one of Agatha's primary glands, then latched on and bit down hard. An instant later, Agatha had bitten her too, and immediately the low flame in Rio's gut flared into an unstoppable conflagration as she started to flood Agatha with cum. With a roar, Rio pushed up for a moment, vision flashing gray white, and then dropped her head back down again.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you," she whispered, "fucking fuck, I love you. I love you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you," Agatha sobbed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio kept cumming, kept cumming, and to be doing this with someone, with someone soft and sweet-scented and warm and tender after years alone, was like some strange new revelation of reality and joy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They stayed tied for almost a half-hour. When it was done, when she felt her knot start to shrink and her cock start to soften, Rio groaned and eased out of Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay?" she asked, forehead pressed to Agatha's.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you," Agatha said softly, smiling.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you too. My mate. My heart."</p>
</div>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They fucked twice more by midnight. In between, they tended to each other's mating bites, cuddled, and Rio made certain that Agatha drank the bottle of water carried up from the kitchen, then stumbled down to drain another herself while Agatha used the bathroom. Around midnight, exhausted in spite of a few mini-naps each, they drifted off comfortably in each other's arms. By 4 a.m. however they woke again, stomachs rumbling with hunger.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll go get us something," Rio said, kissing Agatha.<br/>
"Anything special my beautiful mate desires?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Whatever my gorgeous mate will provide," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shambling out of bed, Rio stretched and grabbed a pair of her pajama pants that was tangled amid the sheets and pillows. Tugging them on, she smiled and reached down to squeeze Agatha's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Be right back to you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Take your time. Be careful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio did as she was told. The last thing she wanted was to trip on the stairs and sprain her ankle again or something.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">In the kitchen, she dug through the fridge, finding that among the prepared food left was a little container of chili mac. That was something she knew Agatha might enjoy, and so she pulled it out and carried it to the microwave to heat up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'Good food for mate,'</em> her alpha thought, <em>'to make happy and feed for strong pups.'</em></p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">For the first time in ages, the rational side of Rio's brain did not argue. Maybe it was not some people's ideal, but it was quick fuel for a hungry body. In Agatha's case, a body that was probably well on the way to being pregnant.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The thought of Agatha pregnant, glowing with health and carrying their child, sent a warm thrill through Rio, and she smiled. It would be amazing to go through that again with a mate, fully aware and in the moment this time. Of course, she was already making plans for how she could absolutely wait on Agatha hand and foot, how she could provide anything her mate might ever need or want.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When the food was warmed up, Rio portioned it out into two bowls, then thought to grab a couple of bottles of juice from the fridge and arrange everything on the little tin tray that usually waited on top of the fridge for sick days.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Got room service!" Rio declared as she re-entered the guest room.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was still sort of sprawled out on the bed, but she smiled and pushed up on her elbows.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Smells wonderful," she said, and it was clear she was trying to maneuver to sit up but was a little uncomfortable.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, easy," Rio said, setting the tray on the dresser and switching on the lamp by the bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The room lit up with a soft pink glow, and Rio looked at Agatha, brow arched.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"More additions to the shopping list?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thought the new bulbs would lend a certain ambiance."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Chuckling, Rio pulled back the sheets and sat on the edge of the bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Spread your legs for me a minute, sweetheart. I wanna see if I hurt you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm fine. Just a little sore.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Sighing, Agatha spread her legs. Leaning in and accounting for the unusual color of the light, Rio could see that Agatha's cunt looked a bit swollen and reddened, the result of multiple vigorous rounds of sex complete with knotting.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Poor sweetheart, I've really done a number on you. Gimme a sec and I've got something that might help."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Standing again, Rio went out and padded along the hall to her own room, ducking into her bathroom and finding the ointment that she had asked William to get neatly waiting in the medicine cabinet. She carried the tube, as well as a warm, damp washcloth, back to the guest room and crawled on the bed, sitting down crisscross between Agatha's legs.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What are you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Gonna clean you a little first," Rio said, holding up the washcloth, "then apply this stuff."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What is it?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just a soothing balm. It's made for times like this."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Gently, oh so gently, Rio went in with the cloth and wiped away the streams of cum that had escaped Agatha's cunt. She saw the omega wince as she worked, and she mentally kicked herself for causing her mate any pain during a moment of care.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Now this," she said, laying the cloth aside and holding up the tube.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Will it hurt..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Won't hurt a bit, my love. Should make you feel a lot better."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha covered herself with a hand as Rio popped the tube open.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I meant is it safe? Will it hurt the baby?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, there isn't properly a baby yet. If you're wondering if it might interfere with conception, no. Like I said, this is made to help mates on the receiving end of a rut. It's formulated not to cause any unwanted effects or interfere with any desired results. Plus, it's for primarily external application. None'll get in you except a little maybe by accident if you move around. Now, can I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Removing her hand, Agatha relaxed back against the pillows, shivering at the first application of the cool substance.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just a second," Rio whispered, "and you'll feel all better. Oh, my poor girl."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once she was satisfied that everything was good, she snapped the tube closed and stood, carrying it into the guest bath and stopping to wash her hands.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Now," she said as she returned, "who wants some... I dunno, either very late dinner or very early breakfast?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha had managed to sit up a bit more, pulling a sheet up over her hips. She eagerly reached out for her bowl and fork as Rio handed them over, then dug right in. Rio took her own food and sat at the foot of the bed to eat.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm so glad there's a food break," Agatha said between bites.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, there'll be a few. This is an uncommon rut for me, so it may not be as intense as the usual one that the shots don't cover. We'll get plenty of rest and food breaks."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What happens if you go into rut while I'm pregnant, though?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio laughed, assuming that was a joke at first, but then she saw the serious look on Agatha's face.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I won't. I mean, I'm a high cycle, so without meds I'd have a rut probably three times a year, but I won't rut while my mate is pregnant."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. How come?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, because that's what happens. Did they not teach you that in sex ed?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My mother had me kept out of sex ed classes."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So... So, like, you... Didn't learn much of anything?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha shook her head.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What does high cycle mean? You said you're..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, most alphas have one rut a year, sometimes two. Occasionally, though, you get alphas who have three or four a year. That's high cycle. It's like how most omegas have a heat every three to four months, but some actually go into heat more often, sometimes even every month."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. Is your high cycle related to... To your suppressant resistance?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Maybe. Resistance does seem to be more common among high cycles."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They ate on in silence a while, and then Rio cleared her throat.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Out of curiosity, without suppressants, how often did you tend to go into heat?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha tilted her head back as if pondering, then nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, about every two months. Mother got me on suppressants about a year after I presented, though, and I've been on since, so I'm not sure if it would have changed or anything."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Oh. Oh shit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... When you're... Uh, I've noticed that when you get aroused..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">How to approach this?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"When I get aroused what?" Agatha asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I've noticed a scent you produce when aroused. Like a really good sweet cream smell. The first time, when I was scenting you in that office, I thought it was my oncoming rut tripping you into a heat..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, yeah. That sounds like my heat scent."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. Because, see, I've noticed it every time you're turned on. Every time we've fooled around or anything."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha laughed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What, are you saying I go into heat every time I'm turned on?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, maybe not exactly heat. But given the frequency of your heats before you were on suppressants, and the way you get when we fool around... You know, you might be a bit suppressant resistant yourself."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Think so?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Possibly. You might not be as resistant as me. You might just need stronger meds. We can try and get you a referral to my endocrinologist, if you want. She's pretty experienced with handling this kind of stuff."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, I'm willing to get checked out, but can it wait until..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If you catch, of course it can probably wait until after the baby arrives, unless something comes up. Still, something to plan for."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Considering how well you've fucked me in the last, oh, 16 hours," Agatha said, "I'm pretty sure me catching is less a question of if it happens than of when it happens."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, it's more likely since I'm in rut, but it's not guaranteed."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Darling, trust me when I say I'm pretty certain you've already knocked me up. You have pumped rivers of cum into me by now. Oceans. Something has to have hit something by now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled at the phrasing, but then could not resist leaning forward and stretching out a hand on her mate's abdomen.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I really hope it works. I really hope you're carrying our child very soon."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha's hand rested on hers.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So do I. I want that so much. Our baby."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You really sure? I mean, you're still so young..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll be 26 in two months. Not exactly a babe in arms. I'm fully ready to bear a child, especially because it'll be your child. I love you. I want that with you. That future."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well," Rio said, pulling her hand away and standing to go retrieve the bottles of juice from the tray, "shall we drink to a happy future then?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha grinned, setting her bowl aside and happily taking the proffered bottle.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll drink to that."</p>
</div>

<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio woke slowly to the realization she was alone in bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha? Agatha?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She felt groggy. Shooting had wrapped two days ago; of course they were not entirely done with the film, but the basic stuff was done and now she simply wanted to rest for a bit. At the moment, her ability to do so was impeded by the absence of the woman she loved. Her mate, soon to be her wife.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Sitting up, Rio shook her head. Maybe Agatha had gone to the bathroom. Maybe...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Sure enough, the door from the ensuite to the bedroom popped open, and Agatha emerged, looking very pretty in the oversized t-shirt she had slept in.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good morning," she said softly, and went around to Rio's side of the bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She smelled happy. Like a perfectly ripe peach.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good morning," Rio smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I have a surprise."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Smiling, Agatha leaned in and kissed Rio very sweetly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm pregnant," she murmured, their lips only a whisper apart.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You... You're sure?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I took a test a day each morning for the past three days. All of them were glowingly positive."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio blinked hard, then felt a small smile twitch to her lips.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're... Wait, are you sure?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"The latest test is still in the bathroom, if you'd care to look. And I have photos on my phone of all three."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... You... You're... You're gonna have our baby. You... You should get back in bed and lie down! You need to be resting, taking it easy..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm only about a month pregnant, my love."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sure, but still. Please, lie down a while and let me cuddle you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha happily shifted around and crawled to her side of the bed, burrowing under the covers. When Rio lay back down and wrapped her in the warmest embrace, she sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I take it my beautiful alpha is happy then?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, I'm ecstatic! I just... Shit. We did it. We really did it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I mean, we did try awfully hard."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you feel all right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Kinda nervous. I was a little afraid you'd be angry. About the baby."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How? How could I be angry that my beautiful mate is carrying our child?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just thought you would be," Agatha whispered, burying her face against Rio's shoulder.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I'm not. I'm happy. Pleased. Proud. You've given me the gift of your time, your attention, your affection. You've allowed me the honor of mating you and siring your child. My sweet love, this is a wonderful day. I love you so much."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you too," Agatha said, pulling back for a moment to smile at Rio and then kissing her fiercely.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They lay there, just cuddling and kissing. Rio pressed her hand against Agatha's belly and sighed, smiling.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They're in there," she murmured.<br/>"Our child."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I hope they look like you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I hope they look like you. Or a little like both of us. Be sort of nice if they had your hair. Your chin. That cute nose."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha snorted out a laugh.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I want them to have your beautiful brown eyes and your smile. And I want them to have <u>you</u><u>r</u> nose."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I guess," Rio said, "we'll just have to wait and see. In the meantime... Fuck, I am gonna take such good care of you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Does care include a little light fucking?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio smirked, shrugging.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Maybe a little. I certainly could go for a little pre-breakfast workout."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha smelled so good, that happy peachy scent over her natural scent making her seem to radiate joyful vitality. Taking Rio's hand, she slid it down her belly and into her panties.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're fucking soaked," Rio murmured.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"From want. From need. Please, Alpha, won't you help me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">With a short growl, Rio pushed Agatha over onto her back and kissed her, then sat up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Clothes off. Now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha hurried out of her clothing and Rio immediately scrambled on top of her, nuzzling down against her mating mark, lapping at it happily a few times. She felt Agatha squirm under her, felt the omega's breath shift to desperate little groans and panting, and yet there was no hint of the sweet cream smell. There had not been, in fact, for weeks now.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">So it <u>was</u> a mating smell, muted out now by the pregnancy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Moving down, Rio sucked Agatha's left nipple into her mouth, smiling around it when Agatha whimpered and arched upward. All these good sounds, the sweet scent, all the wonderful things about Agatha, were driving Rio wild. Her cock was already at full mast, hard and pulsing, aching to be sheathed in her mate's tight, slick cunt.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck," she grunted, kneeling up between Agatha's legs and whipping off her shirt.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Her boxers she wiggled down her thighs and, as she stretched out on top of Agatha once more, kicked off down her legs.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My perfect, soft omega," Rio growled, "all bred full and still needy for my cock."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, Alpha! Please."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio shoved in rough, spearing all the way to the base immediately. Agatha gasped and clung to her as she started thrusting, driving in hard, drawing back almost enough to exit, then hammering back in.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So hot for me, Agatha. So tight. Love stretching that pretty, tight little cunt around my cock. So wet."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm all yours, Alpha," Agatha moaned.<br/>"All yours to fuck however you like."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good girl. My good girl. My mate, made just for me. Fuck, so nice."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio rutted her cock hard and fast for a while, then turned to slow, leisurely strokes while she sprinkled kisses over Agatha's face and neck.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My woman. My mate. Agatha, I love you. <em>Mi cor</em><em>az</em><em>ón</em>, <em>mi luz</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Everything about Agatha's cunt was so perfect: the rippling walls, the wet heat so intense it felt like plunging into some molten dream of need. Rio wanted to live in that tight, wet, welcoming place forever, wanted to never lose her place in that little heaven.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The burn in her gut was flaring higher and higher, and she felt her hips close to losing rhythm at the same moment she felt Agatha shiver and felt the walls of that perfect cunt clench around her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck! Agatha, FUCK!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's cum spilled forth as if it could somehow quench the heat, as if it was not of the same fleshly warmth. It seemed to go on forever, almost as bad as a mid-rut ejaculation, but at last it stopped and Rio slumped, rolling Agatha with her so they were on their sides.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Alpha," Agatha moaned, "so rough. Fuck, I love that. Love when you take me hard like that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You take me so good, sweetheart. You're so soft for me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As Rio came down from the high of the fuck, she felt a twinge of worry and ran a hand over Agatha's belly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hope we didn't shake up the pup too much," she said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled, her hand going to cover Rio's.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sure they're fine. If we didn't hurt them before we knew about them, we probably did no harm now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Smiling, Rio kissed Agatha a little sloppily.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Want breakfast?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mmm. Definitely."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Anything special? I think today you really ought to get to pick, since you've given me such wonderful news."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"An omelette? That really good one you make with everything."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I can do that. Just gimme a minute to finish catching my breath and I'll make you the best omelette you've ever had."</p>

<p dir="ltr">"You know this could fuck up reshoots, right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Reed, calm down," Rio sighed."All along watching the rushes you were pleased, everyone else was pleased. Any reshoots will be minimal and we can shoot around Agatha possibly showing. Hell, if we need any reshoots for the last few minutes, it might look better with her actually showing than with the fake belly production cheaped out on."</p>

<p dir="ltr">"It's just you've always been the one so effusive about Agatha's talent, about what a big star she could be, but then you turn right around and make her your biddable little mate. Knowing you it'll be a pup a year for her..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Excuse... Knowing me‽ What the fuck does that mean, Reed‽"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I'm sure you'll go off the emergency shots now and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm not a damn monster! Agatha and I are already discussing family planning for the future. We're gonna take every necessary precaution to space our family out so that she can be safe and happy and comfortable while continuing her career. Suppressant resistance doesn't mean I can't fucking control myself!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're getting awfully loud right now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Because of what you're implying! Fuck, Reed, is there more to this? What, you and Sue want her for yourselves or something and now that she's mine..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, what my wife and I do in our private life is our business..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And what I do in my life is my business. I was very careful to not even risk anything with Agatha until filming was nearly complete, and we'll continue to be careful in future. Now if you'll excuse me, Reed, I've had a long day already editing and shit. Now I have to get home and pamper my mate."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio stormed out of the office, taking the stairs down to the ground floor rather than the elevator. She needed to work off some upset energy. Even with that, all during the drive home she felt on edge and a little angry. She tried to calm down as she pulled up to the house; she wanted only calm energy at home. That was always how she wished it to be, and especially now she felt the need to keep things light and safe in the house.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Everything needed to be nice and calm for her mate. No stress, no fear.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As she headed in, Rio heard laughter from the kitchen and smelled unmistakeably the fragrance of delicious food cooking. Smiling, she made her way there and found Agatha and William busily preparing dinner.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I walk into a party?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Immediately Agatha set aside her work and wiped her hands on a dish towel, then rushed to hug Rio.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Welcome home, my love."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, <em>mi cor</em><em>azón</em>. You feeling all right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Totally. Everything cleared up by lunch."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. Anything I can do to help with dinner?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Go and sit in your den, like a good boy, and relax."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio chuckled and kissed Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You ordering me around, Omega?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I am, Alpha. Now go."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes, ma'am. Right away."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As she turned and left the kitchen, Rio called back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't let her boss you too much, William!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, we've worked out a system, boss!" the delta said laughingly.<br/>
"I do what she says and I don't get <u>THE LOOK</u>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio knew exactly what William meant. Agatha had this expression, a certain little widening of the eyes and downturned pout of the mouth that made her look like you had just utterly destroyed her soul. The sight of it turned at least Rio and William to mush, and Rio was certain it worked on others. Of course, Rio knew she was just as capable of deploying her own sad brown eyes to get her way.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">If the baby came out looking perfectly like a combination of the parents, the hearts of the world might well be doomed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">In the den, there was a book lying on the coffee table, a collection of love poems. Rio knew William's reading tastes, and she was coming to know Agatha's. Her mate had clearly been in here reading today. That pleased Rio, because it meant Agatha was becoming totally comfortable in the house that was rapidly becoming her home. <u>Their</u> home.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There were a few messages to get to, and so Rio lounged on the sofa and flicked through them. Discussion of a couple of possible upcoming projects, a question from an old associate about a possible lunch meeting next week, and a message from her publicist to call immediately. Immediately being three hours ago, but...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Rio, thank goodness you <u>finally</u> got in touch!"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good to hear from you too, Darcy. What's up?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Oh, just a few outlets fighting for exclusives about your new romance."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit, really?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Yup. You and Agatha are a hot commodity, it seems. I've touched base with <u>her</u> publicist, and we're winnowing down the selection."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What do they want, exactly, in terms of an exclusive?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Oh, just an interview and a few pseudo-candid snapshots. Could be really good stuff. Think of it as pre-press for Young Allies."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio had known stuff like this would come up. Agatha was being recognized as a big deal, and so of course her relationship would draw attention.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, if Agatha's amenable..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Like I said, I talked to her publicist and it seems like she's fine with whatever we decide."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, then, we oughta get it done soon. Can you keep a secret?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Oh, hon, I am strictly off the record until I need to be on the record."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha... Well, we're... She's pregnant."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Silence on the other end of the call, and then an excited shriek that nearly blew out Rio's eardrum.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Rio, congratulations! Oh, you're gonna be such an amazing parent! I'm so happy for you guys!"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thanks, Dar. She's only a little over a month, so we can probably hide any outward signs for a while, but..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"We'll handle that when we handle that. Oh, my goodness, congratulations! I better be an honorary aunt!"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You will be, Dar, definitely. You take it easy, okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"You too, <u>Dad</u>! Buh-bye!"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio huffed out a laugh as she ended the call. She was going to be a dad, in a way. Her woman was going to give birth to their child. The wonder of that fact had not yet worn off, and she hoped it never would.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As if on cue, there was a light knock at the den doors, and then Agatha leaned in.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Dinner's nearly ready."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Great. Hey, could you c'mere a second?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha crossed the room and immediately plopped down in Rio's lap.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mmm, my cuddly sweetheart," Rio sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Love you," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Love you too. I just wanted to ask, are you <u>sure</u> you feel better?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Darling, it was a little morning sickness. Perfectly normal."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, well, I just don't like to think of you sick or hurt or anything."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"The baby'll be fine."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's not just about the baby. I worry about you. I love you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you love me <u>and</u> the baby?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course. I love my whole little family with all my heart. But see, you have to stay healthy for the baby to stay healthy. So I want to be sure you're okay. Both of you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, we're both fine. Now, do you want to come and have your dinner?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course. Kiss first?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha kissed her quite thoroughly, so that by the end Rio felt a bit drunk.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're so pretty," she managed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So are you. Now come along. Dinner time."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes, ma'am."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Dinner was excellent: steak and string beans and new potatoes and a green salad. Rio and Agatha and William ate together amid much laughter and good conversation, but somehow Rio still felt a nervous pit in her stomach. When the meal was over, she insisted that William head out to his apartment and Agatha head up to bed and rest while she did the dishes. Really, she just wanted to think a bit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The press were clamoring for them. For news of their relationship. That was to be expected, probably. Rio's main concern was that this put as little stress on Agatha as possible. She wanted her love safe and happy and relaxed. No pressure for now; just comfort.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She had nearly finished up the dishes when Agatha came padding back into the kitchen, clearly having dozed at some point.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio? Are you coming to bed soon? I can't sleep without you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll be up in a few, sweetheart. You feel okay?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just missing you. I think it's the hormones."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, you only miss me 'cause of hormones?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I miss you any time we're apart. I think the pregnancy is making it sort of more, though."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, don't you worry. We're gonna spend plenty of time together for the rest of our lives."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha ended up sitting and waiting at the kitchen island while Rio finished up, and then they went up to bed together.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So, was it love at first sight? Or at least lust?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio sighed and relaxed slightly more into the sofa.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, I definitely fell for Rio the moment we met," Agatha said.<br/>
"I mean, she has such an aura of strength, and she's so beautiful, how could I not? As a director she created such a comfortable atmosphere. I'm sort of a nervous type, but she made me feel safe."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I'd say," Rio said, "that I definitely felt drawn to Agatha... Well, I was initially interested in her purely as a talent, of course, though of course there was a feeling of being attracted to her physical beauty as well. Once we got to know each other, I came to see her inner beauty as well; her warmth, her resilience. She's just an amazing person."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How quickly did you two get together?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, we moved pretty quick," Rio smirked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha laughed and leaned into Rio's side, kissing her cheek then looking back to the interviewer.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We did start to get very close right off the bat once filming started. I was just so drawn to my beautiful alpha. What can I say?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Now it was the journalist's turn to laugh, and he nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And you, Rio? You're pretty notorious for avoiding relationships..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Not anymore."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course. But after being someone whose public persona is as a loner, how does it feel to be with someone?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Pretty great, though I would point out, I've never been a loner. I've always had a lot of friends. I was just not one for romance for a long time. Now, though, I'm really happy I found someone as wonderful as Agatha."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And can I just ask, given how quickly your relationship seems to have progressed, any truth to the pregnancy rumors?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No comment," Agatha and Rio chorused.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They were keeping their baby a secret for as long as they could. At the same time, they knew their evasion would only stir the rumors further.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There were plenty of other questions asked, and then it was time to parade through the house while a few photos were taken. They goofed off in the kitchen, by the pool, and on the stairs, and then finally they were alone in the house.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fucking hate these dumb press things," Rio grumped, flopping on the sofa.<br/>
"Don't we have a right to privacy?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Suppose we could have turned them down," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, but... Well, maybe putting some stuff out there will keep the hounds from the door for a while. Especially these next few months, huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As Agatha settled beside her, Rio reached over and patted the omegas abdomen softly. There was still really no sign of the pregnancy, but still, Rio found it harder and harder to keep her hands away. Her mate was carrying their pup. That was amazing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They're gonna be right back on our case once the bean makes his presence more known," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"'His' presence, huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shrugging, Agatha rubbed her belly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just a feeling."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Leaning close, Rio smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Whoever they are..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p>"You'll love them. I know. But trust me, I just... I think we'll have a son."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, you're their mom. Maybe you can sense those things."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If it <u>is</u> a boy, would you... I mean, if he..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha trailed off, and Rio noted her posture shift and stiffen.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If he what, <em>cariño</em>? Something wrong?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Would you be upset if he's an omega or something?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio huffed out a laugh and scooted still closer to Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why would that bother me? Our kid will be our kid. I already love them. I always will. No matter what happens in life, I adore you, and I'm gonna adore our kids. Things like designation don't matter to me in that way."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You say that, but..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Cariño</em>, I promise you, our babies will always be safe and loved. I intend on being the best sire possible for them, and the best mate possible for you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio lay down, head on Agatha's lap, and turned her face toward the omega's abdomen.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, you. Kiddo. This is your <em>papi</em> talking to you. You comfy in there? Hope so. Listen, I want you to know that I love you and your mommy very much. I'm gonna take really good care of both of you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She punctuated her statements with a kiss to Agatha's belly, then smiled up at her mate.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Feel better, <em>mi amor</em>?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha nodded, stroking Rio's hair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know I probably shouldn't worry..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart, I get why you'd be afraid. You've told me how awful your sire is. But Agatha, I'm not like her. I'd never be like that."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Sitting back up, Rio took Agatha's hand, squeezed it, and kissed it.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do you believe me, Agatha?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I do. I just... Maybe I need some therapy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Could be a good idea. I know therapy's helped me. But you should only do it if you really want."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'll think about it. Right now, you know what I could use?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What? Anything you want, I'll get for you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can we get some lunch?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Of course! You wanna go out, or order delivery, or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Delivery. Pick something you want."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Aw, but you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, Alpha, you choose. I just want you to be happy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I want you to be happy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It'll make me happy if you choose.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay. How you feel about..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, you choose."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shrugging, Rio pulled out her phone.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just was gonna ask your opinion on cuisines. Don't suppose our bean has any opinions?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He wants you to choose too," Agatha smirked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wow. My mate and pup ganging up on me, making me make decisions..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She grumbled, but she was grinning as she did. Flicking through options, she knew what Agatha would like most. There was a little Sokovian place that had catered the wrap party, and Agatha had absolutely loved the food. Rio ordered a nice selection of things she knew suited Agatha's palate. It was all stuff she liked too, so everyone would be happy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"There. Order placed. Whatcha wanna do until it gets here?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was by now lounging comfortably at one end of the U, and she smiled at Rio's question.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We could fool around."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hmm," Rio nodded, "now there's a fantastic idea."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Pulling up onto the sofa, Rio crawled around and stretched out atop her mate, trailing a hand down to slide into the waistband of Agatha's leggings.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, somebody's already wet."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What can I say?" Agatha whispered.<br/>
"I just can't resist you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So, we're very well matched then."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, ideally matched, I would say."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mmm."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio slipped two fingers along over Agatha's clit, teasing, barely touching.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, Rio, touch me?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm touching you. Oh, sweets, you are soaked."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio's fingers went further back, sinking easily into Agatha's core. In the same moment, she let the heel of her hand apply firm pressure to the previously teased clit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Alpha," Agatha breathed, hips canting up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You wanna get fucked, huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh-huh."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Gonna be my good girl?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I'll be good. Please, let me be good for you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're always so needy and good for me, aren't you? My sweet omega."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, fuck me? Please, I'll be good."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Pumping her fingers slowly, Rio growled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My beautiful mate. My wife."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you," Agatha said, voice small and soft.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I love you, sweetheart. Shit, I love you so much."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There was a sensation like Agatha's cunt was sucking her fingers, trying to draw them as far as possible in, and Rio grunted as the thought, wondering if there was time to switch them out for her cock. Making a decision, she pulled the hand away, surprised at the little whine that broke from Agatha's throat.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fuck me!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Gonna, sweetheart, if you get those leggings off."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Stepping off the sofa, Rio dropped her jeans, watching at the same time as Agatha rushed to skin off her leggings. During the short wait, Rio stroked her cock firmly twice. The sight of so much glistening wetness between Agatha's legs made her feel like she could go off instantly, so she closed her eyes for a moment and took a deep breath.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Her eyes snapped open again when she felt Agatha's soft hand grip her cock.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Get down here," the omega said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes, ma'am."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Returning to the sofa, Rio took another deep breath, then got back into position and slid in smoothly. Agatha's cunt swallowed her cock in a way that struck Rio as joyful. It was like being hugged into perfection. Each out stroke was work, so tight was the clasp.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You needed this, didn't you <em>cariño</em>?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I always need you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It was an easy, gentle fuck, all wetness and need and hot give and take. It felt a little like floating in some way to Rio. A little like being high or something. Everything seemed so rare and open and dreamy, in out in out, throbbing union.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio found herself moaning as she rutted leisurely in and out of her mate. Agatha clung to her, whimpering, nuzzling at the alphas mating mark and babbling.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So big, oh, you're so big, such a good mate fucking me so deep, stretching me out, feels so good..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Thrusting a bit more roughly, Rio ground hard down on each in stroke, wanting to put plenty of pressure on Agatha's clit. She could feel her mate's cunt clenching and fluttering more desperately and, after a few moments, a massive squirt of slick flowed around her cock. The sensation almost made her eyes roll back, and Rio picked up speed with her thrusts.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Gonna... Flood your cunt," Rio growled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha moaned, head thrown back, and her cunt squeezed tight, so tight, almost painfully tight, and the last boundary between Rio and climax dissolving.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She came hard, hips slamming down, vision graying out and then flooded with sparks as she spilled and spilled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">In that same moment, her phone buzzed from the coffee table.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sh-shit," she panted.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio allowed herself a moment of near-collapse on top of Agatha, trying to ground her mind a bit more. When the phone buzzed again, she pulled out slowly and sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Probably about lunch."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh," Agatha nodded, eyes hazy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Reaching for the phone, Rio peered at the screen, sighed again, and scrambled to grab her jeans.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, good thing we worked up even more of an appetite. Food's about two minutes away."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Excellent," Agatha managed, looking more ready for a nap than a meal.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shaking her head, Rio struggled to fasten the fly of her jeans. Her mind felt slow and sluggish.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Luckily, she accomplished her task right as the doorbell rang.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm beat," Agatha sighed, slumping into bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Immediately, Rio was at her side, holding her hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can I get you anything to help? Tea?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That would be nice, but you don't have to."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I want to, <em>cariño</em>. You just stay right here and rest, and I'll get you... What, that green tea with ginger you've liked lately?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, that sounds so good," Agatha murmured, and she was already drifting off to sleep.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio leaned down and kissed her cheek, drawing in a deep breath just after to check her scent. Nothing seemed off, other than a whiff of stress from a long day in the studio doing ADR. Still, Rio worried.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr"><em>'I'll worry every day until the pup arrives,'</em> she thought as she stood and left the bedroom, <em>'and then I'll </em><em>still probably worry after.'</em></p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Her phone buzzed in her pocket halfway down the stairs, but she ignored it until she got to the bottom. No tripping and falling and fucking up her leg again. Grabbing it, she saw it was her publicist.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, Dar, what's..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Rio, this isn't a business call. This is personal."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">William was in the kitchen, making himself a cup of cocoa. Rio gestured to him, pantomiming for him to refill the kettle after.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"Have the cops been in touch with you at all?"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Cops? No. What..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"They haven't called or mailed you anything or..."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No. Darcy, what's going on?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio heard Darcy take a deep breath.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"</em>
<em>Did you know they let David Haller out?"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The name jolted Rio, and she felt like the room had just spun around her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They what?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"He's been released. Well, they... Sort of released."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's "sort of released" mean?" Rio growled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">William was refilling the kettle, and he looked at her in concern, nose wrinkling as she stress-scented wildly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"He ended up as part of a program to ease the rehabilitated from his facility back into society."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They... He... Okay, so, what, he's living in a halfway house or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"They got him a job and an apartment, apparently, but..."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, I do not like that word at that place in the sentence, Dar."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"You remember Ptonomy Wallace?"</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, yeah. Yeah, I remember him. He was... He was part of the community. He... He made it out. He was the one who... Who confirmed Violet's birthdate. What about him?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>"He's dead. Murdered. He... They don't know who did it, but Haller's dropped out of sight."</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio dropped her phone. William lunged and grabbed it, but rather than take it back, Rio turned and rushed from the kitchen, tearing back up the stairs. She burst into the bedroom, pulling Agatha out of her light doze.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, what..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Get up, sweetheart. Please, get up."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What's going on?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio had gone to the closet, pulling out one of her old gym bags and one of Agatha's suitcases.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We gotta go, sweetheart. We gotta get out of here, we gotta..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, what's happening? What's wrong?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, please, we gotta go, we gotta go, we..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shaking, Rio sat down on the floor, scrambling to back herself into the corner. Agatha left the bed and came to her, scenting calm and guiding Rio to lie down, head in her lap.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shhh, Rio. Okay. What's happening, my love? What's got my poor alpha scared? Hmm?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Please, we have to go away! We have to get out of here!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why? Rio, why do we need to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">William charged in, dropping to his knees beside Agatha and Rio.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Boss, calm down. Boss..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Groaning, Rio sat up and wrapped her arms around Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry, sweetheart. Sorry, sorry, I... Oh, fuck, don't go away. Please don't go away."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm not going anywhere, my love. I'm right here."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Have to protect you and the baby. Have to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You have. You protect us all the time, Rio. Shhh. It's okay. William, what happened?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Let's get her to bed and I'll tell you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio allowed her friend and her omega haul her to her feet and lead her to the bed. As she lay down, she grabbed at Agatha and pulled her down, wrapping around her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Have to protect you," Rio muttered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She buried her face against Agatha's neck, breathing deep of her mate's scent. She wanted to memorize it, to lock it forever in her mind in case...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Fuck, it was going to happen again. That sick fuck was going to take away her mate and baby again. He was going to hurt them and take them away.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hush now," Agatha whispered, stroking Rio's hair.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha smelled so good. So calming and soft. But Rio could not afford to be calm right now. She could not rest. She had to be on guard, on alert, to protect her family. She had to.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When she opened her eyes again, the sun was just peeking in through the window. With a panicked groan, Rio sat up. Agatha was not in the bed with her. Agatha was gone. The baby was gone. Had this all been a dream? Had it...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha appeared in the doorway, looking a bit pale, and sighed as she came and crawled back into the bed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart?" Rio rasped.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I hate morning sickness."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Shit, are you... We need to get out of here, need to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, calm down. C'mere."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha opened her arms, and Rio burrowed into her embrace.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's okay, my love. The police were by after you fell asleep last night, they explained. We'll be all right. They have leads on where the suspect is, and they're keeping an eye on the house."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I hurt you," Rio said.<br/>
"I... You're in danger because of me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No I'm not, Rio. I'm safe with you. We're safe."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But he..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They'll stop him. He might not even be coming here anyway."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What if he does? What if he..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Darling, I have total faith that this will all be fine. We'll all be safe, all right? You, me, the baby, William. We'll all be safe here. Nothing is going to happen. This isn't a repeat of the past."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And if it is?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha smiled and kissed Rio carefully.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It won't be, my love. Just relax, all right? Just relax. Reed called, he's working on rescheduling things so neither of us is needed for the rest of the week. We can just have a little break."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But if Haller comes here..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We'll be safe. Now, breathe and relax. We'll get some extra sleep, all right? We'll just rest together and dream of better days."</p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio's past catches up to her, but she manages to purge the demon.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio had slept only intermittently over the course of the week after her initial collapse, so worried was she about her little family. They had moved William in from his apartment to the downstairs guest room at first, but then three days in he went, at Rio's insistence, to stay with his boyfriend.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"The less you seem connected to me right now," she had said, "the better."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">William had protested at first, but Rio had basically begged him to go, so at last he went. Then it was just Rio and Agatha actually in the house. After four days, Agatha had been the one to make a suggestion to lull Rio to rest.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mon, my love, and let's sleep in the nest a while."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">So they had gone and lain down in what had formerly been the guest room. Rio had crawled onto the bed and had spooned up against Agatha, holding her tightly but gently. Agatha had, in turn, taken Rio's hand and pressed it to her softly curved lower belly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Now you see?" she whispered."Nothing to worry over. We're here and safe. Just us and our baby."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just don't want to lose you," Rio muttered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You won't. I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere. I'm with you, and I'm carrying our child, and we'll be all right."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry if..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, none of this is your fault. Honestly."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I was so stupid, such an idiot, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You were young and confused and fell into the wrong situation. You did get out, and you tried to make things right."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But I failed. I failed and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You didn't fail, Rio. Now rest, all right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And so, amid such comfort, surrounded by the scent of her mate, Rio began to sleep more regularly again. After that first week, she dove back into involvement on post-production work for the film—Reed was even good enough to hire a small personal security team for her—and managed to be a little more calm and happy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Two more former members of the cult turned up dead in Oregon a month later. The cops said there was at least an upside to that, as at least it meant Haller had possibly left California. That did nothing to assuage Rio's fear, and she once again became a nervous wreck. Even Agatha now seemed far more openly worried, and Rio started considering how to send her somewhere safe. Of course, the suggestion she leave, even for her own safety and that of the unborn child, made Agatha even more determined to stay.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, you wouldn't abandon us if something happened, and I won't abandon you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, it's to keep you safe. You're under such stress here..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And I'll be stressed wherever I am if you're not with me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio dropped the matter. Then, another week later, another former member and their entire family were slaughtered in Indio.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If this is Haller," Rio asked the detective handling the case, "how's he getting around like this? Aren't there notices out? Flags on possible travel documents or whatever?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Detective O'Connor shook her head.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I don't have any solid answers for you, I'm afraid. We thought we had this shit locked down, but Haller's a slippery guy. That's how he slipped out of the guarded release program, and now... Well, we're doing what we can to..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"This asshole has killed multiple people, Detective, including several now who were never connected to the cult! I have a mate and pup to protect, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I understand you're concern. I have a mate of my own at home, expecting two pups any day now. Rest assured, we've stepped up surveillance around your home, and we'll be supplementing the security team your producer provided. We will catch Haller somehow."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That night in bed, Rio tossed and turned, head aching. She knew she was massively scenting fear and anger, and she was glad they were sleeping in the regular bedroom tonight. She did not want to sully the nest with such negative scents.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Around two in the morning, she realized that Agatha was awake, and was scenting heavily of distress. Turning to her mate, she spooned up against her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweetheart, you..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, I'm... I'm so scared..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know, <em>cariño</em>. I'm right here, I'm gonna..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha's breathing was shallow and rapid, and she turned over with a panicked look on her face.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I can't... Breathe."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio grabbed her phone to call for an ambulance, and it seemed to arrive in an instant. Some of the police detail drove along after them to the hospital, and once Agatha had been taken in and was being treated, the cops hung back outside, throwing their weight around and stopping nearly anyone who even walked past them, entering the hospital or not.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio, meanwhile, sat panicking in a waiting area, a private-ish one that some hospital PR liaison directed her to. The doctors had already said Agatha was probably just having a panic attack, but Rio still worried. If something went wrong and Agatha lost the baby...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Standing, she left the waiting area and paced the hall nearby a while, then saw a sign pointing the way to the chapel. She made her way there and ducked inside.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The place was mostly empty. Just an older woman dozing in the left middle pew and a dusty-scented guy knelt in prayer in front of the left front pew. Rio shuffled herself into the right rear pew and sat.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She had not prayed in a long time. Some of the accoutrements of the faith she had loosely been raised in lay at home, but those were tucked away, mementos of a past better forgotten. Hell, even in childhood her faith had been shaky, half due to being bounced around between homes so much with little time to think of anything but survival. The cult had stomped out the last shreds of faith she held, though not for reasons Haller might have wished.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It felt awkward, kneeling there and trying to pray. The words of childhood devotions bubbled in her mind, but those she tossed aside in favor of simply pleading with the universe for the safety, for the lives, of her wife and child.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">
<em>'Agatha did nothing to deserve this fear. This pain. Please, let her be all right. Let the baby be all right. I don't care what happens to me. Take me if you have to, just let them be safe.'</em>
</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As she knelt there, eyes squeezed shut, desperately clutching at the back of the pew before her, she was dimly aware of the sounds of the chapel and the more muffled sounds of the hospital outside the doors. There were the squeaks of shoes on linoleum. The rattle of I.V. stands. Across the way, the dozing old woman snored, and the man praying in front of her wept softly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The chapel door flapped softly open, then closed. Rio smelled someone sweaty and anxious enter, heard them settle into the same pew she had chosen. They knelt as well, shaking the kneeler, and started muttering low.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They reeked of old onions and pine wood and a waft of juniper berries. Rio startled at the scent, eyes opening to slits as she tried to catch a peripheral glimpse of the interloper.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shit.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Carefully, slowly, Rio rose to her feet and tried to shift around the pew in front of her to slip out and leave the chapel to call security. Haller smiled at her, standing as well, and approached her, backing her toward the wall.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Long time, no see," he murmured.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You sick fucker," Rio spat.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, now, we used to be friends, didn't we? Hell, I gave you a new name and everything when we would hang out. But I guess you didn't like it, since you're back to using your old one. Back to trusting the world. And now you're in here, praying to some worthless dead delta who never knew how to protect Himself. Just like none of your knew how to protect yourselves, so I had to protect you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio let out a low growl, and Haller actually did hesitate for a moment, falling back a step. That gave her time to vault the middle pew and tear into the aisle, fleeing the chapel. She could hear him behind her, shoes clomping loosely on the floor. She got not more than six steps out the doors before he caught her around the midsection and took her down.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Twisting, Rio kneed at Haller's chest, tried to squirm away, and saw a nurse running toward them.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Get security!" Rio roared.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Haller crawled up her body, managing to pin her by the shoulders to the floor.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You always were a runner, Lenore."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's not my fuckin' name!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But it was, once. When you saw the light. When you followed me."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Get the <u>FUCK</u> off me, fucker!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Now, now, Lenore, is that any way to treat your savior?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">He released her left shoulder for a moment, hand going into his coat. The move bought Rio enough leverage to slither out from under him and stagger to her feet, but he lashed out a hand. Pain lanced the back of her knee and she fell again.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Haller was on top of her once more, smirking.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Did anyone ever tell you why your first bitch whelped early? Because, you see, since you left her..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... I left to get help! To get help to get her away from you!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes, but you did leave. And when you left, well, someone had to take over as her alpha. She didn't really like it, of course, but at least it got your worthless pup out of her and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Haller's head snapped up, and Rio heard the sounds of rapid footfalls. Taking advantage, she kneed Haller in the groin with her uninjured leg. When he shrieked and went boneless, she rolled him off of her. He flailed a blade in her general direction, and she growled, then fell on him and let her teeth do their worst to the soft flesh just under his jaw.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When Rio woke, she felt mindless and swimmy for a moment. She was in a bed, a hospital bed, one leg immobilized and screaming agony, her head and back throbbing. Her mouth felt cottony, and there was a taste of copper.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, the hero awakes," a voice purred, and Rio looked right to see Detective O'Connor nearby.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... Haller..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He won't be a problem anymore. You certainly did a number on his throat."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio blinked hard twice, then jolted a little as she tried to sit up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My wife! My wife is..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She's fine," the detective nodded.<br/>"It was anxiety. Panic attack. They've got her resting. And you, my friend, are gonna be resting for a while too. Haller slashed the hell out of your knee."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Falling back against the pillow, Rio coughed. Everything still hurt, but she felt better. Lighter.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You kept yourself safe," Detective O'Connor said, "and you kept your family safe. You did good."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio closed her eyes and nodded. In the end, for her, that was all that mattered.</p>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I mean, I'm the director, she's the lead. Why shouldn't we sit together at the junkets and shit?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Reed stared at Rio, clearly trying to formulate an argument. After almost two full minutes, he sighed and buried his head in his hands.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Fine, fine. Whatever. Hell, it'll probably be amazing for press or whatever."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio smirked and sauntered—as best she could on crutches—out of the office. Sure, she liked to consider herself an enlightened alpha, not into trying to excessively control her partner, but this was not a matter of control. This was about being at Agatha's side to protect and tend to her. After what they had been through in the recent past, Rio had no intention to not spend as much time as possible looking after her wife.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Besides, Agatha was nearly six months along now. There was a level of instinctive alpha drive that made Rio want to stick close the further the pregnancy got, and by the time they started press for the film, things would be further along still. She wanted to be there to help and fetch and carry and generally be a good mate. Things would, she had decided, be as close to perfect as they could be for Agatha and the baby.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They had an appointment this afternoon for a sonogram. Rio was nervous as hell; she had left it to Agatha to decide if they would try to ascertain the baby's sex. She knew no matter what she would love the pup, but lately there had been nightmares about it being a girl and looking too much like Violet and ending up dead like her too. Sure, they were just troubling dreams, but they shook Rio up, especially after the shit with Haller.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Sometimes he was in the dreams. Sometimes Rio tore his throat out with her teeth again, but he just got back up and laughed in her face, then went on his way to harm her new family.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was never alone now; Rio saw to that. William, after the madness, had officially moved in with his boyfriend, but many days he was back over at the house, hanging out with Agatha if Rio had to be away for something. Meanwhile there was a new driver, generously paid for by Reed, to ferry Rio around places while her leg continued to heal. As she eased into the car today, Rio sighed. At least this injury was, for once, not entirely her own fault.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">At home, Rio stumped into the house through the garage. William was in the kitchen, cleaning up some dishes. Rio bumped him gently as she passed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, kid. How's shit with... That guy? Teddy?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Eddie. We're good. How was your meeting?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It was the usual meeting with Reed. He whined and balked, then I got what I wanted. Where's Agatha?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Relaxing in the den."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Great. Thanks for being here, man."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No problem. You know I'll always be around for you guys. Gonna make lunch in a while and drive you guys to the appointment too."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Smiling, Rio awkwardly hugged William, then stumped off toward the den.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The door was slightly ajar, so Rio easily slipped in, not so quietly as she might have without crutches, and made her way over to the back of the sofa.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha was stretched out on her side, one hand holding the book she was reading, the other hand rubbing softly over her belly. She turned her head and smiled up at Rio.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hi," she murmured.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey there," Rio nodded, "how're you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. How are you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Great, now that I'm home."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Laying the book aside, Agatha patted the sofa near her head.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You should sit a while. Rest before this afternoon."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Nodding, Rio moved around and managed to ease herself down and raise her leg to rest out at her side. Dropping the crutches, she leaned down and kissed Agatha softly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"How's our kiddo?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I think they're fine," Agatha said.<br/>"Pretty active this morning. Maybe they're excited that we get to see them."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Mmm. I'm excited to see them. Are you?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Excited. A little nervous."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Why nervous, <em>mi cor</em><em>azón</em>?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Just... Well, if the baby's not a boy..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, you know I'll love the baby no matter what. I... If they're a girl, if they're a boy, whatever, I'll love them."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"But you want a son so much."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just want a healthy, happy child. I want you safe and well and I want them safe and well. Anything I've said about having a son... Look, I'm working on my shit. I promise. No matter what, this is our child. We're both gonna adore them. Love them. Protect them."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio kissed Agatha again, then smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Te amo, Ágata, y amo a nuestro pequeño</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you so much, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. Now, no more worries. Let's just be happy. This afternoon, we see our pup. Our little baby. That's going to be wonderful."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They shared a few more gentle kisses, and Agatha shifted and sat up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I think you might almost... Here, feel."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She took Rio's hand and pressed it firmly to her abdomen. After a moment, Rio felt the softest hint of a fluttering motion.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey," Rio whispered, "hey, you're in there, kiddo. Really in there."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Tears welled in her eyes, and she stretched a bit closer to kiss a spot beside her hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can't wait to see you, little one, and to meet you one day. Your mom and I, we're so looking forward to you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They had lunch together with William there in the den, and Rio noted how William was so careful of Agatha. Concerned that she ate enough and had what was needed. The whole pack, she knew, were like that. Lilia had been by last week and had acted like an absolute mother hen, fussing over Agatha and reprimanding Rio over a perceived lack of speed at rushing about for anything Agatha wanted or needed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">At least, Rio thought, this was assurance that even if anything should happen to her, Agatha and their child would not be alone or uncared for.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She had been thinking of that a lot, lately. Of the possibility that somehow she might not be there for her family. She blamed it on the plot of the film, or more really on the actual story the film was based on. Having met the real Veronica during development, and her son Alfred as well, Rio had learned a lot about the hard early years they went through. Of course, they had a support network too, if a more nebulous one. It's why Carol had insisted on ending the screenplay as she did, with the assurance that Veronica would not end up a suffering omega alone in an era when an omega having a child on their own was a dangerous thing.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Of course, times were different now. Laws were in place, conditions improved.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Still, Rio remembered the thing Agatha had mentioned early on; the pups before her gassed to death as infants for possibly being omegas. That actions of that nature had been totally legal in her own lifetime horrified her. It was also very much in living memory for omegas to not even be allowed to have names once they were mated. Rio thought of that and worried so much that, even with the changes time had wrought, she would do or say something to be a cruel alpha. She feared she would, without meaning to, hurt Agatha or their baby. Even with all her effort, all her control, she feared she could let overprotective alpha drive get the best of her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">At the doctor's office, Agatha seemed all nervous excitement. Rio was just nervous. Was the baby okay? Was everything going well? What if there was something wrong and it was her fault somehow? What if she was not taking care of her mate and pup properly? What if she was failing them and the pup was not even born yet?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Calm down, my love," Agatha whispered, squeezing Rio's hand gently.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're scenting absolute <b>dread</b>. Not a great thing in an obstetrician's office."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh. Uh, sorry. Sorry, I was... I'm so sorry, <em>cariño</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's all right, Rio. It's fine."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once they were finally back in the exam room, Rio tried hard to keep her worry tamped down. She just wanted her wife and child to be safe. They needed to be protected at all costs. No matter what it might take, she was going to look after her family and not mess things up and...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hnn?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Are you all right? Do you want to go wait in the car with William or..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No! No, I need to... I need to be here. Need to be with you. I'm just... I love you so much. I love the baby so much. I want everything to be perfect, and..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Calm, Rio. Be calm. C'mere."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha hugged her close, letting Rio burrow her face in against Agatha's neck. The omega was pumping out a soft, calm scent, and the alpha gulped the fragrance down in huge breaths. By the time she straightened up and stepped back again, she felt more than a little scent-drunk.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It was a good sensation.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The sonographer came in, and everything got underway, and Rio stared at the screen, mind a bit wobbly as things were pointed out. The little face, limbs, body... Everything, according to the sonographer, looked very good. Rio felt a goofy grin cross her face as she looked on, squeezing Agatha's hand softly throughout.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That was their pup. Their baby. They had made that together, and it was alive and moving and growing and...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So do we wanna know the sex?" the sonographer asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The question shook Rio a little out of her scent-drunkenness. Would Agatha be worried if it was a girl? Would Agatha be afraid of her and think she was angry if it was a girl? What if...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Looks like you're having a little boy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio blinked, staring at the screen harder for a moment, then looked down to Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It..." Rio choked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's our son," Agatha nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Immediately, Rio wanted to burst into tears, half over joy that this assuaged her worries, half in rage at herself over worrying so much. Instead, she leaned down and kissed Agatha's forehead.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Te amo</em>," she whispered.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">All the way home, Rio's feelings whipsawed between that scent-drunk joy and worry over the safety of her family. In between, it peaked around beating herself up internally over her issues and being elated that they were having a healthy child.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The moment they were alone in the den again, Rio pulled Agatha close and hugged her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm sorry if I've been shit to you, <em>cariño</em>. If I've been a bad partner, a bad alpha..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, you've done no such thing. It's all fine. Just breathe, okay? We made it this far, made it through all the bullshit. We're fine, our son is healthy..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'd love the baby no matter what, honest I would, you know I would, I'm just so sorry if you still feel scared that I wouldn't if..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sit, Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Immediately, Rio sat on the sofa, eyes downcast like a scolded pup. Agatha sat beside her, holding her hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know that what you went through when you were younger was awful, Rio. All of it, from childhood onward. I know the stuff with Haller, the old stuff, screwed you up, and that him being around more recently only made that worse."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">With a little whimper, Rio leaned in and wrapped her arms around Agatha.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I also know," Agatha went on, "that you love me, and you love our child. Yes, I still worry sometimes. Everyone worries about things. But Rio, you've been wonderful to me all this time. Even before we were properly together, you did everything with consideration for my safety and happiness. You're a good person, a good partner, and an amazing alpha. You've done everything to show you'll always be there for our family."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you," Rio sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know, my love. I love you so much too. Now, can we try and be happy? Can we just spend a quiet evening staring at the pictures of our baby and celebrating that everything looks all right?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Nodding, Rio smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He's pretty cool, huh? Our little guy, I mean. Like, he... He's our kid."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah," Agatha said, "he's amazing."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They sat there, close and loving, breathing each other in and relaxing in the moment.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So," Rio said at last, breaking the still, "name ideas?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha laughed softly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I was thinking Rio, Jr."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uck. No. Something more classical, surely. Theophilus or something."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Caesar?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, not, like, that sort of classical."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, like Theophilus isn't even more..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Right, okay. Let's table the discussion. You want food?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Pretty much always, at this point," Agatha said.<br/>"Little Rio Theophilus Caesar is a big eater."</p>

</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Could you hand me the water bottle there, my love?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio leaned over and grabbed the bottle, passing it to Agatha without a thought. They were hours into this junket and frankly Rio had long since entered auto-response zone, even between interviewers.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I really don't like the marketing imagery for this," she muttered, gesturing vaguely to the backdrop behind them.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Say something," Agatha suggested.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And risk Yelena challenging me to an old-fashioned alpha duel? I think not. You feel sturdy?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uhm, I don't know if that's the word I'd use, but I feel fine."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sorry, love, I didn't mean anything by it, I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know. I'm just nervous. I'm getting as big as a house..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"No you're not! Remember, the doctor says you're actually kind of small for six and a half months."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Small mercies."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Small baby. Just our li'l guy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio smiled at her wife, but saw Agatha suddenly look tense. Actually, according to the doctor, Agatha was still showing a bit less than might be expected because of the way her body carried the pregnancy. That the baby was on the low-mid end of size was only part of it. But being reminded that the baby <u>was</u> small—not dangerously so, just little—worried Agatha. She was still hung up on the idea that Rio would be upset if the baby was an omega, and omega male infants were often small.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"<em>Mi amor</em>," Rio whispered, reaching over to gently squeeze Agatha's hand, "he's fine. Our pup is fine. He's healthy and when he arrives we'll love him so much he won't know how to handle it. I mean, he won't know how to handle much of <u>anything</u>, being so new..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know. I just... I want him to be safe. And happy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We'll see that he is so, yeah? We will."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Not long after, it was back to the junket routine. Another interviewer bustled in while the crew hanging around checked Rio and Agatha's make-up and generally set everything before dodging back out of sight once more.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Every interviewer asked about the film, of course, but the bulk of them seemed to be far more interested in asking about Agatha and Rio's relationship and especially about the pregnancy.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So, was there any conflict on set due to your relationship?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Any behind the scenes drama over your relationship?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Agatha, you got pregnant during filming. Was that a problem?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio, do you worry people will see your relationship as unbalanced, not so much due to designation dynamics, but because you were directing Agatha when you claimed her as your mate?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">A few of them even dared to ask if Rio was going to <u>allow</u> Agatha to continue her career now.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Uh, well, that's not really up to me," Rio invariably said, "because it's Agatha's career. I just want her to do whatever will make her happy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">None of them, Rio noted, turned and redirected to Agatha, asking if she <u>wanted</u> to keep working. None of them seemed to care.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I am so taking out some sort of ad in the trades," Rio grumbled on the way home.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What about?" Agatha asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"About how I'm so proud of my beautiful wife. About how I hope that our work together shows her to her fullest advantage, and how I know she's destined to be one of the greatest stars of all time."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sweet," Agatha smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yes, well, so many of those damn interviewers were... Well, why the fuck would they think I'm in charge of whether you keep working or not?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Because you're my alpha. Because that's how things were for years upon years upon years."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, well, things were stupid all those years. Dumb as shit. Fuck, I'm... I'm so sorry you had to sit through that, <em>cari</em><em>ño</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's fine, my love. It is what it is. All we can do is hope for a better world for him."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">At the last word, Agatha took Rio's hand and pressed it to where their child lay. He was active right now, kicking and shifting so that Rio could not fail to feel his antics. That brought a smile to her face.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey," she said, leaning down a little, "little guy, we're gonna kick this world's ass for you, okay? Make it so you and your generation maybe have less of this to deal with."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Do not talk about kicking ass in front of our son!" Agatha exclaimed, feigning shock.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"What, like he hasn't heard worse? I mean, he has a mommy who sometimes gets <u>very</u> dirty with her language when I..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ah! Don't tell him about that either."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Right, right. Listen, son, Mommy has all the answers. You should listen to her. Your ol' sire is a bad, bad influence. Why, if you pay too much attention to me, you might grow up to direct films, and then where would you be?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If he plays his cards right," Agatha said, "he'll end up with a very nice home, a loving spouse, and a bank account that's nothing to sneeze at."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay, okay," Rio nodded, "so you can be a little like me, son. A bit."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I actually hope he's a lot like you," Agatha said."Kind and goofy and sweet. And I hope... I hope he's strong."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He'll be strong, love. From the way he's practicing his Jiu-Jitsu moves in there, he'll be the strongest guy who ever lived."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">At the house, Rio kissed Agatha just inside the front door and smiled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I love you, ya know?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I know," Agatha nodded, "and I love you too."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Tired?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah. Ugh, and we have to do all of that <u>again</u> day after tomorrow."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We'll make it through. How about tomorrow is just a rest day? Just relax as much as we can, you and me and <em>nuestro pequeño</em>, sound good?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sounds really good."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Good. Wanna relax in the den a while before we head up to bed or something?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'd like that, yeah."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">In the den they settled in a familiar attitude: Rio tucked back in a corner of the U, legs spread, Agatha seated between her legs and relaxing against her chest.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I got everything now, I guess," Rio said.<br/>
"Got my gorgeous wife, a baby on the way, a film that might actually be a hit..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha snorted out a laugh.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"As if most of your films haven't been hits."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, I've had good luck, sure. But this one... This one, love, I want so much to be a hit. Not for the earnings or whatever. The accolades. I want people to see the movie. To know the story. I want them to remember, so maybe it... Maybe things are never like that anymore."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're such a softy, you know? At least when it comes to all of this."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, I mean, times are still bad enough for so many. Even in our own lifetimes, things have been bad for people of certain designations. This story we're telling, it goes back to a time when things were even worse in even more ways. Maybe some places they still are so bad. I want to change that. Maybe even one person sees this movie and decides not to be an asshole about dumb shit that doesn't matter. If that happens, we've done our job, my beloved."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Head slumping forward, Rio kisses Agatha's shoulder and let a hand roam over her belly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I really do want a better world, <em>cariño</em>. For our boy and every other little one. For the future to be happier."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're gonna make me cry, and I mean that sincerely. Damn hormones."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Maybe a little cry is good now and then, so long as I'm here to hold you during so you can feel safe."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just... I'm so happy you're who I ended up with. That you're so gentle and thoughtful and... And that you love me unconditionally. That you'll love our child unconditionally."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio smiled and nuzzled at Agatha's neck.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I do love both of you, completely and unconditionally. I always will. All I want for myself is happiness with my family. This family I was never sure I would have."</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Listen, you have to let me back there! You have to, please! That's my wife in there, my mate, and she... She's having our pup and I have to be there, I have to because I promised! I promised!"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I understand your concern, but right now we're doing all we can to stabilize the situation, all right? To bring your mate and your pup safely through. It's going to be fine if you just go to the waiting area and sit. We'll let you know as soon as there's news."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio wanted to growl, to let out her inner alpha and push past the doctor. She wanted to storm into the surgical suite where Agatha was, wanted to hold her mate and beg her not to leave.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Instead, she turned on her heel and went, as directed, to the waiting room. The rest of her "pack" were there: William and his boyfriend, Lilia, Alice. They had all raced down to the hospital as soon as Rio called them. Reed was there too, but out in the hall, making calls and demanding updates almost as vociferously as Rio had been. Probably he just wanted to know if they would need to add a memorial slate to the credits of the film. It was not so last minute, after all. They still had four months until the premiere.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Slumping into a chair, Rio groaned and immediately felt Lilia's hand on her back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It's all going to be fine," the older alpha murmured, and Rio winced.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Lilia had lost her mate in childbirth decades ago, and nearly lost the pup as well. This moment must be terrifying to her as well. Yet for Rio...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">If things went the worst possible way, if neither Agatha nor the baby made it, Rio would give up. She might go lock herself in the house and just stop functioning, she might just go walk into the ocean. In whatever way, she would give up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Today had been fine, at first. Everything seemed quiet. Normal. Agatha had been a bit grumbly when she woke up, but by now that was not unusual. The baby had recently had a little growth spurt and was taking up more space, wriggling around and generally being a little mischief maker. Rio had simply kissed and cuddled her omega until things seemed a little brighter, and then they made their way downstairs for breakfast.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">After the meal they had been lounging in the den when Agatha got grumbly again.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"My back is... Fuck, it hurts."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"C'mere," Rio had said, and had settled the omega right in front of her, gently trying to massage the tense muscles.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Then Agatha had groaned, pulling away and wrapping her arms around her belly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"This... Rio, we... We might need to see a doctor."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">When she shifted away and stood, that was when they saw the blood. Rio had raced for the phone, an ambulance had been called...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And now they were here. They had been here for a while, and while Rio had been allowed to ride along up front in the ambulance, she had not been allowed to stay with Agatha all the way.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha, who had been so frightened and in pain in the ambulance.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha, who had been screaming and crying for her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha, who might be dying right now, and the baby along with her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Lilia's hand on Rio's back was firm, comforting.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She'll be fine, Rio. Agatha's a strong girl. And the pup will be well."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Lilia, it's two months early! What if... Fuck. I can't lose them. Either of them! I... I tried! I tried not to fail them, I tried not to mess up..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And you haven't. You've been a wonderful, caring alpha to Agatha. You've done all you can to protect her."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Then why wasn't it enough‽"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio turned aside to cry against Lilia's shoulder, letting the older alpha rock her gently like a child.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just... I love her! And the pup, I love him too already, so much, and... And if they go away..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They will not, Rio. They will be fine."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The words were said so firmly, with such deep assurance, that Rio almost could believe them. Almost.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It seemed like days, years, <u>forever</u>, that Rio sat there sobbing, wailing, letting out all the years of horror and fear that had kept her from even daring to risk a relationship and that were now resurging because if <u>this</u> mate died, if <u>this</u> pup died, would that not be proof? Would that not prove that she was some horrible, awful monster unworthy of having a family?</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">At some point, Rio almost fell asleep, propped between Lilia and Alice. She almost allowed herself to doze off, to drift into dreams...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">But then there was the <em>schlap</em> of footsteps, the clatter of something against the wall.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Vidal?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio shot to her feet, raced to the doctor who stood in the doorway. She felt and heard the others, even Reed who had been out the other side of the room, rush with her.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, doc, is... Please, is Agatha..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Your wife is all right, for now. She lost a good deal of blood, but we got things under control. She's resting now, but you can go see her in a moment."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, thank... And the baby? Did he... Is..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He's very small, but he's alive, and with care there's every chance he could be just fine. We've got him in the NICU, just making sure he's settled in and everything. If you like, you can be taken to see him as well, even just a little before you see your wife."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... It..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio looked around to her friends, and Lilia nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You should go see whichever of them you can, as soon as you can, my little Rio."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Bursting into a fresh spate of tears, Rio collapsed into the arms of her pack. When they got her calmed down, the doctor was gone, and it was Reed who hauled Rio to her feet.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, my friend... Well. You got a son. How about that?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I... They... They're okay."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"They are. They fuckin' are."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Perhaps 15 minutes later, a nurse arrived and collected Rio to lead her to the NICU. As they approached the area, it struck Rio that she and Agatha still had not settled on a name for the baby. They still had not decided they knew him enough yet.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Well, now that he was here, they would choose a good name. Whatever fit him.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Gowned and gloved, Rio was led into the room where the baby was shielded in an incubator. The moment she saw him, her heart broke a little, because he seemed so tiny and defenseless.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"H-hey," she whispered.<br/>"Hey, <em>mijo</em>. Hi there."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She slipped a hand through one of the ports in the side of the incubator and gently ran a finger down the baby's arm. When it reached his hand, his own impossibly small fingers clutched at it desperately. Rio thought of a struggling swimmer grabbing at a branch to try and stay above the surface of a river.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That's right, buddy," Rio said.<br/>"I'm here. I'm gonna help you stay afloat as much as I can. Your mom, she'll help too. We love you so much, baby boy. We just... We adore you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The baby's chest rose and fell a little fitfully, and his feet kicked out like he was startled by something, and all the time, his hand stayed clamped on to Rio's finger.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're a beautiful baby," the alpha went on, "and I can't wait for your mom to see you."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio was not sure how long she stayed there, just looking in on their son, watching him exist, before the nurse gently patted her shoulder.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We can take you to see your wife now."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Carefully, oh so gently, Rio eased her finger out of the baby's grasp and turned.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Is she..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"She's awake, but I'm told she's pretty groggy. Not surprising, considering what she went through."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">And then Rio was letting herself be led again, and eventually she was at the door of a room, and she warily pushed it open and stepped through.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Rio?" Agatha rasped.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">She was in the bed, pale and looking very delicate. Rio crossed the distance, smiling, and leaned down.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Hey, <em>cariño</em>. You scared me pretty good there."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"The baby, what about..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He's okay. He's in the NICU, 'cause he showed up so early, but he's okay. I saw him. He's wonderful. Absolutely beautiful, and he's gonna be so strong, just like his mommy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Is he... Can they tell if..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Oh. This was still a worry.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I didn't ask, <em>mi cor</em><em>azón</em>, because all that matters is that he's well, and you're well."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha's eyelids fluttered, and Rio could see that she was trying to blink back tears.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"If he goes..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He won't, Agatha. Neither will you. You're both going to be just fine now. I'm gonna do everything to make sure you both get all the care you need."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio stayed until Agatha was sleeping, and then found that arrangements had been made so that she could stay and be there at the hospital as long as she wished. A folding cot was set up against the far wall of Agatha's room, and William rushed to the house and brought Agatha's go bag, as well as clothes for Rio. It was a long, nervous night, but everyone made it through.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Early the next morning, the doctor said Agatha seemed fine to go and see the baby, and so Rio was allowed to wheel her to the NICU. They went in together, and Rio smiled to see that the baby still seemed fine. Tiny, yes, and a little weak, but still breathing, still moving.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha wept as she reached into the port and touched their son's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He's the most beautiful baby," she said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, he better be," Rio nodded, "as he's probably gonna look just like his mommy, and she's the most beautiful woman."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That actually made Agatha laugh through her tears, a sort of astonished sound.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Don't listen to your sire," she whispered to the baby.<br/>"Your mom is just ordinary looking. You'd do well to look more like your sire."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They stayed with him, talked to him, observed him until the nurses said Agatha really should go back to her room and rest again.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"All right, Nicky," Agatha said, "Mommy'll be back soon. I promise."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As she wheeled Agatha back to her room, Rio leaned down.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Nicky, huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha shrugged.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He looks... I don't know how, but he looks like a Nicholas.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">That was a name they had talked about, just briefly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Means 'Victory,' right?" Rio asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Victory of the people," Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Seems appropriate. We're people. He's our little victory."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"He is."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Back in Agatha's room, the nurse who was always along helped her back into bed and saw that everything was correct, then left them alone. Rio smiled and stroked a stray strand of hair back from Agatha's forehead.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You feel okay, <em>cariño</em>?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Okay as I can, I suppose, considering."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"You're gonna be fine. Just fine. We'll get you and our boy home soon, and everything'll be smooth sailing."</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Can you hand me the... Great, okay, thanks."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Rio held her breath as a blast of hairspray came at her, then sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Almost done here," the stylist said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Great. Awesome. Epic."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Glancing sideways, Rio saw Agatha absolutely basking in the attention of the other stylists. The sight made her smile, even if all the other people so close to and touching her omega sort of put her on edge.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As soon as the stylist released her, Rio crossed the room and leaned against the wall so that she was just in Agatha's sightline.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, you look gorgeous!" Agatha said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, thank you. A few times a year, I try."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Would you go check that Nicky..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"On it."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Leaving the room, Rio went just next door, to the nursery, and knocked before entering.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"And how is young master Nicholas doing?" she asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The baby appeared to be doing quite well, having a bottle and being generally fussed over by Lilia and Alice, with William standing by.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Pay close attention," Rio nodded to the young delta, "because pretty soon..."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I'm only two months along," William whined.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah, well, that's soon enough."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I just hope they can be friends," William said, a hand rubbing over his still flat belly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Ah, they will be. They'll basically be cousins."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once Nicky had finished his bottle and been burped, Lilia was the one who set to work dressing him in the tiny little custom suit that had been made just for tonight.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Really don't know if he should be attending premieres at only four months old," Lilia said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Closer to two months, if you account for when he was due," Rio pointed out, "but it's gonna be fine, Lil. Our Nicky is ahead of the curve, and he's so strong and healthy. Aren't you, son?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Nicky made a small cooing sound that Rio chose to interpret as an affirmative.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Well, still and all," Lilia groused, then went on with dressing the baby.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Look, Agatha's not ready to leave him yet, and neither am I. We're only just taking him for the first little bit. We'll walk the carpet, put in an appearance at the top of the screening, and then come straight home. The doctors all cleared it, and we're taking precautions. Plus, after this, we're not letting the press anywhere near him for a long while, so they better get their shots while they can. They'll leave us alone a little, this way."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">In his suit, Nicky looked about as dashing as it was possible for an infant to look, and Rio grinned as she carefully picked him up.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Now, there's a handsome boy," she said.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha swanned into the room about five minutes later, looking amazing in a soft purple gown, hair in loose waves around her shoulders. Rio felt a sense of awe that this was her wife, her partner, her mate, the mother of her son.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Wow," was all she could say.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Thank you, my love. Now, let me see my boy. Oh, Nicky, you look so handsome. You do."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They headed downstairs, and Lilia held Nicky again while Rio helped Agatha with the forest green wrap that was actually an artfully constructed wrap carrier. They would not need it until they left the car at the premiere, of course, but they had been practicing for days and decided it was best for Agatha to have it on before they even got in the car.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Out in the car, they settled Nicky into his car seat, where he promptly fell asleep.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Maybe he'll sleep all through everything," Agatha said, smiling.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Maybe," Rio said.<br/>
"Might be best. Wish I could sleep through all of this."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Frankly, so do I, but I guess it might be best to actually be at the premiere of my first film as lead, hmm?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"That seems like the thing to do, yeah."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">As they were driven toward the event, Rio grinned, looking over at her wife and then down at their child.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Things had been so terrifying at first, but Agatha had bounced back surprisingly fast from the difficulty of the birth, getting her strength back and being desperate to be fully up and about within days. Then there was the fact that Nicky had proven to be a tough little one. He had grown fast, had hit every milestone necessary so that, after just a month, they were able to bring him home. Since then, he had continued to make excellent progress. He was very close to looking like the two-month-old he would be if he had been born at his actual due date, and he was a generally calm, happy baby. Oh, he cried. He definitely made a fuss when he needed something. But for the most part, he was decidedly chill.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">There had already been a lot of discussion and planning about any possible future children. They were going to wait until Nicky was around four years old, just so that everything would be nice and settled. Agatha had gone in for the necessary tests and it had been found that, yes, she did have a form of suppressant resistance, though it was milder than Rio's. A lot of diligent effort had led to finding suppressants that could work for her, and they had even managed to find an updated formulation that somewhat worked for Rio as well, meaning she could cut back on the emergency shots.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Basically, they had things under control.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once the car rolled up to the premiere, Rio and Agatha carefully got Nicky out of his seat and slipped into the carrier so that he was securely settled against Agatha's chest. He sighed once, but otherwise slept on.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Getting out of the car was a bit of a scramble, but they made it safely and then, oh, the horrors of the carpet. The crowding here and there, Darcy yapping at their heels to keep them moving, the having occasionally to talk to interviewers...</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">It was hell, but Rio found herself distracted from it by the light pressure of Agatha's hand in her own and the sight of her wife and their child. Agatha was stressed as well—Rio could sense it—but she was remaining calm, her free hand always holding the ends of her wrap together so that they rested over Nicky's back.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">The baby, for his part, still slept, though he got a little wriggly and popped an eye open in annoyance a few times.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">They made it through the gauntlet of the carpet, waved to the people alongside Reed at the start of the screening, and then once the lights were down, they were quietly ushered out through a side exit and taken back to the car. Once Nicky was back in his car seat, he finally woke for a moment, fussed for just an instant, then spent the ride home seeming highly entertained as his parents talked to him and around him.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once they were finally back at the house, instantly there was the rush to get out of the good clothes, to scrub off the makeup and get the hair product combed and rinsed out, and then they collapsed on the sofa in the den in their most well-worn pajamas. Lilia had once more been there to take over with Nicky, but now she brought him to them again, all freshly dressed in a sleep sack, then left quietly.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Alone at last," Rio groaned, "just our little family."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Agatha sighed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"It was good to get out of the house but... Ugh, how long can we possibly wait before ever doing that again?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We'll put in a good effort to delay it as long as possible, <em>mi cor</em><em>azón</em>."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Excellent, because frankly, for now all I want is a lot of time alone with my beautiful, sweet, gorgeous alpha and our precious baby boy."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Sounds ideal."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Leaning over, Rio kissed the top of Nicky's head, then kissed Agatha's cheek.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"So, who wants to be lazy the rest of the night?" Agatha asked.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Me!" Rio squeaked in a small voice, reaching over and raising Nicky's hand.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Oh, well, whatever Nicky says goes, I guess."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Damn right," Rio nodded.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Shifting over a bit, Rio settled into one of the corners of the sofa, legs a little apart, and gestured Agatha over.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Come and sit, <em>cariño</em>, so I can hold you and the boy in my arms."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Once Agatha moved over and settled in, Rio wrapped an arm carefully around her waist, the other going above it to support Agatha's arms where Nicky was cradled.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We make a pretty good team," Rio said.<br/>
"I mean, we made a great film, <u>and</u> we made a great little guy, huh?"</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"I think we might just be the best team in Hollywood, you and me," Agatha agreed.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"Yeah. Yeah, we might be."</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">Resting her chin forward on Agatha's shoulder, Rio smiled down at Nicky.</p>
</div><div align="left">
<p dir="ltr">"We've done some great things together, and maybe we'll do many more, but for now, this is pretty great. Just this. Being together. Being a family."</p>
