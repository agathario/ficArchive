<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Professor Vidal has always hated Professor Harkness. Agatha's teaching style was wild, chaotic, a party for each class. Rio on the other hand felt a classroom was a sacred space to learn. Not to have dance parties or comedy shows in. The two were opposites, enemies in each other's eyes.</p><p>However, one night- Rio finds herself crying in the ice cream aisle after being stood up by her date. To make matters worse? Agatha Harkness finds her there.</p><p>Little did Rio know, the best years of her life stood in that aisle with her...</p><p>_______________________________</p><p>A small few chapter AU fic:)</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Okay so..what started out as a long, mega, one shot has exploded into something far more LMAO. I genuinely have fallen in love with this and I hope you do too. I'm thinking it'll be four chapters, that may change! I have it all written out just editing/working through lol</p><p>Also! This one is also pretty different to what I've done in the past. Added some texts, even a tiny playlist for the fic if you're interested. It's songs I listened to while writing/obsessing over this. Lol. I really, really, REALLY appreciate if you're here to read it. Poured my heart and soul into this one. Enjoy:)) xo</p></blockquote>

“Are you fucking kidding me?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed, tossing her phone down on the desk with a loud smack, not caring if the screen shattered or cracked. Frustration flooded through her veins, annoyance picking at every inch of her skin. </p><p> </p><p>“She can’t just up and change everything!” </p><p> </p><p>She exclaimed, her voice strained with desperation for this to all be a nightmare. One she could wake up and shake off as if it never happened. </p><p> </p><p>Jen shrugged, leaning against the edge of her desk with arms crossed. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s Harkness. Lilia lets her get away with murder”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>“At this rate, she’ll be giving lectures on how to do that” She grumbled. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha Harkness.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha. Motherfucking. Aggravating. Irritating. Harkness. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, thinking over the name that made her bones shiver, jaw clench till every muscle in her was so tense- they were all close to exploding louder than any sound in the universe. The reaction to anything Agatha related always remained the same. Violent, life threatening, way too much for Rio to handle.</p><p> </p><p>(And she always ignored when anger and resentment shifted into lust and wonder. Rio tried to <em> never </em>acknowledge any piece of that)</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had started teaching at the university a few years ago. Three achingly long years ago, to be exact. Not that Rio was counting. The newest professor was a quick hit. The talk of the campus barely into her first semester. After her first course, one class, just two hours and suddenly, every student wanted a piece of Professor Harkness. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Rhetoric: The Art of Persuasive Writing and Public Speaking” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Which should have been the only name, but after a month- Harkness and her students had given the title it’s own nickname, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “That’s It! Now We’re Talking!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio silently scoffed, outwardly cringed. The name sounded straight out of some 80’s game show and after briefly meeting Agatha Harkness? That only made more sense as to why the name was chosen. </p><p> </p><p>The professor wasn’t like the rest. She wasn’t Jennifer Kale who was a woman full of sophistication. Who appeared to be above all, put together, and completely self centered. That last part, Rio had to learn to put up with. But, she was better than the Kaplan kid who didn’t know his left and rights. How he earned his role as a TA, she’d never know. But, that was Alice Wu-Gulliver’s issue to put up with. </p><p> </p><p>To make matters worse? Lilia Caldreu (The president of the university, or how she liked to be called as “<em> The Order of All Things”) </em>was known to commonly take pity on the weak. Rio assumed that’s how a mess like Agatha Harkness was able to nudge her way in.​​ The only good thing the new addition had been good for was making Rio appreciate her time off more than ever. </p><p> </p><p>She’d always buried her head in work, never taking a breath or a second away from her classroom. (The others joked that the university was Rio’s home, second home, and vacation home all in one). </p><p> </p><p>But then, Agatha came along and suddenly, Rio felt a <em> deep </em> need. No- A strong desire to be a million miles away from the campus every chance given.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t that Agatha was a bad person or a villain of the sorts, but she was in Rio’s eyes…weIl, immature. She didn’t seemingly take on the role as an educator as seriously as Rio did (in her mind, that was). Not to mention, Agatha couldn’t complete a sentence without a joke or insult. It drove Rio mad sitting in board meetings having to hear that grating, irritating, raspy, sexy voice (Okay, Rio was NOT supposed to think that, but she’d be lying to herself if she denied it).</p><p> </p><p>For Rio, it had always been a dream since she was a little girl to become a botanist. The professor aspect came later on in life when her friend, Wanda Maximoff, mentioned how she’d rule a classroom with ease. Rio thought too how beautiful it’d be to inspire others, maybe lead them in the same career path she walked. Plus her love for plants, that was always a perk. </p><p> </p><p>To see someone as careless, reckless, spontaneous, unorganized as Agatha becoming the university’s favorite? Well, maybe Rio held a bit of jealousy. A slice of bitter resentment. </p><p> </p><p>And what didn’t help? Another reason the woman was everyone’s favorite? Something Rio found difficulty arguing or not understanding. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Did you see Professor Harkness today? She looks way too good in purple..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I swear, I need to get in that class” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Oh shut up, you don’t even care about that subject. You just wanna stare at her” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “She’s hot!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Can’t blame you there..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Have you asked about her hair routine? I’m so jealous! I need it” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>On and on, Rio would overhear students muttering amongst themselves. Not that she’d dare utter a word out loud, but..Rio agreed. How could she not? Agatha Harkness was a stunning human being from head to toe. She was tall, confident, strided with ease as if she ruled the universe. Her laugh was contagious, a smile that radiated through the halls. She had crystal blue eyes that Rio swore glimmered in the dull fluorescent lights. </p><p> </p><p>There’d be times during board meetings or in the break room, Rio found it difficult to not stare at the other professor. She’d try to hide her gaze, harden and disguise it as a glare. Agatha had only seemed to catch her once or twice (Rio never caught on to how it was much more than just a few times). Always a wiggle of her fingers, a wink followed along. Sometimes a dramatic mouthing of the words,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Call me?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Which Rio always sneered at. She’d pack up her stuff, storm out of wherever they were to catch her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hated her. </p><p>Rio couldn’t <em> stand </em>her. </p><p>Rio wished Agatha Harkness never appeared in her life. </p><p> </p><p>No matter how hard she tried though? There was a tiny candle size flame burning within her. It never dulled, blew out into a cloud of smoke. The flame of intrigue and lust stayed bright, threatening to destroy her completely. </p><p> </p><p>She decided and told herself the feeling only developed out of spite. Maybe Rio held so much disgust for Agatha it turned into something else to prevent her from losing control. </p><p> </p><p>After all, Rio hadn’t been on a date let alone a hook up in years. Her head was buried in work, too distracted to have time for such things. So it only made sense seeing a woman such as Agatha striding through the halls, smirking everytime she caught Rio’s gaze, always irritating flirtatious comments that brought out something more than hatred within her- </p><p> </p><p>All of it made her feel something more than anger. It made sense it was nothing more than just being single for however many years. Hence why Rio was going on a date off an app her friend, Wanda, helped her create. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Tinder.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>God, Rio felt pathetic for it. Luckily though the woman she was going to see was interesting and a treat for sore eyes. <em> Eye candy, </em>Wanda had wiggled her eyebrows while saying the name. Rio had rolled her eyes over that.</p><p> </p><p>The date would help even if it led to a one night stand. Rio would be too in her head filled with disgust for herself over a hookup. Those always ruined her mentally, but…it’d distract her from Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>But for now? Just as always, Agatha skidded and danced her way around the rules. Which drove Rio to the verge of screaming every single time. Especially now unlike any other time before. </p><p> </p><p>“How the fuck did she manage to up and move her classroom overnight?” Rio asked with a shake of her head. “Did she fucking <em> bribe </em>Lilia into this?! That old woman has always been against creating chaos mid semester” </p><p> </p><p>“She’s Agatha,” Jen shrugged.</p><p> </p><p><em> She’s Agatha. </em>Fuck. That was always the explanation for how she managed to get away with things. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t need to be three classrooms away from her,” Rio laughed, but it wasn’t humorous. No. It was complete disbelief filled with annoyance. “She’s loud enough and my classes need complete focus. Hearing her parties right down the hall won’t help”</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Jen agreed. “Go talk to Lilia about it. Maybe she’ll-”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio firmly said. “I’m not giving up my room. This has been my domain for years. Far longer than she’s even been here. Plus, all the natural lighting is perfect for the plants” </p><p> </p><p>She stood up from her chair, gesturing her hand in the air around to every plant scattered in her room. Jen watched as the woman began to pace, muttering incoherent Spanish under her tongue. A sign her blood was boiling with fury.</p><p> </p><p>“No..” Rio shook her finger in the air, tossing her head side to side. </p><p> </p><p>“Noooo, what?” Jen asked. </p><p> </p><p>“She isn’t going to win” </p><p> </p><p>Jen chuckled. </p><p> </p><p>“Win what, exactly?”</p><p> </p><p>“She doesn’t get to push me out, nope! Not a chance in hell, Jennifer!” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, using my full name. Awesome” She rolled her eyes. “You better not take this out on me. I didn’-”</p><p> </p><p>“She. Will. Not. Win!” </p><p> </p><p>The other woman muttered a low,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh my god”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jen pushed herself off the desk, hands held up in surrender as she started to make her way to the door. </p><p> </p><p>“I need to go get ready for my next class. Good luck with…whatever this is- No, you know what?” Jen turned. “Focus on that date tonight, Rio. That’s more important don’t you think?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped her pacing, sending a wide glare her way as she muttered, </p><p> </p><p>“I regret telling you about that..”</p><p> </p><p>Jen laughed and tossed a wave over her shoulder, leaving her to her lonesome. However, that didn’t last more than two seconds. As if Rio’s temper couldn’t get any worse? </p><p> </p><p>“Howdy there!” </p><p> </p><p>The greeting chirped down the hall, Jen’s little laugh followed with some low chatter. <em> No. </em> That voice, it’s owner, <em> fuck! </em> Agatha was far too close to her room for her liking, gossiping with Jen most likely about god knows who. Maybe her, not that Rio cared (She did). </p><p> </p><p>“Go away..” Rio muttered under her breath as if Agatha would be able to hear her from afar. </p><p> </p><p>Her feet stormed over to the door, ready to slam it shut with dramatic force. She wanted to make a statement how Agatha was not welcome to be near her room more than she would be. The idea of seeing her in the hallway even more than before, hearing her voice clear as day. Not to mention that beautiful laugh that always was laced with the cutest snort- </p><p> </p><p>
<em> STOP! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabbed the edge of the door, ready to push it shut when the figure slithered before her. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey there neighbor” </p><p> </p><p><em> Fuck. </em>She was too late. </p><p> </p><p>The older woman took in a deep breath, looking up to meet those sparkling blue eyes that shimmered with glee. It’s like she fed off being an annoyance, Rio swore it. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you want, Harkness?” Rio asked, voice monotone as if she was dead inside. </p><p> </p><p>“Just being courteous, giving my warm greetings to my new neighbors” </p><p> </p><p>She shrugged, holding out a tiny gift bag. It was a dark forest green, tied together with black ribbons and a purple bow on the side. Rio stared, trying to figure out what it was before she could open it. </p><p> </p><p>Did she even want to open it? No. She should shove it in Agatha’s face, add the reaction with a door slam and ignore her presence all together.  </p><p> </p><p>Instead, her curiosity betrayed her when Agatha shook the bag in the air with a higher pitch,</p><p> </p><p>“Made special for youuuu-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swiped it from her, not offering a warm grin or kind eyes. Her glare remained sharp. A frown stern stubborn to remain still. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that all?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged again, both arms crossed against her chest as she leaned against the doorframe. </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing in return?”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know we were exchanging gifts. Let alone up and changing <em> rooms” </em>She snarled. “You know that’s ridiculous, right? You’re up and changing everything. Your students now have to change their routine and-”</p><p> </p><p>“I needed a bigger room <em> for </em> my students,” Agatha explained. “Just as you need this,” She gestured into Rio’s spacious room. “For all your plants. Figured out of all of us, you’d understand”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, a tang of jealousy over how popular Agatha’s classes had become. Or…was it just jealousy that even more people had access to admire her all day? She voted the first (It was the second). </p><p> </p><p>“Great,” Rio said. “Again, is that it or would you like to continue being more annoying?”</p><p> </p><p>“What would you prefer, <em> Professor Vidal?”  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her professional name every now and then. And when she did? She always laced it with the same silky tone, rich in a deep rasp while her head dipped lower. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> I hate you.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I think you know the answer” Rio nearly whispered, feeling the oxygen being stripped from her lungs. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha dramatically sighed, leaning back as she took a step away. </p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Agatha said. “Enjoy your weekend and the <em> gift” </em></p><p> </p><p>The woman slowly let that smug grin grow on her lips, wiggling her fingers in the air as she took a few steps back. In a small voice, one that sounded like it belonged to a ghost- She sang,</p><p> </p><p>“Ta-ta” </p><p> </p><p>She then had the nerve to wink before spinning around, letting her heels click down the hall. Rio’s grip on the door tightened, knuckles turning a pale white as she tried to rip her eyes away from those hips. The ones that swayed rhythmically  back and forth. A movement that plunged Rio into a state of hypnosis.</p><p> </p><p>“Professor Harkness!” </p><p> </p><p>The voice made Rio jump, eyes snapping over to Billy Kaplan running down the hall to meet her. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t run. You’ll fall and smack your head again, kid” Agatha advised. </p><p> </p><p>He slowed down instantly just as anyone else would because as always, Agatha had a way with getting people to do whatever she said. Hell, Rio found herself falling under the same spell the others did at times. Whether it was handing her the copies out of the printer while she passed or even offering to hold the door open for her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was a witch and everyone knew it. Or, at least Rio knew.</p><p> </p><p>As the two down the hall started to talk amongst themselves- Even from afar, Rio felt herself pulled into Agatha’s orbit. She was always such a strong presence even when her attention wasn’t on you. People always surrounded her, eager to hear what she said to say and hopeful she’d look their way. </p><p> </p><p>And once again? Her fucking beauty didn’t help.</p><p> </p><p>Rio admired the white button up blouse with her sleeves rolled up. Purple slacks that captured her waist perfectly, but flowed loose at the same time. She stood tall with her heels that added a few extra inches. The wild hair that never seemed to know what a brush looked like drenched down to her mid back. Rio’s eyes trailed down, admiring each inch until-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked over as Billy searched through his bag. His lips were still moving at a fast pace, but Agatha didn’t seem to hear as she winked Rio’s way once again. Rio snapped out of her trance the second the wink registered in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head, slamming the door shut and pressed her back against it with a strong inhale. Her eyes closed, trying to steady herself from the rush that coursed through her. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> I hate her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I hate her. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I hate her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio chanted the mantra, reminding herself of the truth (lie) to bring herself back down to earth. All was well after a few moments until she started to walk and felt the gift bag hit against her thigh. The reminder of Agatha’s gift was a punch, an annoying one more like. </p><p> </p><p>She paused, averting her eyes to the bag staring back at her almost as Agatha did so. Taunting, threatening, ready to drown her in regret at any given moment. </p><p> </p><p>Part of her wanted to just toss it in the trash and forget it existed. She had papers to grade, things to do. Agatha’s <em> gift </em>was below rock bottom on her list. </p><p> </p><p>Well…it should be. </p><p> </p><p>Rio placed it on her desk, staring and taking double glances its way. </p><p> </p><p>“No..” She muttered to herself.</p><p> </p><p>The woman shook her head, storming away to rummage through her bag for a piece of gum. A way she had quit smoking a few months ago was by living off it. Especially in tense moments like so. Relief took over when the cinnamon flavor sprawled across her tongue, the rubber, chewy, texture softened between her teeth. </p><p> </p><p>However, when she turned back around to her desk- The small gift bag stripped any relief she had felt. Erasing its existence completely. Rio shook her head, muttering under her breath how ridiculous it was before storming back over. She didn’t waste another second. The sooner this bag was gone, sooner Agatha was out of her mind. </p><p> </p><p>Rio began to work quickly, pulling out the small amount of black tissue paper. What she wasn’t expecting was a needle point to nip her skin, bringing out a strong hiss followed by a muttered,</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck?!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s antics were now becoming violent. <em> Awesome. </em> Though, Rio briefly thought how that’d be a lovely way to get her fired. </p><p> </p><p>Though, to her surprise (and secret delight) the assailant was a simple tiny cactus, healthy as can be. </p><p> </p><p>“Well…hello there” Rio greeted with a soft smile as she did to any plant that was new to her. “Aren’t you a cute little thing?” </p><p> </p><p>She admired each inch of the small plant, smiling at its beauty. After a few seconds, her eyes drifted to the note attached against the plastic pot it was packed into. Her fingers unfolded it, eyes scanning the few words messy in Agatha’s scribbled writing,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “This plant is a prick. Suits you xo” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Pop.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The bubble of Rio’s adoration and grin was tossed away. A bubble exploded into pieces of what it once was. </p><p> </p><p>She scoffed, crumbling the note and tossing it in the garbage with a low,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Fucking Harkness” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The plant was cute, but really? Such a stupid insult. A joke that wasn't funny in the slightest. <em> Whatever. </em>Rio moved to take care of the plant, making it a home amongst the others. </p><p> </p><p>What Rio didn’t consider as she made the plant comfy in her room? Every single time her eyes caught a glimpse of the cactus, it’d spark Agatha in her mind more than she already dealt with. </p><p> </p><p>And maybe, just maybe, that was Agatha’s plan all along…</p><hr/><p>The freezers buzzed in Rio’s ear. Matched with the faint, crackling, radio above her. The speakers were clearly old and torn. Most definitely had seen better days. </p><p> </p><p>Suffering through them, A soft throwback station that played classics from the eighties. Cyndi Lauper, Michael Jackson, The Police, all the songs Rio knew like she knew her plants. Word for word, detail to detail. It was her favorite part of the grocery store as stupid as it sounded. </p><p> </p><p>But, it was different this time. She was fresh off a Tinder date that never happened. After sitting at a restaurant table on her own for over an hour as the staff gave her cringe worthy sympathetic looks- She just wanted to run and hide till the end of time. </p><p> </p><p>Typically, Rio would sing to each song under her breath. She loved doing so, drifting into her own little world even if she was in public. However, she couldn’t. Not after what just happened, where she was, and why she stood in the ice cream section of the store- Drenched in tears, heart aching as her mind dragged a big weight of despair. </p><p> </p><p>Nine PM. They were supposed to meet at nine for drinks and a late dinner. A Tinder date that Rio already thought was fucking stupid, but she’d be lying if she said there wasn’t some anticipation for it. The woman was nice, laidback. Their text conversations flowed with ease. Rio really thought meeting her, having a date, maybe it’d spark into something. A relationship of sorts that’d make her feel whole. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had been sitting in the corner booth, nursing a beer ever so slowly. Each time the door opened, her body perked up and she pulled out a warm smile. Though it was wasted when the glimpse of said person was not her Tinder date. Every ten minutes that passed turned into an hour, then another, and finally Rio had enough of embarrassing herself. </p><p> </p><p>She left cash on the table, far too much for a single beer and some pretzels. But, Rio didn’t care. The staff had been giving her way too many sympathetic stares and pathetic smiles to stay a second longer. She had texted the date letting her know she left, but by the time Rio pulled into the grocery store’s parking lot?</p><p> </p><p>The woman must’ve unmatched them right after Rio messaged. </p><p> </p><p>That’s when the sobs hit her, punching her in the chest with a strong kick to her stomach. Not because of heartbreak, no. She didn’t even know the woman. It was disappointment, embarrassment, wondering endlessly why she wasn’t enough. </p><p> </p><p>Everyone she knew had a significant other for the most part. It had been that way her entire life. She was nearing her forties and barely had three girlfriends. Wanda always tried to remind her it wasn’t a bad thing, but Rio hated it. </p><p> </p><p>When was it her turn to fall in love?</p><p>When would the universe send a woman her way to spend life with? </p><p> </p><p>Everyday, Rio felt she was running out of time. So much of her was preparing to grow old alone, digging her own grave in the most morbid way.</p><p>
<em> “Every step you take, I’ll be watching you…”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio cleared her throat, lowering her head when she heard the soft voice a few steps behind her. The woman strolling down the aisle had snapped her out of the blank staring trance she had stuck in. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh, can’t you see? You belong to me…” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>If Rio was in a better mood, she’d look over and offer to add on another lyric with the woman. Maybe they’d laugh together, the moment would be sweet before both went their separate ways. However, that thought didn’t help. That should be her with another woman. Someone to fall in love with, dance in the grocery store close to midnight, make laugh and cherish time with. </p><p> </p><p>That’s all Rio wanted. Was it too much to ask for?</p><p> </p><p>She brought her sleeve up to wipe the tears off her cheeks. A few sniffles were audible, louder than Rio preferred. But, it didn’t matter. Not like this woman would ever see her again. So what if she caught Rio crying in the middle of the grocery store?</p><p> </p><p>“This is my favorite one for the tears” </p><p> </p><p>Rio paused. Her heart stopped, jumping a beat before pounding harder like never before. She swallowed the giant knot in her throat, slowly turning her head over to see-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No. This can’t be real. This can not be possibly fucking real. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The universe hated her. Rio was certain because the universe wouldn’t give her a woman to fall in love with, no. But sure. It’d give her Agatha Harkness, the woman she couldn’t stand to be around. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head, a puff of air pushed from her lungs as she took a step away to gather distance between them. Agatha was nearly shoulder to shoulder with her, gesturing to the freezer door with the pints of ice cream inside. Rio didn’t even know which flavor she was referring to, but she sure as shit wasn’t going to stick around to figure it out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed, muttering under her breath a few things in Spanish. From how ridiculous she was to cursing out the universe. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m just trying to be helpful, dear,” The woman sang (Or, was that Rio’s imagination because her voice was that damn nice?). “What’s got the tears rolling?” She questioned. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Isn’t dealing with her at work horrible enough? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Better yet, <em> who </em>has the tears roll-”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned. </p><p> </p><p>“Was it my gift? Oh, you poor thin-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head. <em> Fuck. </em> She wasn’t in the mood for this. </p><p> </p><p>“I said-”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, yeah. I’m not deaf, you know?” Agatha laughed and that damn, cute, adorable, stupid fucking snort broke in between. “We aren’t at work, <em> Professor </em>. You don’t need to treat me as your rival-”</p><p> </p><p>“You aren’t my rival,” Rio scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> You’re just my worst nightmare. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“A rival would mean there’s competition between us. There isn’t”</p><p> </p><p>“Awe! So we <em> are </em> secret best friends?!” Agatha taunted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, arms tightly crossed against her chest as she stormed off. She made sure their shoulders bumped into one another, making Agatha stumble back a bit as the woman let out a soft laugh followed by a call, </p><p> </p><p>“You forgot your ice cream!”</p><p> </p><p>“Go to hell, Harkness!” Rio snapped back without a second thought. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> What the fuck, what the fuck?! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her mind chanted the three words over and over. She was close to dropping the basket of snacks, running out of the store and maybe even put in her resignation from the university. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t sure what was worse anymore. Was it being stood up? Or how the universe never letting her meet a woman to fall in love with? And now, the most annoying co-worker who taunted and teased the hell out of her found her sobbing in the ice cream section on a Friday night. </p><p> </p><p>The third. That had to be the worst thing the universe had ever gifted her. </p><p> </p><p>The woman slipped back into the chip aisle, catching her breath right next to the Doritos. She kept a hand over her stomach, telling herself it was just the emotions and she was not going to toss up the beer and pretzels from before. That’d only sign her death certificate if she were to vomit all over the tile floor for Agatha to inevitably see. </p><p> </p><p>About two minutes had gone by when Rio finally felt her lungs find a steady pace. She wiped her eyes again, feeling the craving for ice cream strengthen more than before. The frozen dessert was always her go to as emotional support. </p><p> </p><p><em> She’s gone. No doubt about it. </em>Rio told herself. </p><p> </p><p>And the same thing she said earlier to Jennifer about her classroom?</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She does not get to win.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio held her head up high, stomping back to the ice cream section- Agatha Harkness be damned. She wasn’t going to derail her from comfort food. She already saw her covered in tears, drenched in sorrow and despair. Wasn’t that the worst of it all already?</p><p> </p><p>Besides, who would stand in the ice cream section for two extra minutes? Well, Rio would. Especially when she was standing there sobbing for who knows how long. But, Agatha wasn’t Rio. She was fine, upbeat, clearly ready to be her teasing nuisance self and-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> You’ve gotta’ be kidding me… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>When Rio turned the corner, she found Agatha standing in the middle of the aisle. Her pint of ice cream in her hand, looking down at the floor like she was checking if her feet were trapped in cement blocks. Rio noticed how it was the exact same spot she left her in. Unmoved, untouched. A statue or a robot who ran out of battery power. </p><p> </p><p>The other brunette hadn’t looked up at her. Rio still had a window to escape and try desperately to forget this encounter ever happened.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No. She isn’t going to win. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio cleared her throat, taking fast steps to the freezer as she rasped out a quick,</p><p> </p><p>“Is letting unpurchased ice cream melt a hobby of yours?” </p><p> </p><p>For a split moment, Agatha was in the shoes of the shocked one. How her head snapped up, eyes wide, lips parted as if she couldn’t find words to say. Rio should’ve known that wouldn’t last long. Speechless wasn’t in Agatha’s vocabulary, she was sure of it. </p><p> </p><p>Shock slithered into a tease. Agatha’s small frown blossomed into a grin. She tossed the pint of ice cream up, making it do a flip and catching it with ease. </p><p> </p><p>“Come over to my place and find out” She winked. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Why is she like this? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The thing about Agatha being a flirt wasn’t anything special. Rio knew she flirted with just about everyone. Insults, jokes, witty comments, and flirts. They were the language Agatha had created for herself. Her signature style, personality, all of the above. </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes though with how often Agatha flirted with Rio, it was hard for her to remember she wasn’t special. Not that she would be (She wanted to) at all. </p><p> </p><p>“In your dreams” Rio scoffed.</p><p> </p><p>“No, not that you perv,” Agatha rolled her eyes, but abruptly planted a smirk on her face with a low, “Unless-”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Agatha” </em></p><p> </p><p>The woman snorted, tossing her hands up in defense.  </p><p> </p><p>“Listen, it’s very clear you need a shoulder to lean on tonight. I mean, come on, Vidal! It’s a Friday night and you’re crying in the goddamn ice cream section!”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re here too, you know?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not the one covered in tears and grabbing fucking <em> rocky road </em> out of all flavors” She scrunched her nose in disgust. “Jesus, no wonder you’re crying. I would be too eating that shit” </p><p> </p><p>Rio turned from the freezer, her eyes narrowed with lips tugged back out of frustration. Seeing the other professor stride through the university halls, the breakroom to every board meeting, having to hear her name from every single student. And now dealing with her in the middle of the fucking <em> grocery store </em>? Just when Rio didn’t think this night could get any worse…</p><p> </p><p>“Can you go one minute of your life without insulting someone, <em> Agatha </em>?” Rio glared.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you go five minutes without looking at me as if I’m scum of the earth, <em> Professor Vidal </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grinned through the name, confirming Rio’s theory on how she couldn’t live without being a nuisance. And yet? Rio still couldn’t ignore what her professional name rolling off Agatha’s tongue did to her. Things that made the warmth between her legs burn, head spiral off its handles. <em> Fuck. </em>She hated her. </p><p> </p><p>“One for five? Shit deal” Rio scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>“Three for three then?” Agatha countered. “And fine, since you take me as someone who sleeps on the first date- We don’t have to go to my place. My car has a good stereo if you just want to blast music till your eardrums bleed”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned, ice cream freezing her skin while watching the way Agatha wiggled her melted one in the air with a disgustingly, far too, overwhelmingly, intriguing grin. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Why are you debating this, Rio? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you so adamant we spend time together?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had to question that more than anything else, including why she was considering accepting Agatha’s offer. After three years of Rio clearly making it known she didn’t care for Agatha, wanted nothing to do with her, couldn’t stand her, all of the above-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Why is she asking me this? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you so adamant we don’t?” Agatha countered. </p><p> </p><p>The younger woman didn’t give Rio time to think about her question. Instead she shrugged, voice sinking into a lower depth as if she wanted her words to be sacred for Rio’s ears only. </p><p> </p><p>“The doors won’t be locked,” Agatha said, taking a step forward. A tiny shrug, pout of her lips that curled into a little smirk. “Well, unless you want to get frisky then-”</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ!" Rio laughed in disbelief, spinning around on her heel to leave. Just as she was about to exit the aisle?</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, come on!” Agatha exclaimed through a laugh. “I don’t bite! Unless you want me to, of course, but..” She added. “Seriously..”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice had fallen, no teasing or humor in it. Rio felt her feet slow down, coming to a stop as she heard Agatha’s sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we just put aside whatever it is that makes you hate me tonight?”</p><p> </p><p>The question made her ache. A tight squeeze in her chest, bringing a pain as if her heart was bruised. She pulled her lips back, holding tighter to the basket’s handles in one hand and pint of ice cream in the other. </p><p> </p><p>Why did Agatha sound exhausted? Especially as she spoke the word, <em> hate. </em>It sounded as if she was pinning all of this on Rio. Sure, maybe she never truly gave Agatha a chance like Lilia begged her to. But, it was the younger woman’s fault for being so damn annoying all the time! </p><p> </p><p>Between the insults, banter, annoyance- <em> No. </em>Agatha had her hand in this feud, divide, enemy stance as well.</p><p> </p><p>Rio spun around, eyes narrowed in on her target as she shook her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t make it sound like it’s just me here” She ordered. “You have given me shit. You have insulted me, made my life difficult as all hell. It is not just me here, Agatha”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head to the left just an inch, lips parted before she whipped back a quick,</p><p> </p><p>“Three years, <em> Rio.. </em>” She said, putting emphasis on the first name she rarely spoke. Always nicknames or her last, but never the first. “You’ve glared, avoided, given me a cold shoul-”</p><p> </p><p>“You gifted me a cactus this morning that called me a prick!”</p><p> </p><p>“That is a light hearted joke compared to the shit you give me and you know it!” </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back, holding her breath as she tried to navigate the situation. No humor was to be found. Not a hint of a joke anywhere she looked. Agatha was serious. Her eyes exhausted, voice low, no teasing or flirts on the horizon. The woman looked…hurt, almost. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head, desperate to rid the shitty feeling of guilt boiling up within her. Swirling in her stomach, drowning her heart and flooding her throat with more sobs. Not only was she not meant for love, she was a terrible human for making someone feel like shit. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Two for two tonight, good job. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair before waving it back in the air. </p><p> </p><p>“Listen,” She said. “You’re sobbing in the ice cream aisle on a Friday night. I’m here begging my enemy to hang out in my fucking car with me. So..”</p><p> </p><p>She shrugged, gesturing her hand aggressively between them both. Shaking it as if she was trying to free her words from their restraints. Agatha wouldn’t look at her anymore, Rio took note of it. Either her eyes were closed or they stared elsewhere. And suddenly, she missed those twinkling blue orbs for whatever reason. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> What is happening to me? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio knew lust, infatuation. Both were always there between the layers of resentment and fury. But this? She silently thanked Agatha for breaking the silence again before sinking herself into another pit of turmoil.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s just be pathetic enemies..together. One night only”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> One night only.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>A dangerous game, Rio knew it. But...it was Agatha. Surely, Monday morning everything would be back the way it was. This would be a distant memory, a fever dream more than anything.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine..” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s answer not only caught her by surprise, but the way Agatha’s head snapped up with her eyes bloodshot open? She was the deer in headlights between them both. </p><p> </p><p>She cleared her throat, holding her finger up as each word that escaped her made a statement of their own. Every syllable was loud and clear. </p><p> </p><p>“But this is not a date” </p><p> </p><p>“There will be no friskiness”</p><p> </p><p>“And Monday morning when you see me in the hallway- I don’t want to hear a word”</p><p> </p><p>“Got it?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything for a second. She stared and stared some more. Maybe they were close to forty seconds or a minute when the woman finally moved. Agatha’s infamous wicked smile slowly grew wide. Like a snake that crawled along her skin, stretching her cheeks ear to ear with hands up by her sides. </p><p> </p><p>She nodded, each step a smooth stride that brought her closer and closer to the older woman who may or may not have been regretting the decision already. But, it was too late now. Rio signed the deal, secured her ticket in Agatha’s passenger seat. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Sitting in Agatha’s car. With Agatha. Hanging out with Agatha…Oh, what have you done, idiot? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shoulder nearly brushed against Rio’s as she stood by her side. She dipped her head down, lips a ghost near her skin. Rio swore she could feel their warmth on her cheek. </p><p> </p><p>The more she thought about it, the feeling was nothing more a wish. Rio wished for her lips to touch every inch of her, to feel how soft they looked, figure out the way they tasted-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh, this was a bad idea. You hate her. Remember, you fucking hate her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio closed her eyes as Agatha’s breathless laugh sent a chill down her spine. She didn’t offer a moments grace to add a raspy, low, slow, </p><p> </p><p>“Aye, aye- <em> Captain” </em></p><p> </p><p>And as if she was never there, Agatha skipped away while humming along to the music above. Rio took a moment to register the guitar. Her heartbeat was still pounding like a bass drum in her own ears. </p><p> </p><p>But as the guitar tuned in? The familiar intro slithered into her ears and tickled her brain?</p><p> </p><p>With Or Without You by U2. One of Rio’s many favorite songs.</p><p> </p><p>She pushed off the floor to follow Agatha down to the registers. Rio smirked subtly to herself, watching her hips sway to the smooth tempo. Every step she took added something more to it. The woman would have to wipe the smirk away within a few moments, but for now she’d let it stay. Take advantage of the soft moment to let her eyes linger on the woman she always tried to ignore.  </p><p> </p><p>As they walked, the introduction to the song continued to progress. Rio had listened to it so many times throughout her life, but for some reason? The opening guitar riff sounded different. <em> Special, </em>even. Rio wondered if it was just a remastered version. Maybe the crappy speakers that barely worked.</p><p>Only when the first lyric broke out in the static sound, Agatha’s voice singing softly to it, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “See the stone set in your eyes..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The memory hit Rio then. No, exploded and shot, kicked and hammered Rio all right there and then. The time Wanda told her life felt different when she met Natasha, her now wife. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What do you mean different?” Rio snickered.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Everything!” Wanda beamed with a laugh. “Just, the world was lighter. People sounded lighter. Music sounded..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Lighter?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “No..” Wanda shook her head, contemplating it before looking up with a soft smile. “Special. Especially the first time we listened to a song together, it…it just felt like the start of something new. A new adventure, something special I-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda snapped her fingers, nearly dropping the red wine glass in her hand from how giddy her mannerisms were.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I got it!” She exclaimed. “It’ll feel like you were born” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio chuckled.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I don’t remember being born, dumbass. None of us do unless you’re like some…crazy memory freak or something, I don’t know” She shrugged. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “No, no” Wanda shook her head. “Not like that, I mean…you’ll feel like your life is just starting..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “My life is-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh my god, Rio!” She yelled out. “Stop being so logical, for two seconds. See? This is why the universe doesn’t hear you. You aren’t open to it!” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “By just pointing out the obvious?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda pushed up to her feet, placing the wine down on the coffee table as she paced around the room. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh, come on. Where are you go-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The sound of books crashed against the floor. Wanda dropped to her knees, picking through before a- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Aha!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She jumped back up, rushing over to crash on the couch beside Rio.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Our highschool yearbo-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda shushed her, bringing a hand up to cover her mouth. Rio snickered, licking her palm which made the other woman cringe and yell how gross she was. During it though, Wanda still made sure to flip through the yearbook until she landed on the sports section.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Alright, check this out”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Hm?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda pointed to their old soccer team. Both shoulder to shoulder in the back row smiling big.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Yes, we played together,” Rio said. “What does this have to do with-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “The action shots. Look. There’s me running behind you..” Her finger slithered across the page, landing on the goalie. “And that’s-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Holy fuck, that’s..Natasha!” Rio sat up with a laugh. “When did you figure this shit out?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The woman shrugged. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Honestly, it’s been such a blur since we started dating-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Because you live in her bedsheets?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Butttt!” Wanda spoke over her with a glare. “My point is..trust the universe” </em>
</p><p><em><br/>
</em> <em> Rio stared, wondering how much her friend had to drink. </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> “So..I need to keep an eye on all my yearbooks? How does this relate to you telling me to cut it out with the realistic shit?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda shook her head, reaching forward to pick her wine back up.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Because,” She started. “The universe works in ways we don’t understand. It’s not like you and I were small town kids. Natasha was constantly moving as well. What were the chances for her to be right there? To be in the same photo in our yearbook as us?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda took a sip, continuing on right after, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You gotta’ just accept there’s no logic going into destiny, fate, the universe…all of it” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “And when it happens, I’ll feel like I’m being pushed out of my mother’s vagina all over again?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda scrunched her nose in disgust as she playfully smacked her shoulder. Rio fell into a fit of laughter.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Just! Ugh, stop it with the realism and trying to push it” Wanda shrugged, looking over with a warm smile. “When the universe sends you that special someone…you’ll feel it” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio hummed, taking a swig from her beer.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Good thing the universe doesn’t send me shit to feel. Just…annoying women like Agatha fuckin’ Harkness” She grumbled.  </em>
</p><p><em><br/>
</em> <em> Wanda shrugged.  </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Who knows, that could be the universe’s person for-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio belted out a laugh.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “And on that note, I’m going to grab another beer!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She pushed up from the couch as Wanda rolled her eyes over her theatrics.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You’ve met her like once, Rio. The new semester hasn’t even started yet!” She exclaimed. “Who knows, you two could fall in loveeeee!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio made gagging noises as she left the room. The woman never knew Wanda mumble a few words under her breath in a mockery voice,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “It’s going to be Agatha…I know these things, idiot..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha placed her items up on the self checkout. She scanned them one by one, carelessly singing under her breath to every lyric. Rio’s plan was to rip her eyes off when Agatha didn’t have her back turned to her. However, with her old conversation with Wanda in her mind, U2 and Agatha singing the lyrics-</p><p> </p><p>It felt impossible to look away. Rio tried telling herself this had to be a facade, placebo effect. Maybe her emotions were playing pretend because everything was lining up to Wanda’s words. </p><p> </p><p>The song made her feel like life was beginning for the first time in her life. </p><p>Agatha Harkness, her sworn enemy and most annoying person, was radiating this beautiful light. The world around her felt lighter, happier. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> It can’t be her.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, snapping Rio out of her daze to realize she had been holding her hand up to her. She had her lips pulled back, fingers curling back to gesture to herself. </p><p> </p><p>“What uh…wha-”</p><p> </p><p>“C’mon, let me scan them”</p><p> </p><p>“No?” Rio asked, wondering if Agatha had gone insane. “I- You aren’t-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, reaching over to snatch the basket and pint of ice cream from her hand. Just as she did so, their fingers brushed and Wanda’s other words had gone off like alarm whistles in her ears,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “And then she touched me..” Wanda recalled. “My whole body just, lit up…it was like being electrocuted but…in the best way possible” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt goosebumps rising up all over her skin. Her eyes began to sting with the sensation of tears threatening her once again. Not because of hatred for the universe, wondering why she wasn’t lucky enough in this lifetime to fall in love, and the being stood up part? Long forgotten.</p><p> </p><p>Tears wanted to break free, roll down her cheeks all over again because of the realization there was a burning buzzing through her veins. One that wasn’t painful, but didn’t help her anxiety or anything else going on in her mind at all. </p><p> </p><p>She felt her kneecaps weaken, heart palpitate while her skin vibrated. A piece of her wanted to chalk it up to the sweet offer Agatha was giving her by purchasing her snacks and ice cream. However, Rio knew better than that. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t Agatha buying her things..it was-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You’ll know when it’s her..you’ll just feel it and know it, Rio”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio watched Agatha place their items in two bags. One was passed to Rio, the other held in her own grip as Agatha ripped the receipt from the printer. </p><p> </p><p>“Alright” Agatha sighed with a smile. “Follow along now, don’t get lost” She winked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded because words didn’t exist anymore. Somehow her feet moved, keeping up with Agatha’s pace as they left the store. The cool air helped settle the vibration through her body, but what it couldn’t help? Rio’s racing thoughts repeating the same thing. </p><p> </p><p><em> Is it really going to be her? No..it can’t. </em> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was being nice. Agatha found her crying in the ice cream section, and offered her a shoulder to lean on. She was buying her items out of pity and kindness. Besides, the woman flirts with everyone. Rio wasn’t special. She always knew that.</p><p> </p><p>Not to mention, it was clear Rio had hurt her in a way or two. Agatha had never shown that side of her before. Hell, Rio didn’t know that piece of her actually existed. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> No.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She told herself as they approached the car. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> It’s not her. The universe would not send me my enemy to fall in love with.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Rio” </p><p> </p><p>The woman jumped, turning on a whim to see Agatha had stopped walking a few steps ago. Rio forced a small laugh, but it was pathetic and didn’t sound like anything. </p><p> </p><p>“Change your mind?”</p><p> </p><p>“No! No, uh..” Rio walked back, stammering out the words with a shrug. “Force of habit” She landed on. </p><p> </p><p>Luckily, Agatha bought it and didn’t seem to want to dive into where Rio’s mind had truly been. She gestured to the black Ford explorer. The car Rio knew all too well because it was where her eyes went to in the parking lot each morning. She wasn’t sure when she started making sure Agatha’s car was there, but the habit was one that never died.</p><p> </p><p>“Good..” Agatha nodded. “You’d be a chicken shit otherwise. I would’ve had to get you a chicken suit and all” </p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, forcing out a monotone, </p><p> </p><p>“Funny” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked as she walked over, brushing against Rio’s back to round the back of the car. She opened the passenger side door, placing her bag on the floor before tossing what Rio assumed was clothes in the backseat. </p><p> </p><p>After a moment or so, the woman leaned back and stepped to the side. Theatrically, she waved her arm with a little bow, </p><p> </p><p>“Your throne awaits”</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh over that. A genuine one, not a fake or sarcastic response to shut the woman up. </p><p> </p><p>“Such a charmer..” She said. </p><p> </p><p>She hopped into the passenger seat, holding her breath as Agatha shut the door behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio took in the interior in the dim light. Only a few wrappers scattered, eyeliner and lip gloss in one of the cupholders caught her eye more than anything. She always looked at the car, the woman who drove or stepped in and out of it. Rio just never thought she’d be sitting <em> in </em>the car. Especially with Agatha in the driver’s seat. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Holy shit.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She was going to be in a car with her. Rio was going to be hanging out with her fucking enemy. Reality was all hitting fast, but abruptly stopped the second the door opened with the chirpy, </p><p> </p><p>“Alrighty” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed as she pulled the car door shut. As she turned the key in the ignition, Rio felt her heart jump again for what felt like the millionth time. Especially as reality had dawned on her where she was, who was beside her and how the entire night had led up to this point. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> How did being stood up lead me here?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I told Wanda Tinder was a bad idea..</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Now typically, Vidal. I do have rules for my car” Agatha started. “But..maybe I’ll make you the exception or…you can be <em> my </em>little rule breaker?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt an ache shoot between her legs over the words Agatha chose. Part of her wondered if Agatha knew exactly what she was doing. Was she feeling everything Rio felt? </p><p> </p><p>From the music, electric touch, everything was lighter and now the familiar thunder of arousal that felt far worse now! </p><p> </p><p>She swallowed the lump in her throat. Rio then forced an annoyed smile as she nodded. No words came out, but luckily Agatha had gotten distracted by trying to find them spoons for their ice cream. </p><p> </p><p>Rio knew she had to break the silence, find her footing and regain the strength she had within her. It was somewhere just…buried beneath the surface, maybe extinct. Wherever it had landed, Rio was determined to find it. The only problem was one repeating thought kept screaming in her mind the loudest,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What if it’s been Agatha all along?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>...Fuck my life...</em>

<p>
<em>"If you're feeling down<br/>
I just wanna make you happier, baby<br/>
Wish I was around<br/>
I just wanna make you happier, baby<br/>
<br/>
We've been doing all this late night talking<br/>
'Bout anything you want until the morning<br/>
Now you're in my life<br/>
I can't get you off my mind"</em>
</p>
</blockquote><hr/><p><br/>
<em> Rio leaned her elbows on the bar, trying to muffle the consistent chatter and music that surrounded her. She didn’t want to be out of bed let alone in public with people at every turn. Especially ones she worked with that expected and damn near required her to be social.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The break up with her ex was still fresh. A wound that barely began to truly heal. It was back in June, right at the end of the last semester everything came crashing down.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She wasn’t happy, plain and simple. It didn’t make sense to her how she could feel the break up cut deep. Wanda tried to explain how it was only reasonable for her to grieve what was. They were together for nearly a year, talking about plans for the future and a possible family.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> But, Rio ruined it. Maybe the wound was still there from that.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She hurt someone close to her, someone who saw the good parts when Rio only ever could spot the bad. Wanda was there, she would attempt to tell her it was okay to walk away. Hell, it was only fair. Even if she hurt her, it’d be worse in the long run for Rio to walk into marriage and a family while still feeling empty inside.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio was always picky with the people she surrounded herself with. An introvert who did everything to avoid social situations such as the one she was currently trapped in. With that, when she felt someone wasn’t good for her to be around (Even if nothing in particular was wrong with them), she felt the weight of it heavy on her shoulders. In her gut, there was a knot that tightened day by day. The words screaming in her mind how this wasn’t her person to spend eternity with.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “It’ll always be this”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She remembered sobbing, choking the words out while her head rested in Wanda’s lap. Her ex had collected the last of her belongings and it dawned on her then how once again- A woman wasn't the one for Rio to love. She didn’t feel loved or seen in the way her mind and heart desired.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “It’ll happen..there’s some lunatic out there who will put up with you”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda had said those words for years and fuck, Rio was growing tired of hearing them.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio glanced at her phone screen, seeing her chat with Wanda still open. The last text she was somewhat ignoring still remained.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="WandaRiotexts" height="600" src="https://archive.org/download/received_1058668312843520/received_1058668312843520.png" width="397"/>
</p><p>
<em> Just as Rio was about to pick up her phone, let her thumbs tap away begging for Wanda to save her from this hell hole-  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “And over here!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Lilia’s voice rang in Rio's ears, stopping her from replying to Wanda.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Dammit. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Instead subtly dropped her head in defeat, locked the phone and counted down from three before she faced the two behind her. Rio had known Lilia for years, far past her start date as a professor. They went way back into her childhood years when the older woman had lived down the street from her. Safe to say? She knew when Lilia was dragging someone along to meet her.   </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio turned from the bartender to follow it. A warm smile, ready to chat away with whoever Lilia felt she needed to meet and- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Holy shit.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She didn’t realize how oxygen could be stripped from you so aggressively. Rio had been starstruck by beautiful women countless times before. Gay panic, Wanda said or whatever the hell it was called. Regardless, Rio never felt the sudden rush through her. How everything else around them blurred, only the woman before her was clear as day.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Isn’t that right?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Lilia nudged Rio’s arms, snapping her out of the strong daze. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “This is Professor Harkness,” She introduced. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Lilia had gone on to say something about the English department, but fuck Rio didn't hear her let alone care. She already knew somewhat where the woman would be working, but Rio never knew who it’d be.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She would’ve never guessed either this would be her reaction.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> LIlia went on to joke about how Rio was a witch with nature. A force to be reckoned with when the landscapers on campus were in her vision. Typically, Rio would be flattered and acknowledge such comments with wits of her own humor. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> However, she was distracted and seemingly- So was the new professor.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The older woman wasn’t blind and Rio knew that, but she chose to ignore that. Without a doubt, Lilia was seeing the way the two stared each other down. Both in their own world, exploring each other’s eyes, never breaking apart.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Well..” Lilia drew the word out, taking a step back. “I see uh, I’m needed over by Professor Kale. We both know how she gets with..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Did Lilia complete her excuse to walk away? Rio wasn’t sure. All she knew was Harkness now stood alone before her. A small smile was growing on her lips, eyes let go to roam up and down Rio’s body which suddenly felt small- Even if she was a slight inch taller than the woman.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Vidal,”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Her voice was something extraordinary. A sound Rio had never heard, a blessing to be introduced to. The way her name rolled off her tongue, it glided with ease and ran smoothly in the space between them.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “The meaning of life?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> As if her voice alone wasn’t enough- Her knowledge stepped out with power. A force that took Rio aback. No one ever guessed or cared to know the meaning of her last name. Hell, it never seemed anyone was interested in the five letter word.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Is uh..” Rio straightened her back, taking a sip of her drink before tilting her beer forward. “Studying words, a hobby of yours?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The woman smirked, a small shrug followed with a small, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Only to impress beautiful women like yourself”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Before Rio was able to digest the flirtatious comment- The woman’s hand was extended and she introduced herself with confidence that radiated power throughout the room, maybe the entire city to every continent.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Agatha Harkness”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio nodded, lifting her hand that was trembling as adrenaline coursed through her entire body. Their first touch was electric- A vibration that trembled Rio down to her core through the floorboards beneath her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Rio Vidal”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She managed to introduce herself within a few seconds, but the way Agatha was smirking- Did she see the fluster through her warm cheeks? How Rio was becoming a mess under her stare? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Rio”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha echoed with a soft smile, slowly nodding before asking,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “So…you're a green witch?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wha- Oh, shit, Lilia…course…Rio thought to herself.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> The older woman had called her The Green Witch since she took over Lilia’s garden back in middle school. What started as a science project turned into something spectacular. Lilia would always laugh, saying how she (Who had years of gardening experience) never managed to make the flowers and plants blossom the way Rio could. </em> <em><br/>
<br/>
</em></p><p>
<em> From that moment on, Rio earned the nickname that she secretly adored.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She cleared her throat, adjusting her shirt as she stood a bit taller.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Um..” Rio shrugged. “Less a green witch, more The Green Witch”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha puffed out a small laugh, shaking her head and Rio thought she stuck the landing. Maybe this conversation, meeting, party- It wasn’t bad after all. The only downside was she’d have to tell Wanda how she was right, but..that was the last thing on her mind.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Ego filled thing, aren't you?” Agatha asked. “I’m sure I’ve seen better” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio wasn’t sure if Agatha meant for her comment to come off harsh. Did she realize the attitude that covered each word? How she sounded absolutely disgusted with her?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Or…was Rio just thinking too much into it? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Most likely, it was the second, but..Rio’s insecurities weren’t always good remaining on the surface. Especially fresh off a break up and from a woman who was dominating the air around them.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She narrowed her eyes, watching the way Agatha looked so smug and something in her stomach kicked. A switch was flipped, the sparks flew but not in the way it did before.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What makes you so sure?” Rio questioned.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha shrugged, taking another sip of her drink.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I know these things” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “So..you know how much of an asshole you sound like right now?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> That seemed to eliminate the smug look on her face. Instead, it was replaced with shock and Rio was able to take the step above- Finally.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “This usually work for you?” Rio gestured between them. “Just…insulting someone off the bat?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha clicked her tongue, head tilting to the side as she tapped her fingers against the wine glass.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What? Are you not like other girls?” The woman asked. “Don’t like to be brought back down to earth a little bit?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio laughed, rolling her eyes as she shook her head.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You don’t even know who I am to be making the call if I need to be brought back down to earth to begin with” She argued.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I know ‘em when I see ‘em” Agatha shrugged.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Wow,” Rio said. “I could say the same about you being an asshole right about now-” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You could or will?” Agatha smirked.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio paused before she scoffed, pushing her back off the bar to storm past the woman. She let their shoulders punch against one another, muttering under her breath,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Fuck off, Harkness..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Little did Rio know that’d become her new mantra for years to come... </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Rules for your car?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t sure how she thought of the words, but she sure as shit wasn’t going to question it. Somehow, she’d managed to pull herself together…well, and least somewhat. </p><p> </p><p>Between the adrenaline coursing through her veins as if the emotion was her blood. How Wanda’s cursed words bounced around her brain, preaching the universe held its own magical ways. And Agatha’s <em> fucking </em>little flirts suddenly feeling as if she’d push Rio off the edge of glory. </p><p><br/>
She always flirted with her. Annoyingly, that was. Why was Rio feeling different all of the sudden? Sure, she always felt a bit flustered and even turned on against her own wishes at times. But this was another level, an intense feeling that only grew with everyone. </p><p> </p><p>“Mhm” Agatha hummed. </p><p> </p><p>The older woman scoffed, suffocating her true feelings the best she could. </p><p> </p><p>“You're joking..” Rio muttered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickered. </p><p> </p><p>“Far from it” </p><p> </p><p>The younger woman continued to rummage through her center console for plastic spoons. Both had forgotten to grab some for their ice cream, too distracted by one another to remember. But, Agatha had insisted she had them somewhere. Rio assumed she must’ve stored them from different drive thru’s and such. </p><p> </p><p>Which felt <em> very </em>Agatha. Rio wasn’t surprised to see her car was complete and total chaos. However, how the fuck did a hot mess have rules for her car?</p><p> </p><p>“I’d give you a rundown, but your tears are excusing you from it” Agatha waved her hand towards her as if she tossed the rules away. </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>“What? Do they excuse me from signing a waiver as well?” She asked with her tone covered in sarcasm. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snapped shut the center console in defeat. She dropped her head, shaking it subtly before silently hissing a small, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Shoot!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The woman then looked up, meeting Rio’s eyes as she added on a slow,</p><p> </p><p>“I knew I forgot something at home..” She sighed. “I’ll email you the documents tonight. Just sign them and send it back to me” </p><p> </p><p>Easily, Agatha had dragged Rio in another moment where she wondered if the joke was serious or not. Though the confusion didn’t last long as that sickening wide grin crept up slowly. The one that confirmed Agatha was in fact joking and there was no car rule contract. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Course.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>This is what drove Rio mad at times. Agatha was so good at lying, joking, pulling one over you without any energy needed. Rio swore Agatha didn’t know how to go twenty four hours (Let alone a fucking second) without making some kind of joke out of a situation. </p><p> </p><p>“Ha. Ha” Rio’s voice was monotone as she rolled her eyes. “I knew there was no way you had rules for your car-”</p><p> </p><p>“Now that,” Agatha pointed. “That is actually truthful”</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio was able to reply- Agatha leaned over to pull down the glove box. Which would be fine, but it was the position she had put Rio in. One moment Agatha was on her own side of the car. The next her shoulder nearly brushed against Rio’s lap, hair just below Rio’s chin, sparking that same electric sensation as before. </p><p> </p><p>This time the feeling was stronger, more powerful as their close proximity was in a compact space. </p><p> </p><p>The lavender with a hint of vanilla conditioner wavered through the air, sneaking up into Rio’s nose. She had to hold her breath to keep her composure. Plus, Agatha was laced through the conditioner. The woman carried something of her own. A smell Rio couldn’t figure out, but could only describe it as, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, here we go!” Agatha exclaimed, snapping Rio out of her shock. </p><p> </p><p>The woman leaned back as if she was never over Rio’s lap, untouched by any emotions that Rio was overwhelmed with. Part of Rio fell into jealousy, but also embarrassed as fuck because it was clearly, <em> just her. </em>Agatha wasn’t phased, she wasn’t feeling the chaos of emotions Rio had been since she agreed to join her in the car. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha held up the spoon wrapped in plastic, a smile of achievement matching it. Rio muttered a small thank you, taking it from her to rip the plastic off. She balled it up, placing it in her lap before taking the seal off her ice cream. </p><p> </p><p>The older woman’s mind was still swimming in Agatha’s orbit. The warmth in the air over her lap grew cold with the abrupt absence. She hadn’t even spent more than fifteen seconds and Rio was drowning as if Agatha trapped her for hours. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Go back to the rules.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Get out of your head with this.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Focus. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Nice try,” Rio said, clearing her throat right after. “For a woman who barely holds standards and rules for a classroom, there’s no possible way you-”</p><p> </p><p>“Rule number one!” Agatha cut off, holding a finger in the air. “Thou shall not complain about my driving”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh my god.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I’m not going anywhere with you. So..that rule is pointless right now” Rio argued. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but continued on as if Rio hadn’t said anything at all.</p><p> </p><p>“Number two,” She continued. “Thou shall not criticize the car’s possessions. She likes stuff, clothes and random objects one wouldn’t think to carry, but end up needing anyway! Hence the spoons” She tilted her head with a smirk at the end. </p><p> </p><p>Rio peeled the lid off her ice cream, leaning forward to flip it upside and rest on the dashboard. She sat back, crossing a leg over the other when she realized-</p><p> </p><p>“Wait..” She said, rolling her head over slowly to see Agatha busy with her own wrapper. “<em> She </em> as in who? You or-”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> She </em> as in the vehicle you are sitting in right this very moment”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Yep. That’s what I thought. She really is insane.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You gave your car a gender?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped, smacking a hand over her heart as she shook her head before looking at her with disgust.</p><p> </p><p>“Professor Vidal, she is more than just a gender!” She exclaimed. “She has a name!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh!” Rio laughed, digging into her ice cream because she needed some kind of vice to continue putting up with this. “And what would that name be, hm?”</p><p> </p><p>She hummed, slipping the spoon past her lips to let the frozen treat greet her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think you deserve the honors to know” Agatha huffed, returning her attention to peel the lid off her ice cream. </p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered, shaking her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Because there is no name”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, there is,” Agatha argued.</p><p> </p><p>“No, there isn’t” Rio countered. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes. There. Is” </p><p> </p><p>“If there was, you’d give up the name”</p><p> </p><p>“I just said you don’t get to know-”</p><p> </p><p>“Which is something one would say when it’s a bullshit lie!” </p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, fine!” Agatha groaned. “It’s Violet. Named after one of my favorite shades of purple” </p><p> </p><p>Rio paused, watching as Agatha took a small dig in her own ice cream. No humor or smirk to prove otherwise. She was serious. Her car had a gender, rules, and was named after not just her favorite color- But, one of many <em> shades </em>of it. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re so lame” She shook her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, as if you aren’t yourself!” Agatha exclaimed. </p><p> </p><p>“My car doesn’t have a name” Rio rolled her eyes. “So, I don’t think I’m the lame one here,” She added. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha worked to finish her bite of ice cream, waving her spoon in the air as she swallowed before replying, </p><p> </p><p>“No, but it is commonly known on campus how <em> Professor Green Witch </em> views all her plants as her children” Agatha argued. “Don’t sit here and tell me you did <em> not </em>baby talk that little cactus”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s cheeks began to burn. She took another bite of the ice cream while hiding her face. Agatha snorted, crumbling up the plastic with a small,</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm! That’s what I thought”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever, continue on with <em> Violet’s </em>rules” She said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio caught a glimpse of Agatha’s ice cream container. The Ben and Jerry’s chocolate chip design dim in the parking lot’s light. Before Agatha was able to carry on, Rio realized then? She had more ammunition to shoot at her for who was the lame one. </p><p> </p><p>“Wait, wait” Rio laughed, pointing over with a strong, “You insult my rocky road, think I am the lame one, but get fucking chocolate chip?!” </p><p> </p><p>The younger woman looked down at her ice cream, shrugging with a tiny smile. No teasing, taunting, none of it lined up behind that grin. The dim parking lot lights casting soft rays through the windshield offered Rio access to see the subtle pink shading Agatha’s cheeks. She looked away as if she caught on to Rio catching it, hiding herself as she scooped up her own bite of ice cream. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s a classic,” She pointed out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s boring and lame”</p><p> </p><p>“Like you?” Agatha rolled her head over, a tiny grin while popping the spoon between her lips. </p><p> </p><p>And suddenly Rio was jealous of a spoon getting to feel and taste something that she desired. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> No. No. That’s not what this is, shut up.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked away in a hurry, desperate to derail the conversation back to where they previously were. Agatha seemed to feel the same as she took the lead to do so. </p><p> </p><p>“And number three,” She said, drawing out the silence as if it were anticipation. “Thou shall not control the music when it is not their car”</p><p> </p><p>Right after she stated the final rule (Or what Rio assumed was the last one), Agatha reached for her phone and unlocked the screen. She navigated with a few taps, passing it over for Rio to see the Spotify home screen staring up at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Aka, the rule I am eliminating for thee” Agatha smiled. </p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at the phone, feeling her heart kick up once again. Not because of the Spotify app, but it was the way Agatha had said she was eliminating the rule for her. </p><p> </p><p>The woman was offering for Rio to choose the music. Her voice telling her that was soft, delicate, brought warmth into Rio’s heart and- </p><p> </p><p>
<em> No. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> This is out of pity.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha found her crying in the ice cream section- This. Is. Out. Of. Pity. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She flirts with everyone and nothing about this is special.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I am not special to her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I’m her enemy.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I hate her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> She knows it.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The older woman cleared her throat, tightening up her shoulders before letting them drop with a low, </p><p> </p><p>“In exchange for..?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked confused for a moment, wondering what she meant by that. She shook her head, lips pursed in a tiny pout as she replied, </p><p> </p><p>“No exchanges,” Agatha said. “Nor a trick,” She added. “Just a trial”</p><p> </p><p>“A trial?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed, looking back up at Agatha who had her eyes locked on her as if she was the most interesting thing in the world. <em> Fuck </em>, that didn’t help anything about this. </p><p> </p><p>“Of what?” Rio managed to choke out. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked as if she expected Rio to ask more questions. </p><p> </p><p>“If you have immaculate or pathetic music taste” Agatha nudged her phone at her. “Come on, now. Chop chop”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated before she caved and took the phone out of Agatha’s hand. She placed the pint of ice cream in her lap, both hands free to let her thumbs search for an artist. </p><p> </p><p>The amount of pressure that weighed on her to choose something good was heavy. She thought about what song would make Agatha want to talk to her more, but at the same time? The annoyance, resentment, and hatred still ran deep. Denial wasn’t a river in Egypt to her quite yet. Rio was holding on to what she knew for three years and pissing or annoying Agatha was her plan. </p><p> </p><p>Well…so she thought, anyway because unbeknownst to Rio? She was already going to choose a song Agatha would like. Even if she wasn’t thinking about doing so. Her heart was ruling over her mind. The secret villain in her pulling all the strings. </p><p> </p><p>She typed in the words, clicking the song before passing the phone back to Agatha who was leaning forward to turn the volume up. The intro began and the title on her dashboard came to life. Rio picked up her ice cream, taking a frantic nervous bite as she awaited Agatha’s response. </p><p> </p><p>A puff of air left Agatha with a tiny scoff when she read the words, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For </em>
</p><p>
<em>                             U2” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“More U2, huh?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>“I always leave this store listening to this kind of music,” Rio shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>“Not a bad thing” Agatha hummed, bobbing her head to the soft beat. </p><p> </p><p>They let the music fill the silence for a bit. Agatha had grabbed her phone, opening to the song’s radio so the one song wouldn’t play on repeat. But, they’d still have the same vibe as it. </p><p> </p><p>Though, when the song was closing in to the end- Agatha broke the unspoken minutes between them to break the glass and ask- </p><p> </p><p>“So..are we going to talk about the tears in the ice cream aisle or what?” </p><p><br/>
Rio snapped her head over, eyes wide as she shook her head frantically. </p><p> </p><p>“What? No. You said we’d listen to music. That was it”</p><p> </p><p>“I say a lot of things,” Agatha snickered. “Besides, I feel like that plan was eliminated when one was sobbing at ice cream. Who cries over ice cream?”</p><p>Rio stared wide, suddenly feeling her stomach and feeling sick because she could <em> not </em>talk to Agatha about this. It was one thing agreeing to hang out with her, but another to admit to the woman who already gave her hell left and right her Tinder date stood her up. And Rio just knew Agatha would never let that go. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s..no,” Rio said before chuckling over the idea of even saying anything about it. “I can <em> not </em>talk to you about this”</p><p> </p><p>“Is it work related?” Agatha questioned. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head. </p><p> </p><p>“No..”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, that’s a surprise”</p><p> </p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” </p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t everything in your life related to the university?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes because <em> great </em>, this topic. Wanda, Lilia, even Jennifer had jumped on her from time to time over it. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You should live life outside of work” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Work doesn’t need to be what you live and breathe” </em>
</p><p><em> “Won’t you regret spending all your life on work one day?” </em> </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think it’s a bad thing, Rio” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wait, what? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“If anything, it’s admirable” </p><p> </p><p>Rio fell into a deeper pit of disbelief because Agatha Harkness, the woman who teased and taunted her every second they were near one another. She always seemed to like poking fun, digging under her skin to push every button that would aggravate her nerves. </p><p> </p><p>How the hell was she not making fun of Rio for such a thing? She insulted her teaching methods left and right. Rio remembered well the first argument the two had ever gotten into. It was during a get together with the others for drinks. Agatha and Rio sat across from one another at the table. She couldn’t remember exactly what sparked it, but she knew Agatha lit the flames between them. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Well, I like to make sure students don’t fall asleep in my class. Professor Vidal, you should take notes from that. Don’t you think?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh shit..” Alice mumbled behind her drink.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio snapped her head up, eyes narrow as her lips slowly curled into a smirk. One that was vicious, venom on her tongue ready to poison the air between them.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha Harkness was already someone she couldn’t stand to be around. Her voice was loud, annoying and way too much for her low energy to handle. And now she was going after her teaching methods?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Is that so?” Rio asked. “Are your students even there to learn? Or do they just want an excuse to have a party mid day?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha snorted through her little laugh. The one that made Rio’s stomach flip and irritated her both at once.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “My students like learning because I make it lively and fun. Yours on the other hand, well” She shrugged, taking a pause so she could sip her wine before continuing. “We all have heard you’d much rather be kind to your plants over stu-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh!” Rio laughed. “Really? Because I hear students that don’t even give a shit about the material they’d learn in your class. You’re just eye candy to them” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You think I’m eye candy then?” Agatha smirked like the devil, threatening to strip Rio’s soul right then and there.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> This bitch...Rio muttered in her mind.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The woman scoffed before she slammed down the rest of her wine in one swallow, pulling her wallet out to leave cash before abruptly standing up.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Guys..” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Rio, sit down” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “C’mon”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The others piled words over the other, but Rio was having none of it.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “No, no” Rio put her hands up. “It’s fine. At least I can sleep knowing I’m teaching my students something over just letting them stare at my ass and party all semester” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio never stayed to hear what Agatha had to say. Instead, she stormed off without looking back. She rarely agreed to go out for drinks or attend dinners with them after that. Which part of her was thankful Agatha ever did that. Even if it was wine induced or God knows what. It gave her an excuse to stay home and that’s all she could really ask for. </p><p> </p><p>“I mean, come on. Remember our professors? How many genuinely <em> craved </em>teaching others? You’re beyond passionate about fucking plants too. I mean, hell, I didn’t know one could view them as humans. Do they actually have feelings?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt her cheeks flame red, looking down and wondering all over again when Agatha’s switch had flipped. She wasn’t insulting her teaching style, but this time admiring it. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> This is all out of pity, has to be.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>But hey, if Agatha wanted to ask about plants? Rio could never deny that topic. She could be speaking to the most evil human on earth and if they asked her something related to nature, she’d be more than happy to discuss. </p><p> </p><p>“I mean..” Rio shrugged. “Realistically? No. They don’t” </p><p> </p><p>Without thinking, Rio found herself perking up in her seat as her worlds began to spill uncontrollably. No filter, no breaks, just an unstoppable train that ran off on it’s own. </p><p> </p><p>“However, I’d like to think since they are living creatures- <em> Yes, </em>creatures, they are that to me. They need water and oxygen just as we do to stay alive and they grow and lose life just as we do and so maybe, yeah, I’d like to think they could potentially have feelings and emotions. Maybe we just aren’t meant to figure that out…but, I always uh..”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head over to see Agatha with a gawking stare her way. Movements frozen, lips sealed shut as they slowly were pulled back between her teeth in what Rio would guess was an attempt to not burst out laughing. </p><p> </p><p>Embarrassment flooded her when realization dawned on her. Agatha was joking just like always. She didn’t care or want to know. Rio just couldn’t shut the fuck up and not make a fool of herself over a stupid fixation. Since a kid, this had hjaoppened. No one ever wanted to actually know how insane she was when it came to her plants.  </p><p> </p><p>Especially the woman she couldn’t stand. </p><p> </p><p>“You were…joking, right-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickered, confirming Rio’s doom was approaching sooner than expected. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, kinda’ but…” She shrugged. “Not going to argue that theory of yours. You could be right, who knows?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sunk into the seat, suddenly not hungry and regretting every bite she took. Agathha must’ve seen it written all over her the way her words rushed out.  </p><p> </p><p>“But, nice to hear this isn’t work related and you do have a life outside of the university” She said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She was too busy debating jumping out of the car, abandon the snacks Agatha had purchased for her. Maybe even skipping town without a bag packed or a look behind her.  </p><p> </p><p>“I won’t tell a single soul what is said in this car” Agatha said. “Scouts honor” She held up her hand. </p><p> </p><p>Rio chewed on the inside of her cheek, debating if it was worth even admitting to. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> I mean…it’d make her forget how much of a loser I sounded like over stupid fucking plants.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No, no. What are you thinking?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Don’t do it.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She’ll never let it go more than sobbing in the fucking store.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Do not- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Tonight was- I’m supposed to be at a..dinner. Woman from fucking Tinder” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Andddd, you’re resigning and leaving the country.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted and Rio’s heart flipped upside down, ready to drop beneath the pavement below them. </p><p> </p><p>“If you’re going to laugh at me, I swear Ag-”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t think you’re the only one that’s happened to, right?” Agatha asked, almost condescendingly. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Bitch.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, totally” Rio rolled her eyes. “Jesus, is this another insult? Are you calling me self centered right now? I’m not saying this as some <em> woe is me </em>shit or-”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m saying it because I was stood up tonight as well. Jesus..” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s words created a silence between them. Just the soft background noise of Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper through the car speakers. Rio looked closely, making sure this wasn’t one of Agatha’s tricks. If it was, it’d be a brutal one. That’s for sure. But as Agatha focused on stabbing her spoon in the ice cream, shaking her head while muttering,</p><p> </p><p>“Why else do you think I’m in the fucking ice cream section begging the co worker who hates me the most to sit in my car with me?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She’s serious.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You’re lying..” Rio mumbled. </p><p> </p><p>It was a last effort attempt to figure out this was just another cruel joke of her’s. Agatha just scoffed, shrugging as she spoke, </p><p> </p><p>“If I am, hit me with one of those plant vase thingys of yours because that is the most embarrassing lie ever” She huffed. </p><p> </p><p><em> “Vase thingys?” </em> Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah they look heavy…breakable” Agatha said. “Regardless, I was supposed to be on a date myself. Not sure what happened. She cancelled like an hour after being late”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh..”</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “The univer-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shut the fuck up, Wanda.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio thought the words to herself when the memory was about to replay in her mind. How timing and all things related to the universe wasn’t supposed to make sense. It was unpredictable and this felt like something related to all of that. </p><p> </p><p>What were the chances of them both being stood up on the same night?</p><p>How could they possibly decide to grab ice cream at the same store, same night, same time?</p><p> </p><p>All of it screamed the universe had a hand in this game and Rio wasn’t sure what to do with that quite yet. If anything, it terrified the shit out of her because Agatha was her enemy. She was the one woman she fought and bickered, avoided for three years now. Why would the universe choose <em> Agatha </em>of all women that existed?</p><p> </p><p>“What’s your favorite plant?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up when Agatha broke the silence, taking a second to register the question. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” </p><p> </p><p>“A plant? Oh sorry, <em>creature” </em>Agatha smiled a bit as she took another bite, asking again this time with a mouthful of the frozen treat. “Which is your favorite?”</p><p> </p><p>“You…you really want to discuss…<em> plants?”  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother answering the question. Instead answering her own question since Rio didn’t bother to. </p><p> </p><p>“Mine would be the azalea flowers, purple specifically. My mother hated them with a passion and they always grew in our garden against her will. Witchcraft shit, really” She snorted. “I’ve adored them since-”</p><p> </p><p>“You adore something your mother hated?” </p><p> </p><p>A weight dropped upon them. The energy in the car shifted into something tense. A heavier energy Rio wasn’t quite able to narrow down the reason for, but..she could tell Agatha became very uncomfortable. It was a new look she wore. Something Rio had never seen in the three years of knowing her. </p><p> </p><p>Whatever it was, Rio felt the swift urge to redirect the subject back to her own answer. Rio slowly smirked herself before rasping a low, </p><p> </p><p>“Hemp flower..” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze before she snapped her head up, eyebrows furrowed as her lips curled. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” She asked.</p><p> </p><p>“My favorite. It’s-”</p><p> </p><p>“Weed?!” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha cut her off and Rio could only laugh how her voice slightly broke in between. A high pitch crack that sent a tingle down Rio’s spine. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, don’t gasp as if you think it’s the worst thing in this world” Rio shook her head with a wide grin, proud to have caught the woman off guard. </p><p> </p><p>“No, no, not the worst thing- Far from it! Just..” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed with her hand up, readjusting in her seat to face her completely. She put the ice cream in the cupholder, hands together as she grinned like a mad woman. The reaction was adorable even if Rio didn’t want to admit it. </p><p> </p><p>Truthfully as time went by, the more words and longer they spent together- Rio was finding she didn't want to acknowledge or face <em> a lot </em>of things. </p><p> </p><p>“Jesus, Vidal. You are so, way, <em> wayyyy </em> far too uptight to smoke let alone <em> grow </em>fuckin’ weed! There’s no way you-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio took a bite of her ice cream as Agatha was bursting with excitement at the new found information she had on her. She slowly slipped the spoon out of her mouth- A tiny grin formed while rolling her head back over to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Who do you think Lilia’s dealer is?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>The younger woman gasped as her jaw dropped. She slowly let out a laugh that turned into multiple tiny snorts. One after the other, trying to catch her breath while choking out the words, </p><p> </p><p>“No way!”</p><p> </p><p>“Way” Rio confirmed with a small nod. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat back, eyes glimmering as she took in the new found information about her enemy. The professor who always seemed so angry, stern, distant and cold to ever feel warm beside her. Now here she sat in Agatha’s passenger seat, slowly pulling back the curtain to reveal who Professor Vidal truly was outside of the classroom. </p><p> </p><p>When she saw the stoic, brave, confident woman a wreck in front of ice cream, of course Agatha felt her heart ache a bit. But as the minutes went by, more words were said between them- She couldn’t help but feel thankful for those tears. Who knew they’d lead to a moment like so?</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Agatha smirked. “Your shit is pretty good. I have to give you that”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio questioned. </p><p> </p><p>“Lilia offered me to smoke with her one time. Little did I know the devil’s lettuce I was inhaling was crafted by <em> Professor Green Witch </em> herself” </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed, looking back at her ice cream in hopes Agatha wouldn’t see how her cheeks burned over the little nickname and compliment. Instead, she focused on the name for the marijuana that Agatha used over the other that made her heart flip.</p><p> </p><p>“Devil’s lettuce” She muttered. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s a fun name for it!” Agatha exclaimed, shaking her head with a swift, “Should’ve found you crying in the ice cream section years ago if it meant learning this about such a now <em> shockingly </em>grumpy professor”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re never letting the ice cream section thing go, are you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Smoke with me and find out, <em> professor”  </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> She’s going to be the death of me.. </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p>The next hour flew by them like a gust of wind. They talked way more than Rio thought could ever be possible. Sure, when they met years ago there was energy between them. But, it had gone sour so quick. Barely reached the top of the mountain before tumbling and spiraling back down. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha told her the latest gossip with her students. Both figured out they had a toxic relationship duo in either class. Rio had the boyfriend, Agatha had the girlfriend. The two laughed as they mocked and rolled their eyes over the students' theatrics with their dramatic fights. Which led into conversations about other students, but both unspokenly skipped over discussing teaching methods. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t know if it was intentional on Agatha’s end to do so, but it surely was on her own. After being stood up, the complex emotions that exhausted her by the second- Rio didn’t want to find herself in an argument with Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>And what she wouldn’t admit to herself quite yet? She didn’t want to stop what was going on between them. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the constant sarcasm and bantering. Neither found a reason to bicker either. Sure, a few insults were tossed back and forth. But it was different compared to their usual. The insults were filled with laughter, feigned annoyance, all of the above. </p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t understand what was going on. All she could chalk it up to was both of them took pity on each other. They had been stood up, finding themselves on a late night trip for junk food to eat their feelings. Agatha had found Rio crying while Rio witnessed Agatha plead for her to hang out. </p><p>They were taking pity on one another and nothing more. That had to be it. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually as the clock teetered towards an hour after midnight, Rio had called it and said she had to get home. Agatha seemed disappointed, but the look didn't last long. Rio assumed it was exhaustion that made her see the delusional reaction, not thinking more on it. </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks uh,” Rio stepped out of the car, looking back up when her feet planted on the concrete. “For this..” She added. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, head tilted back against the seat and <em> oh hell- </em>Rio swore the look made her feel tipsy as if she downed a bottle of jack. Suddenly her mind was swimming in a flood of confusion and wonder, trying to decipher if the tears and tiredness had won or if it was genuinely just Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>The woman looked so content. A lazy smile that Rio never had access to before. She was used to vicious smirks, exaggerated grins everytime she managed to make Rio storm off. Not whatever this was, but…what Rio knew? She loved and hated it more than words can say. </p><p><br/>
And what didn’t help the feeling she already had found herself drowning in?</p><p> </p><p>“That woman is a moron, Rio” </p><p> </p><p>She said it so effortlessly as if the thought had been on her mind since Rio told her. The lazy smile had faded, but not in a bad way. Instead she subtly frowned. One that told Rio her words were sincere and again, Rio didn’t know what to do with it. </p><p> </p><p>“Is she?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled her lips back while humming a small, </p><p> </p><p>“Mhm” </p><p> </p><p>But, Rio barely heard it. She was far too aware of how her eyes were watching her every move. How Agatha was burning lasers into her while Rio was quick to busy herself. She grabbed her phone, wallet, making sure she had everything and Agatha was watching her <em> every single move. </em></p><p> </p><p>“She missed out..” </p><p> </p><p>Rio froze for a second before jolting back up. She scanned over her belongings, making sure she had everything. There was a passing thought to leave something so she had an excuse to venture back here. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t leave anything behind (Well…physically, emotionally and mentally was up for debate). </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah..” Rio nodded, clearing her throat a second after. “Also uh, thanks for..buying this” </p><p> </p><p>She held the bag of junk food Agatha had bought her in the air with her words. Agatha perked up in her seat right as she said it, reaching forward to find her keys.  </p><p> </p><p>“Just a pity gift,” Agatha shrugged with a tiny grin. “I’ll see you on Monday and no worries, this never happened” </p><p> </p><p>She tilted her head back up and fucking <em> winked </em>. Rio genuinely was losing her mind and hoped Agatha wasn’t able to see any piece of it. </p><p> </p><p>“Take it easy on yourself, Vidal” </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. </p><p> </p><p>“You too..”</p><p> </p><p>Rio went to shut the door, feeling the vehicle vibrate as Agatha started up the engine. But like a force of nature that held a will of its own, she spun around to add a quick,</p><p> </p><p>“Your ghost was stupid too” She rushed. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was in the middle of buckling herself in when she shot her head up, looking like a deer in headlights. It was clear how she didn’t expect it and Rio took some joy out of that. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re annoying, don’t get me wrong,” Rio quickly added. “Like, insufferable and everything, but uh…yeah” She shrugged with a shake of her head. </p><p> </p><p>Slowly Agatha grinned that lazy smile all over again. Her cheeks burned red under the dim light and for a moment Rio thought to herself,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Is she feeling everything just the same? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Ghost..” Agatha echoed the word. “Nice little name for her”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked. </p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes I’m good”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh” Agatha shrugged. “Night, Vidal”</p><p> </p><p>The woman scoffed, shaking her head while she tried to look as annoyed as possible. But the three familiar words she spoke had a smile forced through them against her will. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off, Harkness” </p><p> </p><p>Rio had said the words, slamming the door shut without a second to spare. Through the window, she felt her heart grow warm when she heard Agatha belt out a warm laugh. A cackle that her little snort trickled through.</p><p> </p><p>She spun around, pulling her lips down to bite on while trying terribly to hide the wide grin that wanted to shine bright. Rio walked through the parking lot to her car, too busy in her head to notice how Agatha waited till she was safe in her own car. When she slithered in the drivers side, that’s when she heard the two beeps. Her eyes shot up, seeing Agatha’s hand flying in the air, but not with a normal wave. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh..that bitch” Rio chuckled. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had waved her middle finger in the air and Rio could vision so clearly that familiar antagonizing grin that went with it. She shook her head, buckling her seatbelt and started the engine up. </p><p><br/>
Her plan originally was to go home, bury herself in bedsheets with a tub of ice cream. And out of nowhere, that had flipped like a coin. What was heads became tails and Rio knew which side she was fond of most, but would she say it to herself? No. That’d be ridiculous. </p><p>Instead, her eyes fell to her phone in the cup holder and like a threat?</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Check her Instagram.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio asked out loud as if someone else said the words. </p><p> </p><p>Why would she look at Agatha’s Instagram? That made zero sense! There was no reason to, Rio did not care, Monday was just around the corner and they’d be back to usual. Neither would acknowledge this night ever happened. Agatha would undoubtedly give her a reason to remember why she hated her to begin with. </p><p> </p><p>“No..” Rio muttered to herself with a laugh. </p><p> </p><p>She clicked her seatbelt, pressed her foot on the brake before shifting the car into drive. However, she never moved to the gas pedal. Instead her body was frozen as if checking Agatha’s Instagram would unlock her, free her from the chains she had found herself in. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Gotta’ be kidding me.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio aggressively shifted back into park, snatching her phone up as if it was her opponent she was determined to defeat. </p><p> </p><p>A few seconds of stalking couldn’t hurt, right? Besides, it’s not like Agatha would know she ever looked. Rio made sure to first run a quick search off of Google, confirming Instagram wouldn’t tell Agatha she had checked her profile. </p><p> </p><p>She held in a deep breath while navigating through Jennifer’s followers, landing on Agatha’s account. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Motherhark.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Right, how could Rio forget that username? She had only looked once a few years ago, but didn’t bother to really pay attention. Agatha had requested to follow her and Rio denied it. That was that. </p><p> </p><p>And now here she was, clicking into her profile to see only the few posts that were up. Five, to be exact. That came as a shock to Rio, truthfully. She heard the few others including Agatha talking about reels and memes, god knows what else. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was never one to be on social media much. She much preferred being outside, working in her garden or taking her dog out on hikes through different nature trails. She had adopted a stray that wandered into her yard a year prior. A black pitbull lab Rio had named as Nicky. She wasn’t sure why, but simply went with the feeling in her heart it was the right name. </p><p><br/>
Safe to say, social media was rarely on Rio’s radar. </p><p> </p><p>She pulled her lips back, clicking on the first post and just like that-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaSelfie" height="600" src="https://ia601909.us.archive.org/5/items/received_1059515766067869/received_3962701300638705.png" width="397"/>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio brought the back of her hand to her lips, pressing and biting down gently on her knuckles. This couldn’t be happening to her. A simple fucking selfie of Agatha and she felt as if her body was being set on fire. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes scanned the woman’s jaw line from left to right. Rio’s eyes had always wandered there, but how her head was tilted back made it more present. She fought of thinking about how it’d feel to trace her fingertips along the bone, suck, press down soft bites and kisses and-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I need to stop.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>But, she couldn’t stop. Not when her eyes trailed down her neck. The veins that popped out like a threat. The same thoughts rushed through her mind. She wondered how her skin would feel against her tongue, how Agatha looked with dark hickies as if Rio was some owner desperate to mark her property. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She isn’t yours to even mark. What the hell are you thinking? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The glasses were a rare sight. Agatha only wore them once in a while. Rio swore only Agatha knew how to make big frames work. Lilia tried, but everyone laughed and said she looked like an old kook with them. The older woman shunned them all for a week after that, but the glasses never made a return. </p><p> </p><p>And the worst of all? Her lips. Agatha Harkness’s fucking lips that moved with every annoying word she spoke. So vibrant, filled with life, almost begging for Rio to attack them with her own. And her eyes daring into Rio’s as if she was posting that photo solely for her. </p><p> </p><p>This was torture. Pure hell that Rio was putting herself through. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head, letting her thumb scroll to the next post that luckily eased the lust boiling within her. Instead, her teeth lifted off her knuckles as a tiny puff of air filled with humor pushed between her lips. </p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="Halloween" height="600" src="https://archive.org/download/received_1059515766067869/received_1059515766067869.png" width="397"/>
</p><p>Rio remembered the Halloween party vividly. Funny enough, it was Wanda who dragged her along as if she worked in the university herself. Rio had a plus one for the event, Wanda was adamant it was to be her. Which worked out because Rio’s co workers adored the red head and it took attention off of her. </p><p> </p><p>She remembered briefly seeing Agatha in the outfit. A rock star straight out of the seventies. Rio didn’t allow herself to linger long, slipping through the door, leaving an Irish goodbye to head home. She hated parties, but hated more how good Agatha looked in that outfit. </p><p> </p><p>But, Rio couldn’t hate the party. Not when Wanda had the time of her life or the bartender ended up giving her a few free shots. Lou Miller who Australian, tall with an attitude Rio instantly felt comfortable with. They even ended up exchanging numbers and Rio ended up becoming good friends with her. </p><p> </p><p>So no, Rio could not hate or dwell on that party. Especially seeing Lilia being in a photo. She always hated and avoided those. </p><p> </p><p>Rio continued on to the next photo and her heart swelled even larger. A tiny amused grin became warm. So soft she would nearly melt at the touch. </p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="BillyAgatha" height="600" src="https://archive.org/download/received_1160058468934243/received_1160058468934243.png" width="397"/>
</p><p>As much as Agatha gave that boy hell, acted as if he was an annoying nuisance- Everyone knew Agatha borderline adopted him like he was her own. If anything, William (Billy was becoming his name more these days or just Kaplan) seemed to be the light that shined in Agatha’s life. Not to say she was a miserable grump before he was hired, but she certainly became different in a good way when he did. </p><p>It wasn’t surprising she took time over the summer to help him become a better driver. Rio began to wonder what other adventures they went on and if the side she saw of Agatha tonight was a snippet into the soft natured person she could be. Through the rough exterior filled with sarcasm and insults, a wicked grin that threatened to annoy you till the end of time- </p><p>Rio felt as if she was wrong. Was Agatha more than just that? And was Rio really starting to crave figuring that out more? </p><p>No. She wasn’t, she couldn’t. And yet, she still scrolled.</p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaAnnounce" height="600" src="https://ia801907.us.archive.org/29/items/covidpost/announcement.png" width="397"/>
</p><p>Right, the nice Agatha was announced and introduced to them all. Rio remembered that night very well. Not just because she didn’t want to be there, but it was when Agatha and her first met. What started off as intriguing and flirtatious became the start of a feud that would last years between them. </p><p><br/>
She clenched her jaw, the smile fading as the reminder punched her in the gut. Agatha wasn’t going to continue to treat her like she did just before. It’d go back to the place they started. A feud between them, arguments and snarky comments. Rio would return to hating her even if she lusted after her as well. </p><p> </p><p>Shouldn’t Rio be happy this was a reminder for that? Rio should take a breath and become relaxed over it.</p><p> </p><p>So…why did she feel slightly disappointed?</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Whatever, one more post.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaCovid" height="600" src="https://archive.org/download/covidpost/covidpost.png" width="397"/>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered, the smile returning as she softly laughed to herself. </p><p>“The fuck are you wearing, Harkness?” She muttered to herself. </p><p>She wore a baggy flannel, shorts and boots with a ridiculously large cowboy hat to top it off. Agatha looked utterly ridiculous and Rio tried to figure out why the hell she was dressed like that. </p><p>Maybe it was Covid brain that had gotten to her. Lockdown did drive everyone insane. Not Rio, she wished the lockdown lasted forever. Being paid to stay at home? Being told to stay away from people? How could Rio ever hate that? It was her dream life and she missed it terribly at times. </p><p>However, Agatha seemingly was losing her mind during it or…was this just Agatha? Was she silly this way? Did she love being the most confusing woman ever? </p><p>And better yet, why did Rio care so fucking much? </p><p><em> Just..go home. </em>She told herself. </p><p>Rio exited the app, locking her phone after making sure her Spotify kept playing music. Once she was situated, she put the car in drive, pressing on the gas to take off out of the parking lot. </p><p>It wouldn’t be until later on, possibly her next visit, it’d occur to her how the store in the rearview was tainted. Anytime she’d step inside, her mind would soar straight to Agatha singing a few steps away. She’d look at the ice cream pints, wait for the woman’s commentary on every flavor. Plus insult the ones Rio chose for herself. </p><p>Grocery shopping would never be the same.</p><p>Parking lots would suddenly feel too empty. </p><p>Being alone in the car would become quieter than before. </p><p> </p><p>Overall, Rio’s life would never be the same. It already wasn’t the moment her eyes locked with Agatha’s. She thought about the woman way more than she realized, but now? Oh. It was different. Everything had changed and Rio hadn’t entirely realized it. </p><p> </p><p>She turned the volume dial up for her music to play a bit louder. A song she had listened to every now and then, mostly when it came on shuffle in one of her mega playlists on Spotify came into clarity. Use Somebody, King of Leon. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You know that I could use somebody…someone like you” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio mumbled the lyrics to herself, barely registering the meaning or how it happened to be the first song that played off shuffle. If she did realize it, she’d be too busy denying and cursing the universe for trying to say Agatha was never meant to be her enemy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness was the woman Rio couldn’t stand. She hated her, despised and avoided her at all costs. </p><p> </p><p><em> You are not going to fall for the fucking enemy, Rio.. </em>She said to herself. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head as she mumbled to the song, trying to shake off the memory playing in her mind as she drove down the road. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Remember when we were kids? Like, when we wished for something every shooting star that passed?” Wanda asked.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda and her were laying in the backyard after a day of moving furniture and boxes nonstop. Rio had just moved into her new home. A tiny cottage tucked away from society. A bit of a farther drive from the university, but it was worth it.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio slowly exhaled the smoke, passing the joint over to Wanda who happily took it from her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Yeah. When you used to wish for longer hair” Rio snickered. </em>
</p><p><em><br/>
</em> <em> Wanda chuckled.  </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> “It worked!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “No, you just didn’t get it cut for three years” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “It still worked,” Wanda shrugged, taking in a small inhale. As she held it in her lungs, she swiftly added. “You wished for the same thing on repeat and never told me what it was, you know?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio scoffed.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Duh. Then it’d never come true” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda laughed as she choked on the smoke through her exhale.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh, come on! We were kids, is it still the same wish or something?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Ugh,” Rio groaned. “Kind of. Maybe. I don’t know” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Tell me” Wanda pushed, holding the joint in the air from her. “Or you aren’t getting this back” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio rolled her eyes, muttering under her breath how annoying the woman was. But she simply started to hum a tune as if she had all the time in the world to hate.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Fineeee,” Rio drew out the word in an annoyed tone. “Maybe I’ve wished…or used to- Yeah, used to. I dont’ waste time wishing anymore-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You so do” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Do not” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Do to” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Do you want to know or not?!” Rio asked.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda surrendered, gesturing for her to continue on as she took another hit.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I guess..I don’t know, it’s stupid” Rio muttered, sitting up to run her hands through her hair. She held the strands back, tugging at her roots as she looked down. “I just..I love being alone, but-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Don’t want to die alone?” Wanda asked.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio puffed out a bit of air with a tiny shrug.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Just feel like I make enemies all the time, you know?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda pushed up on her elbows, holding the joint in front of her to take. Like it was her reward for opening up on what her truest wish was.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Hey, who knows..” Wanda shrugged. “Maybe you’re meant to experience the enemies to lovers trope” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio was taking a hit when she broke out in a strong laugh.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What?!” Wanda exclaimed. “It could be true!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Doubtful..” Rio said, turning her head over her shoulder with a low, “Those tropes are a headache. A disaster waiting to happen” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “And yet, sometimes the worst turns for the best,” Wanda said.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The redhead pushed herself up, their shoulders pressed together as she reached over to steal the joint back.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I wouldn’t rule it out,” She advised. “The world works in mysterious ways” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You and the universe bullshit..” Rio muttered. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Enemies to lovers, Rio. That’s your destiny. I can feel it in my bones” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio laughed.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You’re stoned. All you’re feeling is an order of Five Guys or Taco Bell right now” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Ooo,” Wanda’s eyes lit up with a lazy grin filled with an appetite. “Both sound so good”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Of course they do..” Rio snickered.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She held tight on the steering wheel, remembering the <em> “enemies to lovers” </em>trope conversation as if it was right before sitting with Agatha. But, Rio still took in a strong breath while chanting in her mind how ridiculous that was. Agatha wasn’t the enemy she was meant to be with. Not when it’d be three years of pure torture having to endure her. </p><p> </p><p>As she drove, her mind started to drift back into the music. Focus on each song and ignore the lyrics' meanings. Everything would be fine. Monday would come along, they’d go back to ignoring and hating one another. This night would be a blip, a fever dream, something that never happened. </p><p> </p><p>But, what Rio wouldn’t figure out until the next day? Her thumb had slipped on one of Agatha’s posts. When she rushed to exit the app, she brushed over the heart icon and liked Agatha’s post all the way from Covid. Rio was so frantic and quick to drive off, desperate to ignore her interest in getting to know Agatha more. </p><p> </p><p>The first Instagram post Agatha had ever posted was from years ago and Rio fucking <em> liked </em>it. Agatha would get the notification, figure out Rio borderline stalked her right after they parted. Rio had signed her death certificate and hadn’t even known it yet. </p><p> </p><p>She would be too busy getting in the house, rushing to bed to see the notification that appeared on her screen that night. A habit of her’s was to clear her notifications, ignoring everything until the next day. Rio would be greeted with her death certificate in the morning. She’d open her phone to check all emails, messages, any notifications she might’ve missed. </p><p> </p><p>The notification would be the most life threatening, stomach dropping, heart racing one she’d ever lay eyes on.. </p><p> </p><p>

</p><hr/><p>
<span>The sunrise slithered through the bedroom curtains, casting little golden streaks across the room. Rio’s eyes slowly flickered open to the light. Matched with Nicky sniffing her up and down, pawing at her leg with the unspoken request, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’d like to go outside, Mother” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slowly turned over, ruffling the hair on his head with a lazy smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Morning, bud. How’d you slee-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A yawn cut her greeting off, stretching her limbs and felt the bed shift as he launched off of it. His paws skidded down the hall, racing for the back door before she could finish her question. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pushed herself out of bed, always thankful for the boy who entered her life. He was the reason she was able to move on her worst days. Even through her darkest moments, his energy and life radiated through her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rubbed her eye while stepping down the hall, into the small kitchen to find him tapping at the glass screen as if Rio had kept him hostage for days. She scoffed with a little laugh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jesus, dude. Ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome? Why not fall in love with your captor instead?” She joked, unlocking and pushing the door open for him to fly out of. “Run along now” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With fire under his paws, he rushed out and ran into the yard. Rio had gotten a fence around her backyard the second he came into her life. It was a game changer to say the least. She was able to leave the door open for whenever he wanted to come back in, letting her drift off to start her day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was the thing about Rio, a curse she joked was set upon her. No matter the hour, if her eyes opened and body moved- She became restless. It’d be three in the morning and she’d end up packing her lunch for the day, taking a shower and getting dressed. Slumber never came easy to her. She wondered at times what it was like to have a full night’s rest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clicked the coffee maker on as she walked by, heading into the bathroom for her morning routine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The night before felt like a fever dream as it slowly trickled back to her. The memory of Agatha was fuzzy, how she found her in the ice cream aisle crying her eyes out. Then invited her to sit and eat their feelings together. It all felt surreal, foreign, as if she made it all up to cope with the idea of hating her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>How the fuck would that make sense?</span>
</em>
<span> Rio muttered in her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What didn’t make sense to her either? Possibly more than just that? Agatha being stood up as well. Rio couldn’t wrap her head around the idea of that happening. </span>
<em>
<span>Not a chance. </span>
</em>
<span>That had to have been a lie because- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Who would give up a chance to be with someone that hot?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With the toothbrush in her mouth brushing off her back molars- Rio froze. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Don’t think that. </span>
</em>
<span>Rio told herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio brushed her teeth harder to the point her gums subtly felt a pinch of pain. She was desperate to shake that thought away because, </span>
<em>
<span>no! </span>
</em>
<span>Rio hated Agatha. A simple two hour hang out session wouldn’t change that!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sure, yes, okay- Agatha was hot. That thought had always been there no matter how much Rio hated it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, the more the memories of the night before came into clarity..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh my god. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio spit out the toothpaste, rinsing her brush off while tipping back the water to swish. Her cheeks stretched just as wide as her lungs, mind racing as her heart sunk to the floor beneath her feet as she realized,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s hot. Like. Hot, hot. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s grin she gave before they parted ways burned in her mind. She felt the same energy seethe through her veins. How her lips looked so delicate, soft, warm to the touch. Her eyes were lazy with tiredness from the day and night’s events. Even through her exhaustion, she smiled at Rio like the woman was the sun peaking out of a cloudy day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t know what to do. Should she put in her resignation? That’d be a good start. Maybe she’d spend the morning apartment searching and give her place up to someone else. Honestly, she didn’t care if her savings would be drained by the end of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Escaping Agatha Harkness was the only answer possible. </span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Truthfully, Rio knew she’d never grow close to doing such a thing. The woman adored her job, students, the people she worked with (Minus a certain </span>
<em>
<span>someone). </span>
</em>
<span>She loved her home, the town she lived in, how her two closest friends lived five minutes away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So, as peaceful as an escape sounded- Rio wouldn’t dare make that move. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Besides, she wasn’t going to let Agatha win. If either of them were the one to jump ship, skip town- It should be her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I was here first..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio checked to make sure her coffee mug was being filled. Sometimes it took a few smacks against the machine to get it working. One day, she’d buy a new one. She just never had a reason to do so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t that she was cheap. Rio had made a decent living and savings for herself over the years. More so the reason stemmed from her special talent. Wanda had nicknamed her years ago,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Particular Procrastinator” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio remembered hearing Natasha break down laughing, agreeing with her partner up and down. She looked over confused, asking for an explanation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“You procrastinate only on certain things in particular” Wanda shrugged. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Everything besides work, more like” Natasha added. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio scoffed. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Bullshi-”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“You literally kept your mattress till your back was so sore you barely were able to stand up!” Wanda laughed. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Your laptop had a crack in the screen for years,” Natasha added. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh! Don’t forget her microwave barely cooked anything! Took ages to heat up a soft pretzel”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“And when she-”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Okay!” Rio yelled. “Point taken. Loud and clear, but..” She shrugged. “At least all my work is done before an hour till the deadline” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Natasha and Wanda both booed, sticking their tongue out while the other flipped her off. Rio snickered, sinking back in the couch with victory- Even if she was a procrastinator. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The steaming liquid poured into her coffee after she smacked it on the side a few times. Rio smiled to herself with a small,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“See? You’re still working” She mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Glancing outside to check on Nicky who was rolling around in the grass, Rio smiled softly. The warm sunny patch that Rio imagined felt good on his back would leave a mess all over his fur, but she didn’t mind. She always chose his happiness over frustrating messes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She then moved to find her phone on the counter, plugged into its charger. Rio scoffed, thinking how it was impressive she even remembered to charge it. Late nights or not, it was a bad habit to let her phone die twenty four seven. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio expected texts from Wanda and Natasha in their group chat, pestering her on the date and asking how it went. She already dreaded having to admit to being stood up, but hey- It’d get her an excuse to not let them make dating profiles or set her up on blind dates in the near future. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When the screen lit up, a few notifications were listed off. Random reels being sent to her, email articles that she didn’t care for, and as she expected- The group chat eagerly awaiting her updates. She didn’t have it in her to talk, not yet. Later in the day that’d be a hill she had to climb over. </span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The coffee maker beeped, signalling her cup was ready for her. She whistled a soft tune, sitting her phone down to stroll over. A tiny bit of milk, a small bit of sugar, she brought the burning liquid to her lips. Typically, she waited for it to cool off, but…after last night’s events? The day ahead? She didn’t care how it’d burn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hissed, squeezing her eyes shut as the seering sting ran over her tongue and down her throat. Rio shook her head, collecting herself before picking her phone back up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Emails would be the first app to open, making sure she didn’t miss anything important. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Next, Facebook to check her memories. Lilia loved tagging her in things, but today was empty. Another sigh of relief she wouldn’t have to be social more than her two friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead of ignoring the reels on Instagram, Rio decided to check them out. That’d settle Wanda’s harassing just a tiny bit. Enough to save her mentality and well being somewha-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Holy fuck. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio clicked the notifications when she saw the little icon that signalled someone requested to follow her. It’d be a bot or someone from high school who would be way too eager to reconnect. But no, her worst nightmare sat in the waiting room to be accepted. </span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>As if the words were in all capitals, bold, daring, life threatening and ready to kill Rio on the spot-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>
<em>“Motherhark has requested to follow you”</em>
</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio dropped her phone on the counter. Somehow remembering to gently place her mug down instead of letting it crash all over the floor. Her feet took two steps back, her palm pressed tight against her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>What the fuck?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>How did she-</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>There’s no way she knows I looked. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>SHE CAN NOT KNOW I LOOKED, RIGHT?!</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She felt sick to her stomach. The tiny sip of the bitter liquid swirling, ready to shoot back up as if it’d been rejected. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This couldn’t be real, no. Rio must’ve had to be still dreaming. That was the only explanation for this! She Googled it, made sure Agatha would have no idea she checked and stalked her profile like some creep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Wait..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A thought popped into her mind, the only answer that settled her fear- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She thought about my Instagram..</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Yes..yes! That’s it! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She wanted to stalk me just as I did with her- No. Nothing weird about us having the same thought. No. Nope. She’s the creep, not me. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio reached back out to pick her phone up, thumb hesitating over the reject button. Though as if she had a magnet under her skin, her phone was a fridge or a locker- She felt the screen press against her thumb and just like that-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness had followed and gained access to Rio Vidal’s Instagram.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>This is fine. Everything is fine. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No one would notice or say anything. Agatha would most likely be a nuisance and send her even more reels than Wanda did. That was that. She didn’t even have to follow her back. The interaction could be a one way street- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>You had to accept the follow though…so, is it still only one sided or-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No..” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She started to laugh, putting the phone down to pace across the kitchen tiles, sipping from the burning liquid that suddenly felt numb. Rio felt her thoughts screaming in circles around her. As if they were a bunch of little demons having a world war of their own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The first side was trapped in a deep state of disbelief, screaming out the words,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>This can’t be real. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What the hell did I just do? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Is..this is all a nightmare..it has to be, oh my g-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The other side was hard at work, rationalizing and trying to alleviate the situation. Rio was </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>No! No, it’s fine.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She followed me. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She invited me to hang out. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This is all Agatha, not me. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In the back of her mind was a soundtrack. A lingering tune that was an orchestra, enhancing and egging on the dramatic battle between her thoughts. She’d barely been awake for twenty minutes and the day felt long, never ending. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Block her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fix this before it’s too-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio had rushed back to her phone, hands shaking as she swiped the screen open. Her thumb tapped onto Agatha’s profile only to have the notification pop up above.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Late..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaText1” width=" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/04/28/FuckinOne.jpeg"/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Is this how being murdered feels? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jesus, don’t be that dramatic. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck my life..” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Whatever. This didn’t matter. Agatha texting her didn’t have to mean anything and furthermore, Rio was not required to offer a reply. Agatha wasn’t entitled to her attention. She was lucky enough Rio had (For whatever reason) accepted the follow request. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Why did she follow me?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The question started to itch her brain, scratching as it begged to dig up the answer. The delusional side of her wanted to believe Agatha simply craved being annoying. Maybe she got the wrong idea after the night before. It was all pure hope to save herself from the possible, biggest, complete and total embarrassing move she’d ever pull. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Like what you see..”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Those words slowly demolished her hope brick by brick, piece after piece. The deep tug in the pit of her stomach pulled tighter. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I made sure to not like anything..didn’t I?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Reviewing each post again felt dooming, but at the same time inevitable. Her fingers trembled as she tapped the screen, bringing her back to the familiar profile. No new posts, the same sight as the night before remained. She held her breath, clicking the selfie that choked her the first time and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The reaction remained the same. A chilling sense of desire, her taste buds tingling with the need to feel Agatha’s skin- Taste her lips and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, no, no. Stop it” Rio muttered to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her thumb aggressively swiped, flying down the posts until she saw the red heart bright as can be. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Like what you see..”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The four words echoed into the void of her soul. She felt her pulse beating through her, a screeching ring in her ears and Rio swore she could hear the blood flowing through her veins come to a stop. The birds outside, trees swaying in the breeze, all of it was silenced. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Who knew a red heart could feel so life threatening?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal had liked one of Agatha Harkness’s Instagram posts. Not a post from a year ago. Not two, not three, not four, but- </span>
<em>
<span>FIVE YEARS</span>
</em>
<span> ago. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>‘March 27th 2020’ </span>
</em>
<span>to be exact. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The Covid post where Agatha stood in a cowboy hat and boots. When Rio had smiled to herself with a shake of her head, wondering what on earth she was wearing. She liked it. Her thumb either slipped or she was drunk on exhaustion to register the action. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh..my..god” She muttered to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She had to fix this. Even if it meant talking to the woman who was bound to give her hell till the end of time. Rio figured Agatha would berate her to the grave over liking her first ever Instagram post. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>The first one. Fucking first..COULD’VE LIKED THE RECENT ONE AT LEAST!</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio screamed at herself silently, racing to open the chat she originally planned on ignoring. It wasn’t a surprise either Agatha hadn’t taken a millisecond to reply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaText2" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/04/28/FuckTwo.jpeg" width="397"/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At least one thing from this was worth it. Rio was remembering exactly why she couldn’t stand Agatha Harkness. Even if she seemed kind, gentle, warm and sympathetic- She was ready to use Rio’s most (Well, now second compared to the Instagram shit) embarrassing moment of her life against her.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And yet? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh no. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She gripped her phone, staring wide at the messages while a new thought joined the party in her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I can not actually like her teasing me..</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>There’s no fucking way. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No, I-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Another message from Agatha popped up, bringing her back from the edge of panic. The cliff edge Rio was preparing to jump off of left abandoned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Argue her. Be mean. Show her you don’t care. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded to herself, letting her thumbs work their magic. Well, she hoped that would be the case. </span>
</p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaText3" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/04/28/FuckThree.jpeg" width="397"/>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She had to block her. That was the only way to end this nightmare Rio was convinced she’d have to wake up from at some point. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, Rio continued to sip from her coffee, staring at Agatha’s profile dumbfounded by the new found thoughts in her mind. How part of her fucking </span>
<em>
<span>liked </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha teasing her. She couldn’t resist staring at the latest post. That stupid selfie that made Rio crave and envision horrible, disgusting, perverted things. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Why are you letting this happen?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio had zoned out to the point she didn’t notice how much time had passed until Agatha messaged her again, snapping the woman out of the daze she had fallen into. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaText4" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/04/28/FourFuck.jpeg" width="397"/>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my godddd!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She groaned, tilting her head back as she squeezed her eyes shut. Just when she thought the situation couldn’t possibly get worse, it does. Even more so how Agatha was waiting on the other side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio wondered if she was still in bed, leaning on her kitchen counter just as she was, on the couch or-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Stop thinking about what she’s doing while texting you, creep. </span>
</em>
<span>She told herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio muttered some curse words of annoyance under her breath. Once again, she decided replying was her only option. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>It is my only option. Not because I want to talk to her more…or anything. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>(Anddd, that was a lie!)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>
<em>
<span>Good. Don’t give her another answer. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled to herself, relief and pride hitting her when Agatha didn’t reply within a few seconds. Though, it was short lived and Rio should have been prepared for that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The notification appeared on her screen with words that didn’t just annoy her, but also made her heart skip a few beats. She felt the way her breathing staggered because of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaText6" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/04/28/SixFuck.jpeg" width="397"/>

</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, fuck this bitch. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course, why should Rio feel any amount or speck of surprise Agatha was using </span>
<em>
<span>blackmail </span>
</em>
<span>to her advantage?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Bet she’s included in the definition of that word. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Ignore her, don’t give her the satisfaction of it. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As if Agatha was hearing her thoughts from afar, reading her mind like a book- The next text popped up just before Rio was able to exit the chat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaText8" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/04/28/EightFuck.jpeg" width="397"/>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>We’d be a delicious combo- Oh no. No. No. NOOOO!</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, eyes shut tight. She smacked her thigh a few times as if it was her coffee maker, shaking it to drain all the liquid out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From a nightmare to a night terror, Rio was convinced she was trapped in one. Or, maybe she died and this was hell. Whatever her new reality was, it felt damning. Alarms were blaring in her mind, she swore she could see the red lights spinning for her to evacuate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I can not fall for her. I can’t.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>This is lust. Nothing more than just lust. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She opened her eyes, rereading the few messages back and forth. A bell rang in her ears. One that belonged to a high striker in an amusement park. Her realization was the sledgehammer, pounding downwards and hitting the thought above. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I have to confirm this is nothing. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>What? You can not possibly be debating hanging out with her again! </span>

<span>It’s the only way!</span>

<span>No, no. There’s other options and-</span>

<span>You can’t!</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She locked her phone, placing it back on the counter while her eyes flickered up to the imaginary camera in front of her. She felt like Jim from The Office, giving his well known deadpan stare that said,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>You’ve got to be kidding me.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio ran both her hands over her face, palms digging into her skin while fingers traced through the bed tangled hair. She slowly felt the weight of seeing Agatha on her again. Hating her was becoming more difficult by the second. How the fuck was this going to make that any easier?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The argument in her head had settled down, sizzling to a simple question Rio would be asking herself all day and night,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>What is wrong with me?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sat in the parking lot, trapped in her car she hoped wouldn’t open. Maybe she’d get lucky somehow and all four doors would be sealed shut. She’d simply shrug, mouth an </span>
<em>
<span>‘Oh well’ </span>
</em>
<span>before zooming off into oblivion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her escape thought was hopeless for the first ten minutes, but she felt hopes lift up as every second went by- It’d be possible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They ended up agreeing on a time for six PM. Rio being the punctual person she was- She had been ten minutes early to be on time. Agatha on the other hand unsurprisingly was now ten minutes late. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Two opposite ends of the clock, Rio could only hope that was another reason to hate her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She took a sigh, head tilted back while her eyes stared through the car's sunroof. The sky was cloudy, a grey doom that matched the energy this hang out was sure to be. The night before was two souls longing for emotional support. They had stumbled into one another and that was that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With the aftermath of being stood up fading away piece by piece, Rio told herself this would be different. They’d argue, banter, possibly even hit one another with baseball bats instead of the objects designated for such actions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Or, maybe they’d never get the chance to do so since Agatha still hadn’t shown up. </span>

<span>Wait..what? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio flipped her head down, eyes wide as she stared out the windshield. Had she truly wished in some form for Agatha to show up?  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Only because I want to confirm this is nothing. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yeah…that’s it. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>(No. It wasn’t)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t have a chance to dwell on the thought much longer. Her eyes drifted over to the familiar vehicle parking in the row ahead of her. Just a few spots away to her left. Rio sighed of relief and despair, undoing her seatbelt in hopes the car doors would magically be glued shut. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course, the door opened right up. A gate swinging wide, almost flying off the hinges with excitement for her to step on through. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shut the door with a bit of flair behind her. A flick of her wrist that said, </span>
<em>
<span>fuck you </span>
</em>
<span>to the car for working. She shook her head, muttering a few curse words incoherently while pressing the lock button. After making sure she had her wallet and phone, Rio spun around and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck me..” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Not that way (Yes that way).</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped out of her car with a chocolate donut held in her mouth</span>
<em>
<span>. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Suddenly I want to be a don- Don’t even finish that thought, idiot.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The denim black jacket draped over a familiar blue flannel she’d wear on Friday’s. Her hair was pulled back, barely held by the loose hair tie. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked so…</span>
<em>
<span>normal? </span>
</em>
<span>No. That wasn’t the word, but Rio was too dumbfounded to think of the correct one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was always polished. Her personality and teaching methods were not, but the outfits and signature design screamed a different side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From the pantsuits, trousers and button ups that always had a few undone. Even with the familiar flannel, Agatha was able to make it fancy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even if she looked more laidback than usual, Rio still felt her outfit wasn’t enough. The blue sweater that almost slipped off her left shoulder. Only part of her hair pulled back, still messy from her slumber. She wore her black jeans and a knock off brand to the Converse high tops, a memory hitting her as she glanced down at the pair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’m not a cheapskate, Wanda. I just don’t give a fuck when I can get the same ones for fifteen dollars” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“God. You’re so boring” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The memory of their interaction from a few weeks ago made her stomach flip. Would Agatha care about them? Was she someone who admired name brands over knock offs from Walmart?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck it. If she cares, I can hate her more. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio cleared her throat, striding through the parking lot to meet her. Agatha was busy chewing away, rummaging through what Rio assumed was her purse. She leaned in the passenger seat where Rio had sat hours prior. </span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Was Agatha thinking about that?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Did she already fill the vacancy as if Rio never existed?</span>
</p><p>
<span>And why the fuck did Rio care to know?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman leaned back up, slamming the door shut while glancing to her left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood with her arms crossed, holding them tight against her as if she could restrain the complicated feelings and never let them escape. But as Agatha’s smile grew wide, those blue eyes somehow shining with no sun in sight- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh. Why did I agree to this?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“‘Ere she is!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman’s words were muffled with the remaining crumbs of the donut in her mouth. Rio should cringe, find it repulsive, but instead-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Ha. Cute- No. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Took ‘ou long ‘nough” Agatha added.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, not bothering to point out how Agatha was late. She had a feeling that would be useless to dwell on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry, I don’t speak </span>
<em>
<span>donut</span>
</em>
<span>?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead of chuckling over the tiny joke or returning a humorous one of her own. Agatha’s jittery movements froze. Even her chewing came to a stop for a few seconds before they continued. Slow chomp after chomp, what looked like a rough swallow to finish it off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slowly smirked, arms folded against her own chest to mirror Rio’s stance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her voice was pitched in a teasing tone. Rio felt her heart skip a beat, anticipating words that were sure to damn her into a state of embarrassment.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The remainder of that donut was in my mouth before you got over here” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pointed out. It didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out where Agatha was going with this. Rio dug her nails into her palms, lips pulled back while she waited for the final bullet to hit her chest.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Were you watching me, </span>
<em>
<span>my little stalker?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fix this. Fix this. FIX IT!</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shifted on her feet from one side to the other. A weak scoff while her eyes rolled to avoid the narrowing eyes on her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“In your dreams” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took a second before she snickered. Eyes of her own rolled back and Rio cursed herself for watching. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Her every move is getting to me. God. I need to get laid so this stops. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>(Rio could sleep with every woman on the planet and Agatha would still make her crumble. Of course, she wouldn’t admit to that)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well then,” Agatha held her hand up to the building, tossing her back an annoying grin. “Shall we?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>No. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess,” Rio shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took the lead for them both, giving Rio access to watch her from behind all over again. How her hips swayed as if she knew to give the woman a show. Her head held up, confidence and power radiating for miles around her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hated it. She hated her. And she hated even more how Agatha opened the door, stepped aside with her arm swaying inward, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“After you, professor” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rolled her eyes, muttering a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha brushed her shoulder against Rio’s while walking ahead again. Rio wondered if it was on purpose, but forced her attention elsewhere. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The room was empty besides them and the worker at the counter. She scanned the posters of people destroying things with malicious grins. The sounds of music from down the hall with bottles of glass breaking echoed, but were covered up by Agatha’s voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, just the two uh..” She said, looking back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead of asking her, Agatha let her eyes roam Rio from head to toe. Almost as if the move was intentional, looking to make the woman shiver under her stare. Rio swore too it burned red lasers and left marks beneath her clothes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’d say large”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Did she just pick my size for me? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>And why is that kind of…hot?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The worker nodded, disappearing into the back room to grab what Rio assumed was the jumpsuits of protection people were wearing in the photos. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Think I’m fat?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tall,” She said, leaning an elbow on the counter with her palm propping her chin up. “I learned the hard way their suits run short” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not that tall. You’re like what? An inch shorter than me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When I’m not wearing heels that make you look tiny, mhm” She hummed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before Rio was able to visualize the memory of her heels that threatened to shatter the university floors, the worker popped back up with neon green jumpsuits in his hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright,” He smiled. “Gloves and jumpsuits here. You guys are in room seven. Right down the hall you’ll see our helmet selection and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smacked the counter twice with a wink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks kid,” She said. “I’ve got it from here” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He stammered a few times before giving up and sitting back down. Agatha whistled as she handed Rio her gear, leading them to the hallway of different rooms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, but not over the ugly color of the gear in her hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You didn’t have to cut the poor guy off” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Maybe she did. That helps me hate her. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m excited,” She shrugged, smirking over her shoulder with a raspy, “Punish me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Nevermind. She should not have done that. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The number seven was spray painted on the door like a jail cell. Rio wasn’t sure if she was a fan of how it looked either. The door was heavy, slid open and shut like they were two inmates stepping into their doom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I swear. If we get stuck, I’m killing myself…and her. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio followed Agatha by pulling on the jumpsuit over her clothes. It was pretty simple, but the zipper on the back decided to put up a fight. Her eyes flickered over to Agatha who was grabbing their helmets, seeing she had managed to secure the back with ease.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>How experienced is she with this shit?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She grumbled a few insults at the zipper under her breath, wrists growing sore from trying to pull it up. Though what made her wish the pain would’ve stayed at the forefront? The familiar electric shock trembled through her body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your shades of green are nicer, that’s for sure”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha spoke so casually as she pushed Rio’s fingers away. As if this was their normal and she helped Rio get dressed a million times before. Rio heard the zipper fly up with ease, Agatha stepping back as swiftly as she appeared. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Jesus. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What uh…what do you mean?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She managed to break through the aftermath of her shock to ask. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha picked up the gloves, pulling on the left before her right. That smirk Rio swore hadn’t left at all stayed present. She then shrugged as if her words were obvious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your wardrobe is ninety-nine percent dark green” Agatha pointed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh” Rio replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh? That’s it?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed the motorcycle helmet, flipping it upside down to hold the straps on each side. Her smirk finally faded away and Rio felt as if she could take a breath. That was until she realized what it had been swapped for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She felt smacked by the memory of the night before, remembering every piece of it well,</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha smiled, head tilted back against the seat and oh hell- Rio swore the look made her feel tipsy as if she downed a bottle of jack. The woman looked so content. A lazy smile that Rio never had access to before. She was used to vicious smirks, exaggerated grins everytime she managed to make Rio storm off. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Not whatever this was, but…what Rio knew? She loved and hated it more than words can say. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Not a bad thing” Agatha assured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>That smile is worse than any other look she owns. </span>
</em>
<span>Rio swore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman forced her attention to the gloves followed by the helmet, determined to focus into rage over whatever the hell Agatha gave her. Butterflies? Flustered? Disgust?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yep. The third one. Has to be. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And as if the universe had it out for her. Almost as if it was desperate and fed off of her embarrassment more and more, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fucks sake..why is this shit so stupid?!” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The helmet knocked around her head as she struggled with the buckle. Agatha had made it look so easy just like the zipper on her back. Rio actually felt hope it’d be simple, but no…why would it be?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, stepping over as her fingers recharged the voltages within Rio’s veins.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here, let me do it..” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s brain was now full of glitches, lungs stripped of oxygen, every limb in her body went numb or didn’t exist anymore- Rio didn’t know which. In that moment, it was Agatha. She was in her orbit, close enough to wrap arms around or push away. Rio truly preferred the second (She didn’t). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked through her cloudy shield, the glass clearly hadn’t been cleaned in ages. Rio didn’t even want to think if the rest of the helmet was ever washed. If she walked out of here with lice though? That’d be a perfect reason to resent Agatha Harkness for eternity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well? Ready to rage, professor?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>God, you have no idea..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t say anything. Instead, she stormed past her to (Almost) break the door down. She heard Agatha’s little snort behind her, but luckily it was drowned by the blaring music through the speakers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The tail ending of Dragula by Rob Zombie bounced off the walls. Rio felt her anxiety ease for a moment. She grew up with her father blasting those songs through the car speakers. Her small body flew in the air with each bump and turn, hair flying as she giggled with every word they screamed together. It was a beautiful memory, one that warmed her heart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She never thought that memory, song, feeling would ever be increased. That was until her head turned over her shoulder, seeing Agatha rocking out with her head banging back and forth. She picked up the baseball bats, lips moving as she chanted the chorus, holding out the one for Rio to take. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And suddenly, Rio hated how Rob Zombie just got ten times better. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The song ended just as Rio took the bat, silence filled the void for three seconds before the brutal guitar of </span>
<em>
<span>‘Limp Bizkit - Break Stuff</span>
</em>
<span>’ welcomed them to the room with spray paint covering the wall, glass bottles and wooden boxes. A few old style television boxes with half broken laptops on desks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha flipped her bat in the air with a flourish, lifting it to her right before bringing it down to crash into the television screen. A scream followed along, glass shards decorated in the air and scattered across the floor. Rio leaned to the side with her arm in the air, shielding herself from the sudden explosion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wanted to hate this. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</em>
<span>Rio wanted to feel more annoyed by the second. But as her eyes opened back up to see Agatha smiling like a fool, her laughter contagious over the music as she started to scream the lyrics like it’d be her last words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s..oh my-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“C'mon Green Witch!” Agatha yelled over the music, flashing her wide grin over. She gestured with her bat to the laptop on the desk. “Hit that shit like it's all you wanna’ do!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked over then back at Agatha with a small grin of her own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So like it's you?!” Rio yelled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If that's what you're into” She winked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course…walked myself into that one.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She took a step forward to the desk, clearly hesitant to smash the device into pieces. Agatha must’ve sensed it or maybe Rio wore it, but she walked over to stand across from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s been pissing you off?” She yelled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked up, not struggling to reply, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. Rio wondered if she realized she was being serious or not. Regardless, Agatha nodded and pushed the laptop across the desk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then think of me, honey!”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>It’s been hard not to..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stepped back with her arms folded, leaning against the wall with her smirk never failing to disappear. Rio took in a deep breath, looking back at the laptop while Agatha was on her mind. If you told her a few days ago to stand in a rage room, think of Agatha while smashing devices into pieces- She’d be happy to!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio would think about the cactus she gifted. How she changed the rules overnight to switch classrooms closer to her own. She’d think of their first meeting when her hopes were lifted only to be crushed by Agatha’s insulting demeanor. Every little thing Rio would think of didn't match to what the thoughts were now.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>All she could think about now was the polar opposite. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She thought about Agatha’s smirk no longer pissing her off. It made her stomach flip, cheeks darken a shade of red while she ignored the most embarrassing feature- How her cunt burned and threatened to soak through her boxers (She still wasn’t admitting to that and never would). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The way Agatha now made her laugh, the lazy smile that killed her the night before and just in the parking lot. Those insults she once hated, now she was growing adoration for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hated everything. How Agatha was growing on her like moss as if she was a tree unable to stop or resist what was happening to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio took in a deep breath, listening to the lyrics through the speakers pierce her ears, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“You better watch your back because I’m fucking up your program” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And god, how real those lyrics were. Agatha was fucking up everything between them and in Rio’s life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I hate her. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a loud yell, the bat lifted in the air and came crashing down. She smashed the laptop nearly in half, flattening the middle between both sides. Agatha’s laughter followed the destruction, clapping her hands as she yelled, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s what I’m talking about! Glad I can be of service!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I hate you!” She yelled back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha only grinned wider, lifting her bat in the air like it was one of those Star Wars swords (Whatever they were called, Rio had no idea). Rio slowly smiled like the devil herself, wondering how she knew they’d end up fighting this way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She lifted her own to mirror Agatha’s stance. Both staring each other down before yelling a loud,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“HA!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In sync as they smashed the bats together. They started to circle the desk, laughing as they kept trying to poke the other with the end, but either side held their own defense well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“YOU’RE SO ANNOYING!” Rio screamed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“OH, SHUT UP! WE ALL KNOW YOU LOVE IT!” Agatha laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“YOU WISH!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I KNOW YOU WISH I ANNOYED YOU MORE!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“YOU COULDN’T POSSIBLY DO SUCH A THING WHEN YOU HOLD THE WORLD RECORD FOR BEING INSUFFERABLE!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“AWE! THAT’S SO KIND OF YOU TO SAY, HONEY!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha dodged to her left as Rio rounded to her side of the desk. The movement took Rio by surprise. Somehow she lost her balance lunging forward, her feet tripping as she stumbled into the wall. Her helmet smacked against it first, shoulder crashed while her knees gave out beneath her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit, Rio!” Agatha called out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No humor was in the woman’s tone. Just panic and worry as she ran over. The bat was tossed aside, her knees cracked so hard Rio somewhat heard it over the music. If her mind wasn’t so overwhelmed with the sudden fall, she would’ve made an old person joke about Agatha’s knees (Even if she was the older one herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked her eyes a few times, adjusting back to the light and Agatha beside her. Her hands were roaming down her arms and legs, checking for any glass that may have pierced the jumpsuit. The woman looked terrified out of her mind and for some reason? Rio knew it wasn’t about herself. She wasn’t worried about feeling guilty for moving aside and allowing Rio to fall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s worried about me..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just as Rio came back to clarity, the adrenaline of the initial crash came down- She registered the song above. Her lips curled up into a tiny laugh. She hadn’t heard the song in ages, but </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>- Was it a damn thing of irony as she stared at Agatha beside her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>‘Miley Cyrus - 7 Things’</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her little cousin had the biggest obsession for the singer. Rio used to drive her everywhere and found a love for the songs as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nice swing you had there” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha spoke before Rio was really able to think about the lyrics. Part of her was thankful for not only that, but Agatha’s look of fear settling down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, starting to push herself up. Agatha didn’t hesitate to grab her arms, guiding her up to be steady on her feet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come on!” She said over the music. “Let’s get out of here before you hurt yourself again” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bullshit! We just got here!” Rio argued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was taking a step to the door when she turned. No smile, no joking demeanor. She wore seriousness laced with confusion and surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You still want to..after that?!” She yelled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Only fuels my ambition to break more shit with you on my mind, Harkness!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, that shit eating grin wider than before as she moved to pick their baseball bats back up. She passed the one back to Rio, winking with the words, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Game on, professor!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Game on. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>About an hour later, they stumble out of the room with laughter dying down between them. Their ears were ringing from the music and every piece of destruction they caused. The muffled silence was a beautiful thing for Rio. She hated when overwhelming noises went on for too long. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took her helmet off with ease, but laughed when she saw Rio fumbling with her’s all over again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“C’mere, helmet head” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha curled her finger and as if it was a spell being casted, Rio’s hands dropped as her feet dragged across the floor to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman tilted her head back, shivering as Agatha’s fingers grazed the skin beneath her chin, making RIo wonder how it’d feel for her fingers to wrap around her throat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh my god, stop being a perv-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The helmet lifted off her head, hanging loosely on Agatha’s fingers. Agatha’s next movement caught Rio off guard harder than her fall had. It was worse than being found sobbing in the ice cream aisle or even the embarrassment of being stood up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s left hand lifted up, fingers tracing down her jawline as her eyes trailed along with them. Rio held her breath, eyes wide as she felt fear hold her hostage. She was a statue beneath Agatha’s touch. Like the woman before her was medusa. Instead of her eyes, it was her fingers able to turn one into stone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio wondered if Agatha could hear her heart pounding. Did she think a thunderstorm was raging through her? Rio wouldn’t be shocked if she was. She felt her blood run cold, not from hatred- just fear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was terrified of how close they were. Petrified of Agatha's touch, a simple gaze, how her breath was so close she could feel the chill from it against her lips. Every little thing was overwhelming her and suddenly- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I have to resign before Monday..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s still worried about the fall I took. That’s it. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>There is nothing else about this. Get out of your head, idiot. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was wearing a helmet” Rio managed to say, but her voice wasn't as rough as she wanted. “I’m fine” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>ANDDDDD, THAT WAS A LIE!</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes shot away. She looked at RIo like a child who had been caught in the candy jar when she shouldn’t have been. The woman visibly swallowed, forcing a little smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah..right”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her voice was weak, vacant of any humor or the usual tease lined up behind it and Rio started to think words that shouldn’t exist. Not when it was Agatha related.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Wait..was she not thinking about- She must’ve been. She couldn’t be thinking about kiss-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well,” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed as she pulled away and </span>
<em>
<span>fuck,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio missed it instantly. She felt cold without her touch, watching the woman walk across the hall to hang up the helmet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This was all only because she’s touch deprived, that’s it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nothing about Agatha </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>(</span>
<em>
<span>Everything</span>
</em>
<span> about Agatha)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Turn around, let me get the zipper before you get in a fight with that too” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Wait, what? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio spun on her heel, hating how Agatha was most definitely a fucking witch. Why did she just cave into her demand? It had to be a spell. A curse Rio would follow every word she said from now on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The zipper was pulled down, Agatha’s fingers pushing the texture off Rio’s shoulders. She rushed to take over from there, not letting her go any further before she exploded out of emotion and desire in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They both moved in silence after the two close interactions…well, maybe three if you count the fall Rio took as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha sighed. “That felt good, didn’t it?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio glared. Agatha snickered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The worker had disappeared from the counter, both silently thankful to leave their gear and head out to the parking lot. Rio this time took the lead to push the door open, holding it for Agatha to walk out from behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, maybe the fall wasn’t great. But, </span>
<em>
<span>mentally </span>
</em>
<span>it felt good, no?” She asked, quickly adding, “After being stood up, it was some nice therapy”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio almost questioned what she meant, completely forgetting the Tinder date she was supposed to go on. Her entire weekend had been taken up by Agatha. The woman lived in Agatha’s mind more than ever before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>This is terrifying..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess I’ll…give you that” She shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The closer they got to Agatha’s car, Rio’s initial plan grew closer. She wanted to leave the second she could. Give Agatha a cold shoulder, Irish goodbye, forget any of this happened by Monday. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, as they stepped closer to Agatha’s car…Rio felt her heartstrings tugging her mind back. They grew stronger, shifting the organ to the front lines of all her guards that would shield her from Agatha Harkness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio knew she was losing it with the idea swimming in the sea of her thoughts. Tidal waves crashing, whirlpools swirling out of control to the point of a vicious storm of their own. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Don’t say it. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shoved her hands in her pockets, lips pulled back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Do not. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood up a bit taller, tongue swiping the inside of her cheek slowly, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>DON’T FUCKIN-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey uh, do you want to go grab a drink or something? I’m..I’m not doing anything after this, so-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit” Agatha muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Told you not to do it..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman spun around, the phone in her hand seemingly a device that created a panicked look on Agatha’s face. She looked up from the screen, double checking it before taking a frustrated, defeating sigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I gotta’ go” She rushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh uh,” Rio brought a hand to rub over the nape of her neck, tugging a few of the tiny roots to create a pinching sensation. “Right..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha barely said a word. She rushed a few ones that Rio somehow managed to understand. A quick jumble of,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know. We forget this by Monday. Same old shit, right. Bye” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her tone was short, leaving Rio stunned as she watched the vehicle fly out of the parking lot. She watched her disappear down the road. Agatha flew away as if she never existed a few steps ahead of her in the first place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Why would she want to get drinks with you?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This was just so her stupid coupon, thing, whatever didn’t go to waste. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You hate her. She hates you. That’ll never change. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed the lump in her throat, kicking the tiny pebbles as her feet carried her to the car in defeat. As she fell into her driver’s seat, slamming the door shut and secluding herself from the outside world- That’s when everything hit her all at once. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She felt the stinging in her eyes, stupid tears threatening to coat her cheeks. Her palm lifted to press over her lips, holding her breath as much as she could so the sobs wouldn’t win. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Why did I ask?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Better yet..why did I agree to any of this?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck off, Harkness..” She whispered to herself.  </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had floored it out of the parking lot the second her Blink camera sent her the front door notification. She figured it was a late Amazon delivery or just a car driving by. But, when she saw the shadow figure sitting on her front porch steps- She knew exactly who it was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her car swung into the driveway, coming to an abrupt stop as her head dipped to see the boy sulking into himself. She turned the engine off, shoulders dropped with a low, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman grabbed her purse and phone, jumping out of the car to meet him where he stayed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not good?” She asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The boy looked up, eyeliner streaks from the tears smudged over his cheeks. A few little gasps were choked as he shook his head. No words were needed between the two. Agatha gestured her finger in the air, stepping around him to unlock the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy had become Alice’s teaching assistant early last year. Somehow though, he managed to drift over to Agatha and she had taken him under wing. This wasn't the first time he sat by her doorstep with tears in his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The first time he did, Agatha didn’t know what to do. It was over a fight with his mother and he needed a shoulder to cry on. If anyone knew that would be his move, they’d tell him to stay clear and never do such a thing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, Agatha was somewhat happy he did. She didn’t mind being a mentor of sorts. The company to keep around was nice as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sit,” She ordered, but her voice was soft. “I'll grab you something” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hm?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned around before entering the kitchen. His voice was small, body fragile as his limbs shook and he held onto himself.  Truly, he didn’t need to say anything or ask. Agatha knew him well enough to know what he wanted, more so needed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can..” He held his breath for a moment. “Can I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, you didn't just think I was telling you to sit. Did you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She asked, pointing over her shoulder down the hallway where the living room sat at the end. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You should know the meaning of that was you're crashing on the couch tonight. Now, go” Agatha directed, disappearing into the kitchen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She heard his footsteps patter down the hallway, little sniffles created their own echoing trail. Agatha thought about chasing down the boy who most definitely broke his heart. This had been a battle for months now. A friend of his had flirted, showed signs of wanting more and constantly crushed him over and over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Little twink. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy was head over heels about the boy as well, always making excuses to hang out and find ways to see him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was in the middle of filling up a glass of water when she froze, a thought breaking into her mind like an intruder,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Just like Rio..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She aggressively turned the water off, nearly smacking the cup down on the counter. This wasn’t about her stupid fucking crush on the woman. Tonight was about the emo boy on her couch, a wreck of tears and sorrow. But as she grabbed the package of Oreos, popping one into her mouth- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>He’s just like me with this shit..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Maybe she had to kick him to the curb, save him from pining over someone for years like she had been doing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m out of your seltzer shit,” Agatha said as she stepped into the living room. “Water and Oreos will have to do”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hated any drink that was seltzer, but Billy lived off the stupid things. Usually, she had a stash in the pantry for him. But, he had finished the last one the last time he was at her place. Agatha was supposed to grab more at the store, but obviously someone in particular had distracted her from doing so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Agatha..” He said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His knees were to his chest, arms locked around with small sniffles. She placed the cup and package down on the coffee table, plopping on the couch beside him. Silence stretched for a few moments between them. Agatha finished chewing down her second Oreo before taking a sigh,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It isn't you..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She moved her elbow on the back of the couch, head resting against her hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I just don't get it” He said, voice trembling. “I really…we get along and we were flirting and all the signs are there and-” He scoffed. “It’s like..so close..so fucking close and I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sometimes, life is shit. It misdirects and you just gotta’ roll with it” Agatha shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But what if I'm tired of rolling with it?” He asked, looking over with exhaustion covering his entire soul. “It’s getting worse now. He..he acts like he hates me in public with our friends. We’re entering an </span>
<em>
<span>enemy ark</span>
</em>
<span> to disguise our </span>
<em>
<span>almost could be </span>
</em>
<span>one”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Ouch. That hits close to home. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Obviously, Agatha couldn’t open up about how well she </span>
<em>
<span>truly </span>
</em>
<span>understood every word he said. Each syllable, letter, all of it hit her like darts targeting the bullseye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you doing this?” She asked. “Why do you keep putting yourself through the damn thing?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Are you asking him or yourself?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because..” He sighed. “I just want it to be him, Agatha. I- I only think about him, I have stupid dreams and it’s like we laugh together and I think this is it, we can be more, and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He started to choke on his words, gasping for air as he shook his head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What is wrong with me? Am I not enough or-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shushed him while reaching out. She pulled him into her embrace with one arm, feeling his sobs shake every limb that made him his skinny being. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Can I kill this kid? Then he wouldn’t be putting himself through this.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wanna’ be like you..” He muffled into the flannel shirt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back, forcing him to sit up so they were back to eye level. She narrowed her stare, lips frowned while shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re strong, you’re smart like..you’d never put yourself through this!” He said. “I’m weak. I can’t stop myself and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Jesus, kid. You have no idea. You are like me, more than you will ever know. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, holding her hand in the air for him to stop. He was silenced instantly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She started, not knowing where to go with it. How could she? Agatha was doing the same fucking thing and had no idea how to stop herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sometimes the stupid Nicholas Sparks crap, shit show infests us” She said. “It’s shitty, sappy, sickening bullshit that organ in our chest wants-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You mean love, right?” He asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ew” She cringed. “But yeah, whatever you want to call it”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was happy to see his little smile lift. A tiny puff of air that was a ghost of a laugh came from him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We both know logic can only take us so far” Agatha added. “Science hasn’t created a pill to help that-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, technically-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not talking that crap. This is Nora Roberts territory. Not Stephen King-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you comparing mentally ill people to Stephen King characters?” Billy asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha held her hands out to both sides, eyes wide as she shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Am I wrong?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He rolled his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s offensive, Agatha”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, what’s offensive is that little </span>
<em>
<span>fag</span>
</em>
<span> leading you on and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jesus, Agatha!” He groaned. “We talked about that word”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay? And I’m not in a gay bar surrounded by your little friends to offend” She shrugged. “Also, I’m going to insult that nasty boy of yours. I don’t like him and you know it” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He shook his head, muttering how unbelievable she was, but deep down? Billy adored her for it and Agatha knew it. The boy sat back, hands covering his face as his head tilted behind. A loud groan exhaled before silence sat between them again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you still have that rage room thing?” He asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The memory of not even an hour before waved its warm hello. She heard Rio’s laughter in her mind, the smile wide as how those brown orbs sparkled when she touched her up close. The hour had flown by faster than any hour of her lifetime. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha never wanted to leave that room. She never wanted to leave Rio’s side. When they walked out to the parking lot, the impending doom was a portal she stepped through. Rio had been saying something behind her back. Most likely an insult or her chance to make a quick escape. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>No. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The words she spoke were definitely about Monday. Rio had been a broken record, saying the order on repeat that put Agatha's heart through the shredder every single time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Maybe Billy crying on her front porch steps made him her savior from hearing that painful speech once more. Agatha wasn’t sure if she could stomach it after being with her. Billy’s words hit hard, they were painfully true. Worse than Agatha could imagine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>We get along. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>We laugh. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She clearly is flustered when I flirt. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Why can’t we just fucking do it?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m not enough for her. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s way too good for me to ever have. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I couldn’t treat her how she deserves. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Maybe it’s all for the best.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you forget about it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>About Rio? Never.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha flipped her head back, eyes wide as she struggled to figure out what he was asking. Her thoughts still bounced like jumping beans, flip flopping at a rapid pace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Forget what?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He tilted his head to the side, eyes narrowed in on her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The rage room- Have you not been listening again? I know you hate Nora Roberts, but-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes! Yes, sorry uh- Had to think about it. You know Nora Roberts, what that wicked woman does to me”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy scoffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right. She only wrote some of the best books imaginable with pissing specifically </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> off” He argued. “It’s not that you have the </span>
<em>
<span>worst</span>
</em>
<span> shopping addiction or anything”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her jaw dropped, hand over her heart with a sharp gasp,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you not benefit from my shopping sprees?! I dare say, that gay little wardrobe of yours has excelled since meeting me” She stood up, brushing the Oreos crumbs off her shirt as she muttered, “Not to mention, saved you from those horrendous khakis” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, come on!” He laughed. “I looked adorable in them!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your definition of adorable and mine hold entire different meanings” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shocker there..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She smirked his way before finding the local pizza shop’s menu on the coffee table. In the mess of magazines, books and random puzzle pieces it laid- never needing to be used from how the shop knew her by name, but it was the principal of it. A routine and tradition that must be followed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here,” She tossed the paper in his lap. “Find us something good to watch, order whatever- I’ve got cash”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, Agatha. I’ll pay, I intru-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha held her head up high as she exited the room, singing a loud,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“LALALA! I CAN'T HEAR YOUUUU” </span>

</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She heard his laugh, smiling softly to herself for being able to pull him from the tears. Even if it was only momentarily he was able to breathe, better than not having a second at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shut the bathroom door behind her, letting go of a breath she hadn’t even realized had been held in. Her hands rested on the edge of the sink, head hanging low as if she could let the thoughts fall into the drain below. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>How Rio’s smile was bright. </span>
</p><p>
<span>How Rio’s laugh was contagious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>How Rio’s way of keeping Agatha on her toes, going head to head with her sarcastic wit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio. Rio. Rio. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Three fucking years, a stupid mistake Agatha still dwelled on from their first meeting. Her mother always said people would see the bad in her one way or another. She also reminded Agatha of how evil, cruel, a fuck up she truly was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was all proven horribly true the first night she laid eyes on the beautiful woman.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“This usually work for you?” Rio gestured between them. “Just…insulting someone off the bat?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha clicked her tongue, head tilting to the side as she tapped her fingers against the wine glass. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“What? Are you not like other girls?” The woman asked. “Don’t like to be brought back down to earth a little bit?”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio laughed, rolling her eyes as she shook her head. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“You don’t even know who I am to be making the call if I need to be brought back down to earth to begin with” She argued.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I know ‘em when I see ‘em” Agatha shrugged. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The memory of their first meeting haunted her with every glare, every argument, every insult tossed like a hot potato back and forth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>God, why did you have to say that? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She had asked herself that for three years, always trying to correct her wrongs, but failing to do so at every turn. How could she play nice twenty four seven when Rio never bothered to try herself? Gifting her a cactus, poking the bear to make her growl louder, talking Lilia into moving to a classroom just down the hall to annoy her more-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Why do you keep putting yourself through the damn thing?”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The question she had just asked Billy bit her in the ass. Her own mind questioning herself on why she did this. It’d hurt even worse now knowing how good they could have had it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If Agatha wasn’t a horrible human being.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she wasn’t vile and evil. </span>
</p><p>
<span>If only her language wasn’t insults.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’d be the best fucking thing that ever happened to me..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” Billy yelled. “Are we doing garlic knots?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She cleared her throat, rolling her shoulders back while she turned her head over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No shit, Sherlock Holmes! And, ooo! Why don’t you consider pizza from the pizza shop as well while you’re at it?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He never responded, probably too busy rolling his eyes and apologizing to the worker if he heard Agatha on the phone (He did). It gave Agatha time to turn her head to the mirror, seeing the mess of a woman covered in self pity and despair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Monday was around the corner. She just had to survive her first Monday back and fall into the numb habit of continuing on with hating Rio Vidal. Then maybe things would feel lighter than they were right now. She knew well though, no more hanging out one on one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The time they had was good. Like a snack so delicious, you mindlessly could eat the whole bag. Agatha couldn’t just close the wrapper and place it on the shelf. She was an addict. One who had to ditch the chips all together…ditch </span>
<em>
<span>Rio, </span>
</em>
<span>completely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded to herself, swallowing the lump in her throat,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I won’t even acknowledge her come Monday. </span>
</em>
<em>
<span><br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Nope. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio Vidal doesn’t exist as far as I’m aware.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Even through her tiny pep talk, a plan that’d feel impossible to go through with- But somehow, she’d manage to do so. There was one question Agatha had asked herself for three years and counting, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Why can’t I hate her like she hates me?</span>
</em>

<p>“And please remember, no exceptions or excuses for tardiness over the next few classes! My door will not be locked, but you will get a mark taken off your grade”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Muttered words and hushed groans echoed through the room. Rio scoffed as she added an amused,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know! How dare I care about you getting your or better yet, your parents- money's worth of learning..” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few students chuckled as they gave Rio a soft goodbye while the others stormed out with no word to offer. She forced a small grin, waved to the students who adored her more than the rest, but once the classroom door shut and Rio was left the last man standing?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She exhaled a long breath, dropping in her desk chair with hands pressed over her face. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Fuck.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It had been a long week. A painful five days that felt never ending. That feeling was foreign to her. Rio loved her job and at times, the semester felt like two seconds leaving her to wish for more. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, this time around? The weekend couldn’t come soon enough. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Monday morning had been the start of the worst week of her life. Five days had gone by achingly slow. Her entire routine was tossed out the window. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It all started with walking to her classroom Monday morning, her usual routine of being on the phone with Wanda before they went on with their busy day. They would discuss their plans, make a date for drinks for Friday night. That part of her routine was there like clockwork. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, what was missing? Better yet, <em> who </em>was missing?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Fucking Harkness.. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Typically Agatha would tease her from behind in the parking lot (They always arrived at the same time on Mondays. The only day Agatha wasn’t running late) while Rio would be on the phone, hearing Agatha mimic her words. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Yeah, yeah..I know,” Rio sighed. “I’m just- Do we have to go for drinks? Why can’t we just bury ourselves on my couch or yours?” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Wanda scoffed, but Rio didn’t hear her response. Instead her ears focused into the voice behind her.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Oh! How can I possibly leave my plants alone?!” Agatha faked a southern accent (Rio was never sure why that was the common one she used, but whatever). “They must be accompanied at all times. Good golly, I’d say they’re a society of my very own!” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Jesus, hang on-” Rio muttered before spinning around. “The sun has barely risen and you’re already on my nerves-” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Aren’t I always, sugar?” Agatha smirked.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Rio grunted, storming off as she muttered how annoying she was under her breath.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She had grown accustomed to the unbearable woman on her tail. The sudden absence, disturbance in routine left Rio looking over her shoulder, waiting for Agatha to jump out from behind a corner or out of thin air. But alas, she had been left with the same thing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No sound.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not a peep. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just an empty space behind her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maybe Agatha was late, that was common. She always ran behind schedule. Her students were more prepared than she ever would be. But as the days progressed, Rio noticed a shift in Agatha’s dynamic with her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She wouldn’t offer a teasing grin. No fingers wiggled in the air with an exaggerated mouthed, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Call me”  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If Rio happened to see her in the hallway, Agatha would quickly shield herself or dodge her before their eyes were even able to connect. Rio almost felt as if she was a nuisance and their dynamic became the reverse. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> This is what you’ve always wanted.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio told herself those words on repeat. She tried to think about how she didn't have to endure Agatha’s antics, be chased from the parking lot to her classroom, feel those piercing blue eyes watching her every move. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha was leaving Rio the hell alone like she had told her to do for three years now. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> This is what you’ve always wanted.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not to mention, Rio’s other command had been followed like an order. A strict obligation for the past weekend to even happen. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> This weekend never happened.  </em>
</p>
<p>And just as she demanded, the weekend seemingly ceased to exist. It was almost as if Agatha and her had made a pact to never acknowledge the other again. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Isn’t that even more than you asked for? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few knocks on her classroom door snapped her back awake. She hadn’t fallen asleep, only sunk into the pit of despair over anything else. A daze that only involved Agatha Harkness. Which wasn’t a shocker with how often Rio had drifted off to that place in her mind. The corner tucked in the back, cobwebs and darkness eliminated. Now a shining bright light with just a lone stool, a photo of Agatha beside it. </p>
<p><br/>Rio shook her hands to rid the jitters, rolling her neck as she pushed herself up, shuffling around the desks-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Maybe it’s her. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three words punched her in the chest. Her hopes skyrocketed, she felt her heart kick into gear, hands made work to straighten her outfit- A black button up top, slim pair of black slacks. Nothing fancy and if it was Agatha at the door- Suddenly Rio wished she dressed better. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> What? Stop caring how you look for her, idiot.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She mentally groaned, hating herself more than she had in years. With a deep breath, trembling hands, Rio opened the door to find-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Afternoon, freak” Alice smiled. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Dammit.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey,” Rio sighed, leaning against the doorframe as she forced a small smile herself. “Heading out early?” She gestured to the bag on Alice’s shoulder.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, cancelled my last class”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Playing hooky with Kale again?” Rio smirked a bit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She watched the woman’s cheeks begin to burn. How her eyes sparkled, looking away while her foot kicked at the floor. Rio laughed, amused by the little girl crush her friend wore. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> If only my crush was that easy- Not a crush. Stop it.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s cute,” Rio shrugged. “Odd duo, stuck up bitch, but..cute” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alice scoffed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She’s not that bad”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re only saying that because you’re going down on her…or the reverse? You know what,” Rio put her finger up, scrunching her nose as she shook her head. “I don’t want to know” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They both chuckled, but were cut off as Billy (William? Rio never knew which name that boy went by) flew by with two coffees in his hands. His breath was short, rapid as his shoulders raised up and down. He gave a little smile, nodding to them both before asking,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey, have you guys seen-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“They’re in the library” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alice finished for him, knowing exactly who he was looking for and also? She did not want Rio to catch on for who he was looking for and <em> why </em>he was searching for them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Great, thank you” He sighed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Going against Alice’s hopes to swiftly push him away, distract and get Rio to walk out with her early. The young man crushed her attempt with unintentional ease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I swear, Agatha’s coffee days will be the death of me” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Shit.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, coffee Friday?” Rio perked up. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mhm” He smiled. “You know how it is” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She smirked a bit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, I-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Might want to catch them before they fly off,” Alice weakly smiled. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He nodded, saying a quick goodbye to them both before rushing down the hall. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After being ignored by Agatha for the last five days, drowning in the memories of the weekend- Rio (unfortunately) was excited to hear Agatha was doing her monthly coffee run. Where she picked a random Friday and bought coffee for everyone. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Well, <em> everyone </em> meaning the staff in their department…more so, just the few people Agatha tolerated)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course, Rio never pitched in by giving William her order. However, that didn’t leave her with nothing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha would always decide for her. Hence why part of her was excited. She loved seeing what the annoying woman came up with, but even worse? Now, it was a way to connect herself to Agatha. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The woman's absence felt hollowing the last few days. Rio was eager to let a small coffee cup designed by her help her with it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> Oh, what am I becoming? </em>Rio wondered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Assuming mine is left in the break room per normal?” She asked. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Though as Alice’s smile faded, looking elsewhere while she hid behind her coffee-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’s that face for?” Rio asked. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alice shrugged, running a hand through her hair while avoiding Rio’s stare.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Uh..well, that’s the thing-” She nervously laughed before quickly mumbling the words, “All the coffees have been..<em> given </em>”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Okay? Where’s mine?” Rio questioned, but realized the answer not a second later. “Wow-” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She didn’t say anything to me!” Alice put her hands up in defense. “All I know is there’s no other-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah! K’, cool…got it. Thanks!”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio disappeared into her classroom, slamming the door shut behind her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha was ignoring her, disappearing left and right and now wouldn’t even include Rio for a stupid coffee? <em> What the fuck?! </em> She excluded her, made her the odd one out. While everyone strided around with their large cup of coffee, wearing smiles and laughter from the joy a simple drink could bring- Rio stood with nothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Fucking bitch.. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sure, this is what Rio had always wanted. But after their weekend together? How things felt completely different off campus with just one another around? She’d be lying if she said this is <em> exactly </em>what she had truly desired. If anything, the more time that passed left Rio to realize this was the polar opposite. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All she had to do was laugh Agatha off, storm out of that store and never look back. Agatha would still be teasing her, annoying her and the best of all?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> I’d never know what could be..what we could be.. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio rushed to grab her belongings, desperate to get home and bask in the glory of her liquor cabinet or maybe a few beers. Rio would know which vice she needed when her pajamas were on, a shitty movie was on the screen, and reality truly struck her for the mess she had created. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She looked around, making sure everything was in her hands. With a few heavy breaths, the classroom door locked behind her- Rio turned to see two staff members laughing with the coffee cups in their hands. She curled her lips in a snarl, scrunched her nose in disgust, muttering under her breath, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fuck off, Harkness..”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Rio used her shoulder to push the door open, stepping into the parking lot as she texted Wanda back about meeting for drinks. As much as she didn’t want to go out, getting drunk with others was a better idea over drinking alone. Sometimes she was smart. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Key word, <em> sometimes.  </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Shit!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio’s head snapped up from her phone when the word was shouted. She searched across the lot for the voice’s owner, scanning each row until-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Agatha.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The woman was crouched down on the cement, picking up the items that had flown out of her bag. Rio’s heart thundered, alarms in her mind going off with a warning to flee the scene. The petty side of her wanted to do just as Agatha had been. Ignore, dodge, turn a blind eye and not offer her anything. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that wasn’t in Rio’s nature. Even if they were still enemies (More than they seemingly were now) she’d help her pick the mess up. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio slipped her phone in her pocket, jogging over before her knees nearly scraped across the cement just as Agatha’s belongings had. Her hands worked to pick up the miscellaneous items. A deck of playing cards, mascara, a pack of gum and a tiny baggy of cinnamon discs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> This is so Agatha.. </em>Rio tried to not grin as she thought it over. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She didn’t notice how the woman beside her jumped, froze, her own anxiety screaming inside. Rio was too busy picking up the other items, handing them to Agatha with a small smile. One that was nervous, careful to not scare her off. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, Agatha never looked up at her. There was no smile in return, no witty comment about Rio being her savior or something like so. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha stood back on her feet with ease. She tucked her purse back together, straightening her clothes and never turning her attention to the woman stunned below. All she offered was a low, clipped, barely coherent, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thanks..” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before turning around, storming off and leaving stunned behind. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Seriously? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She scoffed, shaking her head as she muttered a snarky reply to the one worded <em> graciousness </em> Agatha had given her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, don’t be too enthusiastic over it or anything..” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio had started to walk away, missing how Agatha spun around the second she had opened her mouth. All she heard was the sarcastic wit, attitude coating her tone,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh! Silly me! I’m just jumping for joy for how I almost just broke my phone and all my shit went flying across the parking lot. Hip-hip-<em> fucking- </em>horray!”  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio turned back around, being met with a harsh glare that Agatha never showed. Sure, they glared at one another. But, it wasn’t the ice cold icicle being stabbed through her right then. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Who knew I’d miss her playful glare so much? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Standing in the university’s parking lot on a late Friday afternoon, Rio was learning how Agatha couldn’t hide annoyance and anger to save her life. That was for sure. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Jeez. Sorry I helped, I guess” Rio said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha scoffed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, cry me a river, Vidal!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What is up your ass?!” Rio asked. “You’re acting as if I am the worst human being by helping pick your mess up!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha laughed with no humor. Only malicious intent and rage filled its tone. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Whatever” Rio muttered, shaking her head as she went to turn around. “Go back to acting as if I don’t exist”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha’s laughter stopped, lips curled up slowly as she snarled back, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Monday morning, back to usual. Act like that weekend <em> never </em> happened. Sound familiar?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio swallowed, taking a step back in case she needed to run. Not from the truth or how right Agatha was. This was her own fault and Rio knew it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>More so she’d be running because <em> fuck, </em> Agatha’s anger was terrifying. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She looked on the verge of lunging out, strangling Rio’s throat- Not the way she had dreamt about either. Everyone knew Agatha was a powerful being, someone who was a force to be reckoned with, but..this was different. Terrifyingly different. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio shook her head, voice starting to waver with every word,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This is different. Not usua-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How so?” Agatha questioned, arms folded against her chest as her foot began to tap. “Hm? I’m doing exactly as you wanted and more! You’ve told me for years to leave you alone. I’d say I’m giving you the entire package!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio shook her head. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s not fair”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> It is fair.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You're acting as if I don't exist. After the weekend, I-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The weekend never happened! You said it yourself multiple times!” She exclaimed. “God!” Agatha scoffed, looking away with her hand running through her hair. “I can’t do anything right when it comes to you” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio opened her lips to say something, but the words were vacant. They vanished into thin air, being replaced with a silence that spoke louder than her voice ever could. She felt like a dam had been built in front of her, impossible to break through and let the flood drown Agatha out. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah..” Agatha scoffed. “Exactly. So, goodbye Rio” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She watched as Agatha turned, making her way back to the car that Rio hated she missed. Rio was frozen, her heart begging to stop her while every other piece of her told her to turn around, give it up. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio did this. She had created the damage between them by begging, pleading for years the woman left her alone. Her wish was true, the genie in a bottle granted her that. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So why the hell was she pissed off watching Agatha walk away? </p>
<p>Why did Rio care that Agatha didn’t want anything to do with her? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Well…to be fair- </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You started this”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three childish words escaped before Rio was able to catch them. On one half, she was lucky for how they were successful by making Agatha stop in her tracks. The other though? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Oh, I’m dead.. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha started to take dangerously slow steps, head tilted as her eyes narrowed in as if Rio was her prey. She was circling, pointing, ready to attack and kill her with one swing.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about, Rio?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her voice was low, daring Rio to argue and worst of all? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Jesus. The way she says my name is so stupidly attractive. Fucking hell.. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio cleared her throat, standing up taller, a hand gesturing out with every word,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Years ago the night we met. You were an ass-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And I’ve spent three years trying to make that wrong a right!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha yelled, the veins in her neck sticking out stronger with every word. Rio jumped in her spot, leaning back as Agatha started to charge toward her. No more dangerous slow steps, a full on run Rio should move from. Turn around, run away before she’d be slaughtered to death in the university’s parking lot. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But instead, Rio stayed put. She braced herself for the impact, but couldn’t prepare for the way her stomach swirled as Agatha was just a shy four steps away. Close enough to feel her presence stronger than crouched down beside her. She leaned back, fists scrunched into balls while her heart pounded like a bass drum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha’s vanilla conditioner was strong, the smell of coffee still lingered on her lips and those piercing blue eyes looked frozen. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know!” She tossed her arms out. “I’m so wicked and evil for how I read the situation wrong! Damn me to hell for eternity-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Agatha-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I thought you’d be one into a bit of competitive flirting, my fucking bad for being wrong. I didn’t realize you’d punish me for years over that. Hell, if I did- We would have never talked!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah?! Well maybe that’s how it should’ve stayed!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio yelled, pushing forward so their faces were inches away, but that didn’t last long. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just as quick as they were close to touching, silently debating attacking the other in a brutal kiss to end whatever this feud was. They leaned away from one another in sync. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both of their faces filled with rage shifted into something unreadable to one another. Rio swallowed the lump in her throat, watching as Agatha ripped her eyes away. Before she did so, Rio saw the water melting the frozen blue orbs that had lost all strength. She didn’t miss how Agatha visibly trembled, lifting her head to speak, but instead just stormed off quicker than before. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And suddenly, Rio preferred Agatha’s life threatening anger over the back of her body as she ran off.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She stayed in her spot, unable to move while staring into the void space Agatha left. Down the parking lot the car door slammed shut, flying off as soon as the engine was turned on. Agatha was there and she was gone in what felt like less than thirty seconds. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio sucked her cheeks in, holding arms over her stomach while no other thoughts were in her mind. Only the hollowing question, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> What just happened? </em>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Rio sprawled every limb over the couch, draping herself as if she were a blanket. A half empty tub of rocky road ice cream tucked in her side, whiskey bottle on the floor in arms reach, with a crappy reality TV show she was definitely not paying attention to. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She wasn’t sure how long it had been since she had trudged through her front door. The only few things she focused on was letting Nicky outside and making sure he was fed. Kicking her shoes off, grabbing a bottle of whiskey and ice cream (A perfect dinner. Gordon Ramsey would most certainly be proud) and collapsing with a thud onto the couch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything else was background, nothing mattered nor did she have the energy for it all. The fight with Agatha lived in her mind as a being separate from her own self. She couldn’t control the memory. It carried its own heart, pulse, thoughts and life. If Rio could gain control, she would’ve by now. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To be fair, the whiskey most likely wasn’t helping the memory’s existence die. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh, what the fuck” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio jumped, but never bothered to sit up. Her head shot over to the redhead standing above her. The woman’s eyes roaming her up and down, scanning around the room with Nicky sniffing her up and down. She slowly started to laugh, holding her hands up with a shake of her head. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Nuh-uh, nope!” She laughed, reaching for the TV remote to turn the show off. “There’s no way one Tinder date gone wrong is going to do this to you”</p>
<p><br/>“What the hell?” Rio whined. “Where did you come from?! Ever heard of knocking-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ever heard of cancelling plans? Maybe answering your phone so I know you aren’t dead?” She countered, arms folded tight against her chest. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda reached down, snatching her phone off the coffee table and scoffed at the black screen facing her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Course,” She scoffed, holding it up for Rio to see. “Why charge the device that lets me know you’re alive?” </p>
<p><br/>Rio shrugged. “More fun that way”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, so is letting me know you’re staying home” She said, rolling her eyes. “Especially when you’re..” She waved her hand up and down. “What is this, exactly?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You barging into my house, that’s what this is..” Rio grumbled. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda let out a laugh, tossing her head back as she held her hands up theatrically. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Okay, sure- That’s the answer!” She exclaimed. “Not the fact you’ve obviously been sobbing your eyes out, not even in your pajamas, a bottle of whiskey and to top it all off?!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She leaned down, ripping the ice cream container from her hold. Her eyes squinted, nose scrunched as she realized-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Liquid ice cream” Wanda said, returning her eyes back to Rio. “But, you’re so right. Nothing else is the issue here” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda smirked as Rio’s demeanor sunk back into herself. She twiddled with her thumbs, pulled her bottom lip back between her teeth with a small shrug. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Maybe I like my ice cream liquid-y now. Ever consider that?” She mumbled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh,” Wanda nodded, clicking her tongue with a wink. “Makes sense. You also love sulking in your work clothes while crying and drinking whiskey. Man, this new Rio era is really <em> not </em> a problem at all”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Exactly!” Rio said, holding her hand in the air. “Now, give me back my liquid dessert and head for the door-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No and no,” Wanda declined. “I am going to plug your phone in, put this soup of yours away and you-” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She pointed, finding the box of tissues to toss at her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re going to sit up, use a few of these and when I get back- Tell me what the hell is going on” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda was exiting the room, but not without swiping the whiskey bottle Rio had taken a hold of out of her hand. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio groaned, throwing her head back with a whine. “I hate you!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know you do!” Wanda called back. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She listened to the woman putting away her two favorite vices, plugging her phone in and most definitely getting herself a bottle of wine. Rio didn’t blame her there. If she found Wanda in this state, she’d need an entire liter of vodka to make it through. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio forced herself to sit up before Wanda would do it for her. She tucked her knees up to her chest, Nicky jumping up to snuggle in beside her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I guess you’re better than snuggling liquid ice cream..” Rio murmured, leaning down to kiss the top of his head. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda snickered as she strided back into the room. </p>
<p>“I’d argue much better, but..” She dropped the water bottle in her lap, dropping on the other end of the couch beside her. “To each their own” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The silence remained for a minute or so. Wanda allowed Rio to blow her nose, wipe the remaining tears and take a few sips of her water. She gave her time to collect herself the best she could, letting her study close and try to pick apart what (Better yet, <em> who) </em> created this version of her best friend. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda stared…and stared- Rio side glancing every few seconds until she shifted uncomfortably in her spot. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I think she’s judging us..” Rio mumbled against Nicky's head, hiding her face behind him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The redhead smirked, taking a sip from her wine before exhaling a sigh. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not judging, simply…reading-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Judging” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Investigating” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You aren’t on the payroll for such a thing” Rio rolled her eyes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I work for a nonprofit,” Wanda shrugged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh yeah? What’s your organization called? Far Too Nosy Redheads?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hmm,” Wanda hummed, pretending to think about it. “We debated that title for awhile, but ended up going with a third party recommendation” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio chuckled. “Oh really? And what was the recommendation?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> “You Can’t Keep Distracting the Redhead Nonprofit Investigator Society” </em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio’s smirk faded, eyes lowered back to the boy snuggled in her side. She heard Wanda humming her successful tune. The one that sang, <em> “I won” </em>their back and forth. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Society? That makes you sound like the leader of some cult..” She muttered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well then, you should feel honored you’re my first vulnerable soul to be corrupted” Wanda replied. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The amusement in Wanda’s voice was cut, tone short, not letting Rio prolong their conversation any longer. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Now. Out with it. What’s the pity party about?” She asked. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio looked up before back down. She shifted her body left to right, clearing her throat as her fuzzy drunken mind tried to scramble an excuse together. All the words felt jumbled, coherent thoughts non existent. One vision stayed clear in her mind, a look that only made her stomach feel sicker than the whiskey ever could. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What is going on in there?” Wanda asked. “I’m not even in your brain and I feel sick-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Is that an insult?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Just an observation” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She shrugged, taking a slow sip from her wine, allowing Rio a few more seconds to reply. But when she didn’t, Wanda simply sighed, her heart breaking for whatever happened to her best friend. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio had rarely looked so destroyed in her life. Only when her father passed could it compare. And as heavy as that weighed, the destruction it had caused- Wanda would be a liar if she said this didn’t feel different. She was dressed in remorse, covered in despair, wreaked of guilt like never before. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Rio, what the hell did you do? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I won’t let you dodge my ques-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That stupid Tinder date” Rio lied and <em> shit- </em>That even sounded pathetic to her. “It..y’know, got ghosted and-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You were over the moon having an excuse to delete Tinder” Wanda pointed out. “That’s not it, you’re a horrible liar and we both know it”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Wow..” Rio puffed out a hint of a laugh. “You’re just <em> lovely </em> company to have, aren’t you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She looked up to find Wanda smiling big, holding her wine glass in the air with a tiny bow, an arm extended out to her side. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What can I say? I’m just a gem”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“A gem that’s a pain in my ass” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What about a rose thorn in your side? Sounds prettier” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Nope” Rio popped the p, shaking her head. “You’re too aggravating to be a peaceful pain” She shrugged. “Up my ass hurts worse”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not a fan of ana-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio groaned, grabbing a pillow to hold over her face, voice muffled as she yelled,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ew! Ugh, fuck off. Go home. Leave me be!” </p>
<p><br/>Wanda laughed as she choked on the red liquid that felt perfect on her tongue, delicious to sweeten this bitter moment. Well…maybe bitter was a bit too harsh. Making Rio cringe through her apparent breakdown was humorous, after all. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I will do such a thing when you admit to what’s going on!” She exclaimed.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio grumbled under her breath. A variety of words that all added up to the same result,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “This is so stupid” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Typically, Wanda would continue arguing until Rio either gave up the answer in a rage or turned into a puddle on the floor. Luckily for her though, she could tell Rio was reaching her breaking point. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It showed how she was fidgeting with Nicky’s ear, her tongue swiping the inside of her cheek every now and then, lips pulled back, fingers tapping rhythmically against her knee. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Agatha got coffee for everyone”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda had been taking a small sip of wine, thinking she had more time before Rio confessed. Though as the wine glass sat against her lips, studying Rio to see if this was one of her annoying jokes. Where she’d say anything to dodge the actual question, the real conversation, to avoid the truth all together. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> She isn’t joking..? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The woman swallowed, clearing her throat before asking,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So..why uh- You care she bought coffee for everyone? I thought you hated when she-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Everyone but me!” Rio yelled through a strong laugh. “Everyone else in that damn building got a coffee!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Okay, building was an exaggeration. BUT! Still! Rio was the only staff member who didn’t have a coffee purchased by Agatha in her hand. That earned her the right to react this way. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyone else who had been left out for coffee day would react the same way…<em> right? </em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And what do I get?! I get that <em> bitch </em>having the audacity to fight me in the parking lot- AFTER PICKING UP HER THINGS!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda was a deer in headlights. A confused deer to be exact and that was probably still too light of a word for it. She felt frozen, eyes wide as she watched the meltdown happen live in action. Rio’s voice was cracking, hands waving in the air as her words screamed out. Her eyes only drifted to see the dog burying himself deeper in Rio’s side, thinking softly to herself, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Poor Nicky. You’re such a trooper.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She’s such a bitch Wanda, I-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Okay, okay” Wanda held her hand up, chuckling softly. “Slow down for one, how much did you have to drink? I’m so confus-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio continued, but not with the answers Wanda was exactly looking for. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“And I didn’t know telling her to forget the weekend would mean this!” She yelled, balling up her fist as she shook her head. “If I did, I-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Honey, you gotta’ guide me here. I’m lost” She chuckled. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As if Wanda’s voice wasn’t gentle, almost like Rio was at the interrogation table with a lightbulb shining on her- She broke under the heated pressure. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio’s head shook, she made Nicky jump off the couch when she screamed the words that the neighbours were sure to hear. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We hung out! Okay?!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda watched as her best friend was trembling physically and vocally. She was picking at her fingernails, shaking her head as if she was trying to ruin her brain. Every little action Wanda analyzed, the words that pieced the woman’s current state together-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Oh my god.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She brought the wine glass up to her lips, tipping back with one swig while wishing it was the entire bottle. Truthfully, Wanda would need an entire case if the direction they were going in was to the destination she already knew. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio had her heart broken a few years ago. It was the last time she really opened herself to date anyone. After that, Rio shut down straight into ultra work mode. Natasha and Wanda tried everything to get her out of it, but no dice. Tinder was a massive breakthrough, but that had failed and they couldn’t put up an argument over it. Rio was stood up, that was enough to allow the app to be gone. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And yet during all of their scheming, plotting, brainstorming on how to get their friend back out there-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Agatha Harkness. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The name was never hated by Wanda. She remembered three years ago when Rio said those two words, gave her the rundown of their first encounter- Wanda went home that night to Natasha with the words, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “There’s something about that name”  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Natasha looked up from her phone with a small smirk.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Agatha sounds like it belongs to an old woman? Is that i-” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Shut up” Wanda sighed, playfully smacking her shoulder. “Listen to me!”  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Okay, okay” Natasha put her phone down, hands up in surrender. “You have my undivided attention, honey” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Wanda rolled her eyes, crashing on the couch beside her. She shook her head, biting at her bottom lip as the name echoed off every wall in her mind.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> There was something about the way Rio said her name. Their first encounter as well may have been a subtle amount of flirting before it crashed. She didn’t think that was it. Even if Rio said they didn’t flirt or never even spoke, Wanda would be feeling something in her gut.  </em>
</p>
<p><em> <br/></em> <em> “You’re usually right about these things..” Natasha said. “So..what’s the name telling you” </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Wanda scoffed. “You’re gonna’ laugh” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Try me,” Natasha said. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> She tugged her lips back between her teeth, nibbling until letting them loose to explain.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “She’s the one..” Wanda shrugged. “I- I don’t know how else to explain it besides…the way Rio said it, even if she’s annoyed by her and all like-” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Natasha didn’t say anything, knowing well to let the silence linger, give her space to continue on when she was ready  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Rio and Agatha. Agatha and Rio. Rio Vidal, Agatha Harkness- It works”  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Hm..” Natasha hummed. “She’s stubborn, you have to keep that in mind. Don’t get your hopes up” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Wanda had been trying for months to push her best friend back out there, eager to see her fall in love like she deserved. Natasha had been supportive, helpful, but still kept her grounded before she could truly get her hopes out of hand.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “I just want to see her happy. Am I too obsessive about this?” She looked over to find Natasha giving a small smile. “Am I?” She repeated.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Natasha shook her head. “You’re a good friend” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Well..mark my words. This is it” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “I believe you,” She nodded. “Guess we’ll see how it plays out” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “You know, I said awhile ago Rio was destined for an enemies to lovers plot” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> The other woman laughed, tucking a piece of red hair behind Wanda’s ear.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “I can see it” </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Right?!” Wanda grinned. “It makes so much sense!”  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio groaned, hands covering her face as she dug the heel of her palms into her cheeks. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She bought my stupid ice cream and snacks” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She began and <em> oh lord, </em>Wanda would never guess where the confession was heading. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We spoke for hours and then we went to a rage room- Which my shoulder is still sore from and that was all because I accidentally liked her stupid Instagram post and this-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio hiccuped, struggling to take a breath through a few tiny coughs. Wanda went into action, putting her wine glass down to exchange it for the water bottle. She twisted the cap, holding it to her with a soft, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Hey, hey..” Wanda said. “Drink some water, catch your breath” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reluctantly, Rio took the water from her. She took a few sips, caught her breath and wiped tears before they could reach her cheeks. The woman shook her head, muttering under her breath,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I hate her so much..” Rio lied. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda snickered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I don’t think you would be here a drunken mess if that were the case..”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio shrugged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Who knows? Maybe this is-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Don’t do that” Wanda said, the softness in her voice gone as if it was never there. “Listen, I won’t press you harder tonight for information about…how the hell you two hung out-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Good. I’m too tired”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda gave a soft smile. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Too drunk as well”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m not that-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Rio, honey you’re slurring every other word..” Wanda said. “Besides, I know you. Let’s just..watch something on TV. If you want to talk, I’m all ears”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She reached forward for the remote, grabbing the fleece blanket to lay over their legs. Rio wouldn’t say it, too lost in her emotions, but…she was thankful for Wanda beyond words. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>When Rio ended up in this state of mind, it was hard to talk about anything. Especially making sense through each word. Not to mention, she had just confessed to hanging out with her worst enemy of all time. Part of her knew when she was good and sober, Wanda would most likely recruit Natasha to gang up on her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Wait- </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re just waiting for Natasha to be back in town to interrogate me..huh?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Natasha was away for work for the weekend, due to come home the following week. Rio wasn’t surprised when Wanda snickered, leaning back as she scrolled through Netflix’s wide selection. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I hate the both of you..” Rio grumbled. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“More than Agatha Harkness now, apparently” Wanda replied. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“No. I still really hate her” Rio lied. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Mhm. Okay, Rio” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I do!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m not saying you don’t!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I hate her”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yep. Keep drinking water, drunkie” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wanda popped the p, not letting the argument go on as she selected Grace and Frankie to watch for the millionth time together. Rio did as she told her, slumping in her spot more as the theme song started to roll. Normally they’d sing it horribly together, but Rio was too busy thinking to herself-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> I still hate her…don’t I?</em>
</p>

<p>The following night rolled around far too soon for Rio’s liking. Saturday night, one day closer to Monday when she’d have to face Agatha all over again. Plus, another day closer to when Natasha and Wanda were certain to break her door down. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They’d be around for dinner Thursday night with relentless questions about what happened. It wasn’t even Sunday and Rio was dreading that night far more than having to see Agatha. Maybe both were the same amount of nightmare fuel. <em> Fuck. </em>Rio didn’t even want to think about it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doomscrolling on her phone, trying to numb the ache in her heart and soothe the upset stomach that hadn’t settled since their fight- A notification from Instagram popped up on the top of her screen, words that made her entire body freeze. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaDrunkt1” width=" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk1.jpeg"/>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio stared at the two broken messages. What else was she able to do besides just…stare? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> She can’t be talking to me.  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> This has to be a mistake. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That was it. Just a text to the wrong person. She should lock her phone, drag herself to bed and let Agatha figure out it wasn’t her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio shouldn’t have been surprised how her thumbs tapped the letters off her keyboard, not allowing herself to follow the logical path. Instead, she was going to ask for clarity- See the obvious answer for herself. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaDrunk2" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk2.jpeg" width="397"/>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Holy shit. </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> She’s drunk.  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> Agatha is drunk texting me.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Oh my god..” Rio mumbled. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And before she could reply, Agatha continued on with a string of messages. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaDrunk3" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk3.jpeg" width="397"/>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> We had fun.  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> If we matched on Tinder.  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> She knows I don’t always hate her- </em>
</p>
<p>“Fuck!” Rio harshly whispered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She quickly sat up in bed, holding her phone tighter as if she could stop Agatha’s messages from coming through. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio had to shut this down before she went on any longer. She was drunk, this was all meaningless. Even if the saying was drunken tongue, sober thoughts come out- </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whatever the hell it was, Rio couldn’t figure it out right then and there. Her mind was planning, plotting, flying on a whim to try and put a stop to whatever this conversation was turning into. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaDrunk4" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk4.jpeg" width="397"/>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As much as Rio wanted to shut this down, turn her phone off and disappear into slumber she wished to never wake up from. Not in a suicidal way, but to ignore reality for the rest of her life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was never that easy. Rio’s personality, who she was- It cursed her as it did in the parking lot. Where she felt compelled to help Agatha pick up her belongings, now she felt it was her responsibility to make sure the drunk woman she hated and yet missed was safe. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio wasn’t surprised to see the following texts of Agatha admitting to where she was. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaDrunk5" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk5.jpeg" width="397"/>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> A bar.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“That’s…not helpful, Agatha” Rio whispered to herself, running a hand through her hair. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She needed more information to work with. There were multiple bars in town, Agatha could possibly not even be in town to find her in one. Rio shook her head, typing as part of her brain begged her to stop. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaDrunk6" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk6.jpeg" width="397"/>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Lou Miller.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The universe had granted her a saving grace for knowing exactly who she was talking about. Lou was an old friend of Rio’s from college. They were still friends, but life had taken them in opposite directions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At first, relief was the only thing running through her mind. She knew where Agatha was, she would be able to track her down and check on her first hand- Let her eyes lay on her, see the woman was safe. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Drunk, but…safe. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fuck, why do I even care?” Rio muttered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She pushed herself out of bed, grabbing a hoodie and a pair of black jeans. Her feet rushed through the house, making sure Nicky was content on the couch while pulling her hair up in a hair clip. If Rio wasn’t so worried, she’d cringe at how much of a mess she looked. Especially seeing Agatha, but..</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> She’s drunk. She won’t even remember any of this. </em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio grabbed her keys, opened her phone back up to shoot Agatha another message. On one side, she wanted to confirm it was Lou she was talking about. On the other, she needed to know Agatha wasn’t so far gone to not reply to her anymore. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaDrunk7" height="600" src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunkFinal.jpeg" width="397"/>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Why not me?  </em>
</p>
<p>She found a way to choke on air, a few coughs as she struggled to shut the front door behind her. Rio held tight onto the doorknob, eyes wide as she stared at the text messages. The previous ones started to sink into her mind as well. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Would you be jealous if I fucked her? </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> I’d rather fuck you, Rio.  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> I shouldn’t say that. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She’s drunk..” Rio told herself, collecting enough strength to make her way to the car while chanting like a mantra, “She’s drunk. She’s drunk. She’s drunk”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shaking her head, feeling her heart racing to the point her pulse thundered up into her throat- Rio managed to tap Lou’s contact while turning the key in the ignition. She put the car in drive, taking off out of her driveway as if she was fleeing a crime scene and needed to escape the police behind her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The phone rang a few times, on the verge of being met with her voicemail. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Come on..” Rio muttered, fingers tapping against the steering wheel. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just as she was about to give up hope, make another plan to drive around incase Agatha managed to leave before she got there-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Rio Vidal, long time since you’ve rang” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Australian voice rasped with a laugh and Rio let out the longest exhale of relief in her entire life. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Lou asked. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Yeah, hey- Uh, you have a mess of a woman at your bar right now. Wild brown hair, um-” Rio sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I don’t fucking know what she’s wearing…maybe a flannel or-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Harkness?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> Harkness. </em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio sighed, relieved she located Agatha. “Yeah. Make sure she stays where she is, please?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lou didn’t say anything for a moment, worrying Rio she wasn’t currently working or maybe found the request weird. She wouldn’t blame her. Rio was basically asking a friend she hadn't spoken to in ages to keep a random woman hostage. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“How do you know her?” She asked. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio shook her head as if Lou was able to see her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Long story, not enough time- Just, make sure she doesn’t move and stop serving her” She ordered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Sir yes sir..” Lou muttered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you, seriously” She sighed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The phone call ended, leaving Rio to hear the sound of her car and thoughts racing faster than the fifty miles per hour she was flying at. Her grip on the steering wheel tightened, jaw clenched as her fear about Agatha leaving paused for a moment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The texts started to flicker through her mind, envisioning every single one word for word. There were a few that held their own collection of, <em> holy fuck. </em>But one in particular stood out the most above all. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio stopped at the red light, looking around before whispering to herself outloud,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She wants to fuck me?”</p>
<p> </p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio pulled into the tiny parking lot, barely turning the engine off before jumping out of the car. Her body felt on high alert, struck with fear as if she was walking into her death sentence. A firing squad behind the front door, lethal injection that’d be stabbed in her veins the second she stepped through the threshold. Everything felt like a dooming end and yet? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>None of it mattered. Rio would walk into fire without a second thought if it meant at the end, Agatha was safe. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> This is insane.. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She ignored her thoughts to push the door open, being welcomed to the grunge atmosphere. Lou wasn’t one for fancy places. She bought the dive bar years ago when her on and off girlfriend had been sentenced to a lengthy prison stay. It was something to distract her, keep her busy and unsurprisingly? She had made a decent name for herself. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio scanned each person, looked around the sea of people until her eyes found the crazed brown hair at the bar. The same blue flannel she wore at the rage room, her body slumped with a hand gesturing in the air- probably slurring and rambling on about something. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Too busy threading herself through the crowd of sweaty, drunk, messy people- Rio didn’t register the song that played through the speakers. If she did..well, it’d be another mental curse out for Wanda to shut up about the universe’s signs. Sparks by Coldplay and ironically, Rio didn't even like Coldplay. But if she heard the lyrics, they'd feel way too realistic to what was happening with them both.</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<div class="ujudUb">
<p>
<em>"Did I drive you away?</em>
<br/>
<em>I know what you'll say</em>
<br/>
<em>You say, "Oh, sing one we know"</em>

</div>
<div class="ujudUb">
<p> </p>
</div>
<div class="ujudUb">
<p>

<br/>
<em>I'll always look out for you</em>
<br/>
<em>Yeah, that's what I'll do"</em>
</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio reached out, gently placing her hand on Agatha’s shoulder- Thankfully her adrenaline was running its own marathon to ignore how a simple touch felt like a million voltages electrocuting her all at once. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Aga-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Well!” Agatha yelled, the words all slurred into one. “Look who it is, everybody!” She waved her arm around, head tilted back as she yelled over the music. “My number one hater!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lou walked over, drying the glass in her hand with a small grin. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Vidal” She greeted. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio looked over her shoulder with a nod. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Thank you” She mouthed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lou winked. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“She was about to take off just a few minutes ago, bribed her with a drink” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Bribe me?!” Agatha laughed. “I can’t be bribed! I’m immortal!”</p>
<p>If she were sober, Rio would totally be making fun of her for how that made zero sense. Instead, she just shook her head while grabbing Agatha’s jacket and purse. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Come on, I’m taking you home” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha shook her head. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m not done yet and also, no! I’m not spending time with you to go to work tomorrow and you hate me all over again!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lou snorted, muttering under her breath. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Don’t think Sunday means work..”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio subtly glared back at her, but returned her attention to tug Agatha’s arm towards her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Just, please?” Rio asked. “Walk with me at the least” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Keeping my enemy closeeeee” Agatha giggled. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Good, that works. Follow the saying” Rio nodded. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio managed to help Agatha off the barstool. She pulled her wallet out with one hand, keeping the other holding tight onto the woman’s arm. Lou pushed her wallet back, waving with a low, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. You’ll get me back when we catch up next week?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She looked up with a thankful smile. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Get that redheaded witch to join us” She added.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio snickered. “She’ll be thrilled. Thanks again, Lou”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Good luck” She pointed. “Take care, Harkness!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Not with her will I!” Agatha’s body slumped against Rio’s with a little giggle. “Hiiii”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio tried to hold her own grin back, making sure Agatha’s belongings were secure in one hand- Agatha’s physical being locked in the other. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Come on,” She encouraged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They stumbled through the bar side by side, but once they got out onto the sidewalk- Agatha almost went face first into the concrete. Rio’s arm lunged out, hooking around her waist and pulling her body right against her own. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha giggled, leaning back into her embrace with a messy, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My hee- Oh, hero!” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other woman shook her head, fighting for her life to ignore every warm feeling and swirl of butterflies that started to create a mess of herself. After a few minutes, Rio managed to get Agatha into the passenger seat of her car, thinking about how the roles were exchanged. It wasn’t her in Agatha’s car, but the reverse this time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> And I was sober. </em>She thought to herself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’s your address?” Rio asked as she buckled her in. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“What’d you have in mind?” Agatha rasped, wiggling her eyebrows. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio sighed, leaning an arm on top of the car with her other hand placed firmly on her hip. <br/><br/></p>
<p>“Get you to bed, that’s-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ooo! Scandalous” Agatha giggled. “And then what?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Fucks sake..” Rio muttered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She shut the car door, walking around the front as she tried to figure out what to do about-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> BEEEEP. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“FUCK!” Rio yelled. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her hand pressed against her chest, eyes wide as her body trembled with the sudden fear. She looked through the windshield to find Agatha leaned over, hands pressing on the horn with a grin so wide- It threatened to stretch her face apart. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The woman rushed to open her car door, pushing the giddy woman away who whined the second Rio sat in the seat beside her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“You’re no fun!” She pouted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio caught her breath, pulling the buckle over her torso with a low scoff, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My apologies..” She muttered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha was humming some tune, whispering the words about going down a road. Rio didn’t bother to truly listen. Reality was slowly coming to light, realizing she had no other option without knowing where Agatha lived. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If she called Lilia, Jen, Alice, hell even that William/Billy kid (<em>I really need to figure out his name someday)-  </em>She’d never hear the end of it. And with the fight that had happened between them, would Agatha hate her even more for outting them? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> There’s nothing about us to out! </em>Rio yelled in her mind. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She wouldn’t admit to it, but the other half of reality was something far worse than the others tormenting Rio for saving a drunken Agatha-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> I need to keep her safe.  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> What if she hurts herself or gets sick? </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> No- I can’t seriously be debating- </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“So..where we going, <em> my chauffeur?” </em>Agatha asked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio took in a deep breath, turning the key in the ignition as she nodded to herself with the two words that didn’t feel real, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My place” She answered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha gasped. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Scanda-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Lous, yeah. I know” Rio grumbled. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She pulled out of the parking lot, driving down the empty dim lit road with Agatha humming the same tune beside her. Rio hoped it’d stay that way for the rest of the night. By morning, Agatha would most likely take an Uber once she realized where she was. Part of her worried Agatha would kill her for doing this, bringing her to her house intoxicated off her ass. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio made a mental note to ask Lou how much she drank once Agatha was settled on the couch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I’m sorry for fucking it up..y’know?” Agatha muttered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio shook her head. “Agatha, you’re drun-”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ask me this sober!” She exclaimed. “I never wanted to hate you- hate me- hate us- hate hate HATEEE!” She whined. “Okay?! So..”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She stopped at the redlight, taking in a deep breath before looking over to see Agatha’s eyes drooping shut. Her head started to drop, slumber taking over all her words and actions. Part of her was thankful for it, even if getting the woman out of the car may be more difficult. She had silence to collect herself and-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Thud.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio’s body froze, every muscle tensed while her blood flowing through her came to a stop. The frizzy hair tickled her face, the smell of liquor and that familiar vanilla conditioner hit her like a storm. The weight of Agatha’s head rested on her shoulder, but none of it felt as heavy as Rio’s emotions in that moment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> You hate her.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It felt so right to have Agatha like this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> You hate her.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her giggle was contagious, how she felt warm pressed against her while they stumbled out of the bar together. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> You hate her.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the idea of bringing her home? The feeling of keeping her safe? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> You hate her.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Your shoulder is comfy” Agatha mumbled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> Please remember you hate her. </em>Rio begged herself. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Luckily the remainder of the drive home, Agatha didn’t say anything else. She had fallen asleep on Rio’s shoulder, leaving drool on a small part of her hoodie. The woman wouldn’t notice until she took it off to change into a comfy t-shirt later that night. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every red light felt far too long, when a car pulled out in front of her- They drove too slow. What felt like hours later did her house finally come into vision. Like a beacon of safety shining for them both. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio pulled into the driveway, not bothering to back in as she normally would. All she wanted was to get Agatha inside, seclude herself in her bedroom and wait for the most terrifying night of her life to be over. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She gently pushed Agatha’s head up, slipping out of the vehicle. This time Rio walked around the back, not trusting Agatha to stay asleep and <em> not </em>lay into the horn this time. Rio would be giving her hell for that move sober or not. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio opened the passenger door, leaning down as she whispered, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“C’mon..”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha groaned, mumbling how she was tired and didn't want to move. Rio ignored her, lifting the woman by her hips to stand up. However, the younger woman started to fall side to side, front and back until Rio finally accepted-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha walking would be impossible, that was for sure. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Shit. Fine.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio mentally counted down from three before hooking one arm under the woman’s legs, the other supporting her back. She couldn’t refrain the little smile on her lips as Agatha’s giggle blew a warm stream of air against her neck, sending chills down her spine. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My heroooo” She mumbled. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She sighed, mumbling a low. “Yeah, something like that”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio struggled to unlock the door, but somehow managed to do so and she was thankful for being able to multitask. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Take that, Wanda. Carrying in all the groceries at once pays off.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nicky greeted them the second she stepped through the threshold. Rio whispered to him to take it easy, not to jump or knock her down while holding Agatha. He was an energetic dog, but luckily listened to Rio well enough to keep his calm. </p>
<p><br/>She maneuvered through the house, careful to not knock Agatha’s legs or head into anything. Nicky stood to the side, tail wagging, eager to sniff the woman up and down as Rio placed her gently on the couch. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I know..” Rio smiled softly at him. “New person, that’s rare isn’t it?” She whispered. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio never brought anyone home. Only Wanda and Natasha were the two regulars to stop by with the occasional Lilia or Alice. Otherwise, no one ever had access into Rio’s home. She kept the house as her sanctuary safe from the outside world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha snuggled into the couch more, unfazed by the little sniffles against her arm. Rio moved to take her boots off, gentle to not wake her up. Just as she put them to the side and turned, Nicky was biting onto the fleece blanket and pulling it down from the top of the couch. He draped it over her body, stepping back, giving a proud smile to Rio who’s jaw dropped. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nicky only ever did that with her. Wanda and Natasha had tried, but he never would budge. The boy had never met Agatha in his entire lifetime and he didn’t hesitate to do something he only ever did for her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Suck up” She whispered, ruffling his hair before pressing a kiss on the top of his head. “Come on, I’ll let you outside before bed” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He ran off to the kitchen, leaving Rio alone to make sure Agatha was secured. She told herself to remember water and a bucket in case she woke up sick. But what caught her eye was Agatha’s phone on the table. It lit up with the notification of her battery running low. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio hesitated, worried taking it may piss Agatha off more than she possibly would in the morning. But, ultimately Rio took it to plug the device in the kitchen. She had a charger right next to the coffee machine, usually saved for her own. But, Agatha would most likely want to order an Uber before she woke up-n That’d be a good excuse to take it to charge it, no?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She opened the door on her way by, letting the boy run free. But as he ran, his leg caught her own and she tripped over with Agatha’s phone flying in the air. Nicky didn’t seem phased, not bothering to turn and make sure Rio hadn’t fallen. Rio usually would joke at him for his selfishness, but she was focused on catching Agatha’s phone in the air and realizing-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was unlocked. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At first, Rio re-locked the phone. She didn't think to snoop or do anything else. There was no point in doing such a thing. But what was something Rio thought to do?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Delete those messages.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She had grabbed a bottle of water, searching for a bowl or bucket to place on the floor by Agatha’s head when the thought abruptly entered her mind. Additional thoughts didn’t waste a second to add themselves on like leeches, ready to suck her dry. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> She’ll hate you even more seeing those.  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> She’ll regret it. </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> Would she quit? No. I can’t let her do that.  </em>
</p>
<p>
<em> She can’t leave.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio looked over her shoulder at the phone sitting on the counter. The device was charging, minding it’s own business and furthermore-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Not my property to do that.. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She shook her head, continuing to open cabinets and walk around the house, searching for the bucket. However with every second, the thought grew stronger- She felt more scared Agatha would actually quit her job and leave out of embarrassment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> I can’t.. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio found the bucket in her bathroom, tucked in the back of her linen closet. She brought both items into the living room, making sure Agatha was still asleep and breathing. Nicky’s paws broke through the silence, tapping against the floor before he jumped up to snuggle himself onto Agatha’s legs. Rio looked over, a tiny grin tugged on her lips as she faked being offended. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Trader” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>She mouthed, leaning down to kiss the top of his head before looking Agatha over one more time. Rio told herself to go to bed, hide in fear for when the woman would sober up and call her a freak, lunatic, every word in the book for bringing her home. Her bedroom would be safe..well, she hoped anyway. </p>
<p><br/>Rio walked through the kitchen, making sure the backyard door was shut and locked. Just as she turned the kitchen light off, Agatha’s phone screen lit up in the darkness with a notification. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> Walk away. Don’t do it.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She bit the inside of her cheeks, nodding to herself as she stormed off to her bedroom. However, Rio only got to the door when her anxiety pushed her back like a gust of wind stronger than nature itself could ever create. The woman almost tripped over her feet to get back to the phone, looking over her shoulder to make sure Agatha wasn’t behind her. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Opening the Instagram app, Rio told herself she wouldn’t delete them all. Just the ones that Agatha may regret, make sure to tell Rio how disgusting those ideas sounded. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “I think if we matched on Tinder” - Deleted. </em>
</p>

<em> “Did you fuck her?” - Deleted. </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> “Why not me?” - Deleted.  </em>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rio exited the app, locking the screen and placed the phone back down. She stepped away, hand over her mouth while the other gripped the end of her sleeve so hard she threatened to tear through the fabric. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agatha Harkness, her worst enemy and slowly becoming her worst crush of a lifetime, passed out drunk on her couch. Rio had just violated her phone, deleted messages that now would live in Rio’s mind alone. She’d have to think about them twenty four seven, being the only one between the two to ever know they existed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her lips parted, jaw slacked as she felt her eyes stinging with tears filled with fear,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
<em> What the fuck did you just do? </em>

<blockquote>
<p>
<em>"I've been in love with her for ages<br/>And I can't seem to get it right<br/>I fell in love with her in stages<br/>My whole life<br/><br/>And that's been the way for me to say<br/>That I felt a certain way in stages, oh<br/>I think the story needs more pages, yes"</em>
</p>
</blockquote><hr/><p>
<span>Slowly, Agatha’s eyes started to blink open, adjusting to the sunlight shining rays beside her. She was partially in the shade, feeling the glow against the side of her face. To her left, a water bottle sat on the coffee table with a bucket on the floor beside it. The atmosphere was peaceful, quiet- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Unfamiliar?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Very, very, unfamiliar. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<span>Agatha felt her fear kick into gear. She pushed herself up, movements frantic as she tried to piece together not only where she was- But, </span>
<em>
<span>how </span>
</em>
<span>she had ended up there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, Agatha didn’t have long before-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh fuck. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She lunged to her side, pulling the plastic bucket to her with one hand while the other gripped the fleece blanket that covered her. Her stomach flipped upside down, inside out, rejecting the remains of what was in her system from the night before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hurled, tossed up spews of vomit, felt her body trembling as she struggled to catch her breath. She was distracted by the chaotic few seconds to register the woman behind her. How she gently pulled her hair back, tying it up in a high bun. The way her hands rubbed her upper back, soothing her through the final few spits until her body finally caught itself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She coughed a few more times, cringing at the aftertaste it left on her tongue- desperate to catch her breath. After a few seconds of silence, the bucket was placed back down on the floor- </span>
</p><p>
<span>That’s when Agatha jumped at the foreign touch. And even worse? A small raspy chuckle came from behind as her hand disappeared from Agatha’s back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well..good morning to you, drunkie” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Holy fuck. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That should tell you how your night went. Bit too much to drink, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned as she stepped around the couch, clicking open the water bottle while she handed it to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was stuck in a trance, lips parted as she still tried to catch her breath from being sick- On top of it now was trying to make sense of Rio standing before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“C’mon, take this” Rio wiggled the water bottle in the air. “It’ll hel-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you think you’re doing?” Agatha asked. “Better yet, where the fuck am I? What is-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Like I said, you had too much to drink last night” Rio shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared wide, lips parted as a little scoffed puffed through them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And so…you took advantage of that and..is this-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes. This is my place” Rio answered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's lips turned into a curl of disgust. </span>
<em>
<span>No. </span>
</em>
<span>Not a chance in hell was she staying put. She wasn’t staying in Rio’s house or on her couch. There was no way Agatha would stick around Rio any longer. After everything, the last thing she needed was to be near her. That choice would be considered self harm in her eyes.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She snickered, muttering a low. “I’m out of here”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And with a spring board shooting her up in the air, Agatha went to push herself up abruptly to her feet, flying out the door at lightning speed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, that move was abruptly cut short. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha winced as she dropped back onto the couch. She squeezed her eyes shut, head falling into the palm of her hands. Her skull wasn’t just aching. It was full on </span>
<em>
<span>screaming</span>
</em>
<span> a loud, fierce amount of pain. She felt off balance, room dizzy while her stomach threatened to make her sick all over again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Okay..so maybe running away wasn’t in her deck of cards. But, she sure as shit had it in her to tell Rio off. Even if the hangover was wrecking her entire being, emotional pain and anger ran off their own generator.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re insane..” Agatha snickered, running a hand through her hair before shooting a glare up at her. “Taking advantage of an intoxicated woman. Don’t you know I can’t consent and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my god” Rio laughed in disbelief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She closed the water bottle, tossing it into Agatha’s lap, making the woman jump in her seat. Rio crossed her arms against her chest. She pulled her lips back, nibbling on them. But when Agatha’s lips parted to speak again, Rio beat her to it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For starters, we didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>. Don’t get your hopes up”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her body shiver and it wasn’t from being sick, but because those words sparked something in her mind. She felt the memory flicker in spurts of texting words that included </span>
<em>
<span>‘Fuck’ </span>
</em>
<span>and </span>
<em>
<span>‘Rio’ </span>
</em>
<span>but couldn’t quite place them. The night before was still fuzzy, not quite clear to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I didn’t tell her I want that..right?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Second- You were fucking wasted, Agatha. I didn’t bring you here to take advantage of you, idiot. I know you hate me and everything, but I am not that kind of disgusting freak”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman subtly nodded. She couldn’t argue with Rio there. Even with her anger and resentment, Rio wasn’t an evil being. A reason Agatha fell hard despite Rio’s continuous hatred for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was kind, soft. A gentle hearted woman right down to her core. Everyone may give her shit for being stubborn and driven, for living by her work. However, every single person who’d ever landed within a foot of Rio Vidal knew- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s an angel. A stupid, fucking, angel. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course, Rio took in Agatha drunk off her ass even after their fight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course, Agatha was hungover on her couch with a water bottle in her lap and a bucket of vomit in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course, Rio held her hair back and soothed her through getting sick without a blink of an eye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course, she's the one fucking asshole who’d ever take care of me like this. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fucking hell. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Third-” Rio held her finger up. “My friend owns the bar you were hanging out at. She called me to tell me you were drunk off your ass”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>And, that was a lie.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Too hungover to question how Lou knew Rio and Agatha were co workers, enemies, whatever they were- She just let the explanation slide, not bothering to press on the answer more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead, her head tipped back as she pinched the bridge of her nose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gotta’ be kidding me..” Agatha muttered, running a hand through her hair before puffing out a tiny laugh. “You’re insane,” She muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Insane?” Rio asked. “Some people say </span>
<em>
<span>thank you</span>
</em>
<span> instead, just a thought”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, looking around to find her phone. She muttered a few curse words, about to snap and ask Rio where it was. Though as if Rio read her mind, she cleared her throat to earn the woman’s attention. Held in the air before her was her phone, followed by the amused grin from the woman holding it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gimme’ that” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha muttered, reaching up to snatch it from her. However, she missed as Rio held it back with a little, stupid, annoying, giggle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ri-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I even charged your phone for you. Don’t I deserve a thank you somewhere, Ms Harkness?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Ms Harkness? That’s new..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Waitingggg” Rio sang. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh this woman is-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re really fucking irritating” Agatha said through gritted teeth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned with a hand over her heart. “Awe! Now you know how I’ve felt for the last three years!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh. I’m fucking sure. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sooo,” Rio waved her phone back and forth as if Agatha was a dog and Rio was holding a bone. “What do we say for taking care of you, charging your phone and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re an asshole”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mm, close!” Rio hummed. “Come on, you can do it. </span>
<em>
<span>Be a good girl for me</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Be a…be a wha-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swiped her tongue on the inside of her cheek, slowly licking from bottom to top. She never took her eyes away from Agatha’s, appearing unphased for the two words she dared to say. Agatha on the other hand felt her entire body light on fire. A match was set and placed on a river of gasoline, scorching through her in a matter of seconds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Was Rio doing this on purpose? Did the fuzzy memory of those texts Agatha sent the night before actually exist? What did Rio know and how the </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span> would she survive being trapped until she felt strong enough to leave?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took in a deep breath, muttering a low. </span>
<em>
<span>“Thank. You.” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman above beamed brighter than the sun. She tossed the phone on Agatha’s lap, smiling wide as she chirped a way too loud for a hangover headache to hear-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re welcome!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha cringed, feeling the pulse in her head pound with an ache a bit harder. She thought peacefulness would finally come. THe phone was in her hands, Uber app pulled up to save her from this hell hole. But then, temptation creeped upon her. An offering that sounded far too good to pass up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Want a cup of coffee?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snickered. “You planning on poisoning me with it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The offer sounded beautiful and Agatha felt the blissful taste of coffee on her tongue, but..she couldn’t show Rio that excitement. She was already giving her hell left and right as it was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “Yes, you caught me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She put her hands up in surrender, feigning theatrics that nearly mirrored the ones Agatha always gave her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Making sure you're safe and taken care of is all a ploy, a con! Just to poison your sorry ass” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, narrowing her eyes on the woman with an annoyed, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You're enjoying this too much” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Agatha, as long as your hungover ass is on my couch-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leaned down, a smirk wider than the devil's while her voice deepened into something low. A raspy tone that sent shivers down Agatha’s spine.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm just getting started..” Rio winked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And as if Rio was never in her orbit, far too close to her as she sped through every warning and stop sign- The woman pulled back before Agatha was able to take a breath. She hummed a soft tune while walking away, leaving Agatha to close her eyes and take a heavy sigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s killing me. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This hangover won’t be the death of me- Rio will fucking be. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She opened her phone, checking messages first. Only Billy had sent her a few about how his Tinder date was going. The latest update being he left early because the boy made him uncomfortable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit” Agatha muttered to herself, thumbs tapping across the keyboard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Usually when dates went bad, Agatha was his savior. She’d show up unannounced without Billy’s request to drag him away. Sometimes she’d fake an emergency, other times she just took him away while the date was in the bathroom. Anytime Billy didn’t feel safe, Agatha would shoot out of bed- Even in her pajamas to get to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And this time, she was too busy drinking away every piece of Rio. Well, tried anyway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sent a small text about how they’d talk soon and to delete the app for now. It wasn’t worth putting himself through date after date when he still had that other boy on his mind. Agatha knew far too well a string of hook ups, useless dates to try and ignore that certain someone made things worse. At least, for her it did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just as she hit send, a plastic package smacked against her phone. She jumped, head snapped to the source with a pain that shot like a million bullets. Rio was opening a bottle of pain meds, not paying attention to her as she still hummed that stupid, annoying, tune. Agatha looked down, flipping the package over,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That doesn’t look like coffee” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was a purple toothbrush, her favorite color. Did Rio do that on purpose? No. Not a chance. Why would she?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, so you like the taste of vomit on your tongue?” Rio asked, snapping her fingers right after. “Right! How could I forget the </span>
<em>
<span>delicious </span>
</em>
<span>combination of vomit and coffee!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scrunched her nose, hating being reminded of what happened the second she woke up. Rio handed her the two pills of aspirin. Agatha took it without an argument or even a thank you. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bathroom is the first door on the left, can’t miss it” Rio directed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leaned down to grab the bucket and this time, Agatha wasn’t arguing in a malicious or annoyed way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, no- I’ve got that, Rio. Seriously, I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shut it” Rio ordered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Embarrassment wasn’t only covering Agatha’s tone, but she physically felt it taking over the hangover’s pain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From passing out drunk on her enemy’s couch, waking up sick and hungover in the same spot- And now Rio, the woman who was her enemy and someone she couldn’t stop falling in love with cleaning up her vomit..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Toothpaste is on the sink” Rio said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She paused with the bucket held in her hand by her side as Agatha’s cheeks tainted a deep shade of red. The way she looked down, fiddling with the toothbrush packet in her hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha..” Rio softened, offering a tiny smile. “I clean up dog shit and vomit. I really won’t blink an eye over this. Besides, don’t need you getting sick from cleaning up your own vomit”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha puffed out a small laugh. One that was weak and filled with defeat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“C’mon now,” Rio kicked her foot out, softly tapping it against Agatha’s leg. “Go brush your teeth, splash some water on your face. It’ll help”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio continued to hum as she walked away, leaving Agatha to debate getting up or to stay put. Ultimately, the aftertaste of sour, bitter, with leftover whiskey (Or, she was probably just imagining that) won. She pushed to her feet to patter down the hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The bathroom was easy to find as Rio told her it would be. She shut the door behind her, giving herself the privacy to use the toilet and wash up. Her bladder was emptied, teeth brushed, face soaked in cold water and dried off- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha caught herself staring at her own reflection. Pale skin, darkened eyes with heavy bags underneath. Her hair was a wreck, clothes wrinkled and worn out. </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha </span>
</em>
<span>was worn out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Is this rock bottom? </span>
</em>
<span>She wondered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn’t an alcoholic, but she was self destructive. After the first week of silence and barely ever seeing Rio, the fight they had in the parking lot- She felt herself slowly losing every glue, every thread, all the bricks that kept her wall together being destroyed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>How can I be heartbroken over someone that was never mine to begin with?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She asked herself that question every now and then, but now it was more than ever. Like clockwork, intuition on the other woman’s part as if she knew Agatha was starting to think of her- Two knocks on the bathroom door snapped her back into reality. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha cleared her throat, rolling her shoulders back as she hung the hand towel back up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you want?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have a set of more comfortable clothes if you want” Rio offered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Why?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The one word started to scream in her mind. Had Rio lost it or was this some wicked vivid dream? Their fight on Friday was brutal, Rio made it clear she wished things would have been different. She said the words that made Agatha freeze and cry driving home that night. How she thought them never talking, meeting, should have been the way everything was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So why the hell was she being nice all of the sudden?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha reached out, ripping the door open with a rough,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you doing this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth had moved to say something, but shut as Agatha took the floor instead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stood with a neatly folded set of clothes in her arms. What looked like a black hoodie, green sweatpants underneath. Agatha knew deep down they didn’t look comfortable solely because she was exhausted, hungover, and her clothes from the night before felt disgusting. Reality was, they were Rio’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The thought of not only being in Rio’s home, on her couch, staying the night even if the memory of it was fuzzy- But to add on wearing her clothes? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m signing my death certificate if I agree to this. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “I hate hangovers” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared, eyes squinted for a few seconds before a tiny scoff,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay? We all do, so why are you-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio muttered something incoherent under her breath. A few words not spoken in English. Agatha only heard her speak Spanish a few times over the three years of knowing her, but </span>
<em>
<span>fuck. </span>
</em>
<span>She’d be lying if she said it didn’t make Rio hotter than she already was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What was that?” Agatha asked, trying her best to stay angry and cold. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sighed. “Just…take these, alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio..” Agatha laughed. “Answer the fucking question”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you questioning someone helping you? Huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because said person just wished we never spoke or met in the first place” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “First part, yes. But I never said that about us ever meeting-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh!” Agatha nodded. “Right. K’, that makes it so much better” She rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman’s head looked away, fiddling with the fabric of her hoodie. She started to teeter side to side, rocking on her feet while sticking her tongue in cheek. Agatha felt her own aggressive demeanor weaken. She’d blame the hangover before ever admitting taking pity on Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sighed, running a hand through her hair. “I’m just confused”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio huffed with a nod. “Ditto”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What is that supposed to mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked up, staring for a few lingering moments. Agatha knew they were close. The woman felt it in her bones they were stepping towards an answer, a line that she never thought would be crossed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But then, like a buzzer that declined what Agatha ever wanted- The coffee maker beeped in the kitchen. Both of them jumped subtly in their spot, Rio’s head whipped over before back at Agatha. She nervously chuckled, shoving the clothes against Agatha’s chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So uh, how do you take your coffee? You know what! You always choose my order against my will so…payback for that. K’, cool. Uh, just- I’ll be- Head to the living room after if you want”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And as if Rio was never there, she rushed down the hall and disappeared back in the kitchen. She left Agatha holding onto the clothes, staring wide as she muttered under her breath, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I like my coffee with answers..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stepped back, shutting the door while placing the clothes on the edge of the sink. Her phone lit up, distracting her for just a few seconds. It was Billy sending a meme of a sad gif. Some kid walking before falling face first. She scoffed, quickly shooting back how the boy he adored was missing out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Though before putting her phone back down, she opened Instagram to check the reels Alice had sent her. Yet…that never happened. Her heart sank, finding Rio’s last message being a simple,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Agatha?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tapped the screen, feeling sick with anxiety as she saw her own messages one after the other. She scrolled up through them, quickly noticing how Rio lied to her moments prior. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lou never called Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t know they knew each other. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio not only was searching for her, but Agatha had texted her drunk off her ass. Agatha wasn’t sure which one was worse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wait..” She whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Don’t tele” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She nibbled on her bottom lip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Don’t tell who..what? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The one above that caught her eye was even more confusing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’m sorry I should nt say”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shouldn’t say what?” She asked herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The first half of the messages were in order and made sense. However the second half?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Something is off…</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She felt the fuzzy memories of drunken messages hit her. The ones Agatha had been questioning their existence or not. And like a punch, an explosion-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh fuck” She muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They all registered in her mind, beeping with a scanner each time they appeared. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I think if we matched on Tinder” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Wasting time on you” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Would you be jealous if I fucked her?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’d rather fuck you” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Did you fuck her?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Why not me?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped her phone on top of the clothes. She pressed the back of her hand over her mouth, the other gripping her hip with such force she threatened to crush the bone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Those messages were real. Their placements lined up the drunken mess of texts perfectly. Puzzle pieces scattered that slotted into their spots in order. Agatha had sent the most damning texts of her lifetime. Ones she’d regret for eternity. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But, she deleted them. How on earth did she delete those? </span>
</p><p>
<span>For starters, Agatha knew herself well enough to know when she was too far gone. Drunk texting the enemy you hopelessly had fallen for was a clear enough sign. Not remembering exactly how she ended up on Rio’s couch? Another. Both of them told her over and over the same thing.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I couldn’t have deleted these..</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>There’s no way I was drunk texting her and remembering to delete them.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, hand running through the tangled mess of hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How..” She muttered. “I-”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I even charged your phone for you. Don’t I deserve a thank you somewhere, Ms Harkness?”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice echoed in her mind. Agatha thought those words over, thinking about how she kept her phone unlocked right after. Billy always said that was a poor decision, but she never cared. No one was ever around to have a reason to take her phone. If some criminal who stole her shit wanted to, he wouldn’t find anything interesting either in her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She deleted them..she-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha started to nervously laugh under her breath. She paced back and forth in the tiny bathroom, tugging at the roots of her hair- threatening to yank them out of her skull. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, two reasons..one could be true and the other night” She whispered to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t uncommon for Agatha to ramble on to herself. Sometimes her thoughts were too loud to keep locked in her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She either hates you texted those or thought I was lying. Drunk off my ass, yeah. That…that could be, but, but, but oh- Shit, shit” She cursed to herself, leaning back as she smacked her thigh a few times. “There’s no way she’d take care of me- Not-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, voice cutting off as two words rang in her mind,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Good girl”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That was flirting” She muttered to herself, but then shook her head. “No” She scoffed with a pathetic laugh. “She wouldn’t…but she never has talked to me like that before. She never-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This was a mess. One giant fucking mess Agatha had no idea where to find the cleaning supplies for. At the rate they were going, bleach and a mop didn’t exist. Agatha knew she was being left to her own devices to clean this up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked back at the clothes, feeling her flannel and jeans far too tight. Agatha was already suffocating in fear and adrenaline, confusion piling on top of everything else. For a split moment, she debated getting an Uber and the hell out of here but…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Good girl. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was a clear indication of flirting. Agatha may live in a state of denial at times, but she knew the meaning of what was said. And the fact Rio had never spoken to her like that before? If those texts were real (Which Agatha was 110% they were) and all of the sudden, Rio was using those words? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She thought as well how minutes ago, Rio almost said something- Gave her just a hint of an answer, but that stupid fucking coffee maker took it away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck it. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn’t going to run from this. What more damage could staying possibly do? She was already drowning, sinking past the ocean floor over every little thing about Rio. Rio on the other hand would easily slip back into hating her and would expect another weekend to be forgotten. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stripped her clothes, folding them into a pile before pulling on the set Rio gave her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The pants were soft, comfortable and fit perfectly. No issue there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The hoodie? There was one major issue and it most certainly was not how it fit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck..” Agatha muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The smell of Rio swallowed her, stole her, took her in like she was its next victim. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She always loved the cologne that could only be described as an apple, woodsy smell. But her clothes? Agatha never knew how comforting, addictive, better than that stupid cologne it could smell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The soft laundry detergent laced with an earthy, sweet, grounding fragrance that instantly calmed the storm raging inside of her. She lowered her head, gripped the edge of the sink to catch her breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>God, I hate her..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t, she really fucking didn’t. What Agatha hated was even with the pain Rio inflicted on her, how the last three years had been an endless hell- The stupid smell of her clothes could ease every inch of the adrenaline in her. How being in her home was comforting even through the urge to run at any given moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And she hated her for deleting those texts and not knowing why. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked back up in the mirror, taking in a deep breath and mentally counting down to get back out there. The smell of coffee lingering through the door helped with the motivation to do so.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Five. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Just gotta’ figure out what the motive was for that. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Four. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Also why the hell she’s taking care of me.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Three. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Worst comes to worse, I just quit my job and leave the country. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Two. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She already hates me, fuck it. I can’t make it worse than it already is. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>One. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Showtime. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed herself back up, grabbing her clothes off the sink before leaving the room. She nearly stormed down the hall, stomping with determination in every step. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just as she entered the living room, Rio was sitting on the other end of the couch with the coffee mug in her hand. She looked up, offering it to her as she spoke,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, coffee for-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Liar!” Agatha exclaimed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Great start. Maybe should’ve planned this out more. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused, eyebrows furrowed over the word.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh,” She looked in the mug, shaking her head. “Nope. Definitely coffee” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If your friend called you..” Agatha held her phone up with a low smile. “Why did you interrogate me on my whereabouts?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s cheeks burned, shading a deep flush that Agatha swore she felt the heat radiating off of from across the room. She looked down, leaning forward to rest the coffee on the table. It was clear Agatha had caught her in a lie and Rio knew it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Now..this is fun. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha thought to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know, I was going to question how Lou knew we were…what? Co workers? Enemies? Besties-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, rolling her eyes as she sat back. She folded her arms against her chest, clearly unamused by Agatha’s words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But when I opened these messages- It all clicked!” Agatha grinned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know, you are far too giddy for the one who drunk texted me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, but!” Agatha held her finger up, taking slow steps over to the couch. “I did not lie about how you found me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>And deleted those messages, but…we’ll get to that. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio watched her every move carefully, evidently more nervous by the second. With every word, every step- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you want the stupid coffee or not?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oo, feisty” Agatha smirked. “What? Don’t like being caught in a lie?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe I was just trying to make you feel better. Save your ego from feeling the damage of drunk texting me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh honey..” Agatha rasped with a small grin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leaned down to pick the coffee mug up, her body just a few inches away from Rio’s. Agatha mirrored the scene Rio had given her prior. Where she had leaned over her, saying how she was just getting started before rushing away as if she was never there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Could that be classified as flirting too? </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha wondered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her head turned, lips curled into a dangerous smile that made Rio sink into the couch a bit more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You came running to my rescue. Think your ego is taking a stronger hit over mine”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swiftly pulled away, dropping on the other end of the couch with a proud grin. One full of herself that earned a glare from the other woman. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She took a sip of the coffee, about to boast about how Rio making her the cup was another thing to ruin her ego. However, the taste silenced her and not in a bad way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The coffee wasn’t just good, no…it was, </span>
<em>
<span>perfect. </span>
</em>
<span>Better than Agatha made it for herself or any barista she went to. She took another sip, and then another, about to find the strength to tease Rio again. The little snicker on her left beat her to it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So? Did I guess your order right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed the liquid with a shake of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Two spoonfuls of sugar, bit of milk and a little bit of caramel,” Rio listed the recipe off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s right. God dammit.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “Your ego should feel damaged knowing that”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Interesting way of saying I’m right” Rio smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, letting the silence linger for a bit. Rio had pulled her phone out as Agatha studied the plants around the room. All bright green, names she didn’t know- Only described as plants or </span>
<em>
<span>creatures </span>
</em>
<span>in Rio’s world. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She knew she should press more on why Rio lied, but those deleted drunk text messages started to shove their way to the forefront of everything else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Part two, get a move on. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha encouraged herself to continue on while she could. Courage was always something Agatha could easily lose. She knew she had to get a move on, take advantage of it before the feeling was stripped away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I feel like I texted you about other things…did I?” She blurted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Out of the corner of her eye, Rio was frozen. Her thumbs that had been texting on her screen had come to a stop. She didn’t look up, not a word or movement. The woman was at a complete stand still, a statue with a title, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I deleted them. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha slowly nodded, taking another sip from her coffee. Two options were in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Option A - Let Rio lie her way out of this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Or, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Option B - Call her out on it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nope” Rio lied, popping the p as she pushed back into being nonchalant. No more fear or embarrassment like before. “Just drunken messages about how drunk you were, all that jazz”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Jazz? </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha laughed in her mind. </span>
<em>
<span>Jesus, you’re a terrible liar. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hm” Agatha hummed. “Well-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before she was able to continue on, Agatha felt a wave of nausea crash like ocean waves over her. She winced, leaning forward to rest the coffee mug on the table and pull her knees up to her chest. Her eyes shut, hands covering her face as she tried to ride it out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stomach again?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn't be bothered with sarcasm at that moment. Instead she muttered a low, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nauseous” Agatha muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio locked her phone, placing it down on the table not far from Agatha’s phone. Her body shifted a bit, elbows resting on her knees as her fingers picked the skin off her thumbnail. She bounced her knee, clearly stuck in a small debate, a battle in her mind. If Agatha didn’t feel so sick, wasn’t focused on coming down from the feeling- She’d make fun of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wanna’ smoke?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The question caught Agatha off guard stronger than waking up in Rio’s house did. She looked up, finding a tiny smirk shining bright her way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It helps..” Rio shrugged. “I have some light shit. Not strong enough to get you super stoned, but…it’ll ease your stomach” Rio explained, but then snapped her fingers with a fast “Oh! But side effects may include wanting to order food” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to not smile. She really, </span>
<em>
<span>really, </span>
</em>
<span>fucking tried. But, the little smirk, snap of her fingers with the tiny side effect she included. God. She hated how stupid Rio’s cuteness was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A little grin escaped from the restraints. She whispered a low, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I never argue free weed” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who said it’s free?” Rio questioned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile faded, embarrassment control all over again. She sounded selfish, ashamed of thinking Rio would just smoke her up for free after being such a bitch since she opened her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood up, a warm grin took over the smirk as she pointed,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your payment will be ordering us food”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her body relax into the couch, she took a small breath, letting go of the shame that was threatening to control her. Slowly, she nodded. A little shrug as she rasped a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That can be arranged”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. “We have a deal then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop stalling and medicate me” Agatha ordered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bossy” Rio held her hands up as she walked away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She picked her phone back up, opening Facebook to scroll through the mess of those posts. Old memes, people in their town group complaining about different neighbors (Agatha did enjoy those the most), but it only kept her mind busy for a few moments. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The giant elephant in her brain grew larger and stronger, spelling out the words, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>We won’t be sober. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blew out a quick stream of air from her nostrils. She put her phone down, pinching the bridge of her nose.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I really should just leave. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>We didn’t even get to finish- Did we even talk? Why aren’t we finishing anything?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio wouldn’t answer her question from before. Agatha had caught her in two lies, but nothing was completed or sorted from that. And now they were just going to smoke as if nothing ever happened? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I gotta’ get out of-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oof!” Agatha yelled out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked down to the heavy weight that had assaulted her. A wide grin, bad breath, tail wagging back and forth in the air. Agatha knew Rio had a dog, everyone did. But, she had yet to truly meet him until he was right on the couch in her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her worries wash away. Every thought about fleeing disappeared. She reached up, holding both sides of his face as she scratched his ears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, hi there” She grinned. “Aren’t you a cutie?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Completely forgetting where she was, too focused on the dog trying to lick her nose while smiling like a lunatic- Agatha didn’t hear Rio rush back into the living room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit, I'm sorry. I'm so used to leaving the back door open for him to run in and out. He's-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A demon!” Agatha grinned, voice muffled against his fur. “A cute one though, I'd argue” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her forehead against Nicky’s head. She started to speak in a baby voice about how good of a boy he was, how cute and soft his fur was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Rio never knew she could feel so doomed seeing someone with her dog before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's heart stopped at the sight. Agatha sitting up on the couch with her legs tucked under her. Nicky in her lap, both in their own world. How the normally shy puppy’s tail was wagging so fast she wondered if he’d start to float in the air. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It almost felt normal, as if the scene was something that fit their narrative. A story the two were meant to write, a movie they should be in, a life they were meant to live instead of the confusing one they kept on going with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Almost makes up for dealing with your wicked, horrible, insufferable mother” Agatha whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, but was thankful Agatha pulled her away from the spot she was stuck in. She sat down on the other end of the couch, opening the small tin case filled with fresh tiny joints. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Run along” Rio reached over to tap Nicky’s leg. “You can come suffocate her after we smoke”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, kissing the top of his head before sending him off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Such a responsible dog mom, you are” She said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio snickered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” She asked, placing the joint between her lips. “Think my cruelness extends to my son?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned in her spot, elbow rested on the back of the couch with her hand tangled in her hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh god, you’re that kind of person?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She watched as Rio flicked the lighter, bringing the flame to the tip. A stream of smoke clouded around it. The woman laughed, coughing a bit as she choked on the smoke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You just called me a dog mom” Rio said, passing her the joint. “Hypocrite”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, eagerly taking the joint and was quick to take not just a hit- But, a deep one. A long drag that she didn’t know she needed so bad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio moved to grab her phone as Agatha smoked. She pulled up a playlist on Spotify, connecting it to the speakers by the TV. The first song, Dreams by The Cranberries, left Rio thankful it wasn’t anything that could relate to them (Well…so she thought). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How do you know Lou?” Agatha asked, passing the joint back over to Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“College,” Rio shrugged. “You a regular for her?” She smirked a bit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sneered, scrunched nose with a little shake of her head as she mocked, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“You a regular for her? </span>
</em>
<span>Fuck off, Vidal” She muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, taking a slow drag before passing it back to Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“An old fling..” Agatha shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>That was a lie. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha partially blamed the weed even if she didn’t feel its effects quite yet. She wasn’t going to continue on with edging every conversation they had so far. If Agatha was going to sit here smoking with Rio, listening to music and spending time with her all over again- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was going to get all the answers before having to act as if this never happened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jealous?” Agatha dared to ask. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, but it didn’t sound like one with humor. It sounded like a defense. A coping mechanism that was protecting the truth behind it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Totally” She took a deep inhale of the smoke before passing it back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took the joint from her fingers, taking a hit as she replied with a small,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hm”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s hm?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha held the smoke in her lungs as she shook her head. “Not buying it” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. “Good. I’m not selling anything for you to buy”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What a shame” Agatha sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The joint was passed a few more times. Only the music filled the silence, neither dared to say another word. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, the weed started to kick in. Little giggling slipped their lips as Rio stammered,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I uh..” She put the joint in the ashtray before leaning back. Her arms threw back above her head and over the back of the couch. A little laugh as she shook her head. “Fuck”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, a little snort cutting through. She swore the sound that she felt embarrassed over for years, but grew to love made Rio smile harder. But, that was most likely just the weed talking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You what?” She asked, smiling wider by the second. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was about to say something, Agatha swore it. But she just shook her head with a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Getting hungry. Side effect kicking in”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to argue that those weren't the original words, but…she was growing hungry too. Her hand grabbed her phone, both giggling as she nearly dropped it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you thinking?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You” Rio answered as if it was obvious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up, finding Rio quickly clearing her throat with a shake of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You uh, you decide..” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s thinking about..me? Is that what she meant? No..no. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Pancakes sound good” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I would make us those, but..I’m- Yeah, I’m stoned” Rio giggled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t trust your cooking anyway”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gasped, a hand over her heart as she made the loudest face of offense. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ve never even tried!” She exclaimed. “That’s so cruel, Harkness. Such a cruel, </span>
<em>
<span>cruel, </span>
</em>
<span>woman”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled up Doordash on her phone as she laughed harder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Guess you’ll have to cook me dinner sometime” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She said the words without thinking. Once again, she would blame it on weed over ever accepting the truth. What she’d also chalk up to the weed?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hm. Noted” Rio shrugged, holding her hand out. “Gimme’ I wanna’ order my foooood” She sang. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled up the restaurant’s location, handing it over to her as she echoed the word Rio had earlier. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bossy” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>__</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The TV played an episode of Law and Order as they were slouched on the couch, shoulders nearly brushing against one another. The foam containers rustled in their hands, forks stabbing the pancakes as they ate like they never had food before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The uncle did it” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, a mouthful of food as she replied,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! It was the boyfriend!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not a chance”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And what makes you an expert on murder cases? Huh?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe I am one, ever think of that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “So murder me then. Get me away from you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Honey, you’re the one nearly leaning against me”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as she said it, Agatha wished she had kept her mouth shut. Rio pulled away as if she electrocuted her. She shifted to the arm of the couch, putting distance between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Idiot..</span>
</em>
<span>Agatha thought to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The show continued on, the ending felt as if it’d never come. Agatha was trying to wait till the episode was over to say something, figure out a way to continue the conversation from before. However, she knew her high was going away with every bite she took. Eating always stripped her of the blissfulness of being stoned, but hey- Food tasted so much better that way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Maybe it was the fact she was still stoned or maybe since the other conversations hadn’t been finished, Agatha wanted to dive into a new one. Maybe then they could complete it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She took another bite, chewing and swallowing before taking a deep breath in, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was an asshole Friday..” She said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The container of Rio’s food came to a silence. She was in the middle of taking a bite when her fork froze in the air, mouth stayed open ajar before slowly closing. The woman started to stab her food, clearly losing her appetite. Agatha worried for a moment she wasn’t going to say anything, but luckily…she was wrong. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I told you to forget that weekend happened. You did” Rio cut her off with a shrug. “You aren’t an asshole for that” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at her food, surprised Rio faced the decision she had made. She wasn’t sure if Rio would ever own up to being the one to force what happened the last week. If she never kept pushing Agatha to forget that weekend ever happened, she wouldn’t have spent days ignoring her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now the coffee thing? Yeah, okay. Dick move, Harkness. I was looking forward to my evening drink” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman froze, slowly looking up with a smirk. One filled with surprise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, did Professor Vidal who’s always told me to shove that coffee up my ass or told everyone she threw it out…did you just admit to-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re hungover and partially stoned,” Rio argued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sober enough to catch you in a lie, honey” Agatha grinned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their attention returned to the episode- Well, Rio did. Agatha thought that anyway, but..she was too busy thinking to herself how that felt completed. It wasn’t a long, drawn out, hours filled conversation. But, it wasn’t an argument either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t quite figure out the words for how the conversation felt, but it wasn’t bad…that was for sure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So..no comment on my pancakes?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked away from the TV. She knew Rio had ordered double chocolate chip, but looked at the mess of pancakes to confirm it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She slowly smirked. “What? About how boring you are?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gasped, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Double chocolate pancakes are the all time greatest!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They’re boringggg” Agatha drew the word out with a roll of her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Says the one who got what?” Rio leaned over, shoulder nearly brushing against Agatha’s once again. “Strawberry shortcake- Fuck! That’s so gay”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pulled back away and Agatha hated everything all over again, but…she kept up with the conversation. Making sure to not show her energy draining slowly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right, right,” Agatha chuckled. “Because I made it ever so clear I am in fact straight”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, voice softening as she replied, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine. Well, to be fair..I’ve never had strawberry shortcake so-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, a tiny snort laced through again. Rio’s reaction of becoming flustered happened all over again as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So quick to judge something you’ve never had” Agatha shook her head. “Disgraceful, Vidal. Such a disgrace..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The next move was nothing but the weed. Agatha felt out of control. There were invisible strings pulling her limbs as if she were a puppet, being dictated by a stronger being above. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stabbed a piece of her pancake, holding up the fork as she leaned her body over just a few inches. Rio was taking a bite when she looked up, words muffled with the chocolate pancake piece in her mouth,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wot’ are you doin’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What does it look like?” Agatha asked, wiggling the fork in the air. “Do I need to make airplane noises for you to understand?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She watched as Rio swallowed the piece of her own pancake. Her eyes were wide, flickering with the same fear that matched Agatha’s. The unknown, how butterflies swirled around them, limbs and skin vibrating with desire to find something more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For a moment, Agatha could see it. She saw how they both felt the same thing, but then again..maybe it was the weed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio took in a deep breath before leaning forward, lips wrapped around the fork as she slid the soft pink pancake off. The woman leaned back, chewing slowly while fiddling with her own fork more and more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tastes gay, but..” Rio shrugged, looking back up at her. “That could just be the source it was coming from” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Why…why did I encour-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe you should check the source..just to be sure” Agatha whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Holy fuck. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Okay. So, maybe the weed wasn’t the best idea to agree to. Agatha flirted with Rio endlessly for three years, but never this. This was uncharted territory. They stepped over a line, through a door that slammed shut from behind. There was no turning back. She felt the change in the air, a switch was flipped-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>What did I just do?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio cleared her throat, visibly uncomfortable- Well, so Agatha thought. She wasn’t uncomfortable in a bad way. The woman was feeling nervous beyond words. Not even weed or xanax would be able to settle her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sources say said source will say I took advan-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Source has been shamelessly flirting with you for years, idiot” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>K’. No restraints anymore. Awesome. Cool. Maybe shut up while you’re ahead?! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You flirt with everyone,” Rio pointed out.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “Not the way I flirt with you. Thought you were smart enough to figure that out” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman let go of her fork, reaching forward to place the container on the table. She started to find her shoes and wallet, figuring if she was about to run out the door- It wouldn’t hurt to throw words that were sure to lock her in hell for eternity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Plus, those deleted texts of mine should’ve told you too” Agatha tossed over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio felt her heart drop, Agatha nearly heart the organ hit the floor. When she had ahold of her boots, she glanced over to see the brown eyes bulging her way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “Yeah. Knew you deleted them-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wha-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t play dumb with me, Rio!” Agatha snapped. “My phone isn’t locked. Hasn’t been in awhile. You took it to charge it, and magically those messages are gone?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I..I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? Were you disgusted by them? Is that it?” Agatha questioned, not letting up for a second. “You didn’t have to delete them. Jesus. That’s a bit over the line, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Rio reached forward to put her food down, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On the other side of the couch, Rio was locked in a deep state of fear. She felt as if she was watching helplessly, unable to find words or lunge forward to hold Agatha back. The moment felt surreal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s...those texts weren’t-</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Is she saying she wants me? Did she mean-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know you hate me, but this is fucking low” Agatha muttered, tying her one boot up. “You could have just said to me you don’t view me the same. Like. My god, deleting them and then taking care of me like this. It’s all so-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, okay, fine..” Rio sighed. “You’re..right about how I fucking hate you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, that’s smart. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked back over with a flicker of pain. Her eyes narrowed, stinging with the threat of tears as she spat a clipped, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck you, Rio”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, exactly” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio puffed out a weak, nervous laugh. She swallowed the nervous lump in her throat. Her mind had been screaming, begging for her to do something. She just didn’t expect those two words or the following to be the answer. The route she was choosing to take was on a whim with no map to follow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck it. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s why I fucking hate you because that’s what I can’t stop..wanting you to do”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was in the middle of standing up, grabbing her things when the words hit her ears. She froze, movements coming to a stop, but her head slowly turned to find Rio leaning her palms on the couch. Her body was towards her, eyes looking up with a doe filled stare mixed with plea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“To me” Rio adds on like an idiot. “Which..yeah, that was probably clear. I don’t- I didn’t have to clarify that”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t know what to say let alone do. She couldn’t move, tried to tell herself this was all just a really extreme high or maybe a nightmare that had trapped her for life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, as Rio kept talking…Agatha realized this was all real. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I deleted those texts because I thought you’d regret it…maybe you still will if this is all just the weed talking” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nervously laughed, taking a breath as she shook her head. “But, </span>
<em>
<span>shit..</span>
</em>
<span>I can’t stop thinking about them” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Stupid fucking weed. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Why did she even suggest smoking? Rio was smart enough to know weed stripped her of a filter, sent her on nonstop rambles with no barriers to stop her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I fucking hate you because I can’t stop thinking about..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She holds her breath, desperate to stop herself. Yet..she was too far gone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You” Rio exhaled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The silence and staring lasted so long, you’d think they were having a staring contest. When in reality, both were stunned. Neither knew how they got here, it couldn’t be explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On Agatha’s end, she had thought about running and silently cursed how no conversation was finished. Only one felt somewhat secure by the end of it. And now here they were, thrown into confessions and words she never thought they’d hear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And on Rio’s side of things? All she could explain it would be just a little,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Lol. What did I do?” </span>
</em>
<span>She’d ask herself after Agatha inevitably left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn't know what else to say. She stared up at Agatha who’s shoes were on, belongings in her hands, close to ordering an Uber or just walking home- Both sounded horrible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I-” Rio stuttered, unable to find words. “Just-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio..” Agatha shook her head. “I’m tired. Okay? What are you saying? Just tell me, straight up- Do you want me to stay or go?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stared up, feeling her entire body pulse with desire. The answer was clear, but she was unsure if she’d be able to finally say the truth or not. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She opened her mouth to take in a breath before whispering the first word till the others followed suit,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Agatha..”</span>

<span>She sighed, feeling her eyes sting just a hint, tears threatening their arrival.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Agatha?” Wanda questioned her further. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio weakly nodded, but regretted it as the room spun hard. She groaned, turning her head to hide her face against Wanda’s shirt. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I think you’re wrong” She said, lifting a hand to push hair out of Rio’s face. “I don’t think you’d be this much of a drunken mess if she wasn’t meant to be more than just a woman you pretend to hate” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’m not pretendin’ to hate ‘er” Rio lied. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Wanda huffed, a weak smile as she tried to settle the mess beside her. It was rare for Rio to be so completely vulnerable. If she were sober, she’d be stretched across the room- putting more than an arms length between the two. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>The woman knew it wasn’t just the alcohol that shoved her down, completely wrecking her from head to toe. If Agatha was a woman she hated, if Agatha wasn’t something more in Rio’s eyes- She’d be a fun drunk making jokes and tossing insults behind Agatha’s back. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Instead, she was down for the count- spewing lies across her drunken tongue. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Hate her, huh?” Wanda asked. “Sure looks like it” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio weakly nodded. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Mhm” She hummed. “She’s a stupid fuckin’ stupid bitch-”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I know you are,” Wanda snickered. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“What?” Rio lifted her head, eyes half open as her lips were stuck apart. “I’m not-”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“You are a stupid fuckin’ stupid bitch” Wanda recited. “With love, of course, but..look at you” She gestured. “She’s ignored you for not even a full week and you’re half a bottle of whiskey in-”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“This is celebratory! Best week of my life!” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Jesus,” Wanda rolled her eyes. “When will you just accept you lost, Rio? You don’t hate her. You never truly have. She intimidates the hell out of you because you’re clearly out of control and-”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“What?!” Rio yelled, sitting up and away from her. “You suddenly a know it all now?!” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“When it comes to you, yes!” Wanda laughed.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She shook her head, arms folded against her chest while giving Rio the strongest glare of disbelief. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Rio. You’re drunk. I know you may forget or feel this is just some fuzzy memory, ƒƒbut get over yourself. Do something. All you’re doing is hurting yourself more and more by keeping this charade going” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>The woman looked down, picking the skin off her thumb while chewing the inside of her cheek. Even in a drunk state of mind, she knew Wanda was more than right. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Maybe she would forget this conversation by the next morning, but what would remain was the hatred for Agatha Harkness being nothing more than a con. A scam that wasn’t running as well as it used to.  </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“And what if I’m wrong?” Rio asked. “Then what?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Wrong about what? Her feeling the same?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio nodded. She appeared to be a small kid, scared of being in trouble or not being liked by a friend anymore. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Honey..” Wanda softly smiled. “I’ve never steered you wrong on anything. Plus, she wouldn’t go that length to ignore you let alone spend the weekend with you..don’t you think?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio laughed. “I don’t know what to think these days..”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Wanda nodded. “Then don’t think. Just do”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>The woman furrowed her eyebrows, head tilted as she recited the words in a questioning tone.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Don’t think, just do?”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Mhm” Wanda hummed. “Don’t think. Just do” She echoed. </span>
</em>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“Don’t think, just do..” Rio muttered under her breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What did you just say?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked back up, the memory stuck in a haze disintegrating from her. Abruptly, Rio had been kicked back into the present. Instantly remembering the word that landed her there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha. </span>
</em>
<span>She had said barely a few moments prior. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The name was heavy, weighed and felt stronger on her tongue than ever before. Rio wasn’t saying the name casually. No annoyance, state of vexation. Hesitation still remained, but there was a charge surging through it, forcing Rio to go in a direction she never dared to venture off to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pulled her lips back, nibbling on them as her fingers grasped the texture of the couch. She felt her body start to shiver. If she were to stand, her feet would break as the world felt off balance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Say something. Anything. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know how uh, I tell you to fuck off?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Wrong thing, dumbass..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, shaking her head. “Got it..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman walked off, leaving Rio to jump up in a panic as she called out, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit, shit- Agatha!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She threw a laugh back at her, not giving a moment to let Rio explain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio, you're referencing your trademark. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck off, Harkness? </span>
</em>
<span>Yeah. Message taken, point clear. I'll be seeing myself out”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For a woman stoned and hungover, she moved fast when she wanted to. However, Rio was right behind her. Running, jumping around the corners, lunging across the entry way- Agatha had pulled the front door open, Rio’s arm extended as her palm smacked with a stinging sensation to slam it shut. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio, I swear to God. Get the hell away from me or I’ll-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned on her heel, trying to ignore how close Rio was- The way her arm brushed against her shoulder. Agatha tried to shove her back, escape as if Rio was threatening to kidnap her. Though the way Rio stared, her breath had a panicked pattern…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Is she holding me back to stay?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Suddenly, the atmosphere between them felt different. Throughout the day, it had swayed like a boat in the ocean. Swinging left to right, crashing upon the waves. Though, this didn’t compare. There were no words, metaphors, explanations to describe what the air had turned into. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, avoiding Rio’s eyes pouring into her own. It was for her own good. She needed to get out, run away to safety.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let me go..” She muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, not hesitating to exhale a desperate, “No” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Now what? </span>
</em>
<span>Both asked themselves in their own minds, unsure where to go from here. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was close to shoving Rio away, ripping the door open and slamming it shut behind her without a care if Rio got caught in the middle. She didn’t care if her arm, leg, any limb got crushed in the doorframe. Agatha wanted out. She didn't want to play their stupid game any longer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And surprisingly, Rio didn’t either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t do this, Rio. I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck” Rio whispered, barely audible for Agatha to hear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Don’t think, just do. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before she was able to question it, press on the word and why Rio had said it- Agatha’s back collided against the door, her head bounced as a warm sensation was pressed on her cheek. She hissed, eyes closed before snapping open, about to ask what the hell Rio’s problem was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Until the unimaginable happened. It </span>
<em>
<span>finally fucking happened. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips crashed against Agatha’s in a bruising manner. Their teeth smacked, sure to pierce a tiny bit of skin on both sides. They’d barely notice the subtle metallic taste of blood. It’d be disguised by their disbelief, the sudden explosive desire that’d been waiting to burst for three years. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The kiss didn’t last long enough for Agatha’s liking. Rio had pulled away after a few seconds, leaving Agatha's body leaning forward in a desperate chase, feeling the hand on her cheek slither down to press against her sternum. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pushed her back just an inch, enough for their eyes to meet again. Agatha pouted, pupils blown as she silently begged Rio to kiss her again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just..” Rio cut her off, shaking her head. “Tell me when we’re sober, this won’t change. You won’t regret this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed hard after asking Agatha to reassure her. Her mind raced, trying to figure out if the few second kiss had really happened or not. The taste of strawberry pancakes was on her tongue, Agatha looking bewildered and utterly desperate before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took a second before her lips curled up, letting out a broken laugh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve only been trying to make this happen for years now” She said, bringing a hand up to push through Rio’s hair, muttering a low, “God, for the smartest professor I’ve ever met- You’re still such a complete and total fucking moron”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio puffed out a small laugh. “Still insulting me even through a compliment. Course, why am I not surpri-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, honey..you love it and you know it” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her voice was stern as the blue eyes darkened. A deeper shade that screamed a threat for Rio to jump back while she still had a chance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t dare to move a muscle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I hate you, actually…in case you, uh..haven’t gotten the memo” She whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand moved down slowly, fingers wrapped around the nape of her neck- curling themselves into the roots of Rio’s hair. She flickered her eyes between the brown orbs that would lock her in for life more than ever- Back to Rio’s lips, the ones Agatha had craved for years, but now would desperately need as a lifeline to keep her heart beating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You have a funny way of showing it, Vidal’ Agatha mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands both moved in sync, roaming down Agatha’s sides until they rested on her hips. She applied a slight amount of pressure. Enough that she watched Agatha’s breath hitch, eyes widened as she found Rio’s stare all over again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do I?” Rio questioned with slight amusement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, standing up taller as she pointed out, “You kissed me, idiot” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The other woman shrugged, tracing her thumbs over the waistband of her sweatpants before letting her thumbs slip beneath them. Right in front of her hip bones, pressing against the skin as she rubbed tiny little circles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah..I guess I did just do that” Rio whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She bit her bottom lip down, pulling it back before letting go to whisper a confession that felt like a sin. One so sweet, but felt damning at the same time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I want to do it again..” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Slowly, Agatha grinned. Although, the slow pace only lasted so long. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pushed herself forward, both hands moved to hold either side of Rio’s neck- thumbs pressed into her cheeks. The container of pancakes in her hand dropped to the floor, keys, wallet, and phone all following suit. She didn’t care if her phone screen was shattered or the mess of pancakes on the floor was left for Nicky to clean up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>(Agatha would stress and feel awful for risking a chance he’d get sick. Rio on the other hand would simply laugh, reassuring her he had gotten into much worse before and survived)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her lips were attached with Rio’s once again. The hint of chocolate and strawberry mixed together, saliva soaked their lips, little moans vibrated into each other. Just as Rio’s tongue peaked through, Agatha pulled back with a smirk to rush the little giggle bubbling within her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Beat you to it” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled Rio back against her before she could argue, gasping as Rio didn’t hesitate to slip her hands up underneath her hoodie. But the tease, cheeky woman Rio was (Something Agatha would learn more and more overtime)- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pulled away, making sure the softly bite down on Agatha’s bottom lip to drag back with her until letting go, rasping a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you really making this out to be a competition right now?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes closed, jaw slightly ajar as she felt her entire body shiver from head to toe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio tisked, shaking her head as she whispered, “And you wonder why I’ve hated you for years..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Neither had any more words to say. The torment of waiting three years, the past week, all built up to the point of overflow. They pulled and pushed, holding each other so close their bodies barely had space between them- if any. Their feet shuffled across the floorboards, barely careful to avoid bumping into any furniture or walls as they made their way back into the living room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was so focused on how Agatha’s tongue danced with her own. They glided, tasted, devoured every inch- exploring the forbidden land. She barely thought about how their mouths were only a tiny corner of each other. The woman would drown in disbelief when the second clothes were shedded, lips and hands were able to navigate into uncharted areas. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The back of her legs hit the couch before feeling Agatha’s weight push her down. She whimpered at the loss of her lips, looking up to see the woman panting above. Only one thought entered Rio’s mind as she studied the way Agatha was looking down at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s going to kill me.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>fuck, </span>
</em>
<span>Rio had never been so suicidal before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her hands gently held Agatha’s thighs, roaming up the sides till she barely touched her hips. Within a split second, Agatha had gripped them with roughness that swore to leave bruises on her bones. Rio barely had a chance to breathe or make sense of what happened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>All she knew was her back had hit the couch, Agatha’s body hovered above, Rio’s wrists pinned over her head. She arched her back, stretching out her spine as she pressed her front against Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know,” Agatha whispered. “Typically, I don’t fuck on the first date, but..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She used her free hand to pin Rio’s back on the couch again. Her hand was an anchor, holding Rio down like it was her job. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Counting last weekend, flirting with you endlessly for three years-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Fuck me, Harkness” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The opposite of her trademark. Three words that nearly sent Agatha into overdrive with no brakes to press pedals into.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That was the opposite. Hence the reference” Rio clarified, but realized a second after. “Shit, uh..I probably didn’t have to clarify that. Fuck. Did I just kill the mood? I did, didn’t I? I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The hand on her hip left, not going far as her next destination was wrapped around Rio’s neck. Agatha applied just enough pressure to cut the rambling woman’s words off into a gasp. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, watching Rio’s lips part into a small ‘O’ shape. She shook her head, leaning down till her lips ghosted against Rio’s to whisper, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio..” She teased a chaste kiss, brushing their noses together before pulling away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their eyes locked as Agatha’s thumb moved up to press against Rio’s lips. A gesture that screamed for Rio to be silent. She waited a few seconds, making sure Rio wasn’t going to say anything else before she asked, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you still talking?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sound her question pulled out wasn’t the silence Agatha was asking for, but </span>
<em>
<span>fuck, fuck, FUCK! </span>
</em>
<span>She wouldn’t argue in the slightest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio whimpered. She fucking </span>
<em>
<span>whimpered </span>
</em>
<span>and Agatha could’ve never imagined how beautiful a sound could be. Sure, she had daydreamed and wondered over the last three years what Rio sounded like in bed. However, none of it compared to the real deal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Though, that silence didn’t last long. Rio put on a tiny grin after a few moments, bringing up a question of her own, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you still not fucking me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile faded, but not into something harmful or negative. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“God, you’re annoying” Agatha muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you still aren’t doing anything about it” Rio pushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman above chuckled in a dark, raspy tone. A stomach flipping nature that felt like a heat wave through their bodies. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So..” Agatha hummed. “Professor Vidal is not only a brat, but a bottom? Well, isn’t this an intriguing surprise” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio huffed, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Making assumptions is awfully brave. Especially since you still haven’t done a damn thing abou- </span>
<em>
<span>Oh!” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed the front of her thigh between Rio’s legs. She parted them, feeling warmth instantly. She grinned like a mad woman over the sensation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Begging, pleading, and obviously so </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> wet- I can nearly feel you soaking yourself through your own pants and mine” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She chuckled, not wasting a moment to let go of Rio’s wrists and hip. Slowly she moved, like a sloth climbing down Rio’s body. Her hands pushed Rio’s shirt up, exposing skin that looked softer than the fleece blanket beside them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, dipping her head down to leave kisses over her stomach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Every movement was slow, delicate, unlike what she always thought would be. The woman figured they’d fuck purely out of hate. Everything would be aggressive, fast, a charged energy that’d leave them broken and battered by dawn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, it was different. Something she felt was unordinary, but so beautiful at the same time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They didn’t need to speak for Rio to push up just enough to slip the shirt off, leaving her topless underneath Agatha’s gaze. She grinned as the piece of clothing was tossed somewhere in the room. Maybe it’d land on the coffee table, TV stand, floor or wherever- it didn’t matter. Not when Rio’s breasts were exposed. Another image Agatha had imagined and wondered about over and over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No bra,” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha whispered, running her hands up her skin to brush the edge of her tits before pulling back. She repeated the pattern until Rio was nearly squirming underneath her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Were you hoping for this, sweetheart?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio weakly scoffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Says the one who’s flirted with me for years. I’d say you’re the desperate </span>
<em>
<span>one!” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She inhaled a strong breath the second Agatha’s palms ran over her nipples, fingers grasping with nails digging into her skin. Rio tipped her head back, fingers tangling in Agatha’s hair as the woman’s lips wrapped around the sensitive bud on her right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha switched back and forth, worshipping and giving attention to them both as if they were their own beings who needed to be seen- feel loved. Eventually, Rio’s hands started to push her lower, bringing out a strong warm laugh from Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eager?” She hummed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio mumbled under her breath, </span>
<em>
<span>“Te quiero tan mala”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, pulling up a bit more to get a better look at Rio below.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“English, por favor?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, a little chuckle as she shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Take a lucky guess-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tell me, or I’m not going to fu-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I want you” Rio pulled her down, adding a quick, “So bad..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned before bruising them in a rough kiss. For every other movement being slow, drawn out- The way they kissed every time was messy, brutal, a crazed need to make up for lost time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they kissed, Agatha’s hand maneuvered down- fingers slipped under the waistband of her pants and boxers with no hesitation. She grinned, pulling apart from the kiss enough to whisper, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Boxers, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio felt her face flush, embarrassment only taking hold for just a second. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s hot” Agatha complimented.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pushed back into the kiss, groaning the way Rio slightly tugged the roots of her hair. Though her focus shifted back down south. Where her fingers were navigating through the patch of hair that was completely drenched. As if a downpour of rain had covered every pie-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, fuck- </span>
<em>
<span>Rio” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha moaned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her fingertips had dipped between her folds. She barely brushed over the woman’s clit, overwhelmed with just how soaked Rio was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This all because you hate me?” Agatha couldn’t refrain from the small tease.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gasped, hips pushing up, desperate to be touched where she was craving most. Her prayers, wishes, pleads were answered before she was given a chance to reply to Agatha’s question. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had pressed her middle finger over her clit. She didn’t spend time teasing, went right to work pressing little designs against the delicate button that seemed to bring out the best in Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>First a few slow circles, followed by spelling out her own name- like casting sigils and spells for Rio to be her very own. The woman below was more than responsive. Broken moans, string of whines and whimpers. Agatha didn’t think it could get any better until-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Agatha” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck” She cursed as Rio started to chant her name like a mantra. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman loved how Rio said her name, even if it was out of annoyance or frustration. But this? Through a mess of pleasure and desire? While she was touching her in a way she never thought would be possible?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You sound so fucking beautiful, Rio”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio thrusted her hips up, Agatha’s fingers gliding and slipping over her clit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve thought about this so many times..” Agatha admitted. “Wondering how you felt, sounded, </span>
<em>
<span>tasted” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The words only made Rio moan harder, head tipped back as her eyes squeezed shut. Agatha was having none of that though. She shook her head, pulling her finger away while demanding- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eyes on me, toots” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s head snapped right back to where it was. Their eyes met, Agatha finding the woman’s pupils absolutely blown out- Like they were balloons that had popped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers slowly moved over her clit, slipping past until the tips of her fingers hovered at her entrance, waiting for the gates to open. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tell me, how many fingers do you wan-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I want you..” Rio admitted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know, honey. That much is clear, but..unfortunately with how insufferable and the amount of hate there is between us- I still don’t want to hurt you” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, mumbling under her breath,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can’t hurt when I need you” She said. “Just, please, Agatha. Fuck me, I- </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck!”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She yelled out the curse as her back arched into a curved bridge, head tossed back as Agatha’s fingers had dipped just half an inch. Though they ripped away as Agatha chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eyes on me, come on” She encouraged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio whined at the little tease, but obeyed without a fight. Agatha would surely tease her for how easy she was to break. How she caved with barely any argument to offer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When their eyes met, Agatha’s middle and pointer pushed in achingly slow. This time more than half an inch. A full sink, a dive that left Agatha's fingers wrapped and suffocated in the soft, tight walls. Her thumb brushed against her clit, causing Agatha to feel a strong squeeze with such force, Agatha wondered if her bones would snap. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But, Agatha didn't care. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She'd fuck Rio with broken fingers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She'd fuck Rio if it was her last dying breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She'd fuck Rio until the world ended. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Until Rio was spent and shattered beneath her, Agatha would fuck her to make the woman realize all the hate was bullshit. The game they had played for three years had been a waste of time. They'd sort whatever this was in the morning, but for right now? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha needed to make Rio Vidal, the woman who had been her most known enemy for years feel her love. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Wait. Wait. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's mind hesitated until she allowed herself to fully believe the fleeting thought that disrupted her for years. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio” Agatha whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman gasped, holding her tight as she inched closer to her high. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think…I uh, I lo-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Fuck, I'm gonna’ c-”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the deathly squeeze around her fingers. The pressure was unbearable, a flow of warm liquid coated and drenched her fingers more than they already were. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn't get the words out and maybe that was okay. There would be more time to say it. Other moments where maybe it made more sense. Plus, Agatha knew her vulnerable side could only handle so much. She’d regret the impulsive words later on, double guess and worry she had revealed far too much of herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Don’t ruin this by being an idiot..</span>
</em>
<span>She told herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha watched, studying close as Rio's eyes were shut. She didn't even notice their eyes parted as she came like a storm that raged beneath her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That didn't matter. Not as Rio was trembling beneath her. The way she slightly turned enough to bury herself in Agatha's body. Her face hid in the crook of her neck and jaw, hand moved to grip the woman's hoodie and pull her down close. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They remained still in each other's hold. The room around them was silent. Not even the TV was registered or the soft crunching of Nicky's kibble in the next room. Agatha only listened to Rio's breath go from frantic to steady. She felt Rio's walls around her fingers release, strength weakening as she came down from her high. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pumped her fingers a few times, amused at the way Rio jumped and whimpered- wiggling her hips as she mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Too much” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman chuckled, pressing a kiss on the top of her head while she went to pull her fingers out. Though Rio's hand flew down to press over the fabric. She held Agatha there, an unspoken plea to not leave yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thought you were too sensitive?” Agatha smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just..” Rio whispered. “Don't leave”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped, feeling how Rio buried herself impossibly closer. She slowly smiled, teasing in a small whisper, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is </span>
<em>
<span>the</span>
</em>
<span> stone cold, stubborn, Green Witch Vidal really clingy after sex?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed about to pull away when Agatha held her close. She shook her head, forcing their eyes to meet so Rio didn't just hear- No. Agatha needed her to </span>
<em>
<span>see</span>
</em>
<span> her when she said, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm not going anywhere” Agatha whispered, shaking her head as she smiled. “No more fucking off for this Harkness” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman beneath her vividly relaxed, nodding while all she had to say was a soft- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can I?” She gestured down to her fingers. “Wrist is cramping. Won't lie” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused before letting out a soft, broken laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So old” She insulted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped. “You're older than I am!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, smiling as if she was drunk on liquor. When in reality, it was an overflow of pleasure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I- </span>
<em>
<span>Mmph!” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had thrusted her fingers back and forth, her thumb pressing against Rio's clit with a laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I love this brand new power I hold to shut you up” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio groaned, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hate you” She mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha slipped her fingers out, not bothering to drag them over her stomach. She didn't want to wipe them off in any capacity. Too eager, greedy to slip both digits between her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instantly, her eyes shut as the sweet taste slipped over her tastebuds. She didn't see the way Rio was nearly drooling over the erotic sight, watching as Agatha sucked and cleaned every inch of the skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As sensitive as Rio was, no matter how overwhelmed this entire moment had driven her- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha” She gasped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman opened her eyes as her fingers (Now clean as if Rio's cum and arousal had never coated them) slipped back out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You taste better than I ever imagined” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Typically, Rio would make fun of her for doing so. She'd tease, poke fun, pester Agatha for having such thoughts. But alas, the sensitive ache between her legs was growing stronger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swiped her tongue on the inside of her cheek before requesting, “Fuck me again” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Well, maybe that wasn't so much of a request, but an order. And suddenly, Agatha was willing to do anything Rio told her to do. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned down, pecking her lips before whispering a soft, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“As you wish, my worst enemy” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused before giggling softly. She lightly smacked Agatha upside the head with an eye roll. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I hate you” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed. “Thank fuck for that” </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes blinked open, adjusting to the morning sunrays casting rays through the bedroom curtains. They were only partially shut, forgetting from the night before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stretched her back, rubbing hands over her face as she waited for the tiredness of a restless slumber to hit her. The typical groggy feeling of a poor night sleep always brought her. Though as the seconds turned into minutes, Rio realized-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I slept. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Calmness, serenity, a heavy peaceful feeling flowed through her from head to toe. The feeling was foreign, something she wasn’t used to. However, nothing would compare to the second feeling that hit her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The bed shifted, a little breath echoed in Rio’s ears. She looked over to her left, expecting regret and hatred to punch her in the gut. But once again, that easy feeling remained. If anything, it increased as her heart fluttered and stomach swirled with wonder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sun was casting a warm glow on Agatha’s face, shining the little drool that dribbled on the pillow below. Her eyes were still shut, a few strands of hair stuck to her face while the others were frazzled over the pillow and along the blanket. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio should feel disturbed her enemy was naked under her own bedsheets. She should hate herself, all her choices, regret the night before and yet..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She stayed. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Part of her knew Agatha was true to her word when it came to how she wouldn’t be </span>
<em>
<span>“Fucking off” </span>
</em>
<span>, but there was always that strong worry. She was used to either being abandoned by morning or sending the woman home on her own terms. Rio felt neither choice was available. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t want Agatha to leave. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t want to make her leave either.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let the few moments linger, drinking in the sight of someone she insisted on hating for so long. If you told Rio over the last three years (hell just a week ago) how she’d be laying in bed admiring Agatha Harkness- She would have slammed the door in your face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Three years, Rio had counted down the days till retirement or wished upon every shooting star Agatha would hit the road out of there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Three years, Rio told everyone and their brother how Agatha annoyed the hell out of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Three years, and…Rio had accidentally fallen for the woman she hated most. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck my life. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Creeper” Agatha murmured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jesus shit!” Rio gasped as her body jolted, a hand smacked over her heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's raspy chuckle echoed, followed by a taunting tune that somehow Rio loved and hated at once. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Busted, disgusted, never to be trusted” </span>
</em>
<span>She sang. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, shaking her head as she grumbled under her breath, </span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus, you're such a fuckin’ child” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The raspy chuckle formed into a full laugh with a tiny snort snuck in between. A sound Rio knew she was damned to grow a stronger love for every single time it blessed her ears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Honey, after last night I don't know if that's a wise take on it” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, reaching over for her phone to grab off the end table. She saw the battery was nearly dead. Typically, that’d be her biggest concern. Unfortunately, the bold and clear, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>
<em>7:27 AM</em>
</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Took all of her worries front and center. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was in the middle of reaching out to hold Rio close when the woman’s body jumped from the bed. She was frantically searching for clothes, rambling off a list Agatha was trying to catch every word to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s nearly eight! We gotta’ go uh, I’ll jump in the shower- No! Let Nicky out first, shower, you can grab clothes just in my closet whatever, uhhhhh- I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Rio was bouncing around the room, only tossing a shirt on since she was heading for a shower- Agatha moved to sit up against the headboard, hands behind her head as she enjoyed the show. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh, we can figure out your car after- We can just take mine to there and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio” Agatha sighed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, it’s fine! I just- We gotta’-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m cancelling my classes. You do as you please, but..” Agatha reached over for her phone, gesturing in the air with it before adding, “My students can afford to miss a day. We’ll make up for it”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio went to argue, but the second she looked over- She felt her words come to a stop, brain short circuiting as she struggled to keep her composure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was topless, the golden rays shining over her breasts. The ones that had subtle red marks from fingernails and teeth scattered across them. Her hair was a mess, eyes squinting at the phone held close to her face. She paid no mind to Rio’s gawking stare, how she nearly dribbled drool onto the floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The look of Agatha Harkness naked in her bed was sexier than words could say. Of course, Rio felt the urge to lunge back on the bed, jump on her, kick off the engine to replay the whole night all over again. However, it weighed heavier than just her looks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha made the right side of the bed look lived in. She didn’t appear out of place or look weird being under Rio’s sheets. If anything, Rio felt Agatha belonged exactly where she sat as if she had been there for years. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck. I don’t love her. Don’t think that. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio cleared her throat, collecting what sense she could make of herself to try and talk her way out of there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah well- I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can’t take a break?” Agatha raised her eyebrow, peaking up from her phone with a little smirk. “That much is clear” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before Agatha tossed her phone to the side, she hit what Rio assumed was </span>
<em>
<span>send </span>
</em>
<span>on the mass email that’d take work off her schedule. After doing so, she shuffled back under the sheet- Unfortunately, but thankfully hiding her chest from Rio’s sight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Although,” Agatha yawned, snuggling back into the bed. “Maybe you're too nervous for us to both magically call out on the same day? Hm?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, ready to argue, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sleeping with her enemy- Oh what would they think? Would they know?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped, dramatic words with wiggling fingers gestured to Rio's neck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Oo! </span>
</em>
<span>The real question here is- Do you even own a turtleneck?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio felt her heart drop. She spun around, nearly falling to race over to her mirror. And just like the red marks on Agatha’s tits, they covered her neck like polka dots. Her collarbone was decorated in scratch marks, most likely her back as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shook her head, shooting over her shoulder, “You’re an asshole for this. Really, Agatha. That-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not what you were moaning last night” Agatha grinned wide, voice chirping every word. “Actually, I recall a string of-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She cleared her throat, putting on a mocking high pitch voice as she spoke, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh, I want you, need you! Agatha, fuck me. Don’t stop! Fu-”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio picked up the hoodie Agatha had been wearing off the floor. She tossed it in the air, making sure it hit the hysterical laughing woman in the face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman shook her head, muttering under breath, “I’m going to shower..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ta-ta!” Agatha sang. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rushed to the back door, opening it for Nicky to run out of before racing into the bathroom. She tried to move quick, not pay any mind to anything else as she stripped her shirt off- turning the water knobs to let the water warm up. Unfortunately, her movements came to a stop when she looked in the bathroom’s mirror. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The dark hickeys not only decorated her neck, but made a path down her stomach, to her inner thighs. Scratch marks, subtle bruises from Agatha’s teeth- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Holy fucking shit... </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingertips traced over them all one by one. Sure, she had rough sex before. It wasn’t uncommon with drunken hook ups, but…it was never the damage she wore. Although, Rio couldn’t classify or title them all as damage. More so, </span>
<em>
<span>worshipped</span>
</em>
<span>, </span>
<em>
<span>owned. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had devoured every single inch of her. Almost as if the woman was starved and Rio was the only meal in the universe to exist. Agatha didn't make her feel used like other women had. No. Rio felt not only seen, but..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Cherished. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wore the marks with a sense of unspoken pride. An ego inside of her had been inflated like a balloon threatening to pop from the air being too much. Sure, Rio would panic and try to cover them up. However, she wouldn’t be able to hide the little smirk over the memory of each one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman forced herself to jump in the shower, wash her hair and body off. She slowly felt her muscles ache. A bit of tylenol would fix that, but she’d be thinking about her heating pad all day- That was for sure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio knew her three minute shower didn’t go to plan. Not when her eyes kept getting distracted as she washed her body, studying every trace of Agatha she left. Plus, part of her worried about stepping back out of the bathroom. The endless questions racing in her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Did she leave?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What if she left?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Was this just another hook up for her?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>One after the other, after the other. They piled on like bricks creating a tower size wall, a warning threat of destruction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slipped the same t-shirt back on after drying off, heading straight down the hall back into her bedroom. The bed was empty, Agatha’s spot vacant. For a second, Rio’s heart dropped. She feared the worst, wondering how the hell she’d make it through the day until-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Fucks sake- Rio!” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio jumped as she pulled her black slacks on, grabbing her bra and green button up shirt. With every movement, relief eased her sore muscles. She smiled to herself, losing herself in solace and comfort Agatha hadn’t left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Rio!” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha yelled again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She snapped the back of her bra while walking down the hall, slipping arms through the sleeves of her shirt. Rio worked on buttoning them down as she rounded the entry way of the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh my god. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stopped at the threshold, fingers stopped to fiddle with the third button from the top. Her eyes widened, lips parted as her jaw dropped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was wearing one of her bigger flannels. A dark forest green one that always slipped down to her knees. It was held together by three buttons in the middle, offering a glimpse into all the same marks Rio wore on her own skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The big square glasses were perched on her nose, hair tied back in a messy manner. Half pony tail, half bun- Only Agatha could make that style not only possible, but look effortlessly good. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Well, I can get used to this..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, hand on her hip while the other gestured to the coffee maker. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This isn’t working” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked and shook her head out of the trance she’d name </span>
<em>
<span>“Agatha stare” </span>
</em>
<span>for herself. She continued buttoning up the shirt while walking over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, it does. You just gotta..” She lifted her hand, holding one side while aggressively smacking the other a few times. Instantly the liquid started to drip into the mug, Rio stepped back with a small nod. “See? Works” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stood back, arms folded against her chest while looking between the half alive machine and a fresh out of the shower Rio-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Unfair how good she looks this early in the morning..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed. “The thing is barely holding on for dear life. Why do you even use this thing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged while moving to find boots, calling back,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It works, doesn’t it?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. “You had to smack it more than five times!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hopped along back down the hall while pulling one boot on, leaning against the doorway for the other. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Like I said, it works” She said. “You’re about to have a cup of coffee, are you not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, an abused one” Agatha muttered, but her frown shifted into a small smile. She dramatically pushed the few strands of hair back, shaking her head as she asked, “Where are you going, dear?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio huffed. “Work. Unlike you” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, tapping her finger against her chin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What will you do at work?” She questioned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was finding her wallet and keys when she paused, turning on her heel to see the woman who looked up to no good. </span>
<em>
<span>Far</span>
</em>
<span> up to no good. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We literally have the same job..what-” Rio shook her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>What is she playing at?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, indeed we do, but..” Agatha shrugged, pointing at Rio with her lips pursed and eyes narrowed in on her. “You don’t have work with classes cancelled. So..what will you do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>What..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio placed a hand on the edge of the counter. The other lifted up to point at Agatha, muttering a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What did you do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped, hand tossed over her heart as she wildly shook her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Me?! Do something?!” She asked. “Professor Vidal, what possibly could I have done with an unlocked and open PC in your offi-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” Rio exclaimed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “You delete my texts, I cancel your classes”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio huffed out a laugh. “Are you serious right now?!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The coffee maker dinged, earning Agatha’s attention to grab her mug from it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Only fair, wouldn’t you agree?” She asked. “Now, where do you keep your sugar and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think one is a bigger deal than the other!” Rio exclaimed. “You can’t just fuck with my job like that. You know I can’t-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, what is it the kids say? </span>
<em>
<span>Womp womp?” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha smirked before clicking her tongue. “Got the sugar! Scratch that”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She whistled while making her coffee. Stirring the sugar, milk, and even a dash of honey she found in the cabinet. Funny enough, Rio didn’t even feel bothered by how the woman rampaged her kitchen as if she had lived there herself. It was more disbelief Agatha had crossed that line. She used Rio deleting stupid drunken text messages as an excuse and yet-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I still fucking like her. What the fuck?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Had kissing her, letting Agatha fuck her senseless ruin every ounce of hatred? Was it now impossible for Rio to be mad or want to stay away from her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, tossing her keys down as she muttered, “I hate you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mhm” Agatha chuckled, sipping from her coffee before raising the mug in the air. “That’s why you haven’t kicked me out of your house yet”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio huffed out an annoyed laugh. “Keyword, </span>
<em>
<span>yet” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then do it” Agatha shrugged. “Kick me out, end this sense you still </span>
<em>
<span>hate </span>
</em>
<span>me so much”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slowly crossed the kitchen floor to the woman who was gripping the edge of the counter. Rio held a strong glare, not realizing how it weakened with every step Agatha took. She inched closer and closer, grinning the second she fiddled with one of Rio’s shirt buttons. A little laugh made Rio’s heart skip a beat as she mumbled,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mhm, that’s what I thought” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“God,” Rio shook her head. “I really hate you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ditto” Agatha whispered with a wink, clearing her throat to speak at a normal volume again. “Now, since we have some free time on our hands- Maybe make me some breakfast, por favor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Jesus.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio held her breath as Agatha started to undo her buttons. From the middle and then slowly worked her way down. She gripped the counter harder, stronger, swiping her tongue on the inside of her cheek while trying to appear angry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, you cancel my classes, rampage my kitchen then request breakfast?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned, giving a small wink as she spoke. “Look at you. Such a smart professor, aren’t you? It’s a shame that won’t be utilized today”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, but it was low and annoyed as she shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You..you are fucking ridiculous” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And I..I’m still waiting for breakfast” Agatha smiled, echoing the same way Rio spoke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clenched her jaw, stretched her neck side to side before shoving Agatha away. But, it wasn’t to end their morning together or completely get rid of her. Instead, she spun around to find the ingredients she’d need- hearing a small,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes!” from behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman couldn’t help but smile softly, shaking her head while asking over her shoulder,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you always this aggravating before eight AM?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio felt every muscle in her body become stiff, body tensing up as the unexpected arm from behind wrapped around her torso. A pair of lips kissed the side of her head before a soft whisper,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, but…this is special edition for the sexiest professor though” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She felt her body lean back, melting in Agatha’s hold as she shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Clearly not a professor in your eyes today” She grumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed against her head, swaying them both side to side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Little roleplay can’t hurt though?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shivered. “You’re impossible”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You love it” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Unfortunately..I fucking do. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Later that night, Agatha regretfully had gone home. Usually, Rio was happy when extra company in her home left. She was able to feel secured, locked back into her safe haven. Surprisingly, Agatha’s absence didn’t leave the same comfort others did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The house felt silent even when she played tug of war with Nicky, even with the TV on, even as the storm outside made the rain pour extra hard against her rooftop. Her couch felt vacant, she didn’t dare step foot into the bedroom. If the rest of the house felt so lonely, Rio couldn’t fathom how her bed would feel and she carried no wanting of figuring that out quite yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sunk into the couch, feet up on the coffee table with Nicky snuggled into her side. Rio had clicked some documentary on, something about a killer- She wasn’t paying attention to it. That was that. Rio was actually trying to fall asleep to ignore how depressing her house had become. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A space she once felt safe, warm, comfortable in now was the polar opposite. Dangerous, cold, lonely..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck off, Harkness..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The familiar phrase entered her mind, but as if it was a creepy way of clockwork? Or maybe Agatha was a mind reader from afar? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s phone lit up, Agatha’s name bright on the screen. She had added her number to Rio’s contact list before taking off that night. A subtle way of reassuring their night wasn’t a one time deal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She smirked slightly to herself, clicking the answer button as she brought it up to her ear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Booty call already?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A warm laugh graced her ear from the other line. Suddenly, Rio didn’t feel so cold in her own home anymore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t get your hopes up, toots” She said. “I’m just looking to ask if I left something at your place”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked around the living room, seeing if any of Agatha’s belongings were anywhere as she asked,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhh, what are you looking for? I’m not seeing any-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My hair tie”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stopped her words, movements paused as she registered the object Agatha was looking for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sat up, a hand rubbing the back of her neck as she asked, “Your…</span>
<em>
<span>hair tie?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, yes” Agatha sighed as if it was the most devastating loss in the world. “It’s my lucky one. The one” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio slowly smirked. </span>
<em>
<span>She’s bullshitting. Has to be.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is it there?” Agatha questioned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked on her wrist at her hair tie with a little smirk. Obviously, the accessory didn't belong to Agatha’s. But, curiosity got the best of her. If Agatha was bullshitting, lying through her teeth- She wouldn’t question who the hair tie actually belonged to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah-ha!” Rio faked the sound of finding it. “Well, would you look at that. It is here. Want me to bring it to you tomorr-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll just come back over to grab it. Lucky one and all” Agatha rushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you su-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m grabbing my keys and such right now. See you in a bit?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly, hating and loving the giddy feeling coursing through her at the idea of seeing Agatha sooner than tomorrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But, she still sighed- trying to hide her excitement. “If you insist” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I insist, insist” Agatha said. “K’, coming over”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll be here” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Keep my hair tie safe for me”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I will,” Rio smiled. </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio opened the door, the sound of the pouring rain louder as it crashed on her porch roof and world around her. Though it was all muted, a muffled sound as the woman before her smiled wide. She was in black sweatpants with a raincoat over her body, not showing a sign of tiredness or being bothered by collecting her cherished lost item. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She held the black hair tie up with a smirk. “Looking for this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha dramatically sighed, knees caved as she pumped her fists in the air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh! There you are” She beamed, taking it from her hand to slip over her wrist. “Been looking everywhere for you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snickered, finding far too much amusement at the sight of her theatrical show. She didn't need Agatha to confess to how the hair tie was all a lie. A scheme Rio wondered how long it took for her to plot before putting it into action. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you..” Agatha said, looking behind at the pouring rain with yet another dramatic sigh. “I guess I should get going before the rain is even worse. I always hate driving in it and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha..” Rio said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha whipped around, about to say something when Rio stepped aside with a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just get in here”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, thank you” Agatha groaned, taking her jacket off as she walked inside. “I wasn’t sure how much longer I could keep that fuckin’ charade going” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The door swung shut, Rio didn’t hesitate to grab Agatha’s hips the second the coat was hung up. She smirked, face inches away from the woman who was rubbing her hands up over Rio’s shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lucky hair tie, huh?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh very, look where I am..” Agatha smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just as Agatha was about to kiss her, Rio pulled back with a little shake of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Funny thing though..” Rio said. “That’s my hair tie” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s grin faded, red flooded her cheeks as she bit down on her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So uh,” She stammered, putting on a tiny grin as she sang. </span>
<em>
<span>“Busted, disgusted, never to be trusted?”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Big time” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Complaints?” Agatha questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not a single one,” Rio replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled her in for a soft, delicate, kiss. Both sighed with relief as if they had gone without one another for years again. Before things were able to progress, become too heavy, Agatha pushed her back to whisper,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’d still argue it’s a lucky hair tie”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused before a little laugh as she shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just fuck me, Harkness” She ordered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, slightly pushing her back for them to stumble along the same trail all over again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“As you wish..”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The rest of the week had flown by in the blink of an eye. Rio wasn’t completely surprised to find out the night of the hair tie trick, Agatha had an overnight bag packed in her car- determined to not leave until she had to. Unsurprisingly as well, she only left for work a few minutes after Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Both agreed to keep things under the table. They arrived at their usual times, but their banter was noticeably absent. Well, to everyone else. To the two of them, they were doing an excellent job at hiding the very obvious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had started to steal Rio’s clothes by Wednesday night when she was out of her own. She took from the back of the closet in hopes people wouldn’t recognize the articles of clothing worn by Professor Vidal first. That didn’t help the two keep their appearance normal. Not when it caused Rio’s staring to be more than usual, stuck in a trance for how good Agatha looked in her clothes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t just the way she owned them, looking marvelous beyond words could ever say. But, Rio felt a sense of pride. Almost as if Agatha was her own to keep. Her clothes were a little mark and claim she had. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And part of Rio slowly lost care if people noticed the clothes belonged to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their nights slowly shifted into a routine. They’d both get home around the same time, stumble into the shower together- Maybe end up in bed with dinner being forgotten. They’d play in the backyard with Nicky, both laughing as they ended up tackling each other instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Or, it’d be like where they currently sat. Both on the couch with yet another binge of Law and Order on the TV. Bowls of ice cream sat in their lap, bickering over who was right about how the episode would end. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can I have more sprinkles?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked over, a little smile as she shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I told you to pour more than just that, but no-no! Why listen to little old me-” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha picked up her leg off of the woman’s lap, kicked her foot against Rio’s chest, earning a small, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oof!”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ridiculous” Rio muttered, pausing the show before standing up. “You know, you have feet that work- You can get your own damn sprinkles!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She yelled over her shoulder as she disappeared into the kitchen, leaving Agatha puffing out a little snort as she mumbled, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And yet, you’re doing it for me”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman continued to eat her ice cream, humming a soft tune as she watched Nicky bite and thrash around the small rope toy. Agatha had bought it for him the other night on a trip to Walmart with Rio. She made a sex joke out of the rope, of course. But overall, she was the one who spent way too much time in the pet aisles- finding things to spoil the boy with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Too busy in her own mind, she didn’t hear the front door open- Only noticed as Nicky jumped up and a high pitch singing voice rang in the air like a bell,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yooo-whooo!</span>
</em>
<span> Are you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman stopped in her tracks, Agatha paused mid ice cream bite as she looked up to find a pair of redheads staring wide at her. She slowly put the bowl back down on her lap, hearing Rio rush back out with the sprinkles container shaking in the air. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your servant brings you your precious sprinkle-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused as her eyes caught the duo across the living room. She stopped talking, words cut before cutting into a shocked,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey..guys”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Natasha and Wanda both nodded in sync, small grins as they returned the hello. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You forgot about dinner, didn’t you?” Wanda asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pulled her lips back, shifting side to side while holding up sprinkles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ice cream for din-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I uh, I should go” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha started to stand up, but Wanda was quick to shake her head. She shoved the dish of casserole against Natasha’s chest, nearly hopping over as she rambled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nonsense! The more the merrier. Besides, another buffer to deal with the old grump here”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She gestured to Rio who only rolled her eyes at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I wouldn’t want to intrude”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Natasha shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nonsense. Wanda made far too much food again-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bad habit” Wanda shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Another person eating means less leftovers I’m stuck with for lunch all week” Natasha sighed. “You’d be doing me a favor”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda scoffed, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh poor you,” She mocked. “Your wife makes sure you eat, what a terrible life you live”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snickered, unable to hold back her amusement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So!” Wanda grinned. “I’m Wanda, this is my wife- Natasha” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The other woman gave a small wave behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who do we have the pleasure of meeting?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha subtly looked over her shoulder, making sure Rio was fine with the situation. She only shrugged, silently saying it was up to Agatha on what she wanted to do. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Without another second to waste, Agatha flipped her hair to the side. She held her hand out, a proud smile crawled upon her face as she said the name Rio knew would damn her for eternity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha Harkness” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda’s grin faded before it grew wide like never before. Natasha’s eyes opened, suddenly more energetic than how she showed up. They both glanced over to Rio who was playing with the sprinkles bottle, avoiding eye contact all together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m so never hearing the end of this one. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well..” Wanda shook her hand, nearly jumping in the air. “This is going to be a lovely night!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>That’s one way to look at it....</span>

</blockquote><hr/><p>“This is really good” Agatha complimented Wanda’s dinner, followed by a quick- “Wanda, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“More like Gordon Ramsey,” Natasha smirked, replying before the other woman had a chance to do so. “Her cooking may be incredible, but she’s a vicious being in the kitchen”</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Agatha chuckled as Wanda rolled her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>The group were sitting outside. The back deck table creaked with every movement, chairs rusted from the amount of time they had spent outside. Worn out, used and well loved. The sunset was turning dark into the early night, casting shadows around them. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda and Natasha sat next to each other on one side, Agatha and Rio straight across from them. The duo who knew Rio well wouldn’t voice it aloud, but after they left that night words would be said through gasps and laughs. They’d point out the obvious, find every part of Rio hysterical. </p><p> </p><p>From how she was nervously chewing at her lip more than her food. The way she tried to keep her eyes off Agatha, but failed miserably to do so. How Agatha sat beside her and Rio didn’t dare move a muscle. </p><p> </p><p>It was more than amusing to them both. They actually felt hope Rio wouldn’t be sitting alone like an old grump the rest of her life. </p><p> </p><p>“Ignore her completely,” Wanda said, putting on a soft smile right after. “But, yes. It’s Wanda”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, holding her fork up in the air as if it was a champagne glass to raise a toast. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, <em> Gordon Ramsey Wanda </em>, you are quite the cook” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda shook her head over the nickname that had caught on over the years.

The others fell into a soft laugh, but Wanda quickly cut through them with a chirping tone. </p><p> </p><p>“Anywaaaaay!” She drew the word out, putting her fork down to clap her hands. “Less about me, Agatha and more about you!”</p><p> </p><p>Natasha swallowed her food with a nod. “Mm! Rio’s told us you’ve worked at the university for a few years now?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused mid bite, her fork lowering as a slow grin stretched across her face. She tilted her head, looking over to Rio who was sinking more into her seat, using the food to hide herself. </p><p> </p><p>“She’s talked about me? How interesting..”</p><p> </p><p><em> Here we go.. </em>Rio groaned in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked back over at the couple, asking a small, “Good things I’d hope?” </p><p> </p><p>Natasha puffed out a short laugh, Wanda shot a glare at her wife before snapping her attention back at Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Well-”</p><p> </p><p>“Her worst enemy, right?” Agatha chuckled. </p><p> </p><p>“Um,” Wanda said, shaking her head. “More like-”</p><p> </p><p>“Worst nightmare” Natasha shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda lightly smacked Natasha’s shoulder which only made the woman laugh harder. Agatha smiled, shaking her head as she lightly chuckled. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to lie, Gordon-”</p><p> </p><p>“I fucking love this chick” Natasha laughed. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned over, nudging Rio’s arm with a smirk. “I am well aware of Professor Vidal’s so called <em> hatred </em>for me” </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed, rolling her shoulders back as she swallowed her food before speaking, </p><p> </p><p>“In my defense-” She started. “You had been incredibly annoying since your first appearance”</p><p> </p><p><em> “Had?” </em>The three asked in sync. </p><p> </p><p>And suddenly, Rio hated all of them more than she ever hated Agatha alone. </p><p> </p><p>“I guess I’ve graduated from being annoying to-”</p><p> </p><p>“Being insufferable” Rio cut off. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm, insufferable enough to be on your couch eating ice cream?” Wanda asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh!” Natasha perked up. “Insufferable enough to be her- What was it? <em> Sprinkle servant?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned, grabbing her plate as she muttered under her breath, “I’m not being sober for this”</p><p> </p><p>She pushed up from the table, storming off inside as the three women behind laughed amongst themselves. </p><p> </p><p>Embarrassment was taking hold stronger than ever. Rio scraped the leftover bits of her food in the garbage, nearly shattering the plate in the sink. She was thankful to have a few moments alone. A plan in action to find a beer, alcohol of any sorts to drown this entire night out.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> This is..fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She popped the cap off, tossing it in the garbage before tilting the bottle back against her lips. The cold liquid ran over her tongue, down her throat. Rio could only hope the effects would hit her soon enough. Maybe not being sober would help her power through this.</p><p> </p><p><em> Why am I like this? </em>Rio wondered.</p><p> </p><p>Shouldn’t she be happy her friends were getting along with Agatha? The entire dinner had gone by in what felt like two seconds. With her exes, dinners dragged on and on. Wanda always had something to say after, Natasha nodding along and making her own little comments. </p><p> </p><p>Rio always knew it’d be coming when the second dinner was nearly over or even worse, barely began. The two gave her a certain look that said,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “She isn’t the one”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>In which, okay- Fine. Maybe letting your friends have such a powerful, large impact on your dating life wasn’t for the best. However, it didn't happen. The two would’ve given her a look by now. The energy during dinner would have been awkward, slow. Unlike with Agatha, it was a dinner Rio had never experienced before. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha fit in perfectly with them. She kept up with the banter, the laughter was endless with her. Rio felt comfortable by her side, mesmerized by her perfect beauty. How she melted in, a puzzle piece that was found after being lost for so long. </p><p> </p><p>So..why the hell was she so embarrassed?</p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was losing her well known reputation of hating Agatha Harkness. After all, stating something powerful and stubborn for three years straight. Arguing left and right giving her a chance to be a tolerable person in Rio’s life wouldn’t happen. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Why am I- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Rio..” </p><p> </p><p>And just like that, being alone didn’t last as long as she’d have liked it to. </p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned, shaking her head. “Don't start-”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha Harkness is in your house?!” Wanda whispered. </p><p> </p><p>“What about ‘<em> don't start </em>’ do you not understand?!” Rio exclaimed in the same harsh whisper. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda took care of the three dishes because <em> of course- </em>She offered to take Agatha’s plate. Knowing Wanda, she was going to bring drinks out and make sure to continue this night- drag it and Rio’s embarrassment farther along. </p><p> </p><p>“She's not only here. In your house. On your couch. Eating ice cream, but also- She’s wearing your fucking clothes!” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> As if this couldn’t get any worse... </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio took another swig, shrugging her shoulders as she replied,</p><p> </p><p>“Or, we just have a similar taste in fashion”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda scoffed, a wide grin as she looked over her shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio, you’ve owned those grey sweatpants since you were twenty six. And! I bought you that hoodie!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha began to sing the familiar taunting song in her mind, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Busted, disgusted, never to be trusted. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Another swig, longer this time- Almost tempted to down the entire bottle in one go of it to crack open another. </p><p> </p><p>She scratched the back of her neck, shoulders shrugging for what felt like the millionth time. Rio began to stammer her words, struggling to come up with an explanation for anything other than the obvious.</p><p> </p><p>“I- Listen- Okay, she-”</p><p> </p><p><em> “I- Listen. Okay, she!” </em>Wanda mocked, shaking her head. “Don’t you lie to me! It’s clear as day! How else would you describe your known enemy in your house and clothes?!”</p><p> </p><p>“We’re friends!” Rio said. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda laughed. “Oh my god- Might as well go with the old, they were roommates at this rate! God, you’ve always been a terrible liar”</p><p> </p><p>Rio muttered a few curse words under her breath, leaning her lower back against the counter. She pinched the bridge of her nose, tapping fingers against the side of her beer bottle. </p><p> </p><p>“I just don’t get it..” Wanda sighed. “You two are obviously <em> perfect </em>together. Why do you keep lying-”</p><p> </p><p>“We aren’t even together, Wanda..” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a total lie, per say. They hadn’t necessarily discussed what was going on between them. It’d only been a week or so since their whirlwind of enemies to lovers-</p><p> </p><p><em> Oh my god. I’m in a fucking cliche trope. </em>Rio realized. </p><p> </p><p>Even worse to that realization? The woman who called it, nailed the hammer on the head, was the one to predict Rio’s future stood before her. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean-”</p><p> </p><p>“We just aren’t!” Rio shrugged. “I’m pretty certain this is just some…fling, hook up sort of situat-”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda gasped, hands flying up to cover her mouth as she started to bounce off the heels of her feet. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh for fucks-”</p><p> </p><p>“Hook up?! Fling!?” Wanda whispered in a giddy tone. “You slept together?! Oh, I knew it! Wait, wait- How was it? Did you fuck her- She fuck you? Or-”</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda” </p><p> </p><p>“Your dry spell is finally over! The curse has been lifted, oh my god!” Wanda laughed. </p><p> </p><p>The woman reached over, grabbing Rio by the shoulders, shaking her back and forth as if she were trying to rid all of Rio’s hesitations. </p><p> </p><p>“I need details, Rio. Like. <em> A S A P!” </em> She said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, desperate to hide how her skin burned. The memory of Agatha’s body against her own. Her moans, words, voice a ghost in the back of her mind. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head harder, muscles in her body tightening like a string being wound up- fighting against its hold. </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing to detai-”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio Vidal, you haven’t had sex in God knows how long now. Give it up. Spill!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio half turned to put the beer bottle down behind her. She covered her face with both hands, shaking her head as she groaned a muffled,</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda. No..just-” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my godddd” Wanda drew out the word, letting go as she placed her hands on her hips. </p><p> </p><p>The woman stepped back, giving Rio space to hide in her shell even more. A turtle inverting her neck, escaping the daylight into her own darkness. </p><p> </p><p>For once in Wanda’s lifetime, it was hard to completely read Rio like a book. She caught a glimpse of the embarrassment, possibly guilt for holding hatred so long. There were nerves mixed in as well. </p><p> </p><p>However, a feeling was trapped beneath the surface. Something that Wanda couldn’t exactly quite pin. Neither could Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda nodded, deciding to lay off and give in to Rio’s demands of letting it go. She didn’t want to drop the subject, but she knew Rio well enough that pressing harder wasn’t going to do much.  </p><p> </p><p>Although, Wanda wouldn’t give up that easily. Not without making Rio clarify her weak attempt at bullshitting away from the obvious, trying to make it appear it wasn’t as it seemed. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine.” Wanda said, her tone serious- a hint of frustration matching it. “So. You and Agatha. Just a hook up? Nothing more?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio took in a deep breath, hesitating before she weakly nodded- forcing it into a stronger one. She rubbed her hands down her face, dragging her cheeks down before letting them rest on either side of her neck. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda narrowed her eyes, lips parting to argue, but Rio beat her before she could.</p><p> </p><p>“Just…<em> fuck buddies” </em></p><p> </p><p>Wanda asked. “Nothing more?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing less..” Rio replied. </p><p> </p><p>“Mhm..” Wanda hummed, not buying the reply for a second. “And why only that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio forced a laugh. Wasn’t it obvious?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t want something more. In Rio’s mind, it was screaming on repeat louder day by day how this would inevitably end. This all could be one evil prank, a joke that involved pulling one over Rio. Revenge for hating her for three years. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had drowned them out, letting herself enjoy being in the moment. But like clockwork, Wanda was there to snap her into reality. Smack her out of delusions, bring her back to earth. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not..” Rio shook her head. “I don’t want anything more”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda had to restrain a laugh over that. It was a pathetic lie, Rio even knew her words were bullshit. All she wanted day by day was something more. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t want Agatha to leave. She had a nightmare a few nights prior Agatha was in the arms of another woman. If you told her weeks ago that thought would make her feel sick, Rio wouldn’t believe you for a second. </p><p> </p><p>However, it was there. The fear of Agatha slipping away. She worried this would be a blip in her life. A brief moment that’d feel like a dream, something that almost never existed. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda sighed. “Rio-”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m serious..” She said. “I- You know I can’t stand her. I haven’t in years. This is out of boredom. I’m sure it’s the same on her end”</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt her heart ache with every word she spoke. A lie that kept on killing her slower than starvation ever could. </p><p> </p><p>“Why do you do this?” Wanda asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Do what?”</p><p> </p><p>“You-”</p><p> </p><p>Footsteps came through the backdoor, AGatha’s presence dominating the space as she always did with any room she stepped into. Rio’s eyes widened, panic striking through as she cleared her throat- grabbing her beer to take a significant swig from it. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, hey” Wanda smiled, appearing as if nothing was wrong. “We were just heading back ou-”</p><p> </p><p>“Actually, I gotta go. Crisis date savior has been requested” </p><p> </p><p>She held her phone up, wiggling the device as she referenced it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look to see the fake smile Agatha wore. She already heard it in her voice, her sudden departure that lined up perfect to get out of Rio’s home. </p><p> </p><p>The woman didn’t suggest to herself Agatha had overheard her. Instantly, her mind screamed how she regretted ever being here. This was it. The clock had run out, their time together was over. By Monday, things would be back to normal and this would cease to exist.   </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, well..” Wanda sighed. “It was really nice meeting you. I hope we get to do something in the future! I know you’re dealing with a recluse here though. Getting her out of the house is like pulling teeth”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckled, but there was no warmth. Just a sound echoed into a void.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll uh, bring these back to you on Monday” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha referenced her clothes, but Rio didn’t pay attention. She just nodded, panic drinking from her beer as they all mumbled goodbyes to one another. </p><p> </p><p>The front door opened and shut. Rio felt the familiar emptiness fill her entire home. Even with her two closest friends still present, her beloved dog running around with glee- It was vacant. No life as if Rio had become Death, doomed to exist for eternity without any love or being around her. </p><p> </p><p>The woman was so lost in her solitude, ripped to shreds layer by layer- She didn’t hear Natasha walk in or see the look on her face. Only being snapped out of it with Wanda breaking the tense silence behind her. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Wanda asked. </p><p> </p><p>Natasha ran a hand through her hair, teetering side to side as she shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>“Pretty sure something may have been said in this kitchen that uh, said <em> enemy </em> did not like hearing” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s own heart broke, looking back over to Rio as she exhaled a long breath. </p><p> </p><p>Before she was able to say something, Rio slammed her beer down- Excusing herself to the bathroom, never hearing behind the low voices that blended in sync with one word,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Shit” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio nearly tripped over her own two feet flying down the small hallway. The bathroom door swung open, nearly flying off the hinges and punching through the frame when she slammed it shut. Her back pressed against it, holding herself up the best she could. </p><p> </p><p>Her knees wanted to cave, body weakening into a messy pile of bones. A puddle of what she once was. The thought of Agatha hearing those words felt worse than Agatha not wanting her. Why was that? </p><p> </p><p>She always hated Agatha, never wanted her to be around, always shoved her away and-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit. I fucking love her.  </em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>No, no. That couldn’t be it. How do you fall in love with someone you just hated days ago? </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Because, never actually hated- Yes, I fucking did- do! No- I- </em>
</p><p>“Ugh!” </p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose as she squeezed her eyes shut. If her thoughts kept having an argument of their own, Rio was sure her head would explode. </p><p> </p><p>Her silence in solitude wasn’t gifted to her for long. Which wasn’t surprising, not when Wanda was only down the hall from her. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t knock, didn’t ask- Simply cracked open the door and stuck her head inside with a small smile. One that Rio didn’t bother to look at. Even if it was an empathetic sad one, a smile filled with understanding- </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t want to see it. <br/>She didn’t want to see anything or anyone. </p><p> </p><p>Unless your name was Agatha Harkness, but..not even Rio would admit that. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda closed the door behind her, leaning against it as she whispered, “Looks cozy..”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed, turning the water on, letting the temperature run as cold as possible. She let her fingertip stay in the stream, unsatisfied until the sensation made her gasp from how frozen it felt. Only then did she bring both hands under to splash a good amount on her face. </p><p> </p><p>“Want a washcloth?” Wanda asked.</p><p> </p><p>Cold water was always a tactic Rio used to bring herself back down from panic or emotional distress of any kind. Wanda would never forget finding her in the shower, frozen as can be when Rio thought she lost Nicky. (He was hiding in the kitchen cabinet where Rio kept her snacks) </p><p> </p><p>However, Rio shook her head as she turned the water off- stepping back to sit on the edge of the bathtub. </p><p> </p><p>She kept her eyes down, fiddling with her thumbs as she nibbled on her bottom lip. Wanda didn’t expect Rio to willingly speak to her. She prepared to fight and pry, annoy and pester until Rio either freaked out or kicked her and Natasha out of the house. Whatever it took, Wanda was prepared to do so. </p><p><br/>The woman ran a hand through her hair, taking in a breath to collect words, about to speak when-</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think she heard?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda snapped her head back up, eyes wide as she scrambled to redirect. Rio wasn’t one filled with surprises. She was someone who never went off script, always stayed the same. A routine that never changed. </p><p> </p><p>But now? </p><p> </p><p><em> Agatha Harkness has gotta’ be a witch.. </em>Wanda thought to herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Um,” Wanda hummed, tilting her head side to side. “I mean..possibi-”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t sugarcoat it” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda scoffed. All of her sweet, tender, nice and soft caring demeanor was swept away. She put her hands out at her sides, snapping with a quick reply, </p><p> </p><p>“What do you think?” She asked. “Yes. She heard it. Agatha now thinks you don’t want anything serious with her. No, actually- She thinks you still hate her and whatever you two have been up to is out of boredom and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay!” Rio groaned.</p><p> </p><p>She pushed herself down backwards, letting her legs hang over the edge of the bathtub while her body sulked into itself. Rio hid her face in her hands, hoping if she hid long enough- All of this would just go away. Her feelings for Agatha, the situation entirely, everything. </p><p> </p><p>Yet, as the seconds turned into minutes? Reality wasn’t able to be ignored. This situation wasn’t fake, something she could click her heels and escape from. </p><p> </p><p>“Can you please…just believe something good for once?” Wanda asked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up, eyebrows furrowed.  “What do you mean?” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda crossed the bathroom to climb in the bathtub beside her. Their shoulders were side by side, legs dangling off the edge. Rio watched as her best friend groaned, muttering under her breath, </p><p> </p><p>“We’re getting too old for this spot, Rio”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered, offering a helping hand only for it to be smacked away. </p><p> </p><p>“Ow-”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh hush!” Wanda huffed, adjusting her clothes as she tried to settle in a comfortable position. </p><p> </p><p>Well- As comfy as you could be sitting in a bathtub. Rio always did pick the oddest places to have a meltdown or hide from the world. </p><p> </p><p><em> At least we’re not under the table or in the cabinet when we were kids… </em>Wanda figured to herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Now,” Wanda cleared her throat, taking in a breath before looking over to her right. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was looking away, picking the skin off her thumb again. She could read all the nerves firing off of her, little ashes from the flames landing on Wanda with every second that passed. </p><p><br/>Wanda gave Rio the floor to speak again if she wanted, but this time around- Rio went back into her old ways. The quiet shell, one hard to crack. </p><p> </p><p>The redhead beside her sighed, bringing her soft voice back like it had never left. “I couldn’t figure you out earlier, but…I just clicked it” </p><p> </p><p>Rio peaked up, eyebrows furrowed as her eyes spoke the question in a silent whisper- “<em> What?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“You’re not believing this could be something good” Wanda shook her head. “You’re just going to avoid it..” She added, whispering a low, “Aren’t you, Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>The woman looked back at her fingers, the skin around her nails picked apart and torn to shreds. She knew the next day the stinging pain would catch her off guard, but..at least it wouldn’t hurt like the inevitable. </p><p> </p><p>Rio would much rather wake up with a stinging burn from her skin being ripped over finding a bed empty, having to go back to life as if she never knew how good it felt to not hate Agatha Harkness. </p><p> </p><p>She pulled her lips back, biting on them with a shake of her head. </p><p> </p><p>“She..” Rio sighed, struggling to say the words. “She’s not-”</p><p> </p><p>“She wants you..” Wanda said. “She isn’t out of your league, doesn’t deserve better- Don’t give me that crap” She added. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted in her spot, lips parted to argue. However, Wanda punched her to the side to continue on. </p><p> </p><p>“And yes. Natasha and I are going to tease you for eternity. So, swallow your pride and push the embarrassment aside” She nudged with a little grin. “You falling for your enemy, Rio- Come on, that’s material even you yourself would work with”</p><p> </p><p>She rolled her eyes, hating how her cheeks grew warm and she couldn’t hide even if she tried. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you really going to let embarrassment have a say in this?” Wanda asked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up, confused, unsure of what she was going at. </p><p> </p><p>“Why let being embarrassed you fell for your sworn enemy take something this good away from you?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda knew embarrassment wasn’t the reason they were in the bathtub after Rio was lying through her teeth back in the kitchen.  Of course, she was experiencing it big time. Especially with how unexpected the dinner and them meeting Agatha was. </p><p> </p><p>But, that was only a sliver- barely an ingredient to what was going on. </p><p> </p><p>“I would tell you if I thought this wasn’t good for you” Wanda said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. </p><p>“Natasha is meaner than I am too, remember..” She shoved her shoulder with a small grin. “She would have been escorting Agatha out the door if she had any negative feeling on her”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m supposed to have negative feelings about her”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well..you don’t” Wanda said. “We can’t always control these things, you know that..” She added. "But..what you can control?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fix the mess I just made?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda grinned. “Ding-ding-di-”</p><p> </p><p>“No, shut up” Rio muttered, hiding her face back in her hands. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda chuckled. “You know what I am. Say it, sayy ittt-”</p><p> </p><p>“Very annoying”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope! Close-”</p><p> </p><p>“How is that close?”</p><p> </p><p>“Close to what?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed. “Close to you being ri-” She put her finger up, catching on with a little laugh. “Nice try. Very nice, well done. I’ll give you props for that”</p><p> </p><p>The woman belted out a laugh, smiling wide as she sat up. “I’m right and you know it!” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She is. She really fucking is.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Wanda checked the time on her phone, faking a sigh Rio could see right through. She knew Wanda through and through, well enough to know her little ways of setting up a departure. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s late,” She said. “Better get Natasha home before she-”</p><p> </p><p>“Just shut up and get out” Rio snickered. </p><p> </p><p>The woman gasped, a hand tossed over her heart as she shook her head. </p><p> </p><p>“How rude!” </p><p> </p><p>“I know your pathetic cover up excuses!” Rio laughed. “You’re just hoping I run out of here to chase Agatha down. Jokes on you, I don’t even know her address and she sure as shit isn’t going to answer me now” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda scoffed. “Come on, you’re better than this”</p><p> </p><p>“What? I just told you-”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio. You used to track my drunk ass down in college endlessly. I think you can manage to track down your <em> co-worker” </em> </p><p> </p><p>She spoke while standing up, Rio instinctively held her hand to guide her out of the tub. Wanda turned on her heel once she collected herself. She pointed with a low,</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll regret this if you don’t-”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have her address!” </p><p> </p><p>“And you didn’t have all those frat houses, bars, diners, wherever the hell my binging and parties led me to. But..you found me. Every. Single. Time” </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head as she looked away. </p><p> </p><p>“This is different, Wan-”</p><p> </p><p>“It really isn't,” She said. “Technology and your brain have come a long way, don’t you think?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda then put her hand up, tilting her head to the side with nose scrunched,</p><p> </p><p>“On second thought, technology has come a long way. You? Not so mu-”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you have to leave?” </p><p> </p><p>The woman’s hands raised up in surrender, but her eyes still pointed with arrows- More so, daggers of their own. </p><p> </p><p>“You’ll regret this-”</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda!” Rio groaned. </p><p> </p><p>“Listen, you know my bullshit excuses to leave- I know what you’ll regret”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t leave room for discussion, not an argument or time for Rio to make more excuses. Wanda tossed a wave over her shoulder as she left the bathroom door open behind. Rio heard Nicky’s footsteps following the two out the kitchen and to the front door. </p><p> </p><p>“Do something!” Wanda yelled. </p><p> </p><p>“Call her, Rio!” Natasha called out. </p><p> </p><p>“Get out!” Rio yelled back. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky didn’t hesitate to run down the hall, jumping into the bathtub right next to her where Wanda once was. She focused on scratching his ears, holding him close as her mind began to race its own marathon all over again. </p><p> </p><p>The idea of going back to normal, chancing Agatha ignoring her like the week she had before. That was hell, pure fucking <em> hell. </em>Rio thought being annoyed by Agatha was bad, but then being ignored by her? </p><p> </p><p>Oh, it was worse. So much worse. </p><p>
<em> “Do something”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio silently cursed Wanda under her breath as she found her phone snug in her pocket. Seriously, what was she supposed to do? She had never been to Agatha’s and the thought of texting Alice asking for her address- </p><p> </p><p><em> Oh, I’d never hear the end of it. </em> </p><p> </p><p>The woman was just realizing herself there was no hatred left. Not a shred, sliver, a pinch of resentment for Agatha Harkness in her. That was a hard enough pill to swallow. Rio didn’t need the teasing and questions from others on top of it. That was a problem to encounter down the line. </p><p> </p><p>As she scrambled for solutions, names and ideas scanned like an imaginary checklist before her- The one boy stuck out in her mind the most. Agatha’s shadow, the one she was seen as a mentor for. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Billy. William. Ugh, whatever name that kid goes by! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio panicked, searching for her phone that was snug in her pocket. She whipped it out, searching the list of contacts that almost felt never ending. For an introvert, Rio had collected a variety of people over the years. To be fair, she never spent energy deleting numbers either. </p><p> </p><p>Luckily, Billy was listed under Kaplan- It was easier for Rio to put him in as that. She silently thanked letting him take her phone that Christmas party to put it in. It was rare they texted. Only if he had a question or needed help with the printer and no one else was available. </p><p> </p><p>She hit the call button, bringing it up to her ear as it started to ring, thinking shortly to herself-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> You better fucking answer, little shit. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Right as the few rings hit voicemail, Rio was about to end it when it was cut off with a panicked voice. </p><p> </p><p>“Professor Vidal?” He answered, stammering over his words. “Uh, you’ve never called me befor- I mean, yeah okay- Hello, how are”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha with you?” She asked, impatience making her tone clipped- words short. </p><p> </p><p>“Uhhh, no?” He replied in a questioning tone. “Why? Is she okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, just dandy-” Rio sighed, ignoring the concern in his tone. “What’s her address?” </p><p> </p><p>He was silent for a second. “Why?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed, shaking her head as she pinched the bridge of her nose. “Listen, don’t question me. Okay? I’m not in the mood”</p><p> </p><p>The woman knew she always made the boy a bit on edge. Part of her enjoyed that fact, but it wasn’t helping her out at the moment. She needed him to not question, just do as she said. Also Rio wasn’t in the mood for his stuttering and hesitation. </p><p> </p><p>“Billy, William, whatever the hell your name is-”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s whichever! Though I do prefer-”</p><p> </p><p>“Just shut up and give me her damn address before I kick your scrawny little ass” </p><p> </p><p>She threatened, sending the young man into a frazzled panic as he rambled on repeat with ‘Yes’ and ‘Sorry’ . Not a minute later, Rio had typed in the address into her GPS. Luckily, Agatha was only about ten minutes away-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Ten?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>All this time, Agatha lived so close and Rio never knew it. She wasn’t sure how to feel about that, but didn’t have the time to let the fact sink in. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure she’s okay, Professor Vidal? I can go over for you if you’d like. I know you two don’t uh, get along the greatest and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope, that’s all I needed. See you, Monday” </p><p> </p><p>She ended the phone call, kissing Nicky on the top of his head as she whispered,</p><p>“Hopefully,” She sighed, leaning back to meet his eyes. “I’m doing the right thing” </p><p> </p><p>He pushed forward, licking a quick stripe up her nose. She scrunched her nose in reply, shaking her head with a little smile. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re gross, but..I’ll take that as a yes”</p><p> </p><p>Rio then pushed up on her feet, adjusting her clothes before looking in the mirror. She didn’t look her best, her eyes were tired and the stress, fear she wore was visible. But, it didn’t matter.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I have to see her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She could only hope Agatha would want to see her as well. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio ran up the flights of stairs, not chancing being caught in an elevator. It didn’t matter to her if she had to make it up to the fifth floor, breathless and winded by the time she had read the number-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “505”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She took in a deep breath, hands on her hips while taking a step back. As her heart steadied itself the best it could with the situation she was in- Rio started to rehearse what she would say.</p><p> </p><p><em> Wait..what do I even say? </em> </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t thought that far ahead. She was acting on impulse, every move she made uncalculated and didn’t hold a plan of its own by any means. Normally, Rio was always well ahead of schedule and knew precisely her every move. <br/><br/>For the first time in her life, Rio was without guidance. She was off a cliff, hanging by a few fingers for dear life. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Hey Agatha- No, too casual.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha, I’m sorry- For what? What if that isn’t even the problem here? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I love you, Ag- No. Too straight forward, creepy. She’d never say that back. Not now, at least. Right? Right.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha, I- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The door swung open, cutting off Rio’s inner rehearsal of trial and errors. Agatha was holding a bit of cash in one hand, still dressed in Rio’s clothes from barely an hour ago. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio?” Agatha asked, confusion written all over her. “What..how did you-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grip slipped off the cliff, free falling into the atmosphere with no harness to steady the fall. She was completely on her own. No rehearsal, script or plan. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Here goes nothing. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Perk of terrifying the shit out of Kaplan” Rio shrugged with a tremble of a smile. “Can squeeze information out of him pretty uh..easily”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused, looking her up and down. She folded the cash back up, shoving it in her pocket before crossing her arms. Rio’s lips opened to say something else, but Agatha was having none of it. </p><p> </p><p>It didn’t take a rocket scientist to know, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She’s pissed.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want?” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Is now a good time?” Rio rubbed the back of her neck, teetering back and forth on her feet. “Mid crisis and all?”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you tal- <em> Oh.. </em>yeah,” Agatha remembered her lie, clearing her throat as she stood a bit taller. “I- Actually, no. Not really. I’ll see you later, k?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped back, her hand on the edge of the door as it started to shut in Rio’s face. The older woman acted on a whim, not thinking as she lunged forward. One hand pressed under the peephole, her foot jammed between the doorframe and the door itself. </p><p> </p><p>She silently thanked Agatha wasn’t too pissed off to slam the door shut. That would’ve hurt, but..not as much as it would if Rio fucked this all up. </p><p> </p><p>“No, Rio-”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, wait” Rio cut her off. </p><p> </p><p>Her voice was breathless, still caught in a panic. She looked at Agatha with her eyes wide, pleading for one more minute- Just a second chance at fixing the mess she made of them. </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Agatha’s anger softened. However, that only lasted for less than a millisecond. She hardened back up, a shell impossible to crack as she sternly ordered, </p><p> </p><p>“Spit it out” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze, a statue solidified by Agatha’s stare as if she was Medusa herself. She took slow heavy breaths, gawking at her with no words to be said. <br/><br/>Agatha’s anger held no patience for it. She simply rolled her eyes, kicking Rio’s foot away as she spoke-</p><p> </p><p>“K’, goodbye Ri-”</p><p> </p><p>“No, Agatha!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was desperate, terrified of letting Agatha go and losing everything they had discovered. Her life had changed drastically in less than a month. Agatha Harkness went from her enemy to a woman she couldn’t phantom spending her life without. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Now or never.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I could never hate you. Not after knowing how…” </p><p> </p><p>She swallowed the lump in her throat, terrified to say the words- unsure of where to go. </p><p> </p><p>“How?” Agatha pressed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio took in a deep breath, shaking her head as she barely said above a whisper,</p><p> </p><p>“How good it feels to let myself not hate you..” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Just say you love her, idiot. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Why is it so hard to say those three words? They were true! Stupidly, fucking, true. Rio couldn’t deny it any longer. Even if she tried to do so, there’d be a huge sign on her forward in all capitals that said <em> “LIAR”  </em></p><p> </p><p>“Why aren’t you hating-”</p><p> </p><p>“Because I’m too busy fucking loving you, Agatha” </p><p> </p><p>The confession came out rough, tense- panicked and frightened all at once. She looked down for a split moment, waiting a bit before peaking back up in fear. Agatha hadn’t said anything, but wore a look of shock stronger than Rio’s. </p><p> </p><p>Rio swore she could hear both of their hearts banging, threatening to break out of their skin and bones to grab onto one another. Was that a good or bad thing? She wasn’t sure of the answer to that question quite yet. </p><p> </p><p>Finally after a few moments that felt like eternity, Agatha slowly nodded. She didn’t clear her throat, leaving her voice cracking as she spoke, </p><p> </p><p>“That's a bold statement, Vidal” </p><p> </p><p>Rio puffed out a small bit of air with a little smile. Even as the tension was so strong that not even a bullet would be able to break through it- Rio felt a bit of relief. Agatha hadn’t slammed the door in her face or looked disgusted. </p><p> </p><p>Which only begged the question- <em> Could she actually feel the same? </em></p><p> </p><p>She shook the thought out of her mind, finding her footing to speak once again.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well..” She said, looking down as she whispered, “Pretty bold of you to ruin my life”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha puffed out a laugh. “Oh, that is such a <em> lovely </em>thing to follow up with after such a confession”</p><p> </p><p>What Rio didn’t hear in Agatha’s voice through those words? The sound of relief. </p><p> </p><p>She had no idea that night when Agatha’s fingers buried themselves inside of her for the first time- She almost said it. Agatha was so close to breaking first, speaking words neither thought would be said by either of them to each other. </p><p> </p><p>“Only the truth..” Rio shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>“Explain yourself” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushed, trying to strengthen her voice back to being strict. Even if it was a weak attempt, it was enough to strike fear into Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“How do you manage to fall in love with someone who ruined your life, hm?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused. </p><p> </p><p><em> Yeah, how the fuck did you? </em>She asked herself. </p><p> </p><p>The woman waved that question away, sent it flying to only come back later and smack her in the back of the head. For now, she needed to think quick- Go by instinct, not let hesitation and fear silence her. </p><p> </p><p>“Because..” Rio said, taking a few seconds before adding a small, “I never knew how good being ruined could be” </p><p> </p><p>For a lingering moment, one that spread past thirty seconds- Neither said anything. There was no movement, word, barely a breath to be heard. </p><p> </p><p>The silence made Rio doubt everything. <em> Ruined. </em>That was such a stupid word. Maybe Agatha took it the wrong way, the true meaning and definition of it. The opposite of what Rio was trying to say. If she did, Rio couldn’t necessarily blame her. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> No, no- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I-”</p><p> </p><p>The woman gasped as her collar was yanked forward. She felt her feet lift off the floor, body being pulled through the threshold before pressed up against the back of the door- feeling it slam shut behind her. </p><p> </p><p>She barely had time to breathe before her body was pulled forward again- This time, with lips pressed against her own. Rio nearly melted in Agatha’s grip, following like a lost puppy as she took every step the woman guided. Their lips barely parted, firm and rough- moving in harmony as they traveled down the hall-</p><p> </p><p><em> Hallway? Maybe? Fuck. I’ll look to see the layout of this place after. </em>Rio told herself. </p><p> </p><p>Right then, Rio gave Agatha complete control. She allowed herself to be guided, pulled, and tossed right onto the bed without any grace. </p><p> </p><p>She rolled over onto her back, panting as she gazed at the woman above. Agatha was taking heavy breaths, running a hand through her hair as she took slow strides closer and closer- Almost a predator circling in on their prey.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed up on her elbows. A little smirk grew as she swiped her tongue on the inside of her cheek. </p><p> </p><p>“Not even gonna’ give me the tour first?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, shaking her head as she knelt down on the bed. </p><p> </p><p>Her hands pressed into the mattress on either side of Rio’s hips, slowly hovering over her. The long hair created a wall on either side of Rio’s face, forcing her to only see the beauty above- </p><p> </p><p>Not that she needed to be forced to do that. Agatha was the only sight on Rio’s radar right then (And always). </p><p> </p><p>The woman leaned down, their noses brushed together- Lips almost touching only for her to pull back as she asked,</p><p> </p><p>“Do you trust me to <em> ruin </em> you even more?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio took a second before letting out a soft laugh, shaking her head. “Not possible”</p><p> </p><p>She shrugged, lifting one hand to pull at Agatha’s collar before maneuvering it down- ready to strip her own hoodie right off of her. Rio made sure their eyes stayed locked together, never parting as she whispered, </p><p> </p><p>“Already fell for my stupid, annoying, worst enemy. How could I possibly-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t let the woman finish her words. She shoved her back on the bed, Rio’s elbows gave out and her head smacked into the pillows. Before she could reach out to bring Agatha with her- She was off the bed and stripping off the hoodie. </p><p> </p><p>Rio whined out a small, “I wanted to do that”</p><p> </p><p>The woman heard a little scoff, but wasn’t sure if it actually happened. Agatha paid no mind as she rummaged through her dresser. </p><p> </p><p>She was topless, only in sweatpants- giving Rio time to admire her back. Toned muscles were decorated by freckles and faded red claw marks from the nights before. Her mouth was dry, yet drool was not far from the horizon either. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was about to speak when Agatha spun around, holding two things that made her stomach flip and drop- heart stop while oxygen ceased to exist.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>In her hands as Agatha slowly made her way back to the bed was something Rio had subtly imagined about, but never dared to voice. She had never asked for such a thing, only ever was the one to use it on another woman. </p><p> </p><p>The black harness was in one hand, purple dildo in the other. </p><p> </p><p><em> ..Fuck, fuck- Fuck? Fuck. </em>Rio’s mind chanted. </p><p> </p><p>Even with how struck with lust she was, excited and turned on unlike ever before- Rio wasn’t one to give in. Not that easy, anyway. </p><p> </p><p>She smirked, pushing back up on her elbows with a pathetic scoff. </p><p> </p><p>“You really think you can ruin me with that?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Because, you can. Oh. You so fucking can.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha simply smiled, placing the items down on the bed as she crawled over her once again. This time, she dipped down to push Rio’s hoodie up- her lips graced the soft skin of her abdomen. Gentle kisses, little licks that went higher and higher until she hit Rio’s sports bra underneath. </p><p> </p><p>She pushed the bra up, bringing Rio on the verge of whimpering- waiting for Agatha’s lips to grace her sensitive nipples that were expecting her. </p><p> </p><p>But the tease she was? Rio shouldn’t have been surprised when she simply pulled away with a little grin. </p><p> </p><p>“Ag-”</p><p> </p><p>“You doubt me, huh?” Agatha questioned.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was taking heavy breaths, eyebrows furrowed as she shook her head. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wha- Oh. Ruined. Right.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah” She lied (Even Rio knew how pathetic she sounded). </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked, hands pulling away from her skin completely. Rio restrained a whine from losing her touch, but was helped by Agatha caressing her cheek instead. It wasn’t exactly where she wanted her, but..Rio would take what she could get. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s cute..” Agatha said, eyes admiring Rio’s lips. </p><p> </p><p>She let her thumb run across her bottom one, pulling it down gently- barely being able to make her own move because Rio had beat her to it. </p><p> </p><p>Her tongue slipped underneath the tip of her thumb, dragging it back as if she had a cord wrapped around the digit. Rio’s lips sealed shut, tongue swirling slowly around Agatha’s thumb- warm, wet, beautiful against her skin. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha struggled to contain her moan over the sight, shaking her head- snapping herself out of the trance to keep her control the best she could. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you trust me?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio felt her thumb slip away, letting go with an exaggerated <em> ‘pop’ </em>as she nodded with no hesitation. </p><p> </p><p>“I won't be upset you don't, Rio. I can assure you tha-”</p><p> </p><p>“Ruin me, Harkness” Rio encouraged. “Or, are you scared of just being all talk and no sh-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned, shaking her head as she roughly grabbed her hips- lifting them up to yank down Rio’s waistband of her leggings. The woman below couldn’t hold back a small laugh, feeling her legs exposed to the cool air, not caring where Agatha had tossed her bottoms to.</p><p> </p><p>She reached out to grab onto Agatha’s waistband, ready to discard her's. But, a firm grip on her wrist pushed Rio back. Before she knew it, both hands were pinned against the pillow above her head, Agatha’s face just a few inches away. </p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, lips parted as her pupils dilated. Agatha didn’t look tender and sweet. There wasn’t the same care, begging and asking for trust anymore. </p><p> </p><p>The devil was above her. </p><p>The woman she put through for three years being her enemy was ready to get her revenge. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha may have fucked her before, but Rio knew right then? She was fucked seven ways to Sunday and then some. </p><p> </p><p>“You will move when I say you move” </p><p><br/>Her voice was dark, raspy, filled with an edge that cut Rio to the core in the best way. </p><p> </p><p>“You will speak when I tell you to” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s leg lifted, prying itself between Rio’s legs. Before she knew it, the soft fabric of Agatha’s sweatpants pressed against the outside of her bare cunt (Or..her sweatpants? God. Rio didn’t even know. Whoever they belonged to, the fabric was already ruined). </p><p> </p><p>She made a soft sound, an echo of a whimper through a gasp as her back arched off the bed over the pressure. </p><p> </p><p>“And you..” Agatha leaned down, smirking right as her nose brushed against Rio’s. Lips barely touching as she whispered. “You will remember that I fucking love you too”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shivered, swallowing the lump in her throat- One built with nerves and disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha loved her. </p><p>She loved Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>And suddenly, in what felt like a blink of an eye- <em> We aren’t enemies anymore..fuck. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Sound like a deal?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared, unable to respond. Agatha didn’t wait a minute to clear her throat before adding on,</p><p> </p><p>“Rio. I asked you a ques-”</p><p> </p><p>“I love you too”</p><p> </p><p>The words caught Rio off guard just as they did with Agatha. Both of their eyes widened, a deep flush of warmth burnt Rio’s skin- Embarrassment making her shy into herself as Agatha let go with a little laugh.</p><p> </p><p>She nodded, flipping her hair back with a little wink,</p><p> </p><p>“Take that as a yes”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha then leaned down to gently pull Rio into a kiss. One delicate, distracting as Rio subtly felt Agatha take her hand and guide it down her own body. Rio gasped into the kiss the second her fingers felt the soaked tangle of hair, remembering the words like she would every single time. </p><p> </p><p>The second night they spent together, Rio had whispered an apology she forgot to shave once again. Any other woman she dated or slept with was one to cringe from any stubble of hair- Something Rio never felt completely comfortable with. </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha? She simply smirked, whispering a soft,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Honey, the hair on your body is the last thing on my mind. The only thing I’m thinking about is fucking you, tasting you, so much more” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Maybe to someone else, the words would have been meaningless. Rio shouldn’t have felt so self conscious over something so small. However, it meant more than anything else. </p><p> </p><p>The rest of that night, Agatha had worshipped and devoured her. Little whispers of adoration, reassurance Rio never had to hide or feel embarrassed by any inch of her skin. </p><p> </p><p><em> She loved me then. Fuck. How could I have been so blind to this? </em>Rio wondered. </p><p>That was the last rambling thought she had as her fingertips slipped between her folds, feeling her arousal soak not only her fingers- But Agatha’s that rested on top of her own. </p><p> </p><p>Both sighed into the kiss before pulling apart. Agatha pushed Rio’s middle finger to slip by, circling around once before rubbing a quick swipe over her clit. Rio whimpered, jolting at the strike of pleasure that coursed through her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rubbed Rio’s clit with her, slowly, not in any kind of rush. It lasted for a moment, something that felt far too quick for Rio to fully comprehend before she pulled back. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand went to follow, but Agatha pushed her back to where she left her. Middle finger pressed on her clit, not letting off as she ordered, </p><p> </p><p>“Continue with that” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushed up and off Rio’s body. She stood at the edge of the bed, grabbing the harness with a little smirk. </p><p> </p><p>“C’mon now, Professor..” She said. “You’re not dumb”</p><p><br/>With her mind becoming fuzzy, clouded and overwhelmed with crazed thoughts. She nearly wanted to scream out for Agatha to fuck her. It distracted her till the realization hit-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh. Fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio started to rub small circles on her clit, pulling her bottom lip between her teeth to muffle the little sounds that would scream out louder than they threatened to. Another thought entered her mind. A short one that made her brain short circuit, all wires sparking into flames-</p><p> </p><p>She was slowly fucking herself while watching as Agatha pulled the strap on up, adjusting it with the harness. </p><p> </p><p>She was fucking herself watching Agatha prepare to fuck her. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> What happened to us being enemies? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio admired the dildo that now hung between Agatha’s legs, unsure if the seven inches (So Rio took a shot in the dark over) was hotter- Or the fact the strap on was over Agatha’s sweatpants, not bothering to spend the few seconds it’d take to strip them. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Jesus.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood back, her eyes stuck in a trance as she watched Rio’s finger move slowly. Her hand moved up to run through her hair, the other had her fingers wrapped around the base of the strap, rubbing just softly- enough to drive Rio to the edge of losing it. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha” Rio whispered. </p><p> </p><p>The woman above smirked, moving forward to kneel back on the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm?” She hummed, hands rubbing up her thighs. “Tell me, how does that feel” </p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled, shaking her head. “Not enough” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Figured as much”</p><p> </p><p>She pulled Rio’s hand away, lifting it to her lips- Not spending a second to wait before licking along her skin. Rio gasped as her fingers slipped between Agatha’s lips, feeling her tongue swipe and swirl every inch, cleaning off the mess she made all over them. </p><p> </p><p>A few seconds later, Agatha pulled them out with a low hum. She smiled, leaning down to whisper against Rio’s stomach-</p><p> </p><p>“Need more” </p><p> </p><p>Before she lowered, leaving kisses along the inside of Rio’s thighs- taking her sweet time which frustrated the hell out of the other woman. </p><p> </p><p>“Come on-”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope,” Agatha tisked, shaking her head as she looked back up. “You don’t get to rush me-”</p><p> </p><p>“But-”</p><p> </p><p>“Three years,” Agatha said. “You made me wait that long. Think you can manage to hold on for me just for a bit, Rio”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed. “Not fai-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha silenced her with a light smack on her thigh, enough to sting but not leave a mark. </p><p> </p><p>“Did I tell you to speak?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered. “You didn’t shut up for those three years so why- No. <em> No, </em>Agatha-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, trying to hide how amused and the way she adored Rio like this. The most stubborn professor was such a brat, a sarcastic thing that became grouchy just from not getting what she wanted asap.</p><p> </p><p>She pushed up as Rio spoke, standing to her feet as she reached down- grabbing Rio’s leggings. Not a second later did Rio stammer into a string of her name, pushing up on her elbows as her eyes begged for her to come back. </p><p> </p><p>The woman looked back with a small smirk, shaking her head as she rasped, “You done being a brat?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed with a small frown, narrowed eyes with a shake of her head. “You’re evil”</p><p> </p><p>“And you’re desperate” Agatha tossed the leggings aside, going back to her as she grinned. “Aren’t you, dear?”</p><p> </p><p><em> Yes. </em>Rio thought to herself, but she wasn’t giving in that easy. </p><p> </p><p>She collected herself, shaking her head as she sped the words off, “Three years, like you said…not that desperate clearly”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused, staring at her before a little laugh. “Right..”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded, bending down to push her legs open with a silent whistle. </p><p> </p><p>“Mm,” She hummed, rubbing her hand over the folds- dipping two fingers to slide through them, smirking when Rio’s hips lifted to chase her. “You feel pretty desperate..<em> soaking </em>desperate”  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha brought her fingers up, snickering as Rio’s lips parted without an order. She slipped them along the woman’s tongue, letting Rio taste herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me, darling. Do you think you taste desperate?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brain short circuited more than before as Agatha slid her fingers back out. She didn’t get a chance to reply as her fingertips thrusted inside for a millisecond before back out. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes locked with Rio’s, slipping the same fingers between her own lips- humming at the taste she’d never grow tired of. </p><p> </p><p>“God,” She rasped. “You taste more than desperate than seconds ago” She laughed. “Wouldn’t you agree, Professor?”</p><p>Rio was speechless, broken, on the verge of being ruined and Agatha had barely even touched her yet. Agatha seemed to be thinking the same as she laughed, </p><p> </p><p>“Haven’t even buried my fingers,” She pushed her fingers back against her cunt, leaning down slowly. “Or my strap in you…” She added. </p><p> </p><p>Just when she hovered above, barely more than a few centimeters away from her face- Agatha whispered, “And you’re fucking speechless” </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpered, earning a soft laugh from Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Think you can do as I say now, Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha won. Rio couldn’t put up a fight or challenge. She was spent, desperate, a burning desire for more. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you say?” Agatha whispered. “What do I want to hear? Come on, baby. You know-”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Fuck me, professor” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed with a smile. Rio had said it twice before, but with the new found confession- A future in front of them- It was different. Even better because Agatha had always called her the little name, never the reverse. </p><p><br/>And the context Agatha was able to hear her own nickname from the other woman in? <em> She could die. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Good girl” Agatha kissed her cheek before moving down. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed down her stomach, along inner thighs for multiple painful minutes. Rio tried to control her temper, on the verge of pulling Agatha’s face to where she needed her most.</p><p> </p><p>Finally after close to seven minutes, Agatha graced her  by licking a small stripe, barely enough to apply pressure on her clit. She pulled away with a hum- diving back in to press a firm kiss against her clit, dipping her tongue inside a second after, nose bumping against her clit at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t restrain the loud whine, biting down on her knuckles while her other hand grasped the bedsheets. </p><p><br/>Agatha completely forgot about her fingers, too lost in the beautiful taste. Sweet, sultry, a taste that drove her off the deep end more than anything else ever could. Only when Rio’s fingers tangled in her hair, a soft cry that barely uttered the word-</p><p> </p><p><em> “More” </em>did she remember. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled her head back, smiling as Rio whined with a  shake of her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha- Ple-”</p><p> </p><p>The beg was turned into a cry as Agatha slipped her middle finger in. Her walls soft, tight, sucking her in as if Agatha was the medicine she needed to not die in that moment. </p><p> </p><p>Barely a few seconds later did she replace one with two, then after two with three. Rio thrashed beneath her, a combination of moans and gasps- Uttered words mixed with Spanish and English both. Agatha noted she needed to study Spanish to pick up on what Rio was saying, but that was for the future. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t wait much longer, unsure if it was too soon for Rio or not. She’d ask, make sure of it beforehand even if it killed her. But <em> fuck, </em> she needed more. <em> So much more. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Think you’re ready for me, baby?” Agatha asked. </p><p><br/>Rio whimpered, hips thrusted up that brought out a little laugh from Agatha. She slid her fingers out, ripping a whine of complaint out of the other woman. Agatha shushed her softly as she crawled back over her, tapping her lips with her fingertips to open. </p><p> </p><p>As Rio sucked off her fingers, their eyes locked together- never parting for a second. Agatha whispered,</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so fucking beautiful, Aggravatingly beautiful”</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t stop the little chuckle, letting Agatha’s fingers slip away as she replied, “And I’m the one with insults”</p><p> </p><p>“Not an insult when it’s just the truth, idiot”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, a warm one with a bit of lust growing beneath it. She reached down to hold the base of the strap, inching forward before leaning back.</p><p> </p><p>“Shit,” She cursed. “Let me grab some lube. I don’t want you to feel uncomfo-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands shot up to grip her forearms, shaking her head. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t need it” She assured. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowned. “But, I-”</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you were going to ruin me, hm?” Rio pushed a piece of Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “Or is mi amor too soft for that now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly died at the two words. <em> Mi amor. </em> Rio had only said it once before. It was in passing on the way to work that morning. Agatha knew she hadn’t even realized her words, never explaining what they meant. She ended up Googling it in the car before heading inside. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Dinner tonight at yours?” Agatha asked, adjusting her bag over her shoulder.  </em>
</p><p><em> <br/></em> <em> Rio nodded as she rushed over from the door to peck her lips, whispering a soft, “Have a good day mi amor”  </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha watched her rush out the front door, a silent agreement they left a few minutes apart. She stood dumbfounded, eyes wide with her lips still tingling from the kiss. Two words cycled and tossed like a dryer did with clothes in her mind,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Mi amor.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I swear-” Rio scoffed. “Just fuck me already. God, you’re insufferable” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused before a laugh. “She loves me, trusts me, and insults me throughout it all. How’d a woman like me get so lucky?”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I swea- <em> Fuck”  </em></p><p> </p><p>She pushed the tip of the strap in just as Rio went to argue, silencing her into a moan. Not a second later did Agatha pull away, smirking as Rio punched the bed beneath her. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a bitch” Rio muttered. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, what was that?” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>“I said you are such a-<em> Mmph!”  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha repeated the same motion, but this time the strap went farther than just the tip- staying still as she watched Rio bite back her lips, silencing herself completely. </p><p> </p><p>“What? Cat got your tongue?” Agatha feigned a pout, lips pursed as she tilted her head. “Nothing more to add, dear?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whispered something under her breath, looking to the side as she pushed her hips up. Agatha though had a strong grip, forcing them back down leaving her unable to move. </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t hear that” Agatha tisked. “Try again” </p><p> </p><p>The woman below groaned, shaking her head before locking her eyes with Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“I said…<em> fuck me already” </em>She ordered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, inching the strap in a tiny bit more. Her hands roamed up to push Rio’s hoodie- making it rest above her breasts, leaving them bare and exposed just as Agatha’s were. </p><p> </p><p>She slowly pushed more and more, giving Rio time to adjust or stop if she needed her to do so. However, Rio only whimpered and moaned more. Her lips parted, jaw ajar as she closed her eyes- Agatha was having none of that though. </p><p> </p><p>She grasped Rio’s chin, shaking her head with a click of her tongue. </p><p> </p><p>“Eyes open or I stop, Rio”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate to obey, following her words without a fight. And <em> fuck, </em>Agatha would never grow tired of that. </p><p> </p><p>Just as their eyes locked, the strap fit like a glove- sucked in and melted them into one. Rio’s nails sunk into Agatha’s skin, holding tighter as she felt a flood of need cry out- unable to vocalize it completely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t warn, she didn’t ask this time around- her hips pulled away achingly slow before snapping back with a force that made Rio’s need to cry out make noise. Her back arched, nails dug deeper as she started to babble off a plea,</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, please, please- I-”</p><p> </p><p>“I know, baby..” Agatha whispered. “I’m gonna’ fuck you..ruin you for just me only, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>Her hips sped up only a sliver, barely enough to scratch the itch that only increased. She smiled as Rio’s head tilted back. Waves of power, desire, a crazed need flooded and drowned her. Agatha barely said anything else before her hips thrusted more, deeper, faster- becoming a pace that could only be described as ruthless. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t extremely vocal in bed, well- Beforehand, that was. Agatha was the loud one with screams and dramatic moans. Rio was whimpers, soft whines and hushed words. Not this time. <em> Holy fuck, not this time.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha was driven crazy with every moan that grew louder and louder, Rio begging in chants that could be compared to mantras. She’d joke later on it felt like Rio was trying to cast a spell, pull her into magic that’d control her completely. </p><p> </p><p>If that was real though? Agatha would gratefully accept it. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m…<em> Mierda, mierda-” </em></p><p> </p><p><em> Fuck. </em>Agatha had looked up the meaning for that one after their first night together. She learned early on Rio would chant that like one word like a prayer. </p><p> </p><p>“Gonna’ come for me, baby? Huh?” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, gasping and on the verge before Agatha was a witch of her own kind-</p><p>
<em> “FUCK!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio cried out as Agatha pulled out in a swift motion, leaving her bare and empty before she was able to tip over the edge. She felt her body move away, leaving her to punch the bedsheets with a huff. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” She exclaimed.</p><p><br/>Agatha snickered. “Yes, my love?” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a bit-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gripped her hoodie, pulling her up to guide her over-</p><p> </p><p>“Hands and knees” She ordered, ignoring Rio’s complaints. “Come on-”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m trying!” </p><p> </p><p><em> Oh, this is good. </em> Agatha laughed in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t edged Rio like this before. In subtle ways, she had, but like this? Ripping her from an orgasm that was so close instead of halfway? Teasing her endlessly beforehand? </p><p>
<em> Could get used to this.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“This is so stupid” Rio muttered as she did what Agatha told her to do. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, twirling Rio’s hair around her fingers with a slight yet firm tug back to her. She leaned down, lips ghosting Rio’s ear with a whisper,</p><p> </p><p>“Wanna’ say that again?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, shaking her head frantically. </p><p> </p><p>“No, baby. Please. I just want you so bad and I- I- <em> Oh!”  </em></p><p> </p><p>She cried out as Agatha lined the tip of the dildo to her cunt, pushing in- This time, she didn’t ease or tease. A strong, quick, punch through her like a cannon. She didn’t wait either to start thrusting her hips- A stronger pace than before. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s moans were stronger. A sobbing sound that cried out for Agatha only. At a volume the neighbors would certainly complain about. Neither would care, they’d both laugh and Agatha would point out that’s why they needed to fuck at Rio’s. </p><p> </p><p><em> “We can get Nicky earmuffs” </em>Agatha would smirk as Rio rolled her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Don’t! I don’t want him to know-”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “That you’re a slut for me?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “...I hate you” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Anyway, take your clothes off”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled Rio’s hair back again, smiling like a mad woman as drool with dripping down her chin. She chuckled, unable to hold back a little tease. </p><p> </p><p>“Drooling for me, baby?” She asked. “Oh, this is new..and to think- You tried saying you weren’t desperate. Just a beautiful slut, crying out on my-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio screamed out, gripping the pillow as body started to pulse. She felt fire burn every piece of her. A blinding white that took over her eyes, blinding her vision as she could only focus on the pleasure shaking her to the core. </p><p>Her walls tightened, almost making it impossible for Agatha to continue thrusting through. </p><p> </p><p>She tensed, muscles trembling and weak- only being held up by Agatha’s grip on her hair. Agatha took advantage of Rio growing weak by pulling the woman up against her front. An arm wrapped around her waist while the one in her hair moved to grasp her throat. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t stop thrusting up in her. This time it was slower, but deeper- letting Rio ride through her orgasm that felt never ending. </p><p> </p><p>“Coming so hard for me” Agatha whispered blindly, finding Rio’s hand to press over her lower abdomen. The little bump pushed against her palm. “Feel that, honey?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whined, nodding with another moan slipped between. </p><p> </p><p>“Good. Don’t move till you come again for me- This time,” Agatha held her throat tighter with one hand, pressing Rio’s palm against her skin harder with the other. “Wait till I tell you to come, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded, pathetic moans with little words slurred along. Ones neither could make sense of. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha loved fucking Rio past one orgasm into the next. It never took as long as the first, a rush of excitement, a flood of anticipation and the need to feel the same sensation all over again. </p><p> </p><p>The woman held her tighter, the bump against Rio’s palm rising up and down multiple times over. Agatha made sure her hand stayed while her own rubbed over the patch of hair that was sticky and soaked. Her fingers slipped down, groaning as she felt the mess that was sure leaving running marks down her thighs- most likely soaking the bedsheets below. </p><p> </p><p>“God, Rio” Agatha gasped. “I’m- <em> Fuck” </em></p><p> </p><p>The base of the harness was bumping against Agatha’s clothed cover clit with every thrust. A pressure that weighed heavier with every thrust. Holding Rio in her arms, fucking her to the point she was screaming in her ear louder than ever before. On top of it all, knowing Rio was hers completely. </p><p> </p><p>Rio loved her. Rio fucking <em> loved </em>her. That thought alone was enough to send Agatha into a crashing orgasm of her own. </p><p><br/>Her plan was to hold off a bit longer, make Rio wait- But, she couldn’t. Not when her own tsunami of pleasure was about to take control. </p><p> </p><p>“Come with me, mi amor” Rio rasped, her free hand raised up to hold the side of Agatha’s face. </p><p> </p><p>Their heads were held together, bodies moving in harmony. An image that was pornographic, erotic, and beautiful more than anything else. It was an omen, a sign of the duo they were always meant to be. Not two enemies at odds, just lovers entangled and perfectly built for each other. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m supposed to be telling you when-” </p><p><br/>Rio pressed back the best she could, enough to press the strap harder against Agatha’s clit. She smiled, a love drunk one as Agatha started to moan against her ear. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m..Ri- <em> Rio </em>” </p><p> </p><p>Both of them held tight onto one another as if they were bracing for a world ending storm. Both cried out in sync, a duet with the same tone, singing out for each other. They became lost in a swirl of chaos, a spiral that brought them down onto the bed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was beneath Agatha who laid on top of her. Both spent, breathless, weak. Their bodies shivered through the aftershocks, taking time to settle and make sense of what just happened. </p><p> </p><p>Rio loved the weight of Agatha on top. The dildo, a piece of Agatha, was still stuffed deep inside of her. The bedsheet was rough against her clit, pressing against the bunched up part of it. She wasn’t sure if Agatha would laugh, find her weird or too needy, but <em> fuck- </em></p><p> </p><p>After that? With Agatha’s own orgasm still in her mind, how it felt to come in sync with her? </p><p> </p><p>Rio maneuvered her hips, letting the bedsheet weakly rub against her clit. It took a few moments for Agatha to come out of her daze, catch on to Rio below. She smirked, choking back a moan as she reached forward to hold the pillows. </p><p> </p><p>“Not enough for you, huh?” </p><p><br/>The woman jumped, only able to babble out a soft whine. Agatha nodded more to herself, finding strength to thrust weak, slow, but enough to press back into the spot that drove Rio wild. They shuffled, slowly swayed against the bed together. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t intense pleasure like before, but enough with how sensitive Agatha had left Rio to make an impact. Especially as Agatha pushed a piece of hair back to whisper against Rio’s ear. </p><p> </p><p>“Wanted you to love me for so long”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, unable to form words of her own as she listened to her. </p><p> </p><p>“Made me your fucking enemy,” She rasped. “Now everyone will know that was all an act. This is all you wanted, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>She felt the third orgasm approaching, so close she could taste it. Agatha bit her earlobe, thrusting a bit harder- The words she spoke, final ones that pushed Rio over the edge completely would be her new favorite ones to always hear. </p><p> </p><p>“God, Rio. I love you”</p><p> </p><p>Right then, Rio crashed all over again. She was suffocated by her moans, controlled and dictated by her body. </p><p> </p><p>Aka, body also and probably more defined by- <em> Agatha. </em></p><p> </p><p>After a few minutes, Rio’s body stopped shivering. Agatha waited till her breathing wasn’t so rapid, whispering a soft warning before she slowly pulled the strap from her. It was soaked, covered in Rio’s cum. Agatha would lose her mind at the thought of Rio sucking every part of it off, but that was for another time. </p><p><br/>For now, she pulled it from the harness, putting it aside. Agatha didn’t spend time taking the harness off. She was too eager to hold Rio close, whisper soft praises and promises to love her forever.  </p><p> </p><p>But first?</p><p> </p><p>“Do my eyes deceive me, or have I ruined you <em> Professor? </em>” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio took a second, flipping over to lay on her back as Agatha was on her side- head propped up with her hand, elbow rested on the mattress. </p><p> </p><p>She smirked down at her, rubbing her free hand over Rio’s torso. Her fingertips delicately tracing random patterns, letter that spelled out a mix of-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I love you </em>
</p><p>
<em> Mine </em>
</p><p>
<em> You’re annoying. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“More ways than one. That’s official” Rio answered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed with a small smile. </p><p> </p><p>“So…you didn’t mean what you said in your kitchen?”</p><p><br/>Rio snapped her head over, eyes wide as she shook her head. “No. That’s what I came here to tell you”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed. “Yeah, you told me alright. Three orgasms worthy of an explanation”</p><p> </p><p>The woman beside her groaned, smacking her shoulder before turning to bury herself in Agatha’s chest. She let out a warm laugh, wrapping her arm around her- kissing the top of Rio’s head with a soft sigh. </p><p> </p><p>They stayed like that for quite awhile. Just Rio buried in her hold, Agatha making sure to never let her go. Even if her back was strained, arm falling asleep beneath her head- All of it. Nothing mattered. They could stay in that spot till they died and Agatha would be happy with her end. </p><p> </p><p>However, Rio was the one to break their silence- whispering a soft, muffled against Agatha’s skin,</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad you don’t hate me” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, holding back the tears that started to gloss over her eyes. She held her closer, whispering against her skull a soft,</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad you’re done hating me” </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate to reply, </p><p> </p><p>“I never really did…”</p><p>

<br/>
</p><p>Subtle footsteps creaked along the floorboards. Rio started to wake slow, gentle. Though as her eyes started to flutter, mind drifting from its state of slumber, realization dawned on her-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> This isn't my room.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s body jolted, eyes snapped open, frantically searching to remember where she was. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t her room, but it didn’t feel foreign. </p><p>It wasn’t her bed, but it didn’t feel wrong. </p><p> </p><p>As her hand ran over the bedsheets, wrinkled and cool to the touch on the vacant side of the bed- She was reminded of everything. The night before down to the smallest details. </p><p> </p><p>How she ran to Agatha’s doorstep, confessing words she never thought would roll off her tongue. They felt heavy, but weightless at the same time. A burden was off her shoulders. A new sense of life, freedom, hope had resided in her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a sigh of relief, letting go of her limbs as she rolled onto her back with hands over her face, hiding the biggest grin that grew wider than the Atlantic/Pacific ocean put together. </p><p> </p><p>She felt her heart flutter, goosebumps raised over every inch of her skin. Each mark, hickey, bruise and scratch Agatha left started to burn. A shining reminder of the night before. </p><p> </p><p>They had spent the entire night devouring each other in ways they hadn’t. Sex that night held a different meaning. In between falling asleep, one would wake up the other by kissing down her stomach. Rio at one point licked, sucked, rolled Agatha’s nipples until she was awake and whimpered her name like a plea. Agatha on the other was an asshole who woke Rio up by pinching her, tickling her sides with a tiny, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I’m bored. Wake up” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio, of course, never complained. Only groaned with a raspy, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “We just fucked, Agatha..”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha would snicker, whispering against her lips,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Let me fuck you again” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>God, it didn’t feel real. None of it. Rio Vidal in bed with someone else wasn’t foreign or unheard of. But for her to be so comfortable, how she never wanted to leave for the night to end. That wasn’t a feeling she was used to. </p><p> </p><p>Not to mention all of this with her fucking <em> enemy? </em>The woman who made Rio’s life a living hell, a human she counted her days to retirement to avoid and considered fleeing the country to avoid? </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Have I liked her all this time? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>No. No way in hell, why would Rio even ask herself such a thing? </p><p> </p><p>Though…maybe it made sense. Maybe all this time Rio hated how Agatha was funnier than others. How her smile radiated through the darkest of days. Rio remembered going into work utterly miserable. Only to feel a little kick in her stomach when that grin was flashed her way, fingers wiggled as Agatha greeted her. </p><p> </p><p>The amount of popularity her classes gained as well wasn’t something that made Rio jealous (Maybe just a smidge). If anything, she found it incredibly impressive. It took skill, talent, and a well educated individual to create that name for herself. Rio wasn’t able to argue with herself on how attractive that was alone. </p><p> </p><p>Okay, so..maybe all this time her true emotions for Agatha were laying doormant. Somehow hidden beneath the surface. So deep not even Rio was able to pick up on them. Is that why she turned to anger and resentment? Was it easier than admitting to having a stupid crush on the younger professor? </p><p> </p><p>A little bit of a silent laugh echoed in her chest. She pulled her lips back to bite on them, staring at the ceiling in disbelief. How long would it take for this to all feel real? Her life already felt changed for the better. What was once dull, routine, happy moments with just her two closest friends or her dog turned into something more. </p><p> </p><p>Now Rio created memories past the sex and love confessions from the night before. She smiled hard remembering when Agatha realized she had ordered Chinese food. It was close to three AM when Agatha  checked her phone. Rio was fading in and out of slumber, naked in her bed, snuggled in her side. She remembered grumbling when Agatha got up, wrapping a bathrobe around herself. </p><p> </p><p>And then..Rio remembered waking up to the most beautiful sound down the hallway. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What are you laughing over?” Rio called out. “Come back to beddddd” She added. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha’s laughter grew closer. The sound of a paper bag wrinkling in her hand, held up when she stepped through the threshold.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio was on her stomach, cheek smushed in the pillow with hooded eyes close to slumber. She felt warmth spread from her chest throughout her body over the sight. Agatha in a baggy hoodie down to her mid thighs, hair a wreck- Her entire being a mess.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What’s that?” Rio asked.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha snorted. “My late second dinner I ordered…hours ago”  </em>
</p><p><em> <br/></em> <em> Rio paused before pushing up on her elbows, eyebrows furrowed until she realized- </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh..shit”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Both fell into a fit of laughter afterwards. Rio had held her arm up, begging for a bite of the cold food. The moment was bliss, sweet and domestic. A feeling of home Rio never knew could be so good. </p><p><br/>The abrupt sound of a zipper pulled Rio out of her haze. Her hands dragged off her face, sitting up enough to spot Agatha’s back turned to her. She was dressed in a pair of black sweatpants, along with one of Rio’s dark green hoodies. Her hair wet, fresh out of the shower- </p><p> </p><p>
<em> How did I not hear her get in the shower? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She had a purple suitcase on the dresser top, fidgeting with the zipper that didn’t want to shut. Rio felt her bubble of happiness pop within a second. One moment was happiness and bliss, straight to complete and utter confusion.  </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Is something wrong?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Where is she going? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Did I do some- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t expected to ask the question. The words raced off her tongue before she could catch them. She brought her knees up towards her chests, arms loosely wrapped around them. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha jumped, looking at her with eyes wide- A dim light from her night lamp casted a shadow over her face. If Rio weren’t so concerned and confused…she’d only be crazier about her right then. </p><p> </p><p>Instead she watched as Agatha put on a small smile. One that was genuine, but Rio’s anxiety made it out to be fake. </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Why do I feel like she’s lying? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I have to leave in a few hours. Going up north with Billy to visit his brother, remember?” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> No.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Truthfully, Rio hadn’t cared what Agatha did up until the past few weeks. Right until she sat in Agatha’s passenger seat after being stood up, eating melted ice cream with her- Rio didn’t care. And when she did start to care? Rio never thought about Agatha leaving. </p><p> </p><p>Well, no- She did. But in a different sense. Not on a trip away so soon. </p><p> </p><p>“Right..” Rio nodded, looking down as she pushed the hair out of her face, rasping a low- “What uh..time is it?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced over at her phone, not looking at Rio over her shoulder as she answered the question. “Close to five”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grumbled, covering her face as she realized Nicky had been home alone for nearly a whole night. He wasn’t used to Rio being away overnight, let alone a few hours. And she hadn’t even asked Wanda to stop by like she typically would. </p><p> </p><p><em> I’m not a bad dog mom. I don’t ever do this. </em>Rio told herself.  </p><p> </p><p>As much as she wanted to stay till Agatha had to walk out the door, she needed to be responsible. It wasn’t fair to Nicky if she left him longer than she already had. Besides, her anxiety was crawling up her skin like a bug. Skin tingling, nerves bubbling..</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I need to get home.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed the covers off, suddenly feeling exposed as her legs remained bare. Her skin was decorated in goosebumps, bruises, red marks. All of them like tattoos with Agatha as her artist. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha must’ve sensed her, maybe heard the ruffling of the covers behind because before Rio knew it-</p><p> </p><p>“Here” </p><p> </p><p>A fresh pair of clothes were neatly folded. A pair of sweatpants, fresh underwear, and a sweater Agatha had retired years ago. Rio felt warm at the reminder of its existence. The brown wool one that hung loosely on her shoulders. </p><p> </p><p>Any other time, Rio would feel honored to wear her clothes. Pieces of her wardrobe Agatha probably didn’t care to remember, but Rio did. However, it felt different. She felt rushed, pushed out of Agatha’s home as if she was never welcomed hours ago. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you..” She whispered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, oblivious to Rio’s nerves as she spun around to continue packing. She tossed over her shoulder a low, </p><p> </p><p>“Much rather keep you without clothes on, but..” She looked over with a small wink. “I suppose I won’t be too selfish”</p><p> </p><p>She turned back around right after saying it. The atmosphere turned colder. Rio felt a weird sinking feeling in her stomach, her heart thundering with every second that passed. </p><p> </p><p>It had to be herself. Agatha was flirting, smirking, winking at her like nothing had changed. Yet the packing, sudden disappearance- Maybe more so, absence was the word. </p><p> </p><p>Regardless, Rio’s anxiety was kicked into overdrive. Something wasn’t right, but Rio couldn’t exactly pinpoint what it was. Not yet, anyway. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled the underwear and sweatpants on, adjusting the waistband as she looked around for her belongings. Agatha must’ve been watching her, making her jump with a small,</p><p> </p><p>“Taking off already?” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>She briefly looked over at her, finding Agatha lifting the suitcase onto the floor. Her eyes locked on Rio the entire time. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, gesturing to Agatha’s bag with a nod. “And you aren’t?”</p><p> </p><p>The woman's words were clipped, every syllable was tight. With every word she spoke, Agatha felt her heart clench and stomach sick. It was clear her packing before Rio woke up was the wrong decision. Something she hadn't even thought about. </p><p> </p><p>Unless, she did think about it..that was Rio’s worry. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, shaking her head. “Rio-”</p><p> </p><p>“When are you back?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio rushed the question, desperate to derail an argument and stop them while they were ahead. Or, was that just her mind going into overdrive? </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Don’t do this.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Fuck, she had a bad habit of this. Wanda had called her out on it her entire life, for the most part. Her overthinking, sudden anxiety always won. She was strong until it came to her own mind. A demon that felt impossible to face. </p><p> </p><p>Once her mind decided something wasn’t right, it was hard to go against that decision. Therapy briefly helped years ago, but she stopped going when the woman she saw retired. Wanda had always been on her about finding a new one. Maybe if she had listened, Rio wouldn’t be going into overdrive. </p><p> </p><p>“Monday” Agatha said, pulling her lips back to bite down on them before asking. “Are you- Is everything okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed with a weak smile, shaking her head in hopes to hide her fear. “Yeah. Why wouldn’t it be?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed the nerves down, second guessing what a few hours ago meant for them. She couldn’t help but hear the pitch in Rio’s tone, how she appeared to be distant even in the same room as her. Not even two hours prior, Rio was in her arms- Safe, secure, tucked in as if she had no plans on going anywhere. And now? </p><p> </p><p>Rio was avoiding looking at Agatha as if the woman was a monster. She was in such a hurry to find her belongings, barely spoke more than a few words. And when she did speak? It felt cold. Rio had hated her before, but not this. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took in a deep breath, grasping onto straws to stop what was going on. </p><p> </p><p>“Is..” Agatha started, but decided to take a shot in the dark for what was wrong. “Listen, I always pack at the last second. I was just trying to be a little bit ahead and Billy is always eager to leave like-”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha”</p><p> </p><p>“You know how he is with plans and roadtrips. There’s a reason we all don’t let that kid go alone!” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nervously laughed at the end. But, it was too late.</p><p> </p><p>Rio held her phone, wallet, and keys. She faked a warm smile which felt worrisome. Agatha felt a terror strike as if this would be the last time Rio stood in front of her. Leaving one question to scream in her mind,</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What is happening?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll see you Monday,” Rio said, leaning over to kiss her cheek. “Text me when you get there, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t have a chance to hold her, never able to verbalize a reply. Rio walked out of her room- No, <em> raced </em>away out the front door, leaving the woman frozen, stunned, confused behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand was in the air. Her cheek cold from the small kiss Rio so graciously left her with. And as the door shut, a sudden darkness fell in the silence with only thoughts that started to scream through her mind. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She regrets last night.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> This was all too soon.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I shouldn’t have been packing, oh my god.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> What did I do? </em>
</p><p>
<em> This is why I never fucking open up like that- Idiot. She loves you? No. Oh my god.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands ran over her face as her heart began to race out of control- threatening to send her into a panic attack. The thoughts were relentless, making her sick with every word. She wasn’t sure what turn they had taken, but maybe (hopefully) there wasn’t one at all. </p><p> </p><p>It was late, Rio realized she had to take care of Nicky. She was tired, cranky- Sometimes Rio wasn’t a morning person. It could simply be that and Agatha was overthinking this entire situation. </p><p> </p><p>However, all it did was bring up the parts of her she worked on tirelessly to silence for so long. Thoughts, hesitations, doubts and worries piled on top of one another- Leaving her fucked seven ways to Sunday (Not in the way she’d prefer either).</p><p> </p><p>She’d spent so much of her life avoiding others, never allowing herself to be loved or feel such an emotion. And just when she was on the surface of doing so? Something went wrong, terribly wrong. Agatha wasn’t sure what to do, but the one old habit started to grip and cling to her like poison-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Run.  </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<em> “Don’t tell me you’re skipping town on her..” Wanda said.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio laughed, packing a bag as her body trembled. At the age of twenty two, she was experiencing heartbreak. The worst she swore would happen to her. A love so strong had broken. A bond that severed felt like the end of her life.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What else am I supposed to do?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I don’t know, wild thought- Talk to her!” Wanda exclaimed. “What is running off even going to do?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I’m not running off-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You booked yourself a last minute gig at a summer camp- A religious one, actually” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “So?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You’re going to a Christian all girls camp to escape your ex-girlfriend for the summer. Does that not sound a little insane to you?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio paused, looking up with her head tilting side to side before a strong- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Nope”   </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She went to continue packing, but Wanda had reached over- ripping the duffle bag to toss it on the floor. The clothes scattered out, but that wasn’t the frustrating part. Wanda made an effort to make a small rip in the opening so Rio would struggle to close it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What the fuck?!” Rio exclaimed. “That bag wasn’t cheap, you know?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda shrugged, slouching back into the couch with arms crossed tight against her chest. She didn’t care if Rio was pissed. She didn’t give a flying fuck if Rio would crash out, scream, call her every insult and name in the book.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You need therapy, Rio”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda said it as if it was nothing. A fact, words she had been saying to Rio for years now. Of course, her friend had been a wall to that fact. Not hearing her at all. Wanda could tell her till she was blue in the face and Rio still would do her own thing.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Not some preaching Jesus camp with bible thumping bonfires and prayers before every meal. Not even that can change or fix this!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “We don’t know that” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What? Are you praying they turn you straight because lemme’ tell you, Rio. Men aren’t any easier than women” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio didn’t look up or respond. Too busy picking up her clothes, assessing the damage Wanda did to her bag.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Is this really what you want for the rest of your life?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “A friend who breaks my bags? No, not really” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda rolled her eyes. “You’re going to regret this one day. A woman is going to come along, you’re going to do this, and regret it”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio huffed, muttering under her breath, “Bullshit” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Yes. What you do is bullshit, honey. Very aware of tha-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What makes you so high and mighty? Huh?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio whipped around, arms thrown out with a glare stronger than her own pain. Deep down, logically, she knew Wanda only had her best interest at heart. But, the timing sucked. How repetitive her advice was becoming. A circle that never ended.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Have you ever considered I don’t need therapy and you’re just fucking putting that on me because you need-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Projecting. That’s called projecting” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh my god!” Rio laughed, tossing the bag as she stormed to find a different one. “I feel like you going to college to be a fucking shrink has turned you into an asshole” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda shook her head, voice wavering as she spoke, “That’s not fair. I’m just trying to help” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Yeah, well- Maybe I don’t need it!” Rio yelled out. “I never asked-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “God forbid I care about my best friend’s happiness” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I never asked-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “One day, Rio” Wanda stood, pointing a finger at her as she collected her belongings. “One day you’ll do this, sit with it, and realize how it’s not worth-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What makes you think I'll ever date again? Maybe I just want to grow old alone”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda stared, not buying her bullshit for a second. It may take years, possibly decades at worst. But Wanda knew Rio wasn't going to be alone.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Someone is out there-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio scoffed, shaking her head with a grin filled with disgust.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “And you need to fix your childish ways now before you're too old to do this”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “And if I don't?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio had turned back around as she asked the question. Arms tossed to the side, voice softening into defeat.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Like I said,” Wanda stood taller with a little shrug. “You'll regret it”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>That memory played in Rio's head as she opened the kitchen door to let Nicky into the yard. Silently apologizing for abandoning him hours before.</p><p> </p><p>No matter how hard she tried to stop the thought, scene, repetition in her mind- It played on repeat. Even if she was in her early twenties when it happened, the words felt fresh. They represented, related to what was going on in the present day. </p><p> </p><p>Therapy followed the memory. Years after that fight, she agreed and had gone to one session. Someone Wanda met during college and who she recommended off the bat when Rio gave in to the advice. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Instead of running- Why not stay?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio remembered sitting on the leather couch. The fabric had a few tears on the arm, clear people had picked at it over time. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Easier said than done, I know” She added. “But..how far can you run until you become too exhausted to exist?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>As she grabbed the cup of kibble, dumping it into Nicky's bowl- Rio silently cursed herself out for thinking about it. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Why can't my brain just shut the fuck up?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The cycle from years ago was repeating itself. Clothes in a dryer, tossing in messy circles over and over. </p><p> </p><p>And she knew..it wasn’t worth it. Not when she went through hating Agatha to professing love on her doorstep. Not after finally allowing herself to be with someone more than just a meaningless way to pass the time or a pathetic attempt at not being alone. </p><p> </p><p>What’s the worst that can happen? </p><p> </p><p><em> Don't answer that </em>. Rio told herself. </p><p> </p><p>But, seriously- <em> What is the worst that can happen?  </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio had been unhappy for years. That feeling wasn't anything new. She was familiar with it, able to survive the loneliness before and would after the saga of Agatha Harkness in her life. </p><p> </p><p><em> Shorter than the fuckin’ Twilight Saga.. </em>Rio snickered in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>She turned the faucet off, bringing the bowl of cold water to place next to the food. Rio brushed her hands off as she stepped to the door. A soft whistle with a little, </p><p> </p><p>“Nicky, come eat bud!” </p><p> </p><p>He flipped around, jumping across the yard with his tail wagging to skid through the threshold. She chuckled, ruffling his hair before slipping by to find her phone. </p><p> </p><p>“Wish I had your energy, dude” Rio said over her shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>She found her phone tossed on the coffee table in the living room. Rio picked it up, silently hoping Agatha had called or texted- But there was nothing. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She's busy packing and Billy probably showed up way too early.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Billy was a sweetheart, but filled with anxiety and Lilia joked he was made of OCD habits. Other professors and staff probably thought the few were too protective of him. But even Rio silently agreed it was best to keep him close. </p><p> </p><p>He grew up in foster homes, bouncing between them his entire life. Rio got the whole story in the break room his second month there. Not that she ever asked, but it was clear he needed to say all of it. </p><p> </p><p>She silently adored as well how Agatha was really the one to take him under her wing. The last trip to see his brother up north he made was alone. Agatha ended up leaving work early to rescue him in the mountains. </p><p> </p><p>His car skidded off the road covered in ice, landing in a ditch. Luckily a tree was there to catch his fall before tumbling down the mountain completely. No one let him travel alone after that incident. At least, Agatha never would. </p><p> </p><p>He was known to be chronically early for everything. Hence why Agatha was most likely packing before Rio woke-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio closed her eyes, rubbing a hand over her face as reality seriously sank into her bones. She overreacted. Of fucking course, she overreacted. Her anxiety won and had gotten the best of her. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> God, I'm an idiot…and maybe I need to go back to therapy.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She forced herself to pull up her messages with Agatha. The last few being stupid selfies they had sent to each other during the day. </p><p> </p><p>One of Agatha sneaking into Rio's classroom, pretending to bite her plant. The next was Rio cleaning it with the caption, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Gross”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>While Agatha replied with smirking emojis and a quick, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You don't say that when my mouth is elsewhere..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>God, she hated how perfect the woman was for her. Cheeky, annoying, sarcastic and beautiful all at the same time. Maybe that didn't help her anxiety though. </p><p> </p><p><em> How can she even want me? </em>Rio wondered. </p><p> </p><p>Regardless, her thumbs moved to type a small message. A quick little goodbye with a small joke in between. How she hoped they had a good trip, Nicky missed her…and maybe she did too. </p><p> </p><p>She hit send and let go of the breath that lived in her chest for far too long. </p><p> </p><p>That had to show Agatha everything was fine, right? Rio tossed her phone back on the coffee table, debating a quick shower- However, she didn't want to rid Agatha's touch completely. But on the same token? Showering was therapy. It'd ease her stress and worries more than sleep would. </p><p> </p><p>Fine. She could cover herself in Agatha once the woman was back home in a few days. Rio figured she had fixed whatever small damage had been done that morning with the text. </p><p> </p><p>Well…so she thought, anyway.</p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was noon when Rio woke up from her nap on the couch. Nicky's head was tucked in her lap, an episode of Shark Tank played on the TV- Someone crying while giving their sob story. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn't even watch for the products. She only watched to make fun of how people cried their eyes out for pity money. </p><p>Another reason she had fallen in love with Agatha was because the woman did the same. </p><p> </p><p>They spent time cuddled on the couch, someone's legs over the other's lap. Both snickering and mocking the people on screen. And as Rio woke up…she realized how lonely the atmosphere was. Barely awake for a minute and that feeling punched her in the gut. </p><p> </p><p>She looked around frantically for her phone, hopeful and anxious to see what Agatha had replied. Usually it didn't take long for the woman to get back to her. At worst, two or three hours if she had lectures and students to help after class. </p><p> </p><p>And so it was safe to say when Rio swiped her phone screen, hopeful her notifications glitched-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Nothing. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her heart sank, stomach twisted into a knot. She slowly put her phone down, tongue swiped on the inside of her cheek. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Okay.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> It's fine.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Billy probably didn't want to drive..or Agatha wasn't letting him. More that than anything.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> So, she's busy. It's fine.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Everything. Is. Fine.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>(It was in fact, not fine) </p><p> </p><p>Rio started to chew the skin off her thumbnail. Her eyes locked to the screen, hopeful the show would take her attention and mind off of Agatha. She should have known that wouldn't work. </p><p> </p><p>Even before all this, Agatha Harkness lived rent free in Rio Vidal's mind. Since their first meeting, since every Christmas party, the first day back from summer vacation. All of it. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Are you really talking about Agatha again?” Wanda asked.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio scoffed, scrunching her nose in disgust as she aggressively shook her head.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I'm saying how irritating she is’  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Natasha snickered. “Irritating to the point you mention her daily-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I do not!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Rio. It's the middle of July and you're bringing her up” Wanda pointed out. “You haven't seen her in weeks”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio huffed, breath puffing out a silent words as she shook her head, eyes flickering between the two. They were filled with amusement, questions, ready to fire back with their own arguments left and right.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She shook her head, denying what should be obvious. “I don't even like her”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Never said anything about liking” Natasha pointed out. “Just how you keep talking about her” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh come on!” Rio laughed. “Do we not shit talk people we can't stand now?!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Not like a broken record and as if she is the only thing you think about” Natasha said.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio glared at her, whipping her head to find Wanda sipping from her iced tea. She shrugged, obviously not taking Rio's side in this.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Unbelievable..” She muttered.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The woman grabbed her belongings in a rough manner. Muttering under her breath insults and words of how she hated them both.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Natasha smirked, Wanda unable to control herself as she called after her- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I expect you to talk about us 24/7 since you hate us, sweetie!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Right?” Natasha laughed.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio shook her head as she stormed out of their backyard, tossing over her shoulder in a childish manner,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I don't like her!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The gate slammed shut, leaving her friends giggling behind.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “She so likes her” Natasha snorted. “When do you think she'll realize it?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda sighed, pulling knees to her chest with a shrug.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “One day..” She looked over at her wife with a sad smile. “If we're lucky”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Natasha hummed. “It is amusing torturing her in the meantime though”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh, without a doubt”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Back then, Rio could now admit she thought about Agatha excessively. Maybe more than she ever bargained for or admitted to. </p><p> </p><p>However, now? Since Agatha used to reside in her home, spend every minute they could together, made her smile and worshipped every inch of her? </p><p> </p><p>God, it was worse than ever. And this silence, the awkward tension from earlier that morning. Rio's anxiety taking over, making her overreact to something so small. She hadn't even let Agatha explain herself before taking off. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sat in silence for an extra twenty minutes. Her mind played Agatha on a loop. Like a broken record, DVD that kept skipping the same scene from hours ago. Typically, she'd continue being alone. Nicky usually made good enough company. </p><p> </p><p>But…this was too much. </p><p> </p><p>She checked her phone again to make sure Agatha still hadn't replied before abruptly getting up with a little apology to Nicky, but not one she really said. He would only be sad for a second because Rio had jumped up to grab his harness and leash. </p><p> </p><p>Instantly when the metal clinked, Nicky's paws ran across the floor. He jumped in the air, tail wagging as he spun in a circle. Even through her terrible thoughts, feeling of doom- Rio couldn't help but smile. </p><p> </p><p>“Wanna’ go see that annoying redhead you adore?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>He whined as she adjusted the harness. A little laugh escaped her over the sound. </p><p> </p><p>“I'm going as fast as I can, dude. Cut a girl some slack, yeah?” </p><p> </p><p>Nicky chased off to the front door the second she clicked his leash on. She felt herself pulled, nearly going face first on the floorboards. That still wouldn't compare to what she felt in that moment with everything else going on. </p><p> </p><p>Rio slipped her slides on, thankful Wanda only lived a walking distance from her. She was not in the mood to drive. A walk always helped her ease her mind somewhat to begin with. </p><p> </p><p>She grabbed her wallet, made sure the phone was in the pocket before opening the front door and muttering, </p><p> </p><p>“We're about to never hear the end of this, buddy” </p><p> </p><p>Rio only barged in on Wanda with no warning when she was a wreck. The last time she did was when Nicky had gone missing. </p><p> </p><p>He had run off down the street, into someone's house and decided to have dinner with them. Luckily once they saw her Facebook post, she was contacted instantly. However, that was one of the only moments she showed up on Wanda's doorstep unannounced. And now that was going to happen because of fucking Agatha? </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh, she's going to be so annoying about this.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Though, Rio knew it was better than spiraling alone. Even if her best friend was about to drive her to the brink of insanity. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Nicky knocked on the door for her. Well, more jumped and skidded his paws against the wood. Wanda had encouraged that in hopes it would, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Mark his existence. Create a memory and add love”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>While Natasha and Rio silently agreed to fix it if he ever left any damage. Sometimes Wanda was far too sentimental. </p><p> </p><p>She heard footsteps come closer to the door. The music blaring was turned down as the door opened, revealing Wanda in her cleaning clothes. Hair tied back, one rubber glove on with the other tossed over her shoulder on top of the damp towel. </p><p> </p><p>At first she was smiling, warmly greeting the stranger at the door. Though as she found Rio in a hoodie, eyes tired and already starting to gloss over- </p><p> </p><p>“Get in here” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda took the leash from Rio, guiding Nicky in first before holding the door open for her to follow. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shoved her hands in her pocket, head down as Nicky ran off to the living room. Mostly likely searching for Natasha who was on a business trip. Wanda would make up for his sadness by giving him treats later on when he realized she wasn't there. </p><p> </p><p>For now, the woman's focus was on Rio who was slugging her way to the kitchen. Her silence spoke volumes, telling Wanda this was definitely Agatha related. </p><p> </p><p>“What happened?” She asked from behind. </p><p> </p><p>Rio puffed out a laugh as she yanked the chair from the table, plopping in it with an exaggerated sigh. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, that sounds lovely!” Wanda chirped with a subtle glare. “Coffee?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. She brought one knee up to her chest, hugging it as she forced herself to check her phone and again-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Nothing.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Wanda gave some grace to her, allowing the silence while making her cup of coffee. Other times, she'd add sugar and creamer- Maybe make up her own stupid, extra flavoring. But, right now? </p><p> </p><p>“K’,” Wanda slid the coffee mug over, dropping in the chair across from her. “Coffee is black as night” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looked over with a little smirk. </p><p> </p><p>“That easy to read?” </p><p> </p><p>Black coffee was Rio's go to when she was sad. She said once it was bitter, something to try and focus disgust on over her own life. Wanda thought it was stupid, but never one to argue someone's coping mechanism. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, you showed up on my door with no warning. You look like shit. Your eye bags are blacker than this coffee. Andddd, you sound like Death” </p><p> </p><p>Rio took a sip from the coffee, nodding a bit with a shrug. </p><p> </p><p>“Right on the money..” She muttered. </p><p> </p><p>“Per usual,” Wanda smiled. “Now. What's going on, sweetie?”</p><p> </p><p>“Honestly” </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed, putting the coffee down to run a hand through her hair. Elbow resting on her knee, looking up at Wanda with a sad smile. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what’s going on”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda narrowed her eyes, asking a low, “What did you do?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed. “Why do you instantly think <em> I </em> did something?” </p><p> </p><p>“Because I know this face, this…demeanor of yours” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda wiggled her fingers up and down. She then pursed her lips, a hum while tapping her finger on her chin. Clearly digging herself in thought, analyzing Rio until she pointed-</p><p> </p><p>“What did you overreact to?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, reconsidering if showing up on Wanda's doorstep was the right idea or not. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, come on-”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm right!” Wanda exclaimed. “You have a certain look to this”</p><p> </p><p>“And what is that?” </p><p> </p><p>“Regret, despair, and upcoming anger with yourself that is due any minute now” </p><p> </p><p>Nicky broke the tension for a second, running in to cut Wanda's interrogation off. She chuckled softly, getting up to the cabinet for his cookies. </p><p> </p><p>“Figure out she's not here, huh?” Wanda asked. </p><p> </p><p>“He's beyond disappointed we have to put up with you” Rio said in a monotone voice. </p><p> </p><p>“Your mother acts like she wasn't the one to show up on my doorstep looking terrible” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda said in a baby voice to Nicky before leaning down to kiss his head, hand him the two cookies for him to run off with. Rio rolled her eyes, but softly smiled as she watched her boy chase off into the living room. Most likely would eat and then play with the toys they kept for him. </p><p> </p><p>She watched Wanda grab a new towel, picking up a plate from the strainer to dry it off before whipping back around. </p><p> </p><p>“Well?” She asked. “This is clearly Agatha related as well-”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you? Some know it all freak?” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda snickered. “No, just cursed to know you since childhood” </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed, taking another sip from her coffee before figuring out where to begin. </p><p> </p><p>“I uh..” She shrugged, looking around as she strung together words in a messy manner, <em> “Imayhavetoldherilovedherthanranoutthismorningonher..”  </em></p><p> </p><p>Wanda paused, holding onto the plate as she broke the words apart to make sense of them. Luckily over the years she learned how to break down Rio's one worded essays, muttered under her breath, barely comprehensive. </p><p> </p><p>Her jaw slightly dropped, nearly dropping the plate as she gasped, </p><p> </p><p>“Shut. Up!” </p><p> </p><p>She rushed over, dropping in her chair without a car as the plate almost broke on the table. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda grinned like a mad woman, leaning close as she gasped in a giddy manner, </p><p> </p><p>“You told her you loved her?! Oh my god, Rio! That's-”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you not catch last part of that?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda waved her hand. “I did and I'll address that in two seconds just-” </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head with a smile, voice softening as she spoke, </p><p> </p><p>“You love someone, Rio. To the point you confessed it! That's…huge! I'm so happy and-”</p><p> </p><p>“I probably just fucked it all up” Rio laughed with a shake of her head. “New world record for that, huh?” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda's smile faded, but still somewhat remained. She didn't think for a second that she and Agatha were over. Not in the slightest. Wanda had called it years ago the two were more than enemies, not even friends. </p><p> </p><p>No matter what happened, Wanda was sure it wouldn't change the outcome. </p><p> </p><p>And also, she had just won twenty bucks from her wife that Rio finally confessed sooner than they took the bet on. It was hard to not keep some kind of smile. </p><p> </p><p>“What happened then? How did you ruin this?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio took in a deep breath, cringing as the memory replayed in her mind again. This time, she'd have to vocalize it. Even in a short summary, it felt hopeless. A pain that grew stronger with worries piling on top of each other. </p><p> </p><p>The image of Agatha's face was clear. How confused and lost she appeared. The way she stuttered over her words. How she frantically searched to explain herself, but Rio had basically shunned her. Only offering a peck on her cheek before running off like Cinderella after midnight. </p><p> </p><p>She closed her eyes, hoping to hide in the darkness of her mind. It didn't work. Especially with Wanda before her. </p><p> </p><p>“Ri-”</p><p> </p><p>“She was packing when I woke up” </p><p> </p><p>“Packing? For what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Going up north with that Billy kid? He wants to see his brother and I've told you about him. No way Agatha would let him go alone” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda nodded. “Soooo, what does that have to do with the packing before you wake up? I don't get-”</p><p> </p><p>“It was like she- I don't know. She gave me clothes” </p><p> </p><p>“And that was a bad thing?” </p><p> </p><p>“At the moment- Well, <em> in </em> that moment, yeah” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda was about to ask why, but heard it in Rio's voice why she viewed it in a negative light. She slowly nodded, leaning back in her chair with arms crossed against her chest. </p><p> </p><p>“You thought she was kicking you out..” </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. </p><p> </p><p>“Which only sent you into panic mode thinking you did something wrong and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I ran out” Rio finished.</p><p> </p><p>The woman sighed, running a hand over her red hair that was frizzed out- Slipping out of the hair tie that loosely held it back. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn't surprised to say the least. Rio had commonly drawn and jumped in the air to conclusions faster than the speed of light. Which always led her to be in positions like so. </p><p> </p><p>“Have you texted her?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. </p><p> </p><p>“And?” </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing” She shrugged, her voice small as she looked at her coffee. “Told you..fucked it up” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda sighed. Her voice sympathetic with eyes softer than a cloud, hoping to ease Rio's worries the best she could. Though that was never an easy task. Xanax sometimes barely touched Rio at all. </p><p> </p><p>“Honey, she's on a trip. I'm sure she's driving or busy” She said, shrugging with a quick- “You know how Natasha is! Sometimes she gets so wrapped up to reply or-”</p><p> </p><p>“That's work though,” Rio said. “This is just a trip north. Few hours out. I won't blame her if she never speaks to me again. I basically fucked and ran” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda nodded, not arguing with her on that. She may try to relax, console, and make her friend feel better. </p><p> </p><p>However, Wanda was never the type of woman who would lie to you. She was blunt, especially with Rio. Still pointed out when the woman was in the wrong even at her worst. </p><p> </p><p>“Like you said though,” Wanda started. “That Billy- He sounds like a lovely boy, but a handful” She smiled. “I'm sure her focus is on surviving that trip with him in one piece” </p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged. Maybe Wanda was right. Agatha did heavily focus on him sometimes when she was worried. And he hadn't traveled that far north since the car accident. He only took small trips, and hadn't left that far in a while. </p><p> </p><p>He was probably rambling nonstop. Agatha probably took over the wheel to avoid him having a panic attack when they got to the mountain he almost fell off of. </p><p> </p><p>“When did you last text her?” </p><p> </p><p>“Earlier like..” Rio picked her phone up, checking her phone to see- “Close to 6ish”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Nearly 6 hours since- Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, hey..” Wanda reached out to take her phone aside. “Breathe”</p><p> </p><p>As if she could read the inner monologue, hear the silent panic attack boiling up within her- Wanda went into action to bring her back down to earth. Hold her there till she could remain grounded on her own. </p><p> </p><p>“Again- Most likely busy. And doesn't he live up towards Lake Placid? Service is so sketchy up there, you know that” </p><p> </p><p>“But-”</p><p> </p><p>“They probably stopped for lunch or rest” Wanda said. “Maybe his brother met them somewhere and they're busy”</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda-”</p><p> </p><p>“There are so many possible answers to this” She said. “Doubtful she's ignoring you. It's clear how obsessed that woman is with you!” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda smiled, not letting Rio try to argue before spilling into her view on Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Natasha and I spoke about her the rest of the night, you know?” She started. “The way she looks at you is <em> insane </em>, Rio. I swear, it was like some freaky protective love drunk look. And she just radiates life beside you. There's-”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you not focus on the way she left though?” </p><p> </p><p>“No because I just won a bet with Natasha you'd be on her doorstep not long after, actually” </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed. “You assholes took <em> bets? </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, one” She held her finger up. “You and Natasha take bets on everything” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda sat up straighter, head held high with a smug grin. </p><p> </p><p>“Two, yes. In fact, I need you to tell her or sign a document this happened because she owes me a twenty and a new purse” </p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “You two are ridiculous”</p><p> </p><p>“And so are you for not seeing how crazy Agatha is about you” Wanda said. “How you two were ever enemies, I'll never know”</p><p> </p><p>“She was an ass to me the second we met!”</p><p> </p><p>“And you've been a miserable asshole to her for years,” Wanda countered. “The only good part is Natasha never won the bet you'd start hate fucking years ago”</p><p> </p><p>“There was another bet?!” Rio exclaimed in disbelief. “How many have you two had? Do you bet on my love life as a pass time for fun or something?!” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda ignored her completely, brushing her off to focus on what really mattered. The main topic they had to talk about, conquer, and get her best friend through this before she destroyed something good completely. </p><p> </p><p>“Try calling her?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, Wanda scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that such a bad idea?”</p><p> </p><p>“She isn’t even answering my texts”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, please. That isn’t even why you won’t do it”</p><p> </p><p>“Wha-”</p><p> </p><p>“Texting has always been easier than using your actual words, having to speak instead of having time to think thoroughly on what to say” Wanda shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head. “Okay- No. If that were the case, I wouldn’t have been at her place last night. This is because she won’t answer me” </p><p> </p><p>“Or you’re worried about bothering her”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back in defeat, hating how Wanda was right (Per fuckin’ usual, but Rio would never admit that outloud). </p><p> </p><p>Soft music from the living room blended with the faint squeaky toy Nicky was chewing on filled in the silence. Rio didn’t look at Wanda. She couldn’t stand to see the face of,</p><p>
<em> You know I’m right.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>And yet even through her frustration- Rio was content on being there. Sitting across from her closest friend, not drowning in her worries alone. Wanda may be annoying when she was right, but she was still such a calming presence. One who confronted you while comforting you at the same time. Sometimes Rio thought about how she was genuinely too pure for the world. </p><p> </p><p>“I think she’s busy more than anything. That’s my vote” Wanda said. “Or..maybe she’s feeling the same as you were this morning”</p><p> </p><p>“Which is my fault for starting it”</p><p> </p><p>“No, not necessarily” She shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda took a sigh, propping her chin on her palm with soft eyes that spoke gentle unspoken words. How everything would be fine and work out for the best. Even if Rio couldn’t see it. </p><p> </p><p>“You two figured out how to not hate each other..” She pointed out. “I think this will be easier than that”</p><p> </p><p>Rio bit on her bottom lip, looking down as her knee started to bounce. She never even had to utter the question aloud for an answer. Wanda just spoke as if she heard the words in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>“And if it isn’t easy? You’ll both find your way through. I know it” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda snickered, kicking her from under the table right after with a quick, “Remember, I was the one years ago who said Agatha might be more”</p><p>“Of a pain in my ass?” Rio looked up. “Yeah, just a bit”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda smiled, thankful Rio was finding her humor somewhat. </p><p> </p><p>“Hate to be the bearer of bad news, sweetie but..sounds like you were the pain in the ass first on this”</p><p> </p><p>“You know, you could just be on my side without the calling out bullshit”</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t ever be your friend if I did that. We both know it”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn't get a chance to reply. Wanda had kicked her again, picking up the towel to lightly snap her arm with before jumping out of her seat. </p><p> </p><p>“Now! Since you came over, it is happy cleaning-”</p><p> </p><p>“No!” Rio groaned like a child. “I came over to be sad! Not clean!” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda spun around to find Rio a towel to help dry dishes off with, singing over her words a loud, </p><p> </p><p>“We will clean, and dance! Then you shall call Agatha and reconfess your sins and love-”</p><p> </p><p>“What sins?!” Rio couldn’t help but subtly smile over the woman’s antics. “If anyone has them it’s <em> you </em>for making your depressed friend fucking clean”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda tossed the towel at her while handing her a few plates right after. She ignored her completely, counting down the list of things that needed to be dusted and vacuumed- giving her the entire schedule of the day ahead. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wanted to be mad, annoyed, walk out in a fit of rage. But all she could do was grab a plate and towel, not offer an argument. Only snarky comments while silently being thankful for the distraction. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe later that night when she was alone again. When the thoughts, worries and regrets all boiled up and over her- She’d call. </p><p> </p><p>What was the worst that could happen? Agatha wouldn’t answer? She wasn’t doing that to begin with. That was the main root of the problem besides Rio regretting how their morning after was spent. </p><p> </p><p>Though before she could ocmpoletely focus in on the hectic cleaning day Wanda had planned- Rio pulled out her phone to send one little message. </p><p> </p><p>“She answer?” Wanda asked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio typed the few words, hoping for a reply to know Agatha was at least safe and not tossed off a mountain. That’d be common courtesy to say that at least, no? </p><p> </p><p>“Uh..” Rio stammered, biting on her lips as she stared at the screen. </p><p> </p><p>For a woman who wasn’t religious, she silently prayed for the typing bubble to appear. However, it didn’t. She locked her phone after a few seconds, dropping it with a shake of her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Give it time” Wanda said. “She stared at you like an addict. Her withdraws will take over soon enough”</p><p>Rio snickered as she dried the second plate, stacking it on top of the other. “Comparing her to a drug addict now?”</p><p> </p><p>“For you?” Wanda laughed. “Like I said, we were very amused with how she looked at you. Wondered if she was going to pin you on the table right then and ther-”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you’re just..wrong. Gross. Bye”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t give me the innocent act!” Wanda exclaimed with a smile. “Listen, you may have been a top with other girls. I know that. But that woman has you whip-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio dropped the plate, looking up with offense as she scoffed, “Are you calling me a bottom right now?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda shrugged. “If the shoe fits-”</p><p> </p><p>“I am not!” She exclaimed, cheeks burning as she shivered over the memory of Agatha. “I- No, I-”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha topping a top,” Wanda snickered. “Makes so much sense. Adorable she has that power over you, really”</p><p> </p><p>“Again, I came here to feel better. Not be accused of such things” </p><p> </p><p>“Mhm,” Wanda hummed. “Dry those plates- Or do you only let Agatha tell you what to do?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head. “I hate it here” She muttered. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda snickered. “I know”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>It was creeping up to midnight when Agatha finally checked her phone. She had been ignoring it since Billy showed up all giddy and excited for their roadtrip. The woman tried telling herself for once she was focusing on the present, living in the moment and enjoying a tiny vacation from her normal. </p><p> </p><p>When in reality…it was Rio. Just. Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha briefly saw the first message when it came through. Her eyes skimmed it before her finger locked the phone in a panic, dropping it into her purse to be forgotten about for the day. Though when they stopped at their final rest area (They had spent the day sight seeing and shopping on their way there) and Billy was taking too long in the bathroom- Curiosity had gotten the best of her.</p><p> </p><p>The first text lifted her heart a bit. It wasn’t long after Rio had bolted out of her room, leaving her alone in a heavy silence. Agatha read those words over and over. Rio missed her. She wouldn’t lie about that..right?</p><p> </p><p>The following three lifted her heart before it smashed to the ground below. Rio clearly had been thinking about her, worried for her safety and wanted updates during the trip. As much as it made her feel warm for a moment, it also somewhat destroyed her at the same time. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had dated women in the past, but for some reason they were never, well…<em> this. </em>Some confessed love, sure. And maybe at the time Agatha thought their definition of love made sense. However, Rio’s weighed heavier, meant something else to her. </p><p> </p><p>Even after a tense morning, Rio was checking in. While even on the best of terms with her exes, none of them ever cared when she left for a couple days. The only messages she ever got was goodbye’s and asking when she’d be back. And here was Rio sending multiple messages almost begging to hear from her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha should love this. She should be relieved and happy to see Rio wasn’t running from her. The woman waited for the feeling to come back. How she adored Rio, wanted to only talk to her and be thankful her packing early didn’t scare her off. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> I don’t deserve her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> This is too much.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> What am I even doing?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I’ll just hurt her in the long run.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The thoughts were aggressive, brutal. Agatha Harkness may come off as someone confident beyond words. An ego that skyrocketed so high out of the universe’s atmosphere. When in reality, she was a product of a mother who hated her. A woman who spent her childhood hiding in closets from kids at school, listening to cruel words and accusations people held against her. </p><p> </p><p>She had worked tirelessly throughout her adult life to either ignore or grow from what she knew. Some days were better than others, but maybe her past relationships felt easier because she didn’t care as much as she thought she did. Maybe it was choosing women who didn’t care. Who only liked her for the sex and good time. </p><p> </p><p>While Rio didn’t see her for just that. No. They started off as enemies, Rio never wanting anything to do with her. If it was just sex, it’d only be that. They’d have zero connection. Rio wouldn’t be smiling up at her like a fool as Agatha rambled about nothing. She wouldn’t be texting her with care for how she was, if they were safe. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha wouldn’t be staring at her phone like someone was holding her at gunpoint. </p><p> </p><p>Slowly she realized how hard she had fallen. Sure, Rio was someone she knew she fell hopelessly for the last few years. She had a stupid little crush. So she thought, anyway. Sometimes Agatha acknowledged how it grew into something more, but always chalked it up to the unknown. Part of her figured once she experienced Rio, it wouldn’t be the same. </p><p><br/>To be fair, she was partially right. This wasn’t the same. Just not in the way she thought. </p><p> </p><p>Everything was intensified. Agatha couldn’t think about the rest of her life without Rio tagging along. She felt overwhelmed experiencing what love was for the first time. Something she thought she knew, but held no knowledge about. And honestly?  </p><p> </p><p>Love terrified the fucking shit out of her. Especially after that morning they had. </p><p> </p><p>When she left Rio’s the day before, it hurt. Sure. The thought Rio didn’t view her the same way sucked. However, it wasn’t the same. She admitted to being loved, allowed someone to say it to her without letting it be a thought that passed through one ear out the other. Agatha put herself in such a vulnerable state only to experience a piece of what it was to be ripped from it. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe Agatha couldn’t handle the risk of hurting that bad. The idea of giving that pain to Rio either? She should stop them while they were ahead, save them both from such horror. </p><p> </p><p>“Ready?” </p><p> </p><p>Billy’s voice snapped her awake from the trance of being stuck in Rio’s texts. She locked her phone, dropped it back in her purse with a nod. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re driving” She pointed while opening the passenger’s side. </p><p> </p><p>He didn’t argue, eager to complete their trip so they could both crash into bed. The sight seeing, shopping, all of it was worth it. Both had forgotten though how exhausting a trip through the mountains could be. Especially when Agatha had to distract Billy from a panic attack when they passed through where his accident was. </p><p> </p><p>As he adjusted the seat and mirrors, starting the car and putting the gear in drive- Agatha took his phone to set up music, not bothering to look at her’s anymore. She couldn’t handle doing so. The thought of Rio texting again or her accidentally sending something back- </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Billy merged out on the highway. One that was busy hours prior now quiet in the dead of night. She turned the radio up just enough to sit in the background. Wicked Game by Chris Isaak. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Course. This shit is in his playlist.  </em>
</p><p>Fine. It was a good song, whatever. But Agatha tried to ignore the lyrics the best she could. How falling in love, this world would only break your heart, <em> ya-deeya-dee-ya-da </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, elbow on the windowsill as she pinched the bridge of her nose. </p><p> </p><p>This kept happening. Songs, videos, shows and movies- <em> Everything </em> reminded her of Rio. It had somewhat prior to them getting together, but accelerated into full drive once they went from enemies to lovers. </p><p> </p><p>The second Rio sat in her passenger seat, Agatha’s world became Rio coded. She couldn’t escape it no matter how hard she tried, far she traveled, any of it. </p><p> </p><p>Though as Billy settled into the middle lane, comfortable with the speed of sixty mph- Agatha always flew at eighty or ninety, but whatever. She wished it was only the music that reminded her of Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“So..” Billy started, fingertips drumming on the steering wheel. “Can I ask you something?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You just did” </p><p> </p><p>He rolled his eyes, ignoring her sarcastic answer. He had become extremely accustomed to them to the point the words barely touched or scared him like they used to. </p><p> </p><p>“You and Professor Vidal..”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh, double no. Fuck to the no. No, no, no, no!  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart dropped, breath stuck in her chest as all her limbs tensed as if poison turned her blood into stone. She didn’t look over, tried to settle the fear in her tone as she replied,</p><p> </p><p>“What about her?” </p><p> </p><p>Billy was blind to the woman beside him. Even if they were in the daylight with the sun blasting rays down on her- He wouldn’t see the sudden discomfort, fear, she wore. </p><p> </p><p>“She called me last night, uh- Demanding for your address, actually” He confessed as if Agatha didn’t know. “Is all alright or..”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No. It isn’t. Or, maybe it is. I don’t know.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Wasn’t torturing herself earlier in the parking lot with these thoughts enough? Did the universe hate her that much to make her revisit this so soon? Especially trapped in a car with a notorious kid who held a record of never knowing when to shut the hell up?</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just,” She sighed, hand up as she closed her eyes. “Mind your business on this one, alright?” </p><p> </p><p>He didn’t respond for a second. Agatha thought for a blissful moment her voice scared him. She was typically rough, sarcastic. But even she couldn’t deny how the soft, quiet, weak and tender voice sounded more frightening. </p><p> </p><p>Of course though, in Billy fashion, he couldn’t shut his mouth for the life of him.</p><p> </p><p>“No, sorry- Agatha. I can’t-”</p><p> </p><p>“You <em> can, </em>you’re just choosing not to” Agatha argued.</p><p> </p><p>“Not after you’ve helped me with everything, no” He laughed with a shake of his head. “You talk to me about anything and I want to do the same! I know, I’m still a kid in your eyes, but-”</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly. Kid in my eyes so shut the hell up about this”</p><p> </p><p>“What is it about her?” He ignored her completely, glancing over before switching his eyes back on the road. “You two have been…different. I-”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s an asshole” Agatha said. “Point blank. Clear as day. No other explanation. </p><p> </p><p>He scoffed. “No. Not true. Yes, she’s..scary, maybe- But..very kind!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, is she?” Agatha snickered. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes” He nodded. “She helps me even when I don’t ask. That stupid copier, for example? It’s like she can sense when I’m about to lose it when it won’t work” He chuckled. “She’s a hero for that thing and so much more” </p><p> </p><p>“Course she is..” Agatha muttered, slouching in her seat more while hiding half of her face. “Is that all? Or do you want to keep preaching about <em> Bitch Vidal?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“No. I want to know what happened with you two” He said. “I don’t- Actually, never have understood the sworn enemies thing between you two. She has the same sense of humor as you-”</p><p> </p><p>“How do you even know she has humor?” She asked as if she didn’t know herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Like I said, she does help me out. She’s scary, but..still cracks some good jokes. Like you! Like uh, teasing and insulty and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Annoying” Agatha ended. “Change of subject and stop looking at me. Keep your eyes on the road”</p><p> </p><p>“What about-”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “William”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Okay hey- No full name basis is needed” He pointed with an eyeroll. “I am just trying to be a good friend”</p><p> </p><p>“Who says I want you to be?”</p><p> </p><p>He scoffed. “You’re on a road trip with me, Agatha. We’re friends. Besties even-”</p><p> </p><p>“Ew, do not use that word” She cringed. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god” He rolled his eyes. “You get so defensive about her”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t talk to you about anything” She argued.</p><p> </p><p>He scoffed. “We just gossiped about Jen and Alice’s relationship, Lilia’s secret affair with God knows who. Every fling and relationship I’ve had down to stories about your mother, but you’re <em> REALLY </em> going to try and tell me we don’t talk?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly. About other things, peopl-”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio is people”</p><p> </p><p>“Oo, look at you. So grown. Using her actual first name!” She teased, dropping back in her seat with a muttered, “Just shut it”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh would you stop avoiding it?!” He laughed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked back out the window, debating jumping out of the moving vehicle all together. Who cared if she died from injuries or the tractor trailer behind them ran her over. It’d save her from this at least. </p><p> </p><p>“Why did she need your address?”</p><p> </p><p>“To leave a bag of flaming shit on my doorstep” Agatha snapped, looking back at him with disgust in her eyes. “She’s a <em> wicked </em> human being” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wicked for making me fall in love, really. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, no” He laughed. “You would have made me throw that out for you and would have called the second it happened” </p><p> </p><p>“I was sparing you for once” </p><p> </p><p>“You aren’t sparing me by leaving me in the dark like this, you know?” He pointed out. “She’s never really talked to me. Didn’t even have my number, I don’t think. What was so important for her to see you, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Relentless little shit.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Whatever. </p><p> </p><p>Fine. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe..she could talk about it. Somewhat, really. Not like she had to go into full blown details of how she had fallen in love for years with a woman who hadn’t even spared her a passing glance until recently. </p><p> </p><p>Well, no- She was always amused catching Rio’s gaze from across the room. It was different now though. No glare, no storming out of the room followed. She stayed put. Instead of running, Rio usually fell into her arms or pulled her closer. </p><p> </p><p>She could shut down the conversation at any given moment. Jump out of the car, threaten his life, etc. Agatha knew too if she gave him a sliver of an answer, he may shut up for awhile until curiosity really took the best of him again. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took in a breath, drumming her fingertips rhythmically on the tip of her thumb. </p><p> </p><p>“We uh,” She stammered, slightly shrugging. “<a href="http://lately...we/" rel="nofollow"> Lately...we </a> hang ou-”</p><p> </p><p>Just as she was about to open up, tell someone else besides the mirror and Rio how she felt. Blue and red lights lit up behind them, a siren echoed on their tail. She jumped up to spin around, finding the cop car catching up to him. Her eyes then flickered to see the sixty mph went up to eighty five. A slow grin crawled on her face, amusement covering her head to toe. </p><p> </p><p>"Oh no.." Billy said. “Oh, no! No! I- I-”</p><p> </p><p>“Just pull over, kid” Agatha snorted. “You’ll be fine. Just a speeding ticket-”</p><p> </p><p>“You speed all the time! I accidentally did so and I get pulled over?!” He yelled. </p><p> </p><p>The car drifted off to the right slowly. Agatha was trying to control her laughter over the situation. </p><p> </p><p>“So much for your bragging of never getting pulled over in your few short years of driving” She mused. </p><p> </p><p>Billy put the car in park as Agatha opened the dashboards for the registration. As entertaining as this was, Agatha knew she’d have to help him get through this. The kid was filled with anxiety over the smallest things. This was probably worse than him nearly dying off a mountain. </p><p> </p><p>“Roll down the window” She said. </p><p> </p><p>“Right, right” He nodded, bones shaking so hard Agatha swore she heard them rattling. “Ag-”</p><p> </p><p>“Honey, you’ll be fine” She softly assured, reaching over to squeeze his shoulder for a little reassurance. “This is fun, but-”</p><p> </p><p>“It is not fun!” He exclaimed. “What if I get arrested?!”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you have a warrant out or a violent history you’ve never told me about?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not that I know of!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha laughed. “I think you’d know-”</p><p> </p><p>“I-”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey there,” The officer appeared. She gave a stern smile, Billy whipped around as he choked on his words. “You know why I pulled you over tonight?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, I- I-”</p><p> </p><p>“You were speeding” Agatha muttered. </p><p> </p><p>“Speeding!” He said. “Yes! Too fast, I’m so sorry. I’ll never do that again. I don’t even like Nascar!” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Nascar? The fuck is he on about? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted, hand covering her mouth to stifle her laugh as she reached for her phone. Just as she swiped the screen, her messages with Rio appeared. The place her instinct was telling her to go. Right then, it hit her like a gunshot straight through her. A violent punch that broke her heart. </p><p> </p><p>She wanted to text Rio, tell her the situation and how he just spewed Nascar for some reason. But, her fear of falling in love, allowing herself to be hurt took over. She dropped her phone back in the purse, looking over to find Billy nearly losing his wallet. </p><p> </p><p>“Can I just take out his license and mine for you?” Agatha leaned over. </p><p> </p><p>The officer chuckled with a nod. “If he’s okay with that, sure. My first time being pulled over made me a wreck as well”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickered, slapping his chest with the back of her hand before taking his wallet. “He isn’t sure if he has a criminal history so..you may want to check that”</p><p> </p><p>“Wha- NO! No, she’s kidding, I-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha handed her their ID’s, sitting back as the officer told them to hang tight. They sat in silence for a few seconds before Billy broke. </p><p> </p><p>“..I’m not forgetting you just told me you’re hanging out with Professor Vidal. Even if I might go to jail now”</p><p> </p><p>If it wasn’t for the last comment, Agatha would have gotten out of the car and asked the officer for a ride to get away from him. However, she just rolled her eyes, shaking her head. </p><p> </p><p>“You continue to say her name and I will make sure you’re arrested. How’s that?”</p><p> </p><p>He gasped, eyes wide with his jaw dropped. “Not even funny, Agatha”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, actually all of this right now is funny” She smiled. “This is the best road trip of my life”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to kill you”</p><p> </p><p>“...Officer!” Agatha turned as she raised her voice. “He threatened-”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” He jumped over to cover her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>The two started to shove each other, half wrestling the best they could while buckled in their seats. Agatha tried to not laugh, but..it was hard not to. Even if the thought of talking about Rio was daunting, she hated how it still felt nice that someone else had a little smidge of knowledge about them. </p><p><br/>And plus, Billy being pulled over for the first time? That was worth the conversation that barely lasted five minutes. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to get to the bottom of this” He warned. </p><p> </p><p>“Not when you’re rotting in a jail cell. Oh! Maybe you’ll find a boyfriend if you drop the soap-”</p><p> </p><p>“That isn’t funny!”</p><p> </p><p>She fell into a fit of laughter, distracted by bullying and teasing him completely. Only later on when they got to his brother’s would she look at her phone to find three missed calls on top of the prior texts.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe then…Agatha would allow herself to reply. </p><p>

<em>"Now I wish we never met<br/>'Cause you're too hard to forget<br/>While I'm cleaning up your mess<br/>Know she's taking off your dress<br/></em>
</p>
<p>
<em>I know that you don't<br/>But if I ask you if you love me<br/>I hope you li-li-li-lie<br/>Lie to me"</em>
</p>
</blockquote><hr/><p>Agatha gasped as the cold water splashed her face, freezing her skin for a few short seconds. She held the sink, listened as the water flowed, admired the sun’s glow on the white marble before her. And for those few moments, barely enough to last a full minute…she didn’t think about her. </p><p> </p><p>Then like a punch, reality reminded her she wasn’t safe from her thoughts..</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her hand aggressively jerked the water off, snatching the towel to cover her face. She wished the fabric could dry off and wipe away Rio Vidal. Wash her completely, get rid of the woman who drove her mad. </p><p> </p><p>If it were that easy, Agatha would have invested in all the towels in the world years ago. </p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly (typically traveling took a major toll on her) Agatha hadn't slept. She may have gotten an hour or two, but definitely not enough to be a functional human being. Which didn't work out in her favor. </p><p> </p><p>By the following morning, Billy was giddy to meet his brother at the diner for brunch. The start of an amazing trip for him. The start of way too much socializing for Agatha's liking. </p><p> </p><p>Billy better count his blessings Agatha had a soft spot for him. Even if she wasn’t struggling with what she left at home, socializing was still her worst nightmare.  </p><p> </p><p>She had Billy take off to the diner without her that morning. It was only two blocks away from the apartment they were staying at. Tommy had a few roommates, leaving it too crowded for them to crash there. Agatha would have argued for their own place regardless. Airbnb was a blessing for introverts like herself. </p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Agatha crawled out of bed and forced herself to take a quick shower. She hadn't dared to look at her phone. Not until she had to. Agatha wasn't sure if she could stomach seeing Rio's texts again. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> I'm horrible.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> An asshole.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Why can't I just reply?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She was a fucking adult for crying outloud too busy hiding like some immature teenager. Hell, Billy would have probably handled the situation better. And yet, Agatha couldn't get herself to fix it. She struggled with facing her fears, sinking into who she worked so hard to stray away from. </p><p> </p><p>Old habits die hard, the saying goes. And Agatha hated that she was the definition of that. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Agatha was forced to look at her phone. Not only to let Billy know she wasn't dead and was still on her way. But also? </p><p> </p><p>Agatha canceled her classes for Monday and Tuesday. </p><p> </p><p>The two would be back by Monday morning, but Agatha couldn't imagine walking in the building. She briefly debated quitting her job completely, but that wasn't possible. </p><p> </p><p>And she had to be a mature adult somewhat, after all…right? </p><p> </p><p>Ultimately, Agatha forced herself to stay away from Rio's messages. She had muted her, deleted their chat before ever opening it. Her thumb swiped away the notifications of missed calls and two voicemails. </p><p> </p><p>She couldn't do it. </p><p>She couldn't face her. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Such a coward.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a deep breath when she approached the front doors of the diner. A mini rundown building that had definitely seen better days. Sooner she went in, the sooner this would all be over and the next few days would go by quick..was that a good thing though? Agatha didn’t want to know. </p><p> </p><p>Billy had told her they were in the back. A bigger table to fit Tommy’s and Billy’s old, new, friends. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fucking yay.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Hanging out with twenty something year olds was not in Agatha’s mind. Originally, this was only supposed to be a trip to see his brother. And now? </p><p> </p><p>“Sure! Get the whole gang together, why not?” Agatha muttered to herself as she spotted the table. </p><p> </p><p>Billy spotted her instantly, jumping up with a bright smile. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” </p><p> </p><p>He rushed over, gesturing to her with way too much excitement (Shocking, truly). </p><p> </p><p>“Everyone,” He smiled. “I’d like you to meet a very important role model in my life”</p><p> </p><p>Deep down beneath everything else going on in her mind, Agatha’s heart did melt a bit. He was sweet. She loved being seen as a guidance, some kind of teacher to him. For a woman who grew up being told to shut up and ignored constantly, it was a surprise. A nice one too. </p><p> </p><p>Tommy grinned. “So you're the legend in my brother's stories?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Legend? More like his worst nightmare” </p><p> </p><p>The rest chuckled in response. Billy gestured down the table to the open seat right next to-</p><p> </p><p>“You’re next to my cousin,” He said, leading the way to pull the chair out for her. “Kate, this is Agatha. Agatha, Kate!”</p><p> </p><p>Kate was not in her twenties. Not by a long shot. Agatha roughly would estimate she was exactly her age or a year, maybe two, younger- Possibly older. </p><p> </p><p>The woman Billy was gesturing to looked kind, soft. She was bringing the mimosa up to her lips when their eyes met. The blonde hair made the blue eyes pop in the warm sunlight shining through. She lowered the drink, wiping off her lips with a tiny wave. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha side glanced at Billy who looked nervous, fiddling with his fingers and chewing on his bottom lip and- <em> Shit. </em>Agatha clicked it without a second to waste.</p><p> </p><p>He’d briefly talked about trying to set Agatha up on a date. She shut him down left and right. Especially lately with Rio being the only woman she ever wanted. And now? </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio can't find out about this.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She forced a smile. One that made Billy step back and see through the facade. His lips parted to speak, but his brother called him back over and he took the chance to flee. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, sitting in the vacant space next to her.</p><p> </p><p>Kate snickered. “We’ve been set up..haven’t we?”</p><p> </p><p>She scoffed in reply, shaking her head while sending subtle daggers down the table. </p><p> </p><p>“Bunch of twenty something fuckin’ year olds. You surprised? I’m not” </p><p> </p><p>The woman chuckled, raising her glass in the air with a small, </p><p>“To being conned” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, looking around for the waiter to order a drink. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s good you joined him though. We appreciate it” Kate said. “My cousin can..well-”</p><p> </p><p>“Be a dumbass?” </p><p> </p><p>“In a kind way” Kate said. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked. “We did get pulled over on the way here. Has he confessed to that yet?” </p><p> </p><p>Kate shot up in her chair, eyes wide with a strong laugh that made the other’s heads turn. Her jaw dropped, leaning closer to Agatha as she whispered,</p><p> </p><p>“Was he driv-”</p><p> </p><p>“Yep,” Agatha popped the ‘p’ with a slow nod, eyes closed as she listened to Kate break down laughing. “Poor kid nearly shit himself right there”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god” Kate laughed, wiping tears as she leaned back to catch her breath. “Oh..I’m so giving him shit for that later. He got a ticket too?”</p><p> </p><p>“The whole package” </p><p> </p><p>“This is beautiful. Suddenly agreeing to be here isn’t so bad” She snickered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t reply for a moment. The laughter faded, making light of Billy’s first time being pulled over was done. And of course, Rio jumped and took over her mind, heart all over again. </p><p> </p><p>“Can’t agree?” Kate asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked back over, taking a second before puffing out a small laugh. </p><p> </p><p>“Not really, no”</p><p> </p><p>“Wanna’ talk about it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed, but Kate didn’t let her reply. </p><p> </p><p>“We will most likely never see each other again. I’m not looking to date, clearly you have another woman on your mind and-”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha’s voice cracked, clearing her throat with a forced chuckle. “Why would I have a woman on my mind? Huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because we are both grown women who know the look of heartache. It doesn’t look good on you. Your eyes are dark and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Wow” Agatha scoffed. “You have some fucking nerve” She muttered. </p><p> </p><p>Kate shrugged, sipping from the drink before replying. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re the only woman my age here. Give me something. If I hear about some TikTok trend again or what’s going on Twitter- I’m going to lose my fucking mind” </p><p> </p><p>She smirked, a little laugh with a nod. “Yeah, I never understand when Billy goes on about that. None of us at work do, to be fair” </p><p> </p><p>“Exactly” She nodded. “So..talk-”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I-”</p><p> </p><p>“Girlfriend? Boyfrie-”</p><p> </p><p>“Ew, no”</p><p> </p><p>“But you didn’t cringe at the first one, so! This <em> is </em>a girlfriend”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took in a deep breath, wondering softly to herself if Rio was still her girlfriend. What would she be going back to if she never replied to her? Was she running out of time? Agatha didn’t want to think about it. Even if it was <em> all </em>she could think about. </p><p> </p><p>“Why did Billy set you up if-”</p><p> </p><p>“Complicated”</p><p> </p><p>“Hidden? Closeted? Sworn enemies or-”</p><p> </p><p>“You ask a lot of fucking questions, Kate” Agatha scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>“You are not fun, Agatha” She snickered. “Okay- If it makes you feel better..” She held the nearly empty glass up. “This is my third..maybe fourth one”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “You’ve only been here for like an hour or two”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. My cousins and all their little friends. Again, give me something here” She said. “Don’t make a woman beg”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated what that did to her. The memory screamed, ran through, shook her mind of Rio begging for her. Not just to cum, but even at her apartment door. The love confession wasn’t a beg, but a plea to hear her. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> And I’m losing her.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Plea-”</p><p> </p><p>“Will it make you shut the fuck up?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll even buy you as many mimosas as you’d like! They’re wonderful here”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “I can tell..” </p><p> </p><p>She took in a deep breath, thankful for the waiter coming over and Kate ordering her a drink. It’d definitely make discussing the topic of Rio easier. Thinking about her as well wouldn’t hurt so much. </p><p> </p><p>“Why are you hidden?” </p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“Like,” She swallowed down the rest of her drink with a wave of her hand, gesturing for Agatha to wait. “Why doesn’t my cousin know you have a girlfriend?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Do I have one? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Complicated”</p><p> </p><p>“Aren’t all relationships that?” </p><p> </p><p>The waiter placed the mimosa down before her. Agatha almost snatched it out of his hand with how quick she moved for it. </p><p> </p><p>She downed the sweet liquid almost all in one go. Her eyes shut, lips pulled back to lick the remaining taste off. </p><p> </p><p>“Drink in hand, mimosa working it’s magic-”</p><p> </p><p>“Not yet”</p><p> </p><p>“Still!” Kate laughed. “Talk” </p><p> </p><p>“God..” She muttered, shaking her head. “Really uh..it doesn’t matter” </p><p> </p><p>It did matter, that was the problem. Agatha knew she was doomed even deeper when there was an urge kicking her to talk. </p><p> </p><p>To a stranger, nonetheless. </p><p> </p><p>For a woman who never opened up, barely showed a crack in her armor- Rio had done damage. She was breaking her not only for herself, but for the rest of the world to see. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was crumbling, falling apart, and it was all Rio Vidal's fault. </p><p> </p><p>“I can see it in your eyes..” Kate sang. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Fucking creep-”</p><p> </p><p>“Why aren't you answering her?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took in a deep breath, keeping her head down as the question circled like a pack of crows in her mind. All she had to do was answer. That was it. Logically it was becoming more obvious Rio wanted to fix things (So Agatha hoped, anyway). </p><p> </p><p>And yet-</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha..” Kate said. “This isn't fair to do this to her and I don't even know the poor girl”</p><p> </p><p>“She's the one that left like that. You have no idea what you’re on about and like I said- Have quite a bit of fucking nerve trying”</p><p> </p><p>“See, this is why you need to talk” Kate chuckled. “I don't even know how she left and you're quick to be so defensive on it!” </p><p> </p><p>“Because..” Agatha shrugged. “It's..complicated” </p><p> </p><p>“Is it?” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> No.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Yes.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Maybe?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was complicated. That was more the truth than anything else. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you not want to fix things?” </p><p> </p><p>“How do you know there's anything able to be fixed?” </p><p> </p><p>“Because if there wasn't..you wouldn't be so shut down, defensive, and clearly stuck in thought over her” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat back, avoiding eye contact with the woman who was nailing her with ease. Not the way Agatha liked her women nailing her either. </p><p> </p><p>Well…no more women, just a <em> woman. </em> </p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t used to a woman, another person, putting up such a battle. Agatha usually scared them off, but she couldn’t even find the strength to create witty insults or toss a drink in the woman’s face. </p><p> </p><p>This was all Rio’s fault. <em> Wait, would that work? </em></p><p> </p><p>Maybe Agatha could find anger and blame easier with Rio than anything else. Rio wasn’t good for her, right? She was turning Agatha into something she wasn’t. </p><p> </p><p>Her entire life was built to be a confident, independent, strong woman. Someone who didn’t let another take her down. She swore to herself after growing up with her mother, no one would make her that vulnerable ever again and-</p><p> </p><p>“You’re scared” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze, her body tense as she repeated the words in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>Did she wear the emotion on her sleeve now? Was it not something she could hide any longer? </p><p> </p><p>“I-”</p><p> </p><p>“You know what..” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed, pulling out cash to put on the table. She didn’t know how much the drink cost, but it didn’t matter to her. A twenty would surely cover her small part of the bill. And when Billy asked why she left, a migraine would be her reply. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna’ head back. It was lovely meeting you, Kate”</p><p> </p><p>The woman sighed, shaking her head. “Honey, I didn’t mean to-”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t call me that” She pointed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded to Billy who read her eyes. He gave a sympathetic smile with a nod of his own, mouthing the words, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “It’s okay”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The woman collected her belongings, saying soft goodbyes and promised to see them all later on. She knew Billy had her back. That was one thing she adored about that kid. He was supportive, protective, and looked out for her in his own way. </p><p> </p><p>She stepped out onto the sidewalk, taking in a deep breath while looking around at the people walking by. Just when she thought her life couldn’t get any worse?</p><p> </p><p>Every brunette was Rio. </p><p>Every shade of green was Rio. </p><p>Every tree, every plant in her sight-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Everything in her life now was Rio.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She was miles away and had hoped this trip would temporarily make her forget, but that was impossible. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t slip into her old ways. She was changed for the rest of her life. Rio was screaming in her mind, heart, every piece of her. While Agatha had been crushing on her for a few years now, it was never this. </p><p> </p><p>The woman placed a hand over her heart, the other firmly gripping her hip as if that’d keep her on the ground. Heavy breaths, chaotic mind, and a destructive decision joined the mix. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled her phone out, fingers trembling as she found the voicemail app. The most recent two belonged to Rio. She had been deadset on never listening, but like an addict who couldn’t stand the withdrawal- </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She hit play.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The woman brought the phone up to her ear, forcing herself to walk down towards the Airbnb. She knew after listening, hiding under the covers or maybe drowning herself would be the only options available. </p><p> </p><p>There was a breath on the phone, maybe a soft cry? Agatha couldn’t tell. It didn’t last long before a small, </p><p> </p><p>“Hey..” Rio whispered, clearing her throat right after. “I uh- God, I’m a psycho. I don’t even know how many times I’ve texted you by now”</p><p> </p><p>She laughed, but it wasn’t one that was filled with humor. The sound was pathetic, wet with tears and soft sobs that were being suffocated to make it through the call.  </p><p> </p><p>“If you get a restraining order, I’d understand but uh..” She said. “I hate how we left that- How <em> I </em>left that. You..well- No. Sorry, fuck”</p><p> </p><p>Rio fumbled with the phone, Agatha could nearly envision how that looked. She was probably adorable even while looking like a trainwreck. </p><p> </p><p>“Just..sorry” </p><p> </p><p>The voicemail ended and Agatha was shivering like the air had turned into a blizzard temperature. She looked around, disorientated but coherent enough to know the area. A few more minutes, she’d be hiding in the apartment from the world. </p><p> </p><p>And yet? She couldn’t hold off to press play on the second one. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay!” Rio laughed. “This time- I got it. Yep!” </p><p> </p><p><em> Is she..drunk? </em>Agatha couldn’t blame her if she was. </p><p> </p><p>“We fucked up” She said. “It takes two to tango and I walked out and <em> YOUUU </em> are being an asshole by ignoring me!” </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Okay. She’s not wrong there.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“So! That being said,” Rio took a moment. Agatha could hear the clink of the beer bottle in the background. “We have a few options. Fuck through it, ignore this ever happened, or I track you down and hold you hostage till you’re mine again!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t hold back the hint of a smile on her face. She imagined in front of her how Rio’s drunken body swayed side to side. How her lips were pursed in a pouting smile. The little look she gave Agatha when the liquor was too much and all she wanted to do was snuggle in her side. </p><p> </p><p>“So uh..choose!” Rio demanded. “No matter the choice- I love you, you love me and I could start singing fucking Barney right now- My little cousin lived on that shit, Agatha. Ugh. You would have lost your mind and…uh…fuck, that’s-”</p><p> </p><p>The woman snickered softly to herself as she listened. Rio was always so chaotic. Sometimes even sober her rambles were scattered into multiple different topics across the board. Drunk Rio only accelerated that. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m literally talking about a show, fake purple ass dinosaur for toddlers…but I love dinosaurs…have I told you that? No! No, shit. I hid my boxers with that print because you’d laugh and..” </p><p> </p><p><em> I love her. Oh my god. </em>Agatha repeated to herself. </p><p> </p><p>She loved how stupid the woman was. How she overthought things like a maniac to the point she hid a pair of boxers. The way she came off to others as a mature, serious, boring adult in her career and home life. Only to be a humorous, sweet, kind soul that adored things no one would guess.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew she loved her Lego sets. Some sat on the wall of her office. Rio tried to brush it off saying it was a gift, but Agatha saw the stacked untouched boxes in the closet. </p><p> </p><p>Rio watched cartoons every Saturday morning, telling Agatha that Nicky adored them and that’s why she put them on. </p><p> </p><p>She also loved stupid Dad jokes, Spiderman movies, everything no one would guess and-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Does she really think that’s all stupid?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha never made fun of her for any of it. She enjoyed the same things, even wanted them to have a date where they just colored and watched movies. </p><p> </p><p>Did Rio not realize it was a reason Agatha fell in love so hard? She learned an entirely different side of Rio than Professor Vidal ever showed. </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe this is why you’re ignoring me..” Rio whispered. “I ran off..immature as fuck, I guess and..” She sniffled, taking a breath before adding, “Do you regret me, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>“Never” Agatha whispered as if Rio was on the other line and not just a voicemail. </p><p> </p><p>“I regret walking out- Running, really..the way I did, but..” Rio sighed. “I miss you. Do you miss me? Fuck. What am I doing? Okay uh..I’m gonna..”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit on her cheek, almost hard enough to draw blood from it. She waited for the end, wondering what Rio had to say, but then..</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Silence.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She looked at the screen, seeing the voicemail ended and was ready to replay if she wanted it to. Agatha stopped walking, not caring if it was in the middle of the busy sidewalk. Her heart was on the pavement beneath her feet. She was stuck, unable to figure out what was next. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Call her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t that simple- <em> It is.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha was changed for the rest of her life. Never again would she be able to hide her emotions, focus on other women, act as if she didn’t have a heartbreak destroying her from within. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately though? It wasn’t that easy to face who she now was. Reaching out to Rio felt too soon, not enough time to accept the love she had was taking over her entire life. While some would argue if the love was strong enough, Agatha could face everything head on and be blind to all else. </p><p> </p><p>But..Agatha Harkness was still not people. She never would be. The woman created the definition of complicated, difficult, all of the above. </p><p> </p><p>She’d find Rio. </p><p>She’d apologize profusely, make it up to her, buy her all the dinosaur boxers and everything she ever wanted. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha already started to rehearse what she’d say when she saw her. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You’re stupid for thinking those things would make me love you less” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I’m stupid for never replying and taking this long”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You’ll never understand what you’ve done to me” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I’m in pieces for you” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I’ll spend eternity doing anything you want” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She just needed some extra time. Just a few more days. Some time to process, accept, figure out how she would function not being who she once was. </p><p> </p><p>The only thing Agatha wasn’t thinking about? Selfishly the woman wasn’t considering what Rio was going through. </p><p> </p><p>She was so stuck in her mind, terrible worry over how to cope with losing her armor. The wall she had stacked so high only to be blown to pieces, dismantled to bits within a short amount of time. There was no thought to how Rio could possibly not want to repair them if Agatha kept ignoring her. </p><p> </p><p>Maybe part of that as well was Agatha not wanting to face she was hurting Rio by doing this. She was changed, but still had parts of herself ruled by an egocentric mind. One she’d have to also let go of moving forward if she wanted to be loved. </p><p> </p><p>In her mind, things could be fixed. Agatha Harkness always got what she wanted through demands, power and striking fear through others. </p><p> </p><p>However, love was new territory. Especially one that was ripping her apart, turning her into someone she had never been. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had a lot to learn, so much to accept and change about herself. </p><p> </p><p>And yet? <em> She’s worth it. She’s so fucking worth it.  </em></p><p> </p><hr/><p>Agatha was camped out on the couch later that night. A fleece blanket covering her, one of Rio’s hoodies snug against her arms and chest. The hood draped over her head, partially hiding her face from the rest of the world. Well, mainly an empty apartment until the front door opened and shut close to eleven that night. </p><p> </p><p>Billy hummed as he walked through the dining room, glancing to where the TV in the living room played, finding Agatha hidden in her own cave. </p><p> </p><p>He gave a sad smile, rummaging through the bag to find the container of leftover fries. It was something he always did. Especially when he noticed Agatha was having a bad day in particular. Leftovers always worked to bring the woman to life somewhat. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey, cold fries or reheated?” He asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha jumped, peaking over from under the hoodie to see him holding the container in the air. Without a word, she held her hand up. Billy brought it over, dropping on the couch beside her with a sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“How you feeling?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunted, shrugging the blanket off her shoulders to open the container up. She tossed a fry in her mouth, holding the next one up for him to take. </p><p> </p><p>They shared the fries in silence, watching the TV that played a crime documentary. Billy waited for a moment before asking, </p><p> </p><p>“Love triangle case?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wife and new guy killed ex husband”</p><p> </p><p>“Classic..” He muttered. “Why can’t people just get divorced?” </p><p> </p><p>“Why are people ever in love anyway?” </p><p> </p><p>The question wasn’t abnormal. Agatha always made fun of the idiots ruining their lives over someone. However, Billy noted the tone in her voice was different. Kate made a comment as well how Agatha screamed lesbian drama all over her. Billy didn’t say anything to them about her. Only a simple, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “She gets wicked migraines. Bad timing”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>All while knowing physically, Agatha was fine. Kate was right. This weighed heavier than that. Also Billy didn’t magically forget what Agatha said in the car, how she acted when the subject of Rio came up. </p><p> </p><p>“That uh,” He scratched the back of his neck, adjusting in his spot with a shrug. “Sounds personal..”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was picking up a french fry as he spoke. She froze mid air, not turning her head or offering a verbal response. After a few seconds she continued on eating. Obviously ignoring the words he just spoke. </p><p> </p><p>He rolled his eyes, arms crossed tight against his chest. Billy almost caved, gave up and didn’t push Agatha to talk. This time though? </p><p> </p><p>
<em> No.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha” He started, voice trembling a bit with fear. “I think I deserve something-”</p><p> </p><p>“Deserve?” She snorted. “You fucking <em> deserve?” </em> <br/><br/></p><p>“Yes!” He exclaimed. “I brought you back food, I’m covering for you so you can stay here when you’re <em> obviously </em>not sick and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Billy..” </p><p> </p><p>“And I’m also worried about you!” He finished, taking deep breaths while shaking his head. “You treat me like this little kid who can’t handle anything..most of the time, anyway, but!”</p><p> </p><p>Billy sat forward, looking over to see Agatha slouching into the hoodie more. She mindlessly nibbled on the end of her fry, trying to focus on the TV and avoid his glare burning through her. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ve never seen you like this”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m coming down with a cold” She lied. </p><p> </p><p>“No, I’ve seen you sick before” He pointed out. “We had Covid together once. Remember? You got it from me? And that stomach virus too and-” </p><p> </p><p>“Jesus, amazing memories” Agatha scoffed. “A trip down memory lane of how many times we’ve been sick. What an amazing topic”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure you’d find that better than telling me the truth”</p><p> </p><p>“I am”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not though, Agatha” He argued. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha muttered a few curse words under her breath. She shook her head, making sure her words were coherent to ask,</p><p> </p><p>“Is it a family trait for you to be so annoying?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy smirked. “You mean <em> caring?”  </em></p><p> </p><p>“Ew,” Agatha scrunched her nose in cringe. “No, <em> annoying. </em>Interrogating, sticking your nose in shit where it doesn’t belong and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Is this Rio related?” He asked. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Fuck.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Shit. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Oh, and also? Fuck! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tossed the fry in the container. She didn’t let the lid seal shut, instead dropping it on the coffee table with a theatrical sigh. Billy rolled his eyes over her antics, per usual. Well, he often hid the eyeroll. But as he aged, learned Agatha did in fact have a soft spot for him- He felt more confident to let his own attitude slip. </p><p> </p><p>“Exactly”</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly <em> nothing, </em>idiot” She muttered, crossing her arms like a child pouting for not getting what they wanted. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right,” He nodded, clicking his tongue with another roll of his eyes. “That’s why you’re pouting right now”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snapped over a glare, finally meeting the glare he wore himself. She saw the look of concern, disbelief for the act she was trying (miserably failing) to get past him. Billy meant well, she knew that. </p><p> </p><p>But after stupid Kate?</p><p>After realizing she’d never be able to live a life without loving Rio, ignoring her own feelings, ever again?</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not in the mood for your shit” She hissed. </p><p> </p><p>“And I’m not in the mood to cover for your ass all weekend, but here we are” He shrugged. “It’s only fair-”</p><p> </p><p>“Life isn’t fair, twat”</p><p> </p><p>“Dick would make more sense for me, but whatever. That’s not the point here” </p><p> </p><p>God, she made him a version of herself. The more time passed on, he developed a witty attitude of his own. Most of the time, Agatha was proud of him. Though when it was aimed her way?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Go to hell”</p><p> </p><p>“Seems I’m already there” He shrugged. “Just as a visitor”</p><p> </p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“That you’re residing in Hell and I’m just visiting to either A, check in or B, get you out of it”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked back at the TV, slouching even deeper into the couch with her lips sealed tight. Maybe if she ignored him he’d go away. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> You know him better than that.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha-”</p><p> </p><p>“William, I swear to God”</p><p> </p><p>“Oooh, full name? Now I’m in trouble, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed. “I miss when you’d nearly pee your pants when I’d say your name like that”</p><p> </p><p>“You tell me constantly to- And I quote, <em> ‘Man up, weakling’ </em>so..”</p><p> </p><p>Of course, her words turned to bite her in the ass. Why should she even be surprised?</p><p> </p><p>“So again, I will ask-”</p><p> </p><p>“Think about if you value your life before doing so”</p><p> </p><p>“Is-”</p><p> </p><p>“William”</p><p> </p><p>“This-”</p><p> </p><p>“Do not make me kill you”</p><p> </p><p>“Related to-”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t. You. Finish. That. Ques-”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, rubbing her hand over her face. Her palm muffled the words, </p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to kill you”</p><p> </p><p>“Who would bring you coffee then?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“And lunch?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“And put up with you being an asshole-”</p><p> </p><p>“Ri-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost said it. She cleared her throat, coughing excessively to try and disguise the word. Billy (Unfortunately for her) caught it with glee. </p><p> </p><p>“Knew it!” He jumped in his spot, clapping his hands. “I knew it! This is lesbian coded all across the board and-”</p><p> </p><p>“You know absolutely nothing, idiot. You're clueless beyond repair. Delusional, actually”</p><p> </p><p>“You said Ri-”</p><p> </p><p>“You need a hearing test” </p><p> </p><p>“And you need to lie better” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “I lie perfectly, actually” </p><p> </p><p>“Not since the Rio situation..” </p><p> </p><p><em> Great. Another thing that bitch ruined about me. </em>Agatha thought to herself. </p><p> </p><p>She had always been a great liar. A con artist who manipulated anyone she pleased. Yet Rio…<em> shit. </em> Once again, Agatha lost another piece to what made Agatha, <em> her.</em></p><p> </p><p>Now she was even more a ghost of the old Agatha Harkness. The woman she dreamt of being was left in the rearview mirror. The more time went on, the farther the car drove and her old self grew smaller in the </p><p> </p><p>“No. There's no <em> situation </em>” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to lie (And failed, again). </p><p> </p><p>“She- We hate each other. Always have, always will and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so enemies to lovers?” He smiled. “I love those stories. Actually, it was my top trope for all I read last year and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Kid,” She sighed. “It isn’t that”</p><p> </p><p>“I know it when I see it” He said. “Even if you won’t tell me..” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat. <em> Enemies to lovers. </em> It sounded beautiful to her. Everything she ever dreamed had come to profusion and…</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I lost it.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Not yet, no. She was still willing to put up a fight…just, well…<em> delayed.  </em></p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I don’t know what it is with you two” </p><p> </p><p>He started, clearly debating his next words. No longer arguing or quickly shooting his own sarcastic replies. </p><p> </p><p>“But I think you two should sort this out. You’re..I’ve always thought you two would make sense together. Honestly” </p><p> </p><p>She pulled her lips back, picking at the skin off her thumb harder. Agatha always had a bad habit of doing so. She'd pick them till they bled, left scars and hangnails. </p><p> </p><p>“And if you ever want to talk? My lips are sealed. I wouldn’t utter a word on it” </p><p> </p><p>She knew he wouldn't. The kid could ramble on about some things in life, but when it came down to it? Something personal, serious such as Rio? </p><p> </p><p>Billy muttered about how he wanted to go to bed. He stood, stretching his back while almost on the verge of whispering his good night. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha without a doubt was frustrated and annoyed with him. The entire Rio situation in itself didn't help. However, she had to let him know one thing.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, kid” Agatha said. </p><p> </p><p>Billy turned. Hopeful eyes, wish filled voice that prayed Agatha would open up to him.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” He tried to hide his excitement, nervous to scare Agatha off. “What uh- What's up?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused for a moment. She twitched her lips to the side, rolling her shoulders back while taking in a deep breath. Billy felt the seconds lasted hours while Agatha felt it was too soon, not able to fully think through her words. </p><p> </p><p>“You know..” She looked up, offering a soft smile that made Billy feel at ease. “Proud of you. You’re really starting to grow a pair of balls there. Not taking shit and backing down so easy anymore” </p><p> </p><p>He paused, momentarily upset it wasn't Agatha opening up about Rio. Though, he smiled softly himself. Sure it wasn't exactly what he was looking for. And the compliment may sound brutal for the way Agatha worded it. </p><p> </p><p>But if Billy learned anything about Agatha? The words held a stronger, heavier, deeper meaning than anyone would ever know. </p><p> </p><p>His cheeks turned red with a little smile. The boy nodded, gesturing a salute that made Agatha roll her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m learning from the toughest woman alive. Only makes sense” </p><p> </p><p>She snorted, shaking her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Night, Agatha” He said. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled. “Night, kid” </p><p> </p><p>He exited the room, walking down the hall till his bedroom door echoed in the distance. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was left alone once again. Rio felt heavier on her mind this time around. Then again Agatha had to laugh because- </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Is that even possible?  </em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The weekend had gone by painfully slow for Rio. No alcohol made her sleep through it, no matter how many episodes of Glee or South Park she forced herself to watch. It all went by at an agonizing pace. </p><p> </p><p>By Monday, Rio thought things would get somewhat better. She hated the idea of facing Agatha at work, but at least she got to lay eyes on her and maybe corner her into talking. </p><p> </p><p>Then Monday went by with no Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Tuesday happened, no Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>By Wednesday when there was again- No Agatha. Rio had enough. It was close to noon when she debated abandoning her classes, storming to Agatha's apartment, breaking down the door- Whatever it took. </p><p> </p><p>She was stuck in her head stomping down the hall, ignoring anything Lilia had to say. Something about meetings and a possible work trip to Florida down the line. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Miami, yeah. Sounds great”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio had muttered, not realizing what was being said. Instead she was just brushing her off to try and focus on getting through the day. </p><p> </p><p>Though as they passed the computer lab, Rio heard the copier being smacked a few times. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Billy.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Oh, that kid was a blessing for her at that moment. She hadn't tracked him down either. Some days he was too busy running around and Rio had been locked in her classroom to provide extra help with some students. </p><p> </p><p>She waved Lilia off, saying how they'd talk later. Luckily the older woman didn't put up a fight. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shoved her phone in her back pocket, sliding beside Billy who lit up instantly. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, thank God. I hate this copier so much and-”</p><p> </p><p>Like usual, Rio smacked it to fix it for him. Billy always called it the <em> ‘Vidal Touch!’ </em> But this time? It didn't just end with a small interaction. </p><p> </p><p>And the smack wasn't light either. </p><p> </p><p>The copier kicked into action after it was hit twice. Billy sighed in relief. He was about to thank her when his second worst nightmare became reality. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you as always, Professor. I really appreciat-” </p><p> </p><p>“Tell me where Harkness is” </p><p> </p><p>Rio was leaning against the copier, holding the top down so he couldn't have access to the paper he needed. She didn't care if she came across mean, scary, any of it. He dealt with Agatha on the daily. The kid should be used to it by now. </p><p> </p><p>His lips parted, eyes wide as his body started to tremble. Sure, he had confidence with Agatha. But that was different! He had grown close to her. </p><p> </p><p>Not to mention, Rio was the <em> strictest </em>professor in the entire building. She had her nice moments, yes. Yet, Billy still barely knew her. </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, what did he know? Something was going on with the professors and he kept getting tossed in the middle. </p><p> </p><p>“What does that mean?” Rio pointed.</p><p> </p><p>“What does what mean?” He rushed. </p><p> </p><p>“Your face is burning redder than a god damn apple. Where is she?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy silently cursed his body out for its betrayal. That'd always been one of his weak spots. Agatha called him out all the time for it. Embarrassment, fear, even being giddy- His skin turned a fire red. Always dead set on giving his emotions away. </p><p> </p><p>He took in a deep breath, trying to let Agatha's words about being more confident echo in his mind. </p><p> </p><p>“Listen-”</p><p> </p><p>“I'm listening if you tell me where the hell she is” </p><p> </p><p>“How would I know?!” </p><p> </p><p>“Because she was with you the rest of this weekend. You're back, she isn't. So where-”</p><p> </p><p>“You both won't tell me what's going on with you. So, why keep tossing me in the middle?!” </p><p> </p><p>He had a point. Rio somewhat felt bad for him since he had been getting tossed in the middle. Then again, her sympathy was wiped away. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘You both won't tell me’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“What does both won't tell you mean?” </p><p> </p><p>Billy stared for a second before shaking his head. </p><p> </p><p>“I- Just..what it means, Professor. She won't tell me, you won't tell me-”</p><p> </p><p>“Tell you what? What isn't she saying?” </p><p> </p><p>“I don't know!” He exclaimed. “All I know is clearly something happened between you two” </p><p> </p><p>“But how did you get to that conclusion if she hasn't said a word?” </p><p> </p><p>Billy scoffed, earning a glare from Rio. Luckily, he dodged it and forced himself to continue on. </p><p> </p><p>“I know when I see lesbians, okay?” He asked. “Besides, you pestering me for her address then she's in a mood twenty four seven after- I mean!” </p><p> </p><p>He gestured his hands in the air with a nervous laugh. </p><p> </p><p>“Professor Vidal, I don't mean to sound intrusive- I really don't. But the writing is on the wall here” </p><p> </p><p>Her tongue pushed the inside of her cheek, looking away to think over his words. </p><p> </p><p>Fine. Maybe they didn't hide this one so well. Then again, what did he mean by Agatha being in a <em> mood </em>. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Is she mad at me?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Is she as upset as I am?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> What is- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“All I know is Agatha wasn't feeling well” He said. “Otherwise, I'm just clueless in the middle here” </p><p> </p><p>She looked back over, fingertips drumming on top of the copier. He nervously looked over, lips twitched to the side as he started to rock back and forth on his feet. </p><p> </p><p>“Professor uh, I hate to…ask this, but” </p><p> </p><p>Rio could laugh at the way he slipped back into his usual self. A bundle of nerves, constantly hesitant to reply or ask for anything. </p><p> </p><p>She took pity on him by answering his question without needing to be asked. Her hand pushed off the copier, allowing him to grab the original sheet instantly. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” He sighed in relief. “Professor Kale is-”</p><p> </p><p>“A pain in the ass about timing, yes” Rio nodded. </p><p> </p><p>Billy weakly smiled with a small laugh. He glanced up to see Rio with her arms crossed, foot tapping on the floor as she glared at the ceiling. </p><p> </p><p>It was clear to him Rio was in the same spot as Agatha. She just seemed to turn to anger instead of wallowing in the darkness of her apartment. Agatha was doing just that last he knew. </p><p> </p><p>“She should be back tomorrow,” Billy said. “I promise. That's all I know” </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, offering a weak smile that barely existed. If he wasn't so close, he wouldn't have spotted it. </p><p> </p><p>He returned the same smile before turning around, heading to the door. However, he paused- Hand above the handle, mind pulling it's own tug of war game until he couldn't hold back any longer. </p><p> </p><p>“Professor Vidal?” </p><p> </p><p>The young man turned, seeing Rio shoot her eyes up to meet his. Billy didn't waste a second. He had her attention, the confidence radiating through him to speak. Now was his chance to add in his own thoughts before the window closed. </p><p> </p><p>“Although I may not know what has happened between you two..” </p><p> </p><p>Rio went to stop him, but he beat her to it before she could. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha cares..” </p><p> </p><p>He spoke with true honesty. Even if he were a stranger, Rio would know he wasn't telling a lie. </p><p> </p><p>“That much is <em> very </em> clear and..I know I haven't known her forever, but..” </p><p> </p><p>Billy shrugged, now pushing down on the handle to prepare for Rio to kick him out. Agatha would have by now. And if Rio was just the same? Well-</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you” Rio whispered. </p><p> </p><p>Shock was an understatement to describe what he felt in that moment. He was frantically searching for a reply, but it felt like his brain had hit a wall. Nothing in him was prepared to be met with that. </p><p> </p><p>He had told himself silently Rio would fight, tell him to fuck off. The scariest, strictest professor in the entire university truly wouldn't put up with him. </p><p> </p><p>Her response as well only made Billy realize how deep this was going between them. It was heavier than just lesbian drama. Something happened and he was desperate to know what it was. </p><p> </p><p>Obviously, yes. It was related to them being lesbians, but it was nothing light hearted. This wasn't about some friends with benefits situation. Not two co-workers that shared a drunken kiss or whatever. </p><p> </p><p>Billy wasn't necessarily a mind reader, but he could see it in both of the women's eyes. And he almost voiced it. He almost said the words aloud, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You're in love”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Luckily Rio spoke before he could do so. </p><p> </p><p>She cleared her throat, waving him off with a strong, </p><p> </p><p>“Move it along now. You don't want Kale being more annoying than she already is” </p><p> </p><p>He snapped out of his little trance. Quick nods, hushed whispers of agreement while rushing down the hall. </p><p> </p><p>Just like Agatha a few nights before, he had left Rio behind to her lonesome. She moved to lean against the copier, hands running through her hair and tugging gently at the roots. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The biggest word running through her mind was simply just…<em> fuck. </em></p><p> </p><p>What else was there to say? Billy was one of the only closest people to Agatha. If she never wanted to talk to her again, he would know. He would have told her as well to back off. Agatha was known to put him up to that. </p><p> </p><p>Instead not only did he break the news she'd be back to work the following day. Which really should be Rio's main focus. He also mentioned how- </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha cares.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio could cry over those two words alone. Although if she cared, why the hell wasn't she here? Why was Agatha still ignoring her and acting like they hadn't just confessed love, spent weeks on end together? </p><p> </p><p>Sure, she ran off. That's what started this whole mess. Then again if she cared..</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Why are we playing this game?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, muttering a few, </p><p> </p><p>“Nope, nope” to herself on repeat. </p><p> </p><p>She pulled her phone out, thumbs trembling as she typed the words. Something Rio never did. Not even when she was sick, out of town, in a hospital room or even away for a funeral. </p><p> </p><p>For Agatha Harkness, Rio had done the unimaginable- </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Classes for the rest of the day are canceled. Going home sick. Will keep everyone posted”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The world's most strictest professor. </p><p> </p><p>The professor who never missed a day if she didn't have to and always expected her students to do the same. </p><p> </p><p>Arguably the most dedicated professor in the university had canceled her classes..</p><p> </p><p>All for Agatha Harkness. </p><p> </p><p>Rio rushed to grab her belongings before anyone could find out she was not sick. As she raced through the hall, nearly broke down her classroom door- Rio started to realize slowly, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She ruined me. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The woman had worked nonstop all her life. She took her career seriously to the point it fell to the level of life or death. And now? </p><p> </p><p>Her classes were canceled solely to show up on Agatha's doorstep all over again. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> God, what have I become?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She locked the classroom door behind her, chasing outside to her car. Rio didn't care if her laptop broke from how aggressively her bag was tossed in the passenger seat. The woman almost forgot her seatbelt as she put the car in drive. </p><p> </p><p>“This is ridiculous..” She laughed to herself. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> What the hell am I doing? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn't care if Agatha didn't want to see her. She had no choice at this rate. Days without a reply, suddenly not showing up for work and Billy revealing- </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha cares.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She'd gone mad, truly. Part of her debated tossing away her entire career if it meant she could camp out on Agatha's doorstep till this was fixed. The woman realized even more how she changed as that thought ran across her mind. </p><p> </p><p>Rio only cared about work, yes. Everyone knew that. But Rio also never chased anyone. If they wanted to be in her life, so be it. If they didn't, she'd let them go. </p><p> </p><p>Yes, letting people go had hurt her. But it was never this. She never felt the rage or need to chase them down. When it came to Agatha though? Rio was already planning how she'd keep the cops at bay holding her hostage in the apartment. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was hers and maybe that sounded possessive and psycho, but Rio didn't care. She'd take time later on to face who she had become. </p><p> </p><p>For now? She was fed up. And Agatha didn't have a choice but to face her now. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> You're mine, Harkness. </em>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Agatha! Open up!” </p><p> </p><p>Rio had barely stepped foot in front of Agatha's door when she started to pound her arm against it. After the first few times when there was no reply, she matched her voice to tell the demand. </p><p> </p><p>And still, there was nothing. </p><p> </p><p>She groaned, almost ready to kick the door in herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, come on. I'm fucking tired of playing this game!” </p><p> </p><p>Rio waited, clenching her fist and looking down the hall to see an older woman glaring at her. She rolled her eyes and paid no mind. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness was her future wife. Rio would make a fool of herself to assure that would be a reality. </p><p> </p><p>She pounded on the door again. This time instead of being able to say anything, the woman down the hall yelled out, </p><p> </p><p>“She isn't home!” </p><p> </p><p>Rio jumped, suddenly thinking how the older woman wasn't so bad. Maybe she had some information for her to work with. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you know where she went?” </p><p> </p><p>“Errands-”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, errands. Cool. But where?” </p><p> </p><p>She shrugged. “I don't know that much, dear. All I know is we said our hellos and she's been gone for the day” </p><p> </p><p>Rio took in a deep breath, wiping her hand across her forehead while the other lifted up as a small unspoken, <em> thanks </em>. The older woman smiled, disappearing into her apartment right after. </p><p> </p><p><em>Great.</em> <em>Alright, well, fine. So she isn't home? Doable. I can camp out here. Totally. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio thought she had been saying all of that in her mind, but the words were mumbled out. Luckily no one was around to hear. </p><p> </p><p>She fiddled with her fingers, pacing for more than ten minutes. Back and forth, over and over and to no surprise-</p><p> </p><p>Still no Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Where the hell are you, Harkness?” Rio muttered. </p><p> </p><p>She pulled out her phone to text again, but when Agatha's face on the contact ID came up? That's when the memory hit her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha told her one time if she ever wanted to swing by her place (Even though they always stayed at her's) how there was-</p><p> </p><p>“A spare key above the door frame” She muttered to herself. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed up on the tips of her toes, reaching blindly and swiping her hand side to side. The dust built on her fingers. Rio swore she hit a dead bug. Maybe a spiderweb as well, but fuck she didn't know and didn't care to know. </p><p> </p><p>Like a beacon, the best feeling in the world-</p><p> </p><p>“Yes!” </p><p> </p><p>Rio bounced as the metal touched her fingers. She pulled it off, looking down at the bronze key shining up at her. The woman wiped the dust off, quickly making work to unlock the handle. </p><p> </p><p>Just as she turned the knob, took one step inside the apartment- Logic kicked in. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Am I really doing this?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Have I become this insane to break into someone's apartment?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>For all Rio knew, Agatha could be sleeping or home any second. She already looked obsessive texting her on repeat and leaving voicemails like some crazed ex who couldn't let go. </p><p> </p><p>The woman stepped back, staring at the door with fear coursing through her veins. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> What have I become?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She'd been in love before, sure. But it never drove her to this point. Where she genuinely was considering breaking into a woman's apartment to do…</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What exactly?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“The fuck..” She muttered. </p><p> </p><p>What would breaking in even achieve? Especially if Agatha wasn't here and-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Make sure she didn't leave.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio knew her brain was grasping at delusional straws, but it worked. Plus! It wasn't breaking in if she had a key. She wasn't picking the lock or whatever…right? </p><p> </p><p>The mental gymnastics Rio was putting herself through would be hysterical to broadcast live for an audience. Agatha would actually love to be in those seats as well and-</p><p> </p><p><em> Stop relating her to everything, dammit! </em>Her mind yelled to herself. </p><p> </p><p>Yet, it felt impossible to follow through with that demand. </p><p> </p><p>She muttered a quick, “Fuck it” and did something- Crossed a line she never had been within a mile radius of before. </p><p> </p><p>Rio slid into Agatha's apartment, softly clicking the door shut behind her. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> This is it. I've hit a new low. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Well, if Agatha showed up and called the cops. At least Wanda was around to bail her out. </p><p> </p><p>She slid the key in her pocket, taking slow steps around the familiar apartment. Her eyes scanned every inch, seeing Agatha's belongings were still scattered. The furniture was still the same, dishes were left in the strainer (Agatha never left until all the dishes were clean. That was a rule Rio had to adjust to). </p><p> </p><p>All signs led to Agatha being back. She hadn't gone on another trip. If she did, she would have taken her purse that sat on the couch. The only way Rio knew she wasn't home was because her jacket and favorite pair of boots were missing. </p><p> </p><p>Rio knew it was time to leave. She got the answer she was looking for. Agatha was due to be back at the university by tomorrow. Rio could confront her there and this would all be either a memory they'd laugh over. </p><p> </p><p>Or, a memory Agatha would never know about. Most likely that one. </p><p> </p><p>Rio started to leave, but then her eyes caught the dining room table. She glanced over to the front door to make sure it wasn't opening. Really, Rio should look for places to hide in case that happened. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, the envelope on the table had caught her eye. </p><p> </p><p>She slowly approached it as if it was a bomb that'd explode. An item that'd catch her in the act. Rio leaned over, eyes skimming the neat hand writing that was far too familiar.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Photos from our trip! Thanks for tagging along Agatha:)” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Billy..” She mumbled to herself. </p><p> </p><p>There was a sigh of relief from that. It was just Billy and some photos from their trip. He'd always been a materialistic person. Before the summer, he always made sure to do his rounds and take photos with everyone. </p><p> </p><p>Rio obliged every time to make him happy, but always tossed the printed copy he sent aside. Not because she hated him or anything. She just wasn't sentimental for those kinds of things. </p><p> </p><p>Well, at least with anyone else. Agatha was different. <em> Shocker.  </em></p><p> </p><p>“Just Billy,” She shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>There was no more need to stay. Clearly Agatha was back, but truly out running errands. Rio was on a time clock to get the hell out before she was caught and ultimately lost Agatha forever. She wouldn't blame her for it either. </p><p> </p><p>She was about to turn when a force of wind pushed her back. A little peek at the photos wouldn't hurt. Just to confirm Agatha looked miserable without her. She wanted to see the, </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha cares.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>For herself. </p><p> </p><p>The first few photos were of sunsets and nature trails. Agatha appeared in only a few photos. Mainly in the background and <em> always </em>at a restaurant or apartment. She didn't appear to join them on adventures. That wasn't shocking. </p><p> </p><p>One by one, Rio flipped through. It looked normal. Honestly, like they had a nice trip. </p><p> </p><p>That was until she flipped to a certain photo. One that made everything around her stop. Her heart sunk, stomach twisted and threatened to turn her inside out- Make her puke everything up on the table before her. </p><p> </p><p>A woman was sitting beside Agatha. Both focused on each other, laughing, heads close, oblivious to the rest of the table. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“This is caring?” She muttered to herself, smacking the photo against the others with a stronger- “This is fucking caring?!” </p><p> </p><p>Her heart was pounding out of control. Rio felt her whole body run cold and hot at the same time. She'd been angry in her life before, but never to this extent. This was a new level of rage Rio didn't know was possible. </p><p> </p><p>And fuck, it scared her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smacked down the rest of the photos. She folded the one, not caring how messy the crease in it would be. At that moment, she didn't care if Agatha found her. Rio knew the reason why she was being ignored now. </p><p> </p><p>While she was back home sobbing her eyes out, pleading for Agatha to answer and apologizing profusely for what happened. Agatha was moving on as if they never were in love to begin with. </p><p> </p><p>“Fucking bitch” Rio hissed. </p><p> </p><p>She started to storm out of the apartment, not caring to return the key to the top of the frame. Rio didn't bother to hide the evidence she had broken in. </p><p> </p><p>Luckily (More lucky for Agatha, really) the woman didn't show. Rio was able to leave the apartment building without being caught. </p><p> </p><p>She didn't know where to start. On one end, Rio wasn't surprised. The enemies to lovers trope was ridiculous and never realistic. Wanda was delusional for thinking the two would ever be more than just two women who hated each other. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was a bitch. Agatha was annoying. Agatha Harkness made Rio Vidal's life a living hell and that would <em> never </em> fucking change. The photo in her hand proved it. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha cares.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Bull-<em> fucking </em>-shit, William!” </p><p> </p><p>Rio hissed aloud as if he was near. She continued on, earning a few weird stares from others in the parking lot as she charged to her car. </p><p> </p><p>“This is fucking caring?! This?” She laughed. “Fucking slut- I make one mistake ONE and this is how she-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio clenched her fists, taking in a deep breath before letting out a yell as she kicked her driver's side door hard enough to make a dent in it. </p><p> </p><p>“Shit!” </p><p> </p><p>She wasn't sure what she'd regret more. How her knee would ultimately be aching for days from that or her car now having a dent in it. One she'd have to make up an excuse to not sound like some emo teenager with dramatic anger issues. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looked around, making sure Agatha hadn't seen her at all. Then like clockwork- The familiar car entered the lot. For a split second, Rio debated charging over and demanding answers. </p><p> </p><p>However, seeing Agatha briefly through the windshield? Rio's heart shattered. The anger dissolved into despair, regret for ever allowing herself to feel more than just attraction towards her. </p><p> </p><p>The woman rushed to hide in her car, even reclining the seat to do so. She held the photo back up without meaning to, glancing at it once more. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's smile. She missed calling that look her very own, but..</p><p> </p><p>It wasn't her smile anymore. Agatha wasn't <em> Rio's.  </em></p><p> </p><p>She fell in the arms of another woman. Rio made the worst decision of her life. If only she stayed, if she never ran or maybe she reached out way too many times. </p><p> </p><p>She dropped the photo, covering her face with her arms as sobs started to take control. Her body shook, bones nearly cracked under the pressure her emotions kept piling on. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha cares… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The thing is though, she didn't. Not in Rio's mind anymore..</p>

<p>
<em>"I hate myself for loving you<br/>
Can't break free from the the things that you do<br/>
I wanna walk but I run back to you<br/>
That's why I hate myself for loving you"</em>
</p>
</blockquote><hr/><p>
<span>Agatha tossed her phone and keys on the kitchen counter. A dramatic sigh escaped her. One that was heavy, exhausted from the last few days. Between the trip, Rio, and battling with her own self as well as </span>
<em>
<span>accepting</span>
</em>
<span> who she was- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was beat. That was to say the least. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The shopping bags were placed on the dining room table, peaking over to see the envelope Billy texted he had dropped off. She gave him a spare key a few months ago. The bar he liked to venture to was just down the block. Agatha scolded him for walking or taking an Uber home when her place was a safer option.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She noticed the envelope opened. The photos sticking out somewhat. Though Agatha thought nothing of it. Billy probably wanted to look through them to make sure there were no duplicates. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Always such a perfectionist..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rolled her eyes, picking up the photos to look through them. Agata was relieved there wasn't a lot of her, but even more so nothing with Kate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If there was? She was going to toss it before it ever saw the light of day. Rio never needed to know about that. Even if nothing happened, the fact Billy blindly tried to set her up on a date stressed her out enough as it was. And she wanted to win Rio back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That would certainly not help if she ever were to find out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After looking through the photos, Agatha checked out the items she had bought. Retail therapy was always her form of self care. But this time? It was retail therapy- </span>
<em>
<span>Rio edition. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wouldn't say it was bribery, per say. In some people's eyes, sure. That was kind of exactly what she was doing. However, for her, this was normal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She already showered Rio with gifts. From bigger ones to simple little things. If she saw a little new snack Rio may like, she grabbed it. When Agatha saw a cool rock, she brought it home. New plants, new blankets. Etc, etc. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's love language was gifts and that'd never change. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She'd be a liar to say though this didn't hold a smidge of bribery at all. But still! Love language over bribery, always. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There were three different pairs of boxers. Two had dinosaurs. The other had Dolly Parton. A stupid joke gift they'd both laugh over. Other things were snacks, small Lego kits, and a new hoodie that said the classic, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Best Dog Mom Ever” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her favorite shade of dark green as well. It was perfect. Agatha was content with what she had bought. There was an urge, little nudge for her to add one more thing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>No. I can't. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn't good with words. Yet, a letter seemed to be the best thing to add. She wanted it more than anything. To write how in love she was, put it into words, give something for Rio to hold onto. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>You don't know how to even say it half of the time.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Let alone have replied to her at all. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Maybe a letter could happen down the line. That could be a goal for the future. But for now? Her second thought was right. Agatha's phone was staring up at her. The promise she made herself on the way home was waiting to be filled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Text her. Just. Text her. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had repeated the words to herself all day. Really, more the last two, but kept pushing it off. Yet, she was due to be back on campus in less than twenty four hours. Maybe they could meet tonight and make things less awkward for tomorrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She picked up her phone, typing a small message that told Rio how sorry she was for the late reply. Using the trip as an excuse, saying how exhausted she was. That was good, right? Had to be, Agatha told herself. It was small, cut straight to the point. She didn’t sound angry or anything in the slightest. </span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Besides, trips were exhausting, no? Anyone would understand that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Who am I kidding? </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wouldn’t be that easy. Rio wouldn’t just come out of the woodworks with open arms, forgiving and all. As much as she wished for it, Agatha was well aware of how much of a selfish asshole she chose to be. Rio had every right to ignore her and offer the same treatment Agatha had given her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She almost texted her again, but decided against it. Maybe giving Rio space was the best option. Allow her to make her own way back to Agatha. She’d still send another text in the morning, stop by her classroom, wait for her in the parking lot and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Okay, fine. Maybe Agatha wouldn’t </span>
<em>
<span>completely</span>
</em>
<span> give Rio space, but was that a bad thing? Rio hadn’t given her space either. The last few hours had been the longest time her phone was silent. No new messages, voicemails, nothing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And right then, Agatha felt herself pushed off the edge. Not of glory either. This cliff was unnerving, terrifying. Agatha started to chew the hangnail on her thumb, foot tapping as she stared at the screen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s quiet. I fucked up. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Part of her debated dropping everything and showing up on Rio’s doorstep that night. Who cared if Rio didn’t want her there? The regret was taking over like poison, threatening to end Agatha’s life before she knew it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, no. Rio needed space. Agatha had to respect and give her that. If she wasn’t reaching out, that was her message and Agatha needed to get it through her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She put her phone down, stepping away to head for the bathroom. A burning hot shower would bring her back down to earth. She’d be able to clear her head, make more logical decisions instead of acting on impulse and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio changed me. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was stripping her pants when the new found realization came to life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No longer was Agatha the spontaneous being she always was. Her mind was actually processing, thinking through not only the woman she was growing into- But no longer making choices with no thought behind them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was always the logical one. Has that seriously rubbed off on her? Was she now slowly becoming a woman who thought before acting?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, what the fuck?” She muttered with a frustrated laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She knew allowing herself to love Rio would change things. Agatha chose to drop herself into the abyss, enter the unknown territory she avoided like a plague. What she didn’t realize was how it wouldn’t just be all about facing fears and life changes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was becoming someone she was </span>
<em>
<span>not. </span>
</em>
<span>Through and through, up, down, left, right and all of the above. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course, parts of her old self clearly remained. The selfishness of ignoring Rio, trying to gift her way out of trouble, little things she hadn’t let go of quite yet. However, so much more of her was gone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And really…</span>
<em>
<span>is that good?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands covered her face, pushing back through her hair and took a deep breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Did she regret falling in love with Rio? No. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Did she regret not focusing on the little things sooner? How her personality had changed so she’d work on accepting those things sooner? Possibly, but then again- How was Agatha to know and expect that’d happen? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Love was completely new to her. She had relationships in the past, but it never compared to this. Rio wasn’t just a new character in her life, she was a separate book. Not a small chapter, but a whole ‘nother saga. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t know the rules, but who did? She had to learn just like anyone else. Though after the last few days, Agatha could only wonder-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Am I too late?</span>
</em>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio ignored Agatha’s text. She actually laughed over it when she read it. Not only from Agatha finally ending her radio silence with some pathetic excuse. But also?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The irony of it appearing the second she had pulled into her driveway after getting home from Agatha’s apart-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I broke into someone’s apartment. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She felt the adrenaline shoot fire through her over the realization. Rio nearly slammed the car door hard enough to break the frame as she ran to hide in her house. Her heart was hammering, stomach turning as her skin vibrated with goosebumps all over. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What have I done?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Since when did Rio fuckin’ Vidal not think through her ideas? She never made rash decisions. Was never one who acted on impulse. Had love actually driven her to the point of insanity? </span>
<em>
<span>Could </span>
</em>
<span>love do that to someone?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t considered Agatha would have an effect on who she was. Sure, Agatha would change aspects of her life. But, change parts of her? Personality wise to who she was at her core. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She never thought love would do this to her. Let alone Agatha Harkness would hold this kind of power. Sure, everyone knew Agatha was the definition of a manipulative witch. Rio saw right through the bullshit though. She wasn’t one who fell into the trap that easily.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And yet, she broke into a woman’s apartment solely from being ignored. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The night dragged on from there. Rio had tossed and turned in bed, moved to the couch to snuggle with Nicky and try to sleep. However, there was no way her mind, anxiety, anything would allow it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was terrified of who she was becoming. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio feared how deep in love she was with someone. It was new, unknown to her. Sure, she had love before. But it wasn’t this. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They weren’t </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Around midnight is when Rio’s mind went from a smaller, easier level of alert to a maximum point she didn’t know existed. It was when she picked her phone up, seeing two missed calls and a voicemail. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio tossed her phone down, refusing to listen. She wouldn’t give in that quick. Agatha didn’t deserve such satisfaction. And Rio would NOT let Agatha think of her as a pushover. Someone easy to manipulate, take advantage of, etc.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Five minutes passed when Rio was chewing on her thumb, side eyeing the phone until her hand quickly snatched it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She will never know I listened to it. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio held Nicky close when she hit play. Just in case she needed to hide, he’d be her shield. The boy was her protector, safety, someone she relied on for comfort. He’d been the only one for years now to be that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Until Agatha was here to be my second..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hid her face in his fur while listening, mentally cursing the way his breathing and tail picked up at the sound of Agatha’s voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re mad at her, Nicky” Her voice was muffled into his body, but Agatha’s voice through the phone speaker was clear as day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Rio..” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t realize her small whimper that crept up her throat. Too busy hating how good her name sounded on Agatha’s tongue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I-..I get it. I do. You have every right to not speak to me” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wow. She does know something for once..” Rio mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I should have replied, okay? I know that..just- This game we're playing is childish”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flew open, body sitting up as she screamed at the phone like Agatha could hear her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Childish? YOU STARTED IT!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I just want things the way they were. Don’t you?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. She shot up to her feet, pacing with her hands gripping her hips like a tether to keep her grounded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“So..let’s just get this over with and-”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh..you</span>
<em>
<span> bitch</span>
</em>
<span>” She hissed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed her phone, ending the voicemail before it was over. She was ready to call or text- Curse Agatha out, call her on the manipulative tone and dismissive words. There was never even an apology! Agatha was prancing around the word like it was invisible, sworn off into oblivion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How hard is it to say fucking sorry?” She muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>No. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha does not deserve her attention at all. Maybe if she apologized, Rio would be willing to reach out. Alas, she wasn't going to let the anger drive her into insanity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not that it already hadn't, of course. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She tossed her phone back on the couch, apologizing under her breath to Nicky for almost hitting his back with it. He just snored a bit, clueless to how his Mom was on the verge of committing murder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, how nice. Break in AND murders now? Lovely..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio started to bite on her thumb. The hangnail that was close to breaking off, dripping a tad of blood and would sting for the next couple of days. As annoying as that'd be? It'd still hurt less than what Rio was going through at that moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had ignored her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had broken into a woman's apartment, stole a photo which made her feel psychotic-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>But she cheated. </span>
</em>
<span>Did she though? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They hadn't made anything super official. Nothing was ever vocalized or in writing. But, she had just confessed she was in love with her! They were both in love, Rio thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was left wondering more if this was some prank. Would Agatha laugh in her face when they saw each other in the hall? Did she lie through her teeth or was just bored and stringing her along? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. She didn't want to know. The break in, obsessive thoughts, texts and calls. It was all too much. They had rushed into it. Crashed and burned before they were able to keep the fire alive for more than what felt like two seconds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was never one to rush into things either. Rio Vidal was logical, took time to process and build up relationships even with friends. It was a reason her life was limited to a small social circle. She had to build trust, connection and all of the above. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yet with Agatha…everything was like a surge of power, faster than the speed of light. The only slow build up to exist was the bickering and hating each other for a few short years. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Next thing Rio knew, Agatha was in her life. She borderline resided in her house. The woman built a home for herself in Rio's heart and took over her mind like a parasite. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was all so beautiful until it wasn't. Rio's walls were back up. Higher than before, stronger than ever. She wouldn't allow herself to gracefully fall back into Agatha's arms. Part of her wanted to completely shun Agatha, swear her off like a drug she would never touch again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And yet, as Rio picked up her phone to block Agatha's number. With the contact ID profile picture smiling up at her. Agatha with Nicky, smiling into his fur with Rio's cardigan wrapped around her. Her hands trembled, eyes stung with tears on the horizon. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She couldn't make the promise to herself that Agatha was gone for good. However, Rio could do one thing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I'm not going back that easy. </span>
</em>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“Keep it up, kid” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>It's Agatha. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio froze when the voice echoed in the hall behind her. The raspy tone that never failed to send shivers down her spin. Even in the midst of her anger, resentment- Agatha still held the power to take a breath and have an effect on her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She had blocked Agatha's number the night before. So close to cancelling classes, but decided against it. One, Lilia would actually kill her. Two? Agatha wasn't going to hold power over her. Well, at least not </span>
<em>
<span>all</span>
</em>
<span> of the power. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was going to work as she did before. She existed in a workplace where once she had tolerated, ignored, and dealt with Agatha's existence before loving her. It'd be simple to do it all over again. Loving Agatha didn't have to mean being co-workers would be different, right? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sworn enemies, the two co workers everyone knew to not expect to stay in the same room. They could be that again with no issue. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I can learn to hate her again. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The more you practice, the easier it becomes. You'll be speaking to crowds that spread for miles by the time you know it” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The young man chuckled, voice clearly showing his nerves were radiating through him. That was typical. Even the students that felt most comfortable in Professor Harkness's classroom were still intimidated by her somewhat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I don't think I'll ever be a politician drawing out those kind of numbers”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not with that attitude, you won't” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No buts,” She cut him off, voice clipped and left no room for a debate. “Don't you dare question your talent. You've got a good head on those shoulders. </span>
<em>
<span>Use it</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She heard his laugh, listening to how they both shared a soft goodbye. And </span>
<em>
<span>fuck..</span>
</em>
<span>Rio hated what that did to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not only hearing Agatha’s voice, knowing she was just down the hall from her- But it was no longer just a small, meaningless sight to see how encouraging Agatha was. When before Rio would find it nice, but nothing more than that. Now? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She's incredible. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It made her heart swell with a warm sense of pride to know Agatha Harkness. The woman who was tough on the outside, full of insults and sarcastic remarks. When it all really boiled down to it? Agatha had a heart of pure </span>
<em>
<span>(stupid)</span>
</em>
<span> fucking gold. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wanted the best for her students. She tried her hardest to make people laugh on their worst days (Even if Agatha didn't think anyone noticed). And even worse for Rio to realize?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She took care of me. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She loved…me. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Did she though? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let her forehead rest against the door for a moment, resisting the urge to slam it against the hardwood until she passed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>God, Rio didn’t have time for this shit. Nor the energy or strength in her to make it through. But…she had to. Rio had students who relied on her, a career she had given up her entire soul for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>It’d be fine..it </span>
<span>had to be. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her head, trying to rid Agatha from her completely. Of course, that'd never work. If it did, Rio would have done that years ago (She’d preach that till the world’s end). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck” She muttered, thinking much worse in her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But if Rio let those words free? The entire campus would hear her loud and clear.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman was about to make a left turn down the hall. She'd take the longer way to the parking lot to avoid risking an interaction with Agatha. However, it didn't go her way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sighed seeing the caution tape and cones up. Her eyes looked around for the custodian, repair guy, whoever to tell her if it was safe to cross or not. Then again, maybe she didn't care if it was safe. Anything felt more secure than walking past Agatha Harkness's room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She held tighter on her bag, moving to step over the caution tape when there was a laugh behind her. Rio jumped, nearly fell backwards at the sound. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dumbass” Alice said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman grinned wide, Rio rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wouldn't go that way-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why?” Rio huffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Kid vomited all over the place. They just cleaned it up, but are coming back to make sure it's-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gagged, hands in the air. “Please stop talking” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice laughed. “Yeah, figured you wouldn't want to step in that. Even if it looks clean” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She ran a hand through her hair, ripping her eyes away. Rio always felt sick at the thought of vomit. Maybe more extreme than others, but still. The only one she could imagine being able to tough her reaction through would be for Nicky and Ag-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>One. Nicky is one. Agatha doesn't- No. She is not included. Stop that. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio needed another plan. Something quick to avoid having to see Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I could just hide until she leaves? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, some nights Agatha stayed late especially if she was out for a day or two. That wouldn't work. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Kill myself?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky needs his mom, unfortunately. Wanda would also bring her back to life just to kill her again. Waste of time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She peaked up to see Alice texting someone back. Rio felt the lightbulb go off then. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alice!” Rio said, pointing at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What's up?” Alice asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm heading out for the night. Wanna’ go grab a drink?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn't want to be social, but asking meant Alice would walk down the hall and out to the parking lot wirh her. It'd be perfect. Rio could be distracted speaking to someone else and Agatha wouldn't pressure her to stay back and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can't” Alice shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm heading over to Jen's room right now for uh, extra help with something”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pushed her tongue in her cheek, arms folded with an amused, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh-huh” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice blushed, hand rubbing the back of her neck as she took steps away. Even if Rio was panicking on the inside? This was beautiful and entertaining as all hell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The two had been sneaking around, that much was clear. Both hiding it, but failing more and more each day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can you two just admit you're-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Later, Vidal!” Alice waved, nearly running down the hall at a high rate of speed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snickered, but the humorous distraction was short lived. She still needed a plan, an escape. Luckily for her, footsteps started to pace down the hall with papers rustling along. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey kid” Rio stepped forward, cutting into his path. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy looked up from the mess in his arms. A flicker of worry crossed his face. She couldn't blame him for that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, professor?” He asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where you heading?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh, Professor Harkness's room..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His voice became smaller as he said the name. Once again, Rio couldn't blame him for being hesitant. She would be as well if she were in his shoes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, gesturing down the hall. “Great. I'll walk with you” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy stood a bit taller, head tilted as his lips parted to say something. She didn't give him the chance to do so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead Rio turned, hearing him catch up to walk by her side. As they took the turn down the hall, Agatha still stood against her doorframe with another student. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her arms were folded, glasses perched on the bridge of her nose. The secondary back up pair that only reminded Rio how she still had Agatha's main pair on her nightstand. She was busy revising a paper in her hand, nodding along to whatever the student was saying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And then Lilia wanted me to make sure everyone signed up for-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, sure” Rio nodded, taking the clipboard from him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy had been rambling on about something. Truthfully, Rio wasn't listening. Something about Lilia's retirement at the end of the year. A get together of sorts, Rio didn't know or care. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her attention was on Agatha who was now smiling. She gave the paper back with a nod, hands waving in the air as she rambled on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Every step took them closer and closer. Rio's nerves began to turn her limbs into nothing but tremors. Her fingers struggled to quickly sign her name before passing the clipboard back to Billy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was a countdown till death. A never ending walk that felt as if it stretched for miles. As they were just two doors down, the student and Agatha said their goodbyes and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” Billy called out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked right at her first. The soft teaching gaze filled with wisdom and encouragement shifted into something smaller. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio watched her tense, stand taller. How she started to fidget with her fingers, cross her arms only to uncross them a second after. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In another world, a different time, Rio would find the sight adorable. How she didn't know what to do, how to hold herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But, that wasn't the case. Not anymore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I just wanted to stop by and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned over, taking a step forward as she ignored the young man completely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio, hey” Agatha breathed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her voice had unsurprisingly </span>
</p><p>
<span>changed. No longer the teaching one. It was the familiar softness Rio had become accustomed to overtime. Only now, she could hear the pain and regret through each word. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Don't give in. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I've been calling. Are you-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I gotta’ go” Rio held her hand up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman couldn't look at Agatha as she spoke. Her feet stormed down the hall, chest tight as her pulse was racing faster than ever. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was tempting to turn, push Agatha in her classroom and slam the door behind. Maybe to bitch her out, maybe to kiss her, maybe to fuck her senseless right then and there to claim her again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead, behind her she left Agatha to watch her leave. The doors clicked open and slammed shut. Echoed down the hall, made Agatha jump and rip her eyes away from the vacant space Rio had stood in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As if Agatha watching Rio, Rio seeing Agatha, all of it wasn't awkward enough? The professor's attention turned to her left, seeing the young man frightened out of his own mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Any other time, Agatha would laugh. The boy seemingly saw a ghost, frozen in his stance of fear. Though after just watching who felt like the love of her life storm off? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “What's up?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned as she spoke, walking back to her desk as Billy's feet stumbled in behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh, are you two-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“William, do you value your life?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rounded her desk, fingers skimming along the edge while her eyes glanced up over the rim of her glasses. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He swallowed his nerves down, nodding while rushing the words out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm stopping by with the final sign up sheet. Just a confirmation for the tr-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Give it” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She held her hand up, grabbing the pen off her desk to quickly sign right under the name, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio Vidal. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jesus..” She muttered, forcing the clipboard back. Nearly hitting his chest while doing so. “Is that it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her voice was rough, clipped. A sharp edge that represented a sword filled with vengeance. Billy wasn't even the target, but still felt the brutal attack that was meant for Professor Vidal instead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh, yes. Yeah” He stammered, packing his bag while turning on his heel. “Have a good night, Agatha” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hummed, focusing on packing her own belongings when she snapped her fingers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Shit” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He turned around with a quick, “Yes?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sighed, looking up at him with a tired glare. Yet it was gentle, struggling to remain calm for the innocent soul before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I need my spare key back” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy didn't hesitate to agree. He nodded, smiling softlg. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I can keep an eye out for it. No prob-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That's when her temper ran short. It wasn't directly Billy's fault. The kid was always forgetful, scatter brained just as she was. But between Rio, never sleeping, and constantly stressed the last few days. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, eyes closed as she shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"William, did you seriously lose a key again?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"What?” He asked, shaking his head. “No, no. I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fucks sake. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Honey, you dropped the photos off by my place and now the spare key I keep on my door frame is gone. I understand if you needed it, but if you lost it again, I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She heard the soft jingle that made her look back up. In the air, Billy held his keychain. The exact blue coated one Agatha had given him shined in the fluorescent light.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You gave me mine," He said. “Remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared, drumming her fingertips along the edge of her desk. Her lips pulled back, mind clouded and frustrated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After a few moments she nodded, unable to argue with him any further on it. The evidence was before her, his key right there with no need to use the spare one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She continued to pack her belongings while Billy spoke. He was saying something along the lines of how maybe it fell or she misplaced it, but Agatha knew the key was never touched. Not even Rio used it when Agatha informed her on where it was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll still keep an eye out for it though. Goodnight, Agatha!” He smiled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha muttered, hand running through her hair as she added a low, “Night..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her classroom door shut, leaving her to drop in the chair behind her. She pressed her palm over her mouth, staring into the distance as her mind raced through the question,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Where the hell did that key go?</span>
</em>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Agatha stepped through the elevator onto her apartment floor. The bag weighed heavy on her shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Books, papers, her laptop and iPad all ready to be lived on for her to catch up on work she was behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A wine bottle was tucked under her arm, promising to ease her mind for the rest of the night. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was happy to be home. No more using her voice, faking being happy and draining energy that already didn't exist. She started to unlock her door when one opened down the hall. Not a second later did Agatha hear a soft, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, sweetie” Sharon smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As much as she didn't want to talk, Agatha didn't have it in her to be a bitch. Call it the Rio Vidal broken heart effect or whatever, she assumed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked over her shoulder with a weak smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Evening” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did that young woman ever get to you?” Sharon asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>What? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who?” Agatha asked, taking a step back to face her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The one from yesterday. She was knocking on your door like crazy. When I came out to let her know I could leave a message, she was gone. I assume you heard from her?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tapped her fingers along the door handle, hip and head tilted in sync as she stared confused out of her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What did she look like?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, beautiful thing” Sharon smiled. “Dark hair, about your hei-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, that was impossible. Why would she be at her door? And-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>No. That-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha reached up to the top of her doorframe, fingers skimming to make sure the key was actually gone. All that was collected with a dead spider and dust. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her heart dropped, but sky rocketed at the same time. She felt her mind spiraling out of control. Rio knew where the spare key was, she was at her door and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is all okay?” Sharon asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha could only force out a pathetic laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think I did hear her make it into your apart-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Holy shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you serious?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, you know how thin these walls are. And really you and I are the only two that live here besides all the way down the other end” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She fucking broke in. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed harder this time. This was unbelievable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was the reason her spare key was gone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio broke into her apartment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was crazier than she was. </span>
<em>
<span>Go figure.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you alrig-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Uh, yeah. Yes” Agatha nodded as she started to rush past her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wasn't going to be a coward in her home, sulk into her lonesome. Not a chance. Agatha was already having a field day in her mind with what she could say. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Is it often you break into people's apartments? Or am I just a lucky woman?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Did you have fun in my place?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Care to return my key?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Oh, there were an endless amount of ways she could confront her. Agatha was already grinning ear to ear in disbelief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As the older woman went to say something else, Agatha waved over her shoulder while opening the staircase door. Not bothering to wait for an elevator. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you Mrs Hart!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The door was closing while Agatha's footsteps were racing down the stairs. Not hearing behind her the strong,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"It's Sharon!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was giddy as all hell, too busy to care about anything else. Which only left her to take a small pause that lasted a few seconds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I'm excited a woman broke into my apartment…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What is wrong with me? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Don't open that door. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was fine. Who cared Rio was fucking insane? Agatha liked her women crazy at times. And there was something that made her feel warm inside knowing Rio wasn't just able to ignore her again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But as Agatha tossed her bag and wine in the car, jumped into the driver's seat and started her car up. She did wonder one thing to herself the most…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Why did she break in to begin with?</span>
</em>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>It felt foreign to knock on Rio's door. The place she had almost called her forever home, planned a future for herself to be in. Everything had happened so fast, her head still spun and nearly flew off her shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For now though, Agatha took a step back while her hips swayed side to side. Lips pursed, foot tapping impatiently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After a few seconds, Agatha raised her fist to knock again just as the door opened to a sight Agatha had missed dearly. Not just Rio, but it wasn't Professor Vidal from work. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was back to her usual self. The baggy hoodie, loose pair of flannel boxers she always had to pull up on her hips, refusing to get a smaller pair. Her hair was messy, eyes tired. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And yet, Agatha still thought she was the most beautiful thing in the world.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, the rush of humor and joy taking over her. Rio broke into her apartment and holy hell- Agatha was ready to have some fun with that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Well. Hiya’ there toot-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>SLAM! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped as the heavy door almost broke off the hinges. The loud click of the metal lock being turned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And really, Agatha should take that as a sign to leave. However, was she ever the type of woman to do what </span>
<em>
<span>should</span>
</em>
<span> be done? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Besides, Rio broke into her fucking apartment. How could Agatha just walk away and let this go? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She huffed, stepping off the porch and eyeing the backyard gate. Her shoulders raised, head shook as she stormed over, muttering under her breath, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Think you're the only one who can break into places? Well-" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She grabbed the handle, but unsurprisingly it was locked. Agatha grumbled a few curse words before looking up and debating the idiotic decision. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck it. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Let's see how you like when someone breaks in” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With that, Agatha grabbed the top of the wooden fence and pulled herself up. She wasn't the strongest woman, but enough to (while struggling, mind you) swing her one leg over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She still was muttering under her breath while doing so. And if any neighbor was on their porch, walking by, able to see what was going on? She didn't care to look insane. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fucking Rio. Think- </span>
<em>
<span>ugh! </span>
</em>
<span>You can, </span>
<em>
<span>jesus- </span>
</em>
<span>Be the one to break in. Well, you've got another thing comin-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just as Agatha was bringing her other leg over, her balance was ripped away. The edge of the wooden fence dug into her palms, a sliver certainly making it's way into her skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The pain made her jump, legs wobbling as her body decided to go against her. And before she knew it? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“SHIT!”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's body collapsed on the grass (That was definitely not soft to the touch). Her body ached instantly, her heel on the bottom of her boot broke off. However, the pain, shock of the fall. Those weren't her main worries. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before she knew it, she heard the rough bark while paws raced from the house down to the yard. Agatha winced, hid herself worried Nicky would attack thinking she was an intruder. However, she heard a whimper instead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He instantly started to sniff her up and down, tail wagging as he greeted her like a long lost friend. (As if they didn't just see each other days ago). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Though the relief over how Nicky remembered her, wasn't going into attack protector mode was </span>
<em>
<span>very </span>
</em>
<span>short lived. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Nicky, wha- Oh..” Rio forced a low laugh, shaking her head. “You have got to be kidding me"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stormed over, snapping her fingers with a sharp, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Nicky, get in the house and you!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky whimpered again as he ran back inside. Rio was glaring as she stormed over, ready to kick Agatha physically through the wooden gate door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, knowing she went too far. Even if it was only fair Rio broke into her place. This wasn't the safest idea and like always, Agatha acted on impulse without ever thinking things through. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Though, things took a turn as Agatha went to push herself up. She was about to stand on her feet when a strong hiss inflated her lungs, her body gave out to drop back in the dirt and grass below. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed in disbelief, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Oh no, nope” She said. “Don't play the I'm hurt act with me, Agatha. Get the hell out"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nervously laughed, unable to say anything. How was she going to explain this? Billy was the one she'd have to call to pick her up. That'd force her to explain while sitting in urgent care why she broke into Professor Vidal's lawn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I am trying here!” Agatha yelled back. “You could give a woman some grace here for trying”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Grace?!” Rio laughed. “Are you insane?! Jumping over my fence?! Did the door slam in the face not mean shit to you?!"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. The irony was absolutely deadly in that moment to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"It isnt funny, Ag-'</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha was this far in. Her ankle certainly busted, death warrant signed, a possible break in charge ahead of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had to remember and act on the reason she was even in this predicament in the first place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She cleared her throat, forced a calm smile while her hand raised in the air. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"May I have my spare key that sits on my doorframe, please?"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was about to yell again when Agatha watched the life drain out of her. And if there were any doubts, misconceptions or mistakes how Rio broke into her apartment? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She fucking did.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned and Rio felt her life flash before her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Busted, disgusted, never to be trusted" Agatha weakly sang the rhyme.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Tongue in cheek, fists clenched into tight balls of fury- Rio was close to kicking the grass and dirt directly into Agatha's mouth to shut her up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Look who's talking” Rio muttered, nodding to the gate with a stronger, “Now get off your ass and get walking"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Awe, honey! We're both poets and we don't even know it" Agatha smiled wide, irritating every nerve in Rio's body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fucks sake. How did I ever even like her at all? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Agatha-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wait, wait, wait, </span>
<em>
<span>waitwait, wait, wait!"</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha held her hand up. "Before you call the cops-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Too easy" Rio laughed. "Much rather kick you out myself"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh good, I don't want to press charges either. That'd be an awkward day in court for us. Can you imagine?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was astonishing to Rio how quick Agatha was able to slip back into her annoying, irritating, aggravating self. Even through her obvious physical pain, how she was balling her fists and holding tears back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If Rio wasn't so angry, she'd be impressed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That judge would have a field day with us. Two psychotic women breaking into each other's homes. Oh, it'd be one for the books” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Get out”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But honey-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop calling me that” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine. Sweetheart-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha. I swear-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Swear to break in again? Swear to be break in partnership? Who's turn is it next? Do we break into each other's classrooms? Cars or-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Enough! You shouldn't even be here” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmm, not something expected from a woman who broke into my apart-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know what?!” Rio yelled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman stormed back inside, leaving Agatha alone to wonder if she was locking her out again. Which was fine. Agatha's hand moved to grab her phone, but-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her phone was in the car. She was trapped in Rio's yard on the grass. Most likely locked out, left to be outside for the entire night. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Huh. Never been in this situation before. One for the books.. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha thought to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Though, Rio came flying back out as soon as she left. Agatha looked back over with a sigh of relief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh good, you aren't leaving me here to- </span>
<em>
<span>Whatthe?!”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The edge of a photo nearly clipped Agatha's chin. It dropped on her chest, a suicide bomb Agatha never expected. Though when she flipped the image over-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Billy..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Suddenly the young man wasn't seen as a hero to pick her up from Rio's yard. But more so the villain she was plotting a murder for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Explain that! You want to fake this injury, break into my house. Explain. That!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The photo was of herself laughing with the date Billy had set her up with. Well, attempted to. It didn't turn out like that at all. However, the photo couldn't show that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed back up on her elbow, shaking her head frantically as the humor she was holding onto drained from her completely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"No, no" She rushed. "Rio, that's not-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Laughing it up with her all while I'm back here freaking out-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Freaking out is an understatement" Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Bad move. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Really?!" Rio exclaimed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Shit, sorry- Sorry! Shouldn't have said that, but" Agatha sighed, shaking her head. “To be fair..you really-"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Are an asshole? Yeah. </span>
<em>
<span>You are.</span>
</em>
<span> I'm well fucking aware"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, holding the photo in the air. "Well you're unaware of this. You've got the story wrong"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, do I?” Rio asked. Arms crossed tight, head tilted as she aggressively nodded. “Tell me then. What's the </span>
<em>
<span>story</span>
</em>
<span> because this looks like you on a fun little date” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, but Rio wasn't finding anything about this funny. Another bad move, but Agatha quickly pushed it off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We weren't on a date. She was the only woman my age there and I was telling her as well about Billy being pulled over for speed-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“HA!” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio cackled. “That's a fucking lie!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It isn't!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Billy getting pulled over? Really, Agatha? He is just learning how to curse lately"</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, shaking her head violently as she pushed to sit up off her elbows. A hand running through her hair as she tossed the photo to Rio's feet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm not lying. Yes, Billy set us up on a blind dat-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That you agreed to?" </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Blind</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio. I had no idea” Agatha said. “She didn't want to be on it either and I spent the rest of the trip basically hiding on the couch” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mhm, sure. Is that why you couldn't answer me at all? I thought you were busy” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know what? Save it, Agatha. Just get out. I don't care if your ankle, foot, whatever your issue is hurts. Just, </span>
<em>
<span>get out!”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down, hand rubbing over her face as she nodded. Rio went to walk away, turn and not watch Agatha leave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck” Agatha gasped as her body collapsed back down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hated herself. Agatha was clearly hurt, unable to hold herself up and she didn't know how to </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> help her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She should help her to her car. Either call someone to pick her up or force her to drive herself out of here. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However when Agatha tried to push herself up again and failed- Rio couldn't do it. She couldn't let Agatha go home alone. The woman knew damn well she wouldn't go to urgent care on her own. Billy would most likely take her, but only if Agatha didn't scare him into letting her go home. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then what? She was on her own, risking a worse injury and- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fucking hell, I shouldn't care.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio did though. She cared way too fucking hard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jesus..” She muttered before charging over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up, showing a bit of panic as she rushed the words- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm trying here, alri- </span>
<em>
<span>RIO!”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio wasted no time to loop one arm under her legs, the other supporting her back as she scooped her off the grass. Agatha's arms were quick to wrap around her neck, holding on tight as if Rio would let her fall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She never would let her fall. Ever. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The younger woman knew Rio hit up the gym a few times a week. She'd nearly manhandle her in bed at times. But being carried like so? Maybe it was the small time apart or just the fact Agatha still found Rio to be the hottest thing on earth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Holy fuck.</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha could drool over this alone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky jumped from his small bed in the living room as the two entered. Agatha was about to say something when Rio dropped her onto the couch, not letting her gracefully sit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Better than the grass, I guess…</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky jumped up on the couch next to her. Panting with his tongue out to the side, tail wagging like he was his own helicopter. Agatha couldn't help but focus on him for a few seconds. Too busy ruffling his hair, whispering a small greeting to notice Rio lifting her leg up. Only when it dropped on the pillow did she hiss, whipping her head over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Could've been a bit more gracious with the drop here” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"You're lucky I'm not leaving you outside to rot" Rio muttered. "I should, by the way”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio began working on untying the boot. She didn't look up at Agatha. Focused on making sure her ankle was elevated, careful to not apply pressure as she undid the laces. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha held Nicky close as she watched, stunned by the change of events. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was crouched down, lips pulled back as she handled her with care. From the aggressive greeting, rough handling to carry her inside, swiftly becoming the softest version of a caretaker Agatha had ever seen before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not even a nurse in a hospital would be treating her with this level of kindness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The boot slipped off. Agatha hissed and held onto Nicky tighter. She swore she heard Rio mumble a few apologies, but didn't press on her to admit they were there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio put her shoe aside, looked up with silent eyes that warned Agatha her sock was next. She didn't nod, but there was an understanding between them both. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her eyes then turned back, pushing her pant leg up to the mid part of her shin. Agatha hated the goosebumps that visibly showed. How Rio's fingers were cold to the touch, yet set her skin on fire from a simple touch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The pain distracted her from any pinch of arousal. Agatha was silently thankful for that. Though her heart sank as the sock slipped off. Swollen, a shade of a dark bruise already forming at a slow pace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Though what scared her was the fact it was immediate. Only a few minutes ago did she fall and her ankle already looked busted. She hated urgent care, hospitals, doctors, any medical environment of the sorts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was already shaking her head. “It's fine” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hummed. “I don't think-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! It's fine” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The older woman looked up from her ankle, meeting the panicked filled eyes staring wide at it. At that moment, Rio didn't see the smug, annoying, cocky woman from before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This was Agatha. The vulnerable version Rio had access to. The woman she had grown to love, care for, and even through her anger and pain..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio placed her hand on Agatha's leg, thumb drawing soothing circles. “We don't have to go anywhere” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha met her eyes. Rio's heart broke at the sight of unshed tears, a wall of them built but held at bay. Her bottom lip was quivering, cheeks pale in a sudden flush of sickness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think this is just a sprain, really,” Rio said. “Wanda used to get them all the time. Never really needed urgent care or anything” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat, wiping under her eyes quick to make sure no tears rolled down her cheeks. She cleared her throat, pushed her shoulder blades back with a shake of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What makes you so sure?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sometimes, it was crazy to Rio how versatile Agatha was. One second her voice was small, the next she was back to her rough attitude filled self. It was impressive to say the least. Though if Rio were Agatha, she'd be exhausted at the constant switch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pushed up from the floor, stuffing Agatha's sock in her boot before putting it aside. She then moved to bring Agatha's other leg up to rest on the coffee table as well, working on untying it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You're not some doctor” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, you want to go see one?” Rio asked, looking up at her. “We can get your shoe back on and head out” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hid a bit in her spot, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then why are you questioning me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you being nice to me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio squinted her eyes, trying to figure out what Agatha's motive was right then. Did she not want to be here? Should Rio call Billy to come get her? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sighed. Agatha was in pain. Rio had to remember the woman when anxious was a lightswitch that flipped back and forth. One day, she'd look into why that was. The science behind it, maybe pick at her personality a bit more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But for now, Rio had to focus on her. Make sure she was safe and knew Rio wasn't out to harm her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Unfortunately, I don't hate you” Rio said. “Now, can I continue with untying your shoe or do we call an ambulan-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No” Agatha said in a panicked tone, but then settled with a shrug as if she wanted to appear fearless. “Continue” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hummed, focusing back on her shoe again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This time it was silent between them. Rio handled her with care while Nicky snuggled into Agatha's side as if he could sense her fear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Which, Rio knew he most likely could. The boy was always her emotional support. Unsurprisingly, he'd be the same for Agatha as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her shoes were put aside while Rio made sure once again her ankle was properly elevated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ice and painkillers are your friends tonight” Rio said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Woo-hoo” Agatha muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio couldn't hide the amused smirk on her face, but luckily Agatha didn't see it. She was glaring at her ankle, clearly stuck in her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And as soft as Rio was treating her? She couldn't refrain or hold back the comment- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, if you didn't jump my fen-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You broke into my place first” Agatha snapped her eyes up at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snickered. “Didn't have to jump your fence though” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You still!-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha went to argue back, but it was Rio who started laughing. The younger woman glared, head tilted as she felt anger rush through her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know you're playing caretaker right now, but you laughing at this is pretty low” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “I mean, it's deserved. The whole lie about Billy-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It isn't a fucking lie!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Regardless!” Rio exclaimed. “Do you not hear us right now?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha fell silent, eyes squinted as she tried to figure out what the woman was saying. Maybe if her ankle wasn't throbbing and anxiety skyrocketing, she'd be able to keep up. But instead, she was at a loss for words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you talking about?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We broke into each other's apartments, Agatha” She said. “And we're bickering over that. This is…</span>
<em>
<span>insane</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took a second to think it over. Logically, she knew this was crazy. They were both out of their ever living, fucking minds. She'd dated some lunatic, off the wall, questionable women in the past. Had been a psychotic ex herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But this? Agatha snorted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You did it first” She mumbled. “And you still have the key as evidence-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“At least I can still stand on two feet” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up with an amused smile. Her reply was cool, swift and filled with humor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you saying you're a better criminal than me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “Intruder is the correct term” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, so the science professor is trying to correct </span>
<em>
<span>me?</span>
</em>
<span> Of all people?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Am I wrong?” Rio asked. “You are the one who focuses on partying in the classroom rather than learning” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh here we go again!” Agatha rolled her eyes with a laugh. “Your classroom is not a sacred place for church or a courtroom. All serious and boring-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess I'll just have to break into yours to fix the nightclub, party warehouse atmosphere” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh and who says residence break in talent equals classroom abilities as well?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you just call me talented?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They stared at each other with a little bit of glimmer in their eyes. Both smiling and even if they were small grins…they were visible. Seen by the other and made aching hearts swell again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The two may have been at odds, in a fight, at each other's throats and wondering if this was all the end. But at that moment, something shifted. The air wasn't as thin. Tensions weren't running as high and life threatening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was hope in the dark tunnel both had found themselves in. Between Rio not letting Agatha go home alone, being able to still joke and poke fun at each other. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The love was there. It was a bit buried, still had to be uncovered and rebuilt. Yet, both of them felt shivers down their spine. Agatha had to look away to hide the red flush in her cheeks while Rio's tongue swiped the inside of her cheek, looking around the room with a small shake of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Snapping Agatha out of the soft moment was another wince. Rio's head snapped over the second she heard it. Agatha had shifted her ankle on the pillow. Most likely forgetting she had injured it for a moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio held her breath for a second before asking a soft, yet stern,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Think you can manage to sit and keep quiet while I grab you, your new friends?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, looking up with a forced grin. Rio could see the pain and how Agatha tried to hide it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do I even get a sticker for being so brave?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, you get a get out of jail free card-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You broke into my place first!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you have no evidence of that” Rio grinned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You hold the key and I have an eye witness” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your eye witness is an old woman and for all you know, I flushed the key” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mrs Hart is a sane woman! Unlike </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, sprained ankle. Whatever you need to tell yourself” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, head tossed back as Rio left the room laughing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I hate you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“All the ladies jump over my fence when they hate me!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“All the crazy bitches break into my apartment!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her heart swell as Rio's laugh echoed through the house. She turned back around, looking down at Nicky who had his head asleep in her lap. Her fingers traced over his ears, down his back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She leaned close to his ears, whispering a gentle, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don't think your mama hates me. Do you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He snored, Agatha grinned. That was enough for her to nod and add a small, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agreed” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>

<span>Maybe there's hope after all…</span>

When we just shared a bed?"</em>
</p>
</blockquote><hr/><p>
<span>“Go on, buddy” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha heard the soft voice drift through from the kitchen. The smell of strong coffee followed, waking her up more than she was before. </span>
<span>It took a few seconds for the woman to remember where she was. The familiar living room, comfortable atmosphere, Rio's voice and Nicky's paws tapping against the floorboards. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The realization should freak her out. Snap her awake, strike fear into her. Though, none of that existed. Agatha was too busy trying to remember when a fleece blanket covered her body. She couldn't recall falling asleep either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>None of that mattered the second the instant ache, throbbing sensation came out of its own slumber as well. Agatha hissed, readjusting on the couch with her eyes squeezed shut. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit, shit” She whispered to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Right, her ankle. Agatha almost forgot that was the entire reason Rio had allowed her to stay the night. More so, didn't give her a choice. Not that Agatha had any complaints. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She managed to move her legs off the couch, pushing herself to sit upright with another painful, suffocated whimper. Careful to not alert Rio in the next room. Agatha already knew the lecture she'd get for mov-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Wait till she leaves. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha quickly thought to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio would be frantic, overbearing, suffocating her if Agatha dared to walk to the bathroom on her own. Agatha knew she meant no harm, but after last night? The grogginess, pain, she felt that second? Agatha didn't need someone breathing down her neck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She checked the time on her phone, seeing Rio was due to walk out the door in the next twenty minutes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I can wait. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha told herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Like clockwork, footsteps entered the living room from the kitchen. Agatha looked up to see Rio as her Professor Vidal self. No more baggy hoodie and boxers. Now clean, put together in a-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“New outfit?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio jumped, looking over her shoulder as she reached for her boots. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had to swallow the lump in her throat, refraining herself from drooling on the spot. Rio looked </span>
<em>
<span>frighteningly good. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From the tight pair of black pants that clung to her hips, legs, all the right places. A dark green shirt with the sleeves rolled up. The top three buttons undone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her hair was held back in a hair clip, makeup dark to bring the brown orbs to life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What about it?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's mouth was dry, lips parted as her brain malfunctioned. This was typical when Rio strutted down the halls. The times Agatha could see through her door how she ruled a classroom. Hand in the air, the other in her pocket while walking around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And yet? Agatha felt more stupid than she was before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh,” Agatha cleared her throat, shaking her head. “Nothing..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before Rio could push or tease her on it, Agatha went to move- Instantly hissing a strong, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit! Shit-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Easy” Rio dropped her boots, rushing over to help. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She lifted Agatha's leg gently to return it to the same pillow from the night before. Propped up on the coffee table, elevated perfectly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not any better today, I take it?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “How could you tell? Idiot..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirked as she pulled Agatha's pant leg up, checking the damage to see it a darker shade of purple- nearly a dark gray or black. It was swollen, a sprain stronger than Rio ever managed to have. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You sure I just sprained it?” Agatha asked. “Not a break?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio huffed a little laugh, but Agatha didn't react. Her eyes were glued on the injury. The pair nearly bulged out of their socket, clearly scared and fearing the worst. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She softened, rolling the cuff of Agatha's pant leg to keep it above. Just enough so when Rio returned with the ice pack, it could sit below it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, it's a sprain. I told you that last nigh-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But what if you're wrong?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her tone was filled with attitude, but Rio didn't take it personal. She sighed, hands on her hips with a shrug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you want to go to the ER to find ou-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I'm sure it's a sprain” Agatha muttered quick, slouching into the couch with her lips pursed in a pout.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hinted at a smile, struggling to hide it. Agatha was adorable. In pain, but still cute. Especially because Rio knew she'd never show this vulnerable, scared side of herself to anyone else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After everything the last week or so had brought on- Rio still had access to the </span>
<em>
<span>real </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha Harkness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Like I said, Wanda had them all the time. Twisted, sprained, all her forte” Rio shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled. That familiar light switch of a personality flickered again. Vulnerable to humorous in just a quick beat. Rio always wondered why that was. </span>
<em>
<span>How</span>
</em>
<span> she was that way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was a wonder of things to Rio, but more so a mystery case she'd never get tired of finding the pieces to. Another reason Rio was so addicted. Not only her love, but intrigue as well remained strong. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that why she's gay then?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused, head tilted with an eye roll. “What? No, it doesn't work like tha-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you think each time she twisted it- Her sexuality went from straight to gay, straight to gay, and she just landed on gay?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's hand had flicked left to right each time she said </span>
<em>
<span>‘straight to gay’</span>
</em>
<span>. Then right after, she looked up with an innocent face matching a tiny grin. Yet still able to look serious as can be. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio took in a deep breath, forcing herself to shake her head while bringing her hand over her mouth- hiding the little smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You're so fucking stupid” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. This time a louder one, but it still sounded exhausted. Rio found herself wondering how Agatha slept. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Did the pain keep her up all night? Was she uncomfortable? Had Rio made the right decision by keeping her there for the night? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her laugh cut short, hiding behind the back of her hand- Eyes squeezed shut had betrayed trying to hide the next wave of pain that seethed through her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'll be right back. Getting you some pain meds and an ice pack”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh yay, my friends” Agatha cheered in a monotone voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, making her way back to the kitchen. Nicky walked through the backdoor, not stopping as he bolted for the living room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Easy with her Nick-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“OOF!” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha groaned with a laugh that settled Rio's fear. “Good morning, baby boy” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha greeted in a warm voice. No longer sounded in pain, teasing tone, none of it. And as Rio popped the bottle of Tylenol open, she couldn't ignore the swelling ache in her chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her mornings had been quiet, too silent for her liking. Even with an energetic dog like Nicky. This only made Rio realize what she already knew, but confirmed it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was her noise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She missed hearing the two have their tiny morning talks. Rio missed when Agatha would hum in the morning or be grumpy and complain it was too early to be up. She missed Agatha taking up half her space, bickering over the bathroom, being in the way and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</em>
<span> Rio missed Agatha (</span>
<em>
<span>Duh</span>
</em>
<span>). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed the ice pack, wrapping it in a hand towel before bringing them back to Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The exchange was silent between them. Agatha took the two pills, grabbing her water bottle from her side. Rio crouched down, gently placing the ice pack over her ankle- Whispering soft apologies as Agatha hissed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Too cold?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head. Rio nodded, pushing back up with a sigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The moment was silent as Rio moved to grab the TV remote, her laptop and a charger for it. Agatha gave her a questioning look, but was able to answer Rio's stare without needing to hear it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia will-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm moving my classes online right now” Agatha grumbled as she opened her emails to do so. “So bossy..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Saving your ass from the wrath of Lilia? Oh, I know. Poor you, my love” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The little name rolled off her tongue before she could catch it. Both froze, but Rio ran away from the moment before it became anything else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slipped on her boots, making sure her bag and keys were together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'll leave the backdoor open for Nicky” Rio said, making her way to the kitchen to grab her coffee. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now, Rio made it clear to herself when she started the coffee machine that morning- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Only coffee for me. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was petty, but Rio was struggling to not easily cave back into Agatha's arms. By making Agatha coffee, she was catering to her completely. Not just being a caretaker with medication and a place to heal. That'd be luxury and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I'm not doing that. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio walked back in the living room, taking a show filled sip from the travel mug to try and brag. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That's where she fucked up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha's blue eyes turned from an annoyed stare into puppy ones. Where she was silently begging for coffee. Rio wondered if her hopes were up at the smell of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Nope. No. Don't give in. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'll be back later on” Rio said, snatching her bag and tossing it over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She grabbed her keys, looked back to see Agatha with her head down. Lips frowning in a small pout, arms crossed against her chest as she waited for Rio's laptop to load. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes, silently hating herself before charging over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here” She muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The travel mug was held out, taken from her hand with a big smile and bright blue eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I thought you didn't make me one” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I didn't..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio watched as she took a sip, instantly smiling harder and relaxing deeper into the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You still have yours, right?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Well, there was that at least. She still cared for Rio to have her own. That being said, Rio knew if she told the truth- Agatha would give the coffee back and argue against it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So instead, Rio nodded. “It's in the car” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled. “Okay, good” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was no coffee in the car. Just a very shitty coffee maker in the break room on campus. Rio could make it work, but she'd have a horrible taste in her mouth all day because of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took another sip, smiling and </span>
<em>
<span>fuck! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Shit coffee taste was worth seeing Agatha happy. Rio absolutely hated herself at that moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Before you go, is Lilia having you sign some bullshit lately?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio moved to grab her keys, this time taking them off the table instead of just tossing them back. She was close to the door, about to leave when Agatha asked her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” She turned partially, fiddling with the keys. “You too?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mhm,” Agatha nodded as she took another sip. “I have no idea what it's about” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snickered. “Neither do I. Been too busy with yo- </span>
<em>
<span>Work</span>
</em>
<span> to uh,” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She scratched the back of her neck, cheeks burning as she rushed to hide what was about to be said.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Notice! No, uh-” Rio waved her hand with a shrug. “It's probably just something about her retirement party. Spring picnics start soon or-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. “No, I'm not doing those picnics again!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled. “Lucky for you, we may be able to use that injury of yours to get out of it” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>We?” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You did get hurt on my property” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I feel like you're just using me now” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, gotta’ pay me for being your caretaker somehow” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but squinted them a moment after as she started to type on the laptop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Again? Really? </span>
</em>
<span>Rio asked herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shook her head, cursing under her breath while she made a path to the bedroom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Again, Rio was catering to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Again, Rio was showing she cared. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her hand held out the pair of glasses Agatha left on the nightstand. The younger woman looked up, sighing in relief as she quickly slipped them on her nose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh,” She smiled with thankful eyes blinking up at Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Better?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“To see you with, my dear? Yes” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, making her way for the door once again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Glad you didn't break them” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Debated it” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, slinging the messenger bag over her shoulder. This time determined to leave without giving Agatha anything else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nicky jumped back on the couch next to Agatha, tucking himself in her side. Rio clenched her fists, jaw tightened. Not from annoyance at him, but over the sight of them together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hearing the pair was one thing. But watching Agatha kiss his head, him smile up at her like she was the sun, stars, all the universe combined?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm only letting you stay because of him, by the way” Rio lied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha kept her focus on him. Smushing his cheeks, scratching his head as she spoke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That's also why your Mama watches Saturday morning cartoons!” Agatha said in a baby voice, quick to add on, “Totally not because she wants to herself or-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay! I'm leaving” Rio announced, back turned while she charged for the door. “Have a good day you two- Nicky. Have a good day, </span>
<em>
<span>Nicky</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, shaking her head over Rio's poor attempt. The door shut behind her, leaving Agatha and Nicky alone for the day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your mom still loves me, hm?” She asked Nicky. “I think we still have a chance. Don't you, baby boy?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He licked her face, Agatha groaned while pushing his head and wiping her cheek off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hate when you do that!” She exclaimed. “You're annoying like your mother is, you know that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He only smiled brighter and Agatha couldn't help but laugh. Though it was cut off by her bladder aching, reminding her she needed the bathroom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was gone. Agatha was on her own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Here's to hoping I don't injure myself more…</span>
</em>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“Alright and remember please! Assignments submitted by midnight!” Rio called out as students packed up and left her room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It had been an exhausting day. Rio knew it was shit the second no coffee was available in the break room. Her head was pounding, temper short. It didn't help either that students had drained the life out of her all day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Some carried an attitude of their own. Others were upset when she marked them as late or didn't give their assignment the grade they hoped for. Which wasn't necessarily an every day occurrence. Especially for a Friday. Typically students were relaxed and quieter than usual. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For a group of college kids as well, Rio never thought this would be a problem. The short period of time she taught high schoolers? Absolutely. But this? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</em>
<span>Is all Rio could think. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She worked quick to pack her bag, wanting to get the hell out of there and hide away for the weekend. Even if Agatha was residing on her couch, well- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That wasn't actually an issue. Sure, Rio was still somewhat annoyed with her. But she couldn't deny the comfort it brought her knowing when she got home, Agatha was there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey Ri- Professor Vidal” Billy corrected himself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked up with tired eyes, seeing the young man stumble into her room with a nervous smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What's up?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I just wanted to make sure these got to Agatha” He held out a few magazines. “I always get extras and she takes them, so-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, no problem” Rio took them, shoving them in her bag before shaking her head with a quick- “Wait, no. Why would- Why do you think I would get these to her?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy turned, eyes showed he was struck with a bit of fear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, uh..” He stammered. “I heard Agatha did her classes through your Zoom account. So I just assum-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“She what?” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah..” He nodded. “It's been the talk on campus. You haven't heard?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No” Rio said through clenched teeth, shaking her head. “I have not </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> heard..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So I just assumed-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She hacked into my account or stole my laptop? Yeah. Agreed” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio aggressively closed her bag, slinging it over her shoulder with a sigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that all?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy nodded. “Yes, yes. Have a nice weekend, Professor Vidal” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She gave him a tiny salute, muttering in her mind how she was going to kill Agatha in her sleep. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>How did she not remember to log out? Did she not want to log out? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was busy in her mind, finding the key to her classroom on the carabiner when she heard papers being shuffled. She peaked up, seeing Billy reorganizing the stack of catalogs on plants Rio had on the table to the side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She scoffed, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do I have to call the cops on you to get you out of here? Or not a fan of holding cells-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She told you?!” Billy whipped around, eyes wide in a panic. “No! I never even made it into a holding cell. Just a ticket and I already paid it off!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stopped walking, head tilted as her lips parted in shock. </span>
<em>
<span>No. What? </span>
</em>
<span>Had Agatha actually told her the truth and Billy the goodie two shoes had actually been pulled over? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn't mean it! I- We were talking and the music was good and my foot just pressed harder than normal and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You actually got pulled over?” Rio smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As annoyed as Rio was with the day, Agatha using her account, and now how long it was taking to get out of her classroom for the weekend. This was too entertaining to ignore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So amusing, Rio forgot for a split second how Agatha's story about not cheating was true as well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes,” He looked down, running a hand through his hair. “But no, you don't have to call the cops. I'm-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Holy shit, kid. I was kidding” Rio snickered, gesturing for him to move. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He raced out the door, Rio followed as she shut it behind to lock it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know,” Rio sighed, stopping him from running away. “You're not a bad kid for getting pulled over” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, but-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snickered, turning to face him with a gentle smile. She crossed her arms, leaned against the door with a shrug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The only downside of that for you is you were with Agatha who will </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> let you live that down” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He nodded, hands on his hips while shaking his head harder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Only because she actually does adore you” Rio said. “We both know she got a thrill and will cherish it forever how she was the one with you for that” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The young man looked up with a tiny smile. “Is she okay, by the way?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio lost her smile, looking down, about to walk off when Billy rushed his following words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Between us, Rio- I mean, Profes-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just call me, Rio” She said. “It's okay to do that” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy's eyes widened. Rio hadn't ever outright told him </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>to refer to her as that. But, she was never one to be casual at work. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Professor Vidal was professional, took the work place as serious as can be. Yet lately, Billy, colleagues and students all noticed the tight strings that kept Professor Vidal together loosening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No one knew why, but Billy. He was closest to the truth. Both had slipped through the cracks of their shield enough for him to see through. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And to Billy? It was exciting being the only one to watch from the sidelines through binoculars the two enemies fall in love. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, </span>
<em>
<span>Rio” </span>
</em>
<span>He nodded. “You and Agatha have both hinted to me to…</span>
<em>
<span>something. </span>
</em>
<span>And I promise, my lips are sealed” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio squinted her eyes. “What are you getting at here?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He took in a deep breath, foot tapping while clearly debating running or staying put. Ultimately, the young man chose the second. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You said you'd get those magazines to her, she used your Zoom account. I'm just- Is she-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She sprained her ankle last night. She's fine, just being a pain in the ass patient on my couch right now” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There it was. Out in the open for one soul to hear. While the entire campus may have a clue by now, Rio could bandage that or yell at anyone who dared to try and talk about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yet, Billy was the odd one out. He now knew partial to the entire truth. While he only had little bits, this was a chunk Rio had placed into his hands to hold onto. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do not,” Rio pointed. “Say a damn word. Got it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn't that Rio was ashamed of Agatha. Neither truly discussed if they wanted to be out on campus as a couple or not. Especially now the answer wasn't clear. Were they together? Not together? Rio didn't know. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So for now, it was best that they remained a secret. Now, here's to hoping Billy would honor that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He quickly nodded. “Understood. Yes. Uh,” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He scrambled checking his bags and pockets with a mutter under his breath. One Rio couldn't quite make out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shoot. I left it at my place,” He sighed. “I have more photos for Agatha of our trip! Just printed them and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is it with that woman at a table?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Kate? Yes. How did you-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Burn them” Rio pointed, glare strong as her voice darkened. “</span>
<em>
<span>Never</span>
</em>
<span> let them see the light of day and </span>
<em>
<span>never </span>
</em>
<span>set Agatha up on a date again. Got it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy gulped, nodded as his voice wavered. “Noted, yes. Yes. Got it. Understand-stood!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She nodded, giving a soft smile to ease the blow of intimidation. To be honest, Rio scared herself a bit over the reaction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They weren't even officially back together and Rio was claiming Agatha as if she owned her. For a woman who kept telling herself there was no chance of falling back easily. Agatha wouldn't be able to win her back that quick. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She's mine. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That didn't work out well for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“See you Monday, kid” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio walked off, pulling her phone out and like clockwork- Agatha's name shined bright.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaTextOne" height="350" src="https://ia600902.us.archive.org/26/items/professors2/professors1.jpeg" width="300"/>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>"Jesus.." Rio muttered to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>There should be pure annoyance, frustration from her words. The multiple messages that were one after the other. While instead? She was struggling to not smile at each one. Rio could almost hear her voice, see the way she ruffled Nicky's hair before telling Rio he sent his greetings as well. </p><p>And then the next one popped up. One that made Rio laugh, stopping the second she heard herself. Rio looked around, making sure no one heard. Not that it'd be readily if they did, but the talk on campus was Agatha using her Zoom account. Now Billy knew they were <em>definitely </em>something more. </p><p>Rio shook her head, focusing back in on their messages. </p><p> </p><p>
<img align="middle" alt="AgathaTextTwo" height="350" src="https://ia600902.us.archive.org/26/items/professors2/professors2.jpeg" width="300"/>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I'm not following it. </span>
</em>
<span>Not out of defiance as much as Rio told herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She just didn't need a list when she knew what Agatha wanted. She knew which clothes to grab, her favorite blanket, along with her laptop and a few books. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In response, Agatha sent a final message. Some gif a cat dancing. Rio smiled softly, but still shook her head and rolled her eyes. Muttering a tired, but amused, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You're so fucking annoying” </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio put the car in park, thankful to be home and out of society for the weekend. The day was longer than Rio ever thought possible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she left campus, her hopes were up that things would be easier. But then? She had gotten to Agatha's apartment and suddenly was questioned up and down by Agatha's neighbor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“So uh, are you a friend of Agatha's?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio turned as she was unlocking the door. She shrugged. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I guess. Something like that, yeah. Why?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Well, she didn't seem particularly happy or…well, expecting that you were here the other day” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>The older woman was sweet. Rio could tell, but was she implying Agatha was upset with her? And more so, was she being seen or suggested as a criminal?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Everything is fine, uh…Ms-”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Sharon” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Sharon” Rio said with a nod. “Well uh, yes, Sharon. Agatha and I are very good friends. She's currently at my place right now” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh good, good..” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio had a weird feeling after the interaction. She texted Agatha to let her neighbor know to not call the authorities. Part of her expected to walk out in handcuffs, but thankfully that didn't happen. </span>
<span>On top of that, traffic on the way home was terrible. There was a car fire on the highway, leaving Rio stranded for nearly an hour when it only should've taken twenty minutes. If that, really. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Safe to say, her home was a beacon in a dark day. And the delivery guy on her front porch added to it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Thank fuck. She ordered food. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But as she undid her seatbelt, Rio noticed he was focused on texting instead of delivering the pizza. Stood still at the door, unmoving. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you just standing there?” She muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Right. Shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha probably hadn't gotten up to open the door. Rio stepped out of the car, grabbing her and Agatha's bag with a nod over to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How's it going?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Going alright,” The young man smiled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio put the one bag down, taking the box of pizza from him. There was a awkward silence in the exchange until Rio realized- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She reached for her wallet, assuming the kid was waiting on a tip. However when she handed him the five dollar bill, his smile turned into a worried frown. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, no. The total is actually-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She didn't pay?” She asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He shook his head. Rio rolled her eyes, asking what the total was before giving him the cash with a quick, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Keep the change”, muttered under her breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio opened the door, kicking Agatha's bag in- using the same foot to kick the door shut. Nicky ran up as always, greeting her warm, but this time more excited as he sniffed the pizza in the air. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She kicked her boots off, dropping her keys while walking through the living room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So much for ordering me dinner” Rio said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up from her phone, gesturing to it with squinted eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You're carrying in the pizza right now” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah and the delivery kid wasn't paid” Rio laughed while disappearing into the kitchen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, tilting her head back, raising her voice for Rio to hear her from the other room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I told them on the phone to tell him to go in my car, grab my wallet and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was in the middle of putting the box on the counter, dropping her work bag on the table when she realized what Agatha was saying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? No- Agatha!” Rio laughed in disbelief, shaking her head while grabbing plates for them. “Do you even hear yourself? You told them to allow a </span>
<em>
<span>stranger</span>
</em>
<span> in your car to grab your </span>
<em>
<span>wallet?! </span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha asked innocently. “My ankle fucking hurts! And I unlocked the door so he could-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That sparked something in Rio that had barely been set on fire before. While the day was weighing heavy on her. Between students, thinking about being the talk of the campus, pounding headache with an endless amount of traffic piled on top. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn't paying for the pizza that bothered her. If anything, that was just her teasing Agatha for it. But this was something else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was letting a stranger into her car, possibly into the house. Furthermore, Agatha had gotten up on her own to unlock the front door.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stormed back into the living room. Hands on her hips with wide eyes that screamed a loud, unspoken, </span>
<em>
<span>what the fuck?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You got up?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha paused, tossing her phone aside with a little laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well honey, the door needed to be unlocked and I do have a bladder that needs to be emptied every few hours so I don't get a UTI and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you an idiot?” Rio asked. “What would have happened if you fell?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you think anything through before being an idiot?! For Christ's sake, you can't even use your own Zoom account! Why am I even surprised you would be brainless about-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio caught herself. She stopped talking instantly, heart pounding while it started to drown to the pit of her stomach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was being harsh, an asshole really. But, Rio was angry. More so worried unlike ever before. Agatha could have seriously gotten hurt, a crazy intruder could have come in, and now the entire campus had an idea about them without Rio even knowing what was going on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes, letting out a slow breath as she shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, that was…uncalled for”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You think?” Agatha muttered, shaking her head. “I'm just going to call Billy. He'll come pick me up and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for her phone, but Rio leaned over and took it from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Give it-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He's out of town” Rio lied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? No he isn't. Don't lie to me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio put her phone on the mantle, turning around with arms crossed. Agatha shook her head, eyes narrowed with a little scoff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You can't keep me prisoner here” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged. “Then go. You unlocked the door to begin with”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha put her hands up before smacking them on the edge of the cushions. She pushed herself up, moved her legs down and just when she was about to try and balance on one foot- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Fucking hell..” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio muttered, rounding the coffee table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The older woman caught Agatha just as she tilted a bit too far and nearly fell sideways. It only made Rio more worried. Anxiety and thoughts raced through her faster than any car on a racetrack flew. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Did this happen earlier? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>How did she get up on her own? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why did I leave her like this? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great,” Agatha muttered. “Now, door is tha-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was cut off by her body being pulled to the right. Agatha double took, looking between the front door and Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you doing? The door is that way, idiot”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio wrapped an arm around her waist, forcing Agatha's arm to wrap around her neck. She didn't answer verbally. Instead pulled Agatha, causing her to hop on one foot at a slow pace. Not giving her a chance to go the opposite way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ri-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You aren't fucking leaving and I'm getting you to take a bath” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed. “What? Do I smell that bad?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio holds Agatha tight as they slowly tread down the hall. Her heart broke with each little gasp and hidden whimper Agatha tried to conceal. Luckily, the house wasn't large or even medium size by any means. Almost the size of a cottage, really. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned the light on, guiding Agatha to sit on the toilet lid while she turned to start the water. The room is silent besides the running water. Rio checked to make sure the temperature was hot just as Agatha liked it to be. Once it was steady, her head turned and she nearly fell herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had unbuttoned her top. She was just pulling her arms from the sleeves, revealing the purple lace bra underneath. As beautiful, sexy, the sight was? Rio did feel a bit bad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>That wasn't comfortable to sleep in..</span>
</em>
<span>She thought to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Cutting her thoughts off was Agatha pushing herself up, making Rio jump the two steps over quickly. Her hands held her shoulders, guiding the woman to sit back down with a sharp,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What does it look like?” Agatha muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re not leaving-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah cause I so stripy pants before going out in society”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh..</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let go, stepping back as she ran a hand through her hair. She took a moment to let the relief push the heavy weight of fear off her shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She isn't leaving.</span>
</em>
<span> Rio told herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well..” She shrugged. “I never know with you. Wild card and all”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, not offering a reply as she pushed up on her hands again. This time Rio rushed to help slip her pants off her hips. When her fingers looped under the silk pair of underwear, she felt Agatha tense up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instantly, Rio let go and took a step back. She squatted down to be just under Agatha's eyes. The blue pair wasn't looking at her, but toward the water instead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Fear, hesitation, it all shined bright as day. Rio pushed her tongue in her cheek, twiddling her thumbs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing I haven’t seen before, but…you can take a bath in your underwear if you're more comfortable that way” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, licking her lips before a small shrug. She pushed up again, a silent motive for Rio to take off her pants and underwear this time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And that's when Rio's fear came true. She pulled Agatha's clothes to her knees, eyes catching the giant patch of dark purple on her hip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio's heart stopped, instantly moving closer to the spot with a hushed, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I like the color purple. What can I say?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was clear Agatha had the defense, excuse, all prepared in her head. Ready to aim, fire, protect herself from the inevitable lecture. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. The bruise was dark, covering her skin. Her thumb gently traced over. Light enough to touch, but not applying a single amount of pressure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You fell earlier..I knew it” She whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “So?” She forced a laugh. “It's just a bruise, Rio”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not just that” Rio shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes. It is” Agatha argued. “I may need clarification on a sprained ankle, but I know a damn bruise when I see one” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head because it wasn’t just a bruise to her. It was more than that. An indicator of her worst fears that she was too selfish to acknowledge early on. As a matter of fact, at any point during her entire day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She started to overthink what could have happened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>What if she hit her head? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What if she was seriously hurt and I got back too late? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why didn't I stay with her? Make accommodations to help her and-</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t notice how her hands started to tremble or how her eyes were watering with unshed tears. But, Agatha did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She noticed her mind racing faster, harder. If there was a way for silent thoughts to make noise, Rio would have found it by now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, lifting a hand to use her two fingers to tilt Rio’s chin up. Their eyes met, a gentle second lingered between them before Agatha spoke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I am fine” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The younger woman couldn't let the vulnerable moment linger on. Something shifted, forcing her to gesture to the water with a quick,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now, stop the water before the tub overflows and we both fall”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn't because the moment was bad. She loved those soft, gentle, quiet moments with Rio. Where the love was overflowing and it was only them in the entire world. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, Agatha's fears sparked enough to force the switch in her to chance. It felt foreign to have someone care for her to that extent. Sure, Rio had shown signs of it and clearly loved her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Yet..this was different. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had </span>
<em>
<span>always </span>
</em>
<span>taken care of herself. Every injury, sickness, it was on her. Even if someone else happened to be around, they were more focused on being helpful for their ego or just to say they did so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Rio? </span>
<em>
<span>Whoa..</span>
</em>
<span>Agatha thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The younger woman saw an entire movie, saga, filled with fear and what if scenarios play in Rio's mind. Even if she was an asshole in the living room minutes prior, Agatha could see why. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Is she used to caring about someone like this? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Does she want to care about me still? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wondered, but her thoughts were cut off by Rio wrapping her arm around her. Gently whispering a soft, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ready?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, both counting to three together before Agatha stood up. Rio guided her into the tub ever so gently. The younger woman noted her smile as she sighed while the hot warm swallowed her whole. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fucking hell..” Agatha muttered, settling in with her eyes closed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not too hot?” Rio asked. “Or too cold?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked. “Goldilocks approved” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, shaking her head. “Don’t move. Can you manage to do that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was in the middle of clearing her throat when she dramatically stilled. Arms in the air, head frozen, clearly putting on a show. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The older woman muttered something incoherent under her breath. She hid the amused smile, shaking her head while turning around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re fucking insufferable” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can’t. Talk” Agatha said robotically. “Still. Statue. Frozen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jesus..” Rio muttered.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She left the room, focusing on getting them their pizza and two glasses of wine. Well, almost. She ended up ditching the glasses and took just the half empty bottle instead. Instead of plates, she grabbed the box. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just as Rio was turning, her phone sat and stared up at her. Agatha's fall, stubbornness, it all played in her mind as she realized-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I can't leave her. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was only the weekend and Rio was stressing over leaving her home alone again. She sighed while putting the food and drink down, picking up her phone to send a quick email saying how all classes would be online for the next week. Enough time to get Agatha through the worst of it and set her up for the following days. However long it took for her to heal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio then nodded to herself, feeling a bit easier as she grabbed their dinner again. Agatha wasn't going to fall. Not only her watch, anyway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Rio made her way back in the bathroom, Agatha looked over and went back to being frigid. A dramatic pose, one that made Rio snicker without even trying to hide it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ha, ha” Rio said in a monotone voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You found it funny though”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because it was painfully unfunny” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That doesn't make sense”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So? A lot of things you do don't make sense. Including making me eat my dinner in the bathroom” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. “What? I'm not making you do anything by staying still in hot water” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio put the slice in her mouth, taking a bite while talking through her chew, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, ‘ou cont’ ‘e trusted alone” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “Just admit you want to wine and dine while watching a beauty bathe in your tub” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio turned, offering an amused glare while handing a piece of pizza to her. Agatha took it with glee, smiling wide as she thanked her softly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The room stilled, a quiet gentle atmosphere rested upon them. Neither needed to say a word to break the ice, being there was no tension to break. Even in the midst of an unexplainable relationship. Where they were at each other’s throats, but unable to constantly be angry or separated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>An unspoken bond had been formed. One fueled by love that couldn’t slip away that easy. And maybe that’s what freaked Rio out the most. How one moment she was on her own. She didn’t need a lover, another person in her life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sure, it had gotten lonely. However, she was safe. No harm or fears on the horizon. But now? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Rio moved to sit on the edge of the bathtub, back resting against the wall, not caring if the humidity would make the back of her shirt damp. Her eyes peaked up to see Agatha on the other end. She was finishing off the last bite of her crust. Eyes closed, peaceful. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The water line was just under her collarbone. Hair untouched, but droplets of water trickled down her neck. It stunned Rio how beautiful Agatha was. This hadn’t been the first time she noticed, but again- It was different.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What if we rushed into this?” Rio blurted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The question whispered in one breath had rolled off her tongue, taking herself by surprise. She felt guilt suffocate her as the blue eyes snapped open, worrisome and struck with a sense of doom. </span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio didn’t want and hadn’t meant to do that to her. But, she couldn’t control or refrain from asking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Was it to protect herself? Make Agatha question everything about them as well? The younger professor seemed so confident constantly. Little blips of vulnerability slipped through the cracks of her tough exterior. Yet, she stood tall and Rio somewhat envied it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Into what?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There it was. The little secret of her sensitive side shining bright. Rio had done that. She brought it out of her and the woman had a love/hate relationship with how she held the ability to do so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They were too far in for Rio to backtrack, peddle, reverse and drive herself off the cliff from this. Agatha wouldn’t let her run off. Even if she had a brutally sprained ankle, Agatha would follow and take every fall to catch Rio- force the topic of discussion out of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio cleared her throat, shrugging as she looked down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Us. This” She said. “I mean, I hated you for years” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “You thought I was hot though” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked back up, eyes that told Agatha she was serious. The smirk her lover wore only lasted a few seconds after that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t be so smug” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As her smirk faded, Agatha whispered a soft, fear filled question herself,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you saying?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you regret the last few months then?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her answer was short, fast. As if it was a reflex, knee jerk reaction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The comfortable tension started to tighten. A rubber band being pulled, threatening to snap at any given moment. Rio started to hate it. A sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach. Her chest was clenching. Suddenly the humid room felt too small for two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, going to stand as she mumbled a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Forget it”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha copied the same answer as Rio seconds prior. She held her hand out, eyes glaring, “Sit” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ag-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you dare leave this room, I will follow” She warned. “Pain and all, you’re not leaving”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio subtly smiled in her mind. Not over the threat, but how she predicated Agatha’s reaction perfectly. With the idea of her falling, injuring herself more- Rio relaxed in her spot the best she could. A posture that told Agatha she wasn’t going anywhere. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha coughed a low, </span>
<em>
<span>ahem, </span>
</em>
<span>earning Rio’s attention. Her fingers wiggled, pointing at the wine bottle. Rio quickly opened the cap for her before passing it over. She watched as Agatha took a generous sip, letting the rim of the bottle rest on her lips for a few seconds- Taking the second swig with a nod. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“K’..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She whispered, putting the bottle on the floor before running hands through her hair. Agatha tapped her fingers against the base of her skull, scrunching her nose, tilting her head side to side before sitting taller. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then, she tossed in the air between them a fast sentence. One rushed as if she worried herself she’d fail to get the words out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“As much as we both hate it- We have to talk…so-”</span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>She reached down again, grabbing the bottle of wine and held it up for Rio to take. A forced smirk, yet relaxed at the same time. Rio could read the fear and hesitation behind it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Liquid courage, baby” She rasped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</em>
<span>Rio adored her. How could she not?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The way her voice was hoarse, tone low. A sexy rasp that’d never fail to send chills down her spine. It reminded her of early mornings. When Agatha was groggy, rubbing her eyes and mumbling complaints. For the grump she was, Rio felt far too fond of that and missed easy, blissful moments like those. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. Not only at Agatha, but herself. She shouldn’t be scared of this. The woman was a fucking adult for crying out loud and being in love still scared her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Pathetic.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She took the bottle of wine, raising it to take a lingering sip herself. A little rush ran through her at the realization hitting her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha’s lips were just- </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio jerked the bottle away, not focusing on if it was obvious or not. She put it back on the sink counter, picking at the hangnail off her thumb right after. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The quiet didn’t last as long as she hoped for. Agatha was impatient, quick to push buttons and didn’t think through her words like Rio would. </span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>A blessing and a curse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you really hate me? Do you still?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>“I don’t..” Rio whispered, but then pulled her lips back with a subtle shrug. “But..I thought I did” She whispered. “I mean, you annoyed the shit out of me. Still do” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hinted a little smirk. “But you like it”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re so full of yourself” Rio rolled her eyes. Her voice warm enough to soften the tension. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you like that too” Agatha smiled. “But..continue”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio then had the floor, but for what exactly? To go into more detail how she hated her? Or, question if this was all worth it, possibly rushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her mind drifted to the first part. She remembered how envious, jealous at times in the beginning Rio was of her. Agatha entered the university and became a force to be reckoned with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She held confidence stronger than anyone Rio had met. Her classes gained popularity higher than what they’d seen before. Everyone fawned over her, wanted to be in her orbit while Rio was on the outskirts questioning everything about her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The jealousy for her career didn’t last long. Rio was content with her own. She loved her job, students, her classroom was a second home and no one would take that from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>However, everything else about Agatha was…frightening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was never one to feel an urge to be with the others. She didn’t flock with the sea of birds surrounding the new shiny toy. With Agatha though? Rio stood on her tip toes to get a glimpse from afar. Hidden stares that were poorly disguised as disgusting glares. It became obvious over the years too, Agatha noticed her. </span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>And maybe that’s what started to scare her more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s stares and glares were met with little smirks, fingers wiggled while Agatha would mouth ridiculous flirts. It felt teasing, but not in a romantic way. To Rio, Agatha was taunting her. Making a joke, making fun of </span>
<em>
<span>her. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha would gift her stupid shit. From that cactus with the note how she was a prick to markers that were ran out of ink with a note, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“You can toss these for me. Thanks!” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was all juvenile, annoying and didn’t help Rio’s wondering if this was some weird bully. Yes, </span>
<em>
<span>bully. </span>
</em>
<span>Even as an adult she wondered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Old habits die hard..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Maybe part of her fear that this was too quick originated from all of those things. Was this a taunt, a long trickful play that would blow up in her face at the end? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You gave me hell..” Rio whispered. “How could I not hate you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha held her breath, clearly conflicted with what reply to give. Rio took the floor and continued standing in it, dominating the conversation more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The shitty gifts, teasing, it all-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Was stupid, I know” Agatha nodded, chin propped on her hand while her elbow rested on the edge of the tub. “I just..didn’t know how to get you to pay attention to me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio squinted her eyes. “What?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, looking down in disgrace. “It was juvenile. The little tricks and shit, I know”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It was..” Rio agreed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And I’m not defending it, but genuinely that was the only way my mind was telling me I could get you to see me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked back up and Rio saw it. The truth covered her from head to toe. No hiding the truthful sincerity, regret and embarrassment behind each word. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A stupid little crush, really” Agatha forced a little laugh, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stammered, struggling to find the words. “What do- I don’t get it”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What don’t you get?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean by my attention?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, shaking her head. “Just that. Your attent-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Was I untouchable or something? Unapproachable or-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You really don’t get it, do you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A few seconds of silence lasted, but Agatha wasn’t able to wait for Rio to reply. She sat up a bit more, head tilted while she rambled on, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you have any idea of how highly you are thought of, Rio?” She asked, not giving her a chance to reply. “So many students talk about how only the smartest ones get into your class. Colleagues admire you, look at you and see you as one of the greats”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re one of a kind. Some kind of rarity that only a few will ever have the honors of meeting in their lifetime” Agatha said. “You gave me a cold shoulder, but apparently that’s common coming from you. However, that couldn’t change what I thought..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled her lips back, biting down on them with a shake of her head as she stared at Rio in disbelief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why on earth would you ever pay attention to a professor like myself?” She asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Holy shit..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>While Rio always thought Agatha was cocky, smug, full of herself. Had she seriously been on the sidelines with this feeling? Did she really believe Rio was someone who looked down on her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>All this time while Rio was convinced Agatha judged her..there was more to it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you think I looked down on you?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snickered. “It was obvious, wasn’t it? You called my classes pointless parties, disrupting and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t understand your teaching style entirely and I probably never will, but..” Rio said. “Let’s be honest here..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She swallowed the nervous lump in her throat, foot tapping against the floor with her knee rapidly bouncing. A tick of her fear bleeding through. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why would you ever want to be with the strict, boring, professor?” She asked. “It’d always made more sense to me for you to be with someone…more like you” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head. A little laugh, but it wasn’t filled with humor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t get it” She said. “And you’re not hearing me”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m hearing you, but trying to get clarification and my side of it” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was infatuated with you from the get go, Rio. Sure, I messed up somewhat and didn’t know how to go about it. But..you were the only </span>
<em>
<span>professor </span>
</em>
<span>in that entire building who made sense to me”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How? You called me stuck up, boring, stubborn”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you never heard me when I complimented how you deeply care about your students, your work and-”</span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio scoffed. “When did you do that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Multiple times. In between insults and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, well-” Rio laughed. “Sorry, I was too busy tuning you out-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Exactly!” Agatha said. “The only way you ever heard me was those insults, shitty gifts, pranks” She said. “I didn’t know how else to get through to you that I wanted you” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio somewhat could recall the start of compliments, but they always turned into a joke. Yet looking back on those times. The look Rio knew now, how she was able to read every page of Agatha..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I really did intimidate her…holy shit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And Rio? You are not as stuck up as you think” Agatha chuckled. “Maybe you only believe it because you are wildly known as the stubborn one”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Exac-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let me finish” Agatha held her hand up to silence her. “That’s you at work, Rio. Your job as much as you may view it does not define who you are” Agatha added. “And as much as I became obsessed with a professor? That’s not who I fell in love with”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fell in love..</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>In love…</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio repeated the words in her mind, spiraling and drowning in them. Her heart started to pound, the fear of Agatha doing all of this out of some joke disappearing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But still,” Rio whispered. “I’m stubborn, like you said. Boring, all of it. So why should you be with m-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You have multiple lego sets hidden in the closet which I can not comprehend because it’d be adorable watching you build those. Your drunken voicemail confessed to hiding dinosaur boxers- Which, by the way? I bought you a few more pairs” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened, the fast pace rambling only picking up speed with every word spoken. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You have a routine of watching cartoons with your dog. You spoil the hell out of him too and even buy him sweaters and little hats. Don’t think I never notice how you and Wanda have a photoshoot for any new outfit you dress him in. You get giddy when I call you stupid little names. When you’re half asleep, you are the most clingy woman I’ve ever met. You cry at chick flicks, you squeal when you bring home a new plant-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took a breath, shaking her head as she drunkenly smiled as if listing things about Rio was intoxicating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re more than just a stuck up fucking stubborn, boring as hell professor, idiot” She whispered. “I barely started, by the way. I could keep going and all this would show is you make fucking sense for me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart was hammering now. A heart attack begging to happen. No one ever described her that way. Ex lovers barely paid attention to her, let alone everything down to the smallest details. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You may have spent years thinking that way, but just know I spent years myself thinking you’d never view me as anything but annoying and immature” Agatha smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shook her head a tiny bit, whispering under her tongue, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re insane, Harkness..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “You’re an idiot, Vidal” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>All of this. The confession, ramble, answers given for why things were said and done. And yet? There was still hesitation on Rio’s end. Agatha seemingly read it for what she added on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I waited three years, Rio..” She whispered. “I can wait more. If easing into this is what you need, so be it. I’m more than willing to be your friend”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Friends?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. “I don’t know how to just be your friend”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then we don’t have to call this anything” Agatha shrugged. “We’ll take it day by day”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down in shame, but Agatha was having none of it. She lowered her hand, splashing a bit of water at the older woman who jumped in response. A little laugh was on Agatha’s end. Especially when a glare was shot her way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop looking like I kicked your puppy-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You would never kick Nicky” Rio said, reaching over for the hand towel to try her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And I would never judge you for needing time..” Agatha said. “Maybe I need it as well. Maybe we both do” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio finished drying her face, lowering the towel on her lap. She looked up at Agatha, letting out a low sigh before whispering, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What if you find someone else?” Rio asked. “In the meantime, I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I am down for the count right now,” She gently raised her leg, but not enough to kick her ankle out of the water. “Sprained ankle and all. So..I’m not running anywhere” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio glared, not amused by the answer. Agatha snickered, finding herself funny as always. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio,” She sighed. “You’ve been on my mind and in my eyesight for years. Unfortunately, that isn’t changing”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Unfortunately..” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s true” Agatha shrugged. “For all the sexy professors in that building. The toughest, stubborn one had to be my favorite” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio squinted her eyes in disgust. </span>
<em>
<span>“All the sexy professors?”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned wide. She sat up, leaning close to Rio without thinking how her chest raised out of the water. Exposing the top part of her breasts. She didn’t miss the flicker of Rio’s eyes down before back up at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Between that and your jealous little tone about other professors? We can manage to be friends and not find anyone else for a bit” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio felt her cheeks burn, looking down before away. This time Agatha snorted, finding it funny how Rio struggled poorly to hide her lust. Yet, it was comforting to know that it was still there. Not going anywhere for the time being. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When did you become so…open?” Rio asked. “I think this is the most emotional speech I ever heard from you..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was shocked herself by the downpour of words herself. No one ever gave her the confidence to be this way. She never was able to find the right words, feel safe enough to even breathe them into the open. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But with Rio?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know..” She shrugged. “I guess disgusting love makes the unthinkable happen”</span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio smirked, shaking her head. “You’re a lunatic, Harkness” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you’re the same as me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sometimes” Rio said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now,” Agatha held her hand out. “Pizza me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Pizza you?” Rio snickered, opening the box by her side to grab a piece for her. “Would you like me to even feed you grapes, your majesty?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took the slice from her, taking a bite as she gasped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ooo, ‘oleplay ahead?” She asked, mouthful of food with her words. Eyebrows wiggled and caused a stir of butterflies in Rio’s stomach. “Keep that in mind” She winked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “I really fucking hate you” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ditto, toots” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They fell into the same comfortable silence from before once again. Rio took another slice to eat, both passing the wine bottle between them. Nothing needed to be said when it was all out in the open. They’d be friends, maybe not even that. Not labeling what they were felt safer to them both for some reason. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio knew one day, she’d do the same for her. The way Agatha gave an emotional, love filled speech- Rio wanted that. Maybe it’d be easier in writing, another lengthy text or voicemail. She’d think about it as time passed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For now though? She’d focus on gaining trust. Unknowingly, Agatha would have to focus on something herself. She gave an entire saga, ramble, but never told Rio how her walls had never been shattered before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha would use the time to learn how to feel comfortable with that. The fact Rio had access to her inside and out. Agatha had to come to terms with being a sucker, love drunk fool who would stop the world if Rio asked her to. She needed to be okay before going forward with being this new vulnerable person. Plus, accepting she was someone who could be loved. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was challenging enough to let Rio care for her. Sit in this bathtub, have someone rage over her stupiud antics from letting a stranger in her car then the house. No one ever cared or questioned Agatha’s impulsive, reckless decisions. No one ever cared if she fell or was sick, injured. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was always on her own, but that didn’t seem to be her future any longer. Unless she pushed Rio away, Agatha was determined to prevent that at all costs. When before in her life, she’d already be long gone. Agatha would have quit her job, skipped down, ditched Rio aside like she never existed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Things were changing. Maybe for the better, maybe for the worse. But both women knew they couldn’t risk losing whatever it was. Their love, bond, it had taken control and they either had to accept it, learn to work through it- Or, completely give up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Neither wanted the second.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey Rio..” Agatha broke the silence. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked up. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked a bit, picking at her food with a tiny shrug. “...You know I used your Zoom account on purpose, right?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused, watching the humor light up Agatha like a Christmas tree. Another little antic, prank. One of many that only made Rio shake her head over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean, I do know </span>
<em>
<span>how </span>
</em>
<span>to log out, but..” She shrugged. “I was bored” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio faked an annoyed sigh, but shrugged her shoulders in an nonchalant manner. If Agatha wanted to play this game. Two can play at once. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That's fine..” Rio pushed up. She started to walk out of the bathroom, but then snapped her fingers while whipping around. “That reminds me- Billy knows about us”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And with that, Rio watched Agatha’s smirk fade into eyes widened. As much as she loved Rio, spilled the emotional ramble- Rio knew Agatha would stress over someone (Especially Billy) knowing she was a sucker for love.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Billy would never shut up or let her live this down either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He knows </span>
<em>
<span>WHAT?!”</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, shutting the bathroom door behind her with a grin. The muffled sound through the door only made her laugh harder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Get back here, Rio!” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Be with you in a moment, sweetheart!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio started to put the leftover pizza in a ziplock bag to keep as leftovers. A smile was permanent, giggling as she heard Agatha grumbling curses and threats to kill her. She felt at ease Agatha was willing to go slow, day by day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But..one question remained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>How can I ever just be her friend? </span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>And in Agatha's mind while she was ready to curse Rio and Billy out both? It was worth the wait. <em>Rio</em> was worth it. Besides, there was the cliche saying,</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Slow and steady wins the race...</em>

<blockquote><p><em>"Ooh, baby. Sweet thang"</em></p></blockquote><hr/><p>Rio spent the following two weeks with classes online, working from her home office. Agatha argued with her on it a bit, but ultimately wouldn’t deny being in the same house as Rio made her feel better day by day.</p><p> </p><p>She worked in the dining room, glasses perched on her nose with her ankle elevated on the opposite chair. Their classes weren’t on the same schedule. So at times, Rio would walk in the kitchen and spot Agatha through the entryway. She’d resist a smile the best she could. See the way the woman was stuck in a chair, but still able to have the most alive presence. </p><p> </p><p>Her hands would be everything, arms flailing while speaking loud. She could hear laughter through the speakers. Her students still attached, hooked on every word and joked along with her. </p><p> </p><p>For the last few years, Rio only heard about Agatha’s classes. The muffled noise, laughter, music that sometimes played too loud for her liking. She never actually saw up close Agatha’s teaching style. Who she was ruling a classroom. </p><p> </p><p>Safe to say for the last few weeks? Rio Vidal was impressed. </p><p> </p><p>She knew Agatha took pride in her work and her students loved her. Rio somewhat had an idea why, but now she knew. She wasn’t a student herself and even if she hadn’t been falling in love with Agatha, she’d be mesmerized. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was a witch who caught your attention, kept you focused on her and nothing else. Hence why she did catch the university by storm and became one of the favorites. Rio’s favorite thing was how Agatha was able to playfully insult a student while lifting them up at the same time. </p><p> </p><p><em>“Now! Let’s do a little roleplay. Ryan! Yes you, deer in headlights, half asleep boy in the back with the snore louder than storm in Wisconsin” </em></p><p> </p><p><em>The class laughed, but Agatha didn’t let it last long before continuing. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>“Give me an improve speech. Any subject your sleepy little heart desires. Three, two, one-” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t listened to the student. Only focused on Agatha who was taking notes, eyes glued to the screen with a few nods as he spoke. When he started to stammer, pause in between words, Agatha snapped her fingers. </p><p> </p><p><em>“What happened?” She asked.</em></p><p> </p><p><em>The young man was stuttering through his reply. Agatha cut him off before he could finish. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>“You lost your confidence,” She said. “You let all these little pairs of eyes in tiny boxes on a screen intimidate you and lost sight of the point”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“No, don’t be ashamed. No pouting, frowning- What does that God awful dance teacher say? One in the wheelchair, went to prison?” Agatha asked. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>A student replied with the name. Agatha snapped her fingers, pointing at the screen. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>“Save those tears- You know what? No. I don’t like her. She sounds like a bitch teacher. I’m a nightmare, but not your worst like a convict. Anyway! Besides the point. Ladies because no one likes a man- You MUST never let the others intimidate you” </em></p><p> </p><p>From that point on, Rio spent her early afternoon lunch grading papers in the kitchen to watch Agatha teach. Only a few times did the younger woman look up, but had to control herself because her cheeks would burn red and she’d struggle to hide how giddy she became. </p><p> </p><p>However, as the first two weeks closed and Rio was due back to campus Monday morning- Agatha called her out on it. </p><p><em>“No extra audience during my second class of the day” Agatha sighed. “I’ll be bored. Maybe you can put a stand up cardboard of yourself to gaze at me?”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Rio scoffed, stirring the pasta on the stove. Agatha sat at the kitchen table behind her. In just a tank top, hair pulled back in a messy bun, glasses falling to the center of her nose. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>“I don’t gaze-”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“So you stare?”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“More so glare”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“Now is that anyway to look at a dear friend of yours?”</em></p><p> </p><p>The friend thing, yeah. They could laugh over ​​it. Neither wanted to admit how miserably they were failing at accomplishing that. </p><p> </p><p>Sure, they hadn’t kissed or slept in the same bed. That was because they were frequently falling asleep on the couch. Both blamed it on watching a movie or TV show late into the night. When in reality, neither admitted how they didn’t want to sleep apart from the other. Especially Rio who had been a bit over protective of Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>It didn’t help that Agatha refused to see a doctor. No medical attention for her ankle. Rio hovered over her more because of it and maybe it was a stupid idea? But that was part of the reason Agatha didn’t want to seek help. Not only her fear of any medical environment, but also Rio was constantly around her. </p><p> </p><p>She helped her walk, made her every meal, catered to her and sat in the bathroom with her when Agatha was in the bath (Which was ran by Rio). For two so-called <em>friends, </em>things felt like a domestic relationship between two lovers. </p><p> </p><p>Not surprising in the slightest, but neither did a thing to acknowledge they were not friends at all. </p><p> </p><p>Ultimately, Monday came too soon for Agatha’s liking. Rio’s as well. </p><p> </p><p>The older woman made Agatha a coffee and breakfast. Made sure the pain med schedule was written down, ice packs in the freezer were available. Agatha was luckily better with walking, but still had to take it easy and limit her movement. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was confident she wouldn’t be following that last part since Rio wasn’t home to make her. Which led her to ask Wanda to drop by around noon with lunch, hoping Agatha wouldn’t catch on to Rio being the reason she was there. </p><p> </p><p>Around noon that day, the door opened with a soft, </p><p> </p><p><em>“Yoo-hoo!” </em></p><p> </p><p>From the entryway. Nicky ran up, tail wagging with little whimpers of excitement. Agatha had just ended her first class of the day. A three hour one that took up her morning. She jumped over the entrance, leaning back to see Wanda striding through the kitchen with take out food in her hands. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, raising her glasses to sit on her head with a little laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“What? Did she seriously recruit you to spy on me?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda put the foot down, shaking her head while turning to ruffle Nicky’s fur. </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe I just wanted to see my special boy!” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, reaching over to see the food she brought. It was funny to her how unbothered she was from the intrusion. Typically, she didn’t like unannounced entrances. However, there was something about Wanda that didn’t bother her. </p><p> </p><p>And maybe it was related to Rio caring from afar. </p><p> </p><p>“So! How’s the ankle? I’m an expert in this area” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickered. “So I’ve heard” </p><p> </p><p>The redhead sat down across the table. The two grabbed their salads. Agatha pushed her laptop to the side, seeing a chicken caesar one for her. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, she sent you alright..” Agatha snickered. </p><p> </p><p>There was no way Wanda knew that was her favorite without Rio telling her. Not a chance. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda sighed, giving a little smile. “I’m sorry. Seriously. But, you know how she is..” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, taking a bite. She smiled at the taste. A salad from her favorite restaurant. Once again she knew, <em>this is all Rio. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry about it” Agatha said. “I wouldn’t want you to risk your life by going against orders”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda chuckled. “It is really insane to us what you’ve done to her” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows, waiting till she swallowed her food before asking, </p><p> </p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s more open, I’d say. Happier even” Wanda said. “I’ve never seen this Rio in my lifetime”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt butterflies tickle her stomach, swirling in a cloud of chaos. Her cheeks burned, looking down to hide the red brighter than Wanda’s hair. </p><p> </p><p>“I was hesitant, I’ll admit” Wanda said. “After the little…silence you two had-”</p><p> </p><p>“Shit, I swear- That won’t happen again” Agatha assured. </p><p> </p><p>“It better not,” Wanda warned. “I may be nice, but I know how to sprain two ankles and other bones as well” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stabbed at her food, losing an appetite as guilt swallowed her. The uncomfortable, stomach turning memory played again. Only a few weeks ago had she given Rio nothing but silence. Listened to those heartbreaking voicemails, prepared herself to lose her altogether. </p><p> </p><p>Everything felt like a fever dream, a nightmare that stuck with you for life. One you never were fully able to forget. Wanda must’ve seen the turn in Agatha. She worked quickly to change the subject back to a light hearted one. </p><p> </p><p>“And I know you two are…<em>friends,</em>” She snickered. “But, I have no fear of you taking my place. I am her best friend. I’m keeping that title”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked with a tiny snort. “Good because I’ll be frank- I don’t intend to hold that title” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you won’t. I’m shocked you still even have it” Wanda laughed. </p><p> </p><p>They were silent for a moment. Both focused on eating, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. Nicky was begging for food beside Wanda. She snuck him a few pieces of her lettuce. Agatha did make a little joke how he was definitely Rio’s dog for liking something plants related. Which led Wanda into a laugh about her garden. </p><p> </p><p>“Wait till she has this weekend off” Wanda said. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda smirked. “Her garden. She’s itching to get out there. You think she’s a freak now, wait till you see- Well, you won’t see her for a while unless you go outside. Hell, you may need to remind her to eat and sleep” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “What is it with her and plants? Has she been an addict her entire life?”</p><p> </p><p>“Definitely,” Wanda smiled. “She used to piss teachers off by trying to have a garden on the playground. She’d find seeds to plant, take flowers from their desks. It’s honestly adorable to look back on” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha fondly smiled, imagining a small Rio being a plant addict like she was now. How her classroom was filled must’ve been her childhood bedroom. </p><p> </p><p>“But why?” Agatha asked. “Is there any reason besides her being a weirdo?” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda shrugged. “I’ve always thought it was just her, but..” </p><p> </p><p>She took a bite, tilting her head side to side while thinking of how to word it. </p><p> </p><p>“I think she likes being in control of something, but also not totally” She said. “She once told Natasha how plants had a mind of their own, but she also was able to guide them. A reason she started teaching as well”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, listening as Wanda continued. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio’s always been someone who needs structure and I think that’s caused so much anxiety. Especially with how chaotic her childhood was” She said. “So..I think being in a garden, working with plants. Not only did it give her something to fixate on. But..”</p><p> </p><p>“Sense of control..” Agatha said. </p><p> </p><p>“Exactly,” Wanda nodded. “Oh! And don’t fear when the delivery truck shows up”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Every year, Rio does this massive order. She keeps it saved on her computer. Very specific on supplies, plants, what not. She’ll most likely order sometime this week and when the truck gets here?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda fell into a laugh, turning to Nicky with a tiny baby voice. </p><p> </p><p>“You know, right?” She asked. “We wonder where the fuck she’s going to put everything!” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha twitched her lips to the side, tapping her fork against the container before pointing it at Wanda. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you know where it is on her computer?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda looked up, head tilted. “Maybe? Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Show me” </p><p> </p><p>“Wha-”</p><p> </p><p>“I gotta’ grab my wallet. I’ll meet you in her office. Just find it”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushed up, hobbling over to the living room. Wanda stared in disbelief. There was no way Agatha was considering making that purchase, right? Rio invested a decent amount of money into all the supplies. </p><p> </p><p>With every ex Rio had, none of them cared about Rio’s love for gardening. They didn’t seem interested in getting to know why she loved it or paid any attention whatsoever. And here Agatha was not only questioning into her past, but potentially surprising her with her supplies before Rio was even able to order them. </p><p><br/>Wanda smiled, she looked over at Nicky with a tiny laugh. </p><p> </p><p>“I think this woman is a bit crazy about your mom..” She whispered. </p><p> </p><p>“Move it, redhead!” Agatha yelled. </p><p> </p><p>“Coming!” Wanda replied, putting her forehead against Nicky’s as she added “And your mother better get out of this stupid friendzone” </p><hr/><p>The next day when noon hit, the box truck pulled up out front. Wanda had shown ten minutes earlier to be there for it. Not only to help Agatha guide them to the backyard, showing them where Rio liked things in the greenhouse. But also to get photo evidence for her wife who did not believe her at all the night before. </p><p> </p><p>“Is this too much?” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda laughed. “Too much? She’s going to lose it tonight”</p><p> </p><p>“In a good way?”</p><p> </p><p>She heard the hesitation, slight worry in Agatha’s voice. It was amusing coming from a woman who appeared confident about anything and everything. As well as heartwarming. </p><p> </p><p>Someone cared so deeply for her best friend. One who was supposedly an enemy. Rio once said she was out Agatha was out to get her, made her life hell, insulted and gave her gifts to piss her off. </p><p> </p><p>Now here that so-called “enemy” stood- Well, <em>sat</em>, with a sprained ankle beside her. They watched the two guys offload the truck full of supplies. From potting soil, new tools (Rio used the same old ones, never buying herself shiny new things. Agatha wasn’t having that), everything a gardener could want.</p><p> </p><p>“This is hands down the nicest thing anyone has ever done for Rio, Agatha” Wanda softly spoke with a smile. “I’m not sure how she’ll react. She isn’t great with expressing vulnerability-”</p><p> </p><p>“Makes two of us” Agatha snickered.</p><p> </p><p>They both weren’t the greatest at it. Agatha felt at times Rio was better, but she knew they were growing and learning together. Building their own special way. Love, trust, caring for each other in a way others couldn’t. </p><p> </p><p><em>Disgusting. </em>Agatha thought, but not in a bad way. </p><p> </p><p>If you asked her a few months ago this is where she’d be. Sitting at Professor Vidal’s home with a sprained ankle, brought to her by jumping a fence all because Rio broke into her apartment. Along with how open she had become. It wasn’t far, but it felt like a few giant leaps over hurdles she never thought could be passed. </p><p> </p><p>All of that would have had Agatha laughing in your face, calling you a moron before she kicked the door on your way out. But now? </p><p> </p><p>It was nothing like that. Agatha was able to laugh at the irony and scenario, of course. She wasn’t laughing though over it never being a possibility. </p><p> </p><p>It still felt surreal to her how she was here. How her life flipped upside down in a matter of minutes. All it took was melted ice cream, a date standing her up, and an assload of confidence to be where she was. </p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal was a wonder to her. She always had been since they first met. Agatha remembered before approaching her how highly she was thought of. The talk of her name circled each colleague she met. </p><p> </p><p><em>“Wait until you meet Professor Vidal”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“She’s tough, unapproachable!” </em></p><p> </p><p><em>“But, that doesn’t mean she is someone not worth speaking to. She’s wise beyond her years It’s astounding what she’s done so far” </em></p><p> </p><p><em>“When you meet her, you’ll see what I mean”</em></p><p> </p><p>And Agatha did. God, she fucking did. </p><p> </p><p>Even if they didn’t start off on the best foot. Agatha regretted what approach she chose, cringed over Rio’s reaction. Beneath those two strong emotions was something deeper. A strong feeling Agatha had never experienced before. </p><p><em>I need to know everything about her. </em></p><p> </p><p>Like an addict, someone obsessed with a celebrity- Agatha researched Rio back to front that night. She read her Linkedin, watched YouTube videos of interviews and recordings of her lectures. Agatha accidentally pulled an all nighter locked at her desk. </p><p> </p><p>A creep, stalker, she felt disgust and embarrassment with herself. Maybe though it was just a fluke. Researching an intimidating colleague was normal, right? Agatha had shaked it out of her system, got everything off her chest. </p><p> </p><p>And then, Agatha’s first day of the semester. Professor Vidal was striding down the hall. Black messenger bag on her shoulder, coffee in hand. Her outfit was a dark green silk buttoned up blouse, tucked into black slacks with Doc Marten combat boots that added an inch to her height. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look her way. She kept her eyes focused on her phone, oblivious to anyone walking past her. Agatha learned overtime, that was Professor Vidal’s normal. </p><p> </p><p>She was a workaholic. Someone who didn’t want to make friends, chit chat at the water cooler or break table. Her heart was dedicated to the classroom. Her focus was given hundred and ten percent to her students. </p><p> </p><p>For all Agatha made jokes about those things. She teased her with being a boring old grump. It was inspiring beyond words. Rio would have never guessed it, but she was the reason Agatha worked harder in her own classroom. </p><p> </p><p>Beyond intimidation, inspiration was a silly intimidating crush. Agatha found herself reacting with child's play because she didn’t know what to do with it. Insults, jokes, stupid prank gifts and mocking the woman during meetings. </p><p> </p><p>It was funny how the childish crush turned into something beyond her beliefs. She always thought Rio, if the day ever came, would only want her as a hook up. Most likely a drunk one after a work Christmas party or something. The smallest parts of her hoped it would turn into something more, but doubt controlled that side. </p><p> </p><p>“She’s going to love it” Wanda assured. “I’d tell you or would have blocked you from doing this if I thought otherwise” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, offering a small smile that was still filled with nerves. She watched as the last of the delivery was in the greenhouse. Wanda left not long after to get back to work. </p><p> </p><p>Then? All Agatha could do was wait. She was thankful to have her next class not long after the workers left. Even if she’d be teaching with Rio heavy on her mind, nerves wracking her being. It’d be something to keep her busy. </p><p> </p><p>She looked at the clock. Six hours till Rio was home. </p><p> </p><p><em>The longest three hundred sixty fucking minutes of my life..</em></p><p> </p><p>(And yes, Agatha had looked up how many minutes were in six hours to think that)</p><hr/><p>Agatha had shut her laptop for the day about an hour prior to the door opening. She had spent her time on the couch with Nicky, trying to focus on a movie to pass the time. </p><p> </p><p>Of course, that did nothing. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky bolted for the door, Agatha pushed to sit up more with a smile that failed miserably to cover the anxiety racing through her. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey..” Agatha greeted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was focused on kissing Nicky’s head, ruffling his fur, down on one knee to do so. A sight Agatha had grown very fond of with every day that passed. </p><p> </p><p>For two friends, they had fallen into a very domesticated old wives routine. Rio comes home nearly at the exact same time, dropping to one knee to greet Nicky, quick banter with Agatha before talking about dinner. </p><p> </p><p>(Agatha didn’t know Rio was resisting the urge to kiss her first before their little back and forth. But, that’d show one day)</p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned while standing back up, Agatha snickered. </p><p> </p><p>“Ya’ getting old over there, chief?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio tossed her keys, kicked her boots off with a tiny smirk. </p><p> </p><p>“At least both of my ankles work”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed. “Mine work! Just a little down for the count right now” </p><p> </p><p>Rio put her bag down on the other end of the couch, stretching her upper back with her head tossed back. Arms locked behind her head, neck craned as she subtly groaned again.</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh my god. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled her lips back, biting on them hard, holding back a moan over the sight alone. Just Rio’s arms, a simple stretch and Agatha was ready to drop to her knees. She snapped her head back at the TV, hand covered her mouth, feeling how her cheeks were burning. </p><p> </p><p><em>Can she see me?</em></p><p><em>Does she know what she’s doing? </em></p><p><em>And am I- Fuck. How the hell am I getting wet over her stretching?</em></p><p> </p><p>It didn’t help either how Rio’s usual long sleeves were now swapped for short sleeves. The usual button up was replaced by a plain white tee. Shirt tucked into her slacks, making the fabric tighter against her chest. </p><p><br/>And the worst of all when it came to those shirts? </p><p> </p><p><em>Her fucking arms..the death of me.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha could taste the drool on her tongue. It was hard to keep her eyes on the TV instead of focusing on the muscles flexed. The way she looked strong enough that Agatha thought a chokehold sounded nice right about now. And this wasn’t the first time it happened. <br/><br/>When Rio was staying home twenty four seven to keep an eye on Agatha, she worked out from home. The woman brought her weights, jump rope, and all the small home equipment she had to the backyard. And Agatha watched as if her life depended on it. She had to remember to breathe when Rio came back inside. Her breathing rapid, skin glistening with sweat, muscles prominent and-</p><p> </p><p><em>How am I supposed to be her friend again?</em></p><p> </p><p>The little scars along her skin from different injuries showed. Agatha remembered the first time she saw them up close. </p><p> </p><p><em>“Do you really have a scar kink?” Rio snickered. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha hummed, tracing the tiny ones scattered on her forearms. Rio had told her it was from her work with plants. Sometimes she caught herself on something or a pair of sheers took a hit when she fell. Others were cat scratches from strays she took in throughout her life. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>“Guess I’m the inventor of that” She shrugged. </em></p><p> </p><p>Her neck was craned back, arms dropped a few seconds after with an exhaled sigh. Agatha felt she was in the clear. At least for now. </p><p> </p><p>“What’s on your mind for food?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, rubbing the back of her neck with a shrug. </p><p> </p><p>“Food”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed. “That joke never gets old..” She muttered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled. She couldn’t wait any longer. Not when she’d been itching all day to find out if her idea was too much. </p><p>Just as Rio went to speak, Agatha cut her off with a quick,</p><p> </p><p>“I think uh, maybe something died at the greenhouse?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had her hands in her pockets, tilted to the side with a frown. </p><p> </p><p><em>How does she look so fucking good standing?</em></p><p><em>I’m going insane. Fuck my life. </em></p><p> </p><p>“What makes you say that?” Rio asked. “You hiding a body in there or something?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed with an eye roll. “Yeah. Murder spree with a sprained ankle that already has me hopping around”</p><p> </p><p>“I never know with you,” Rio shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>She hummed. “Well, Nicky must’ve found the body there. He was sniffing around like his life depended on it”</p><p> </p><p>Not a total lie. Nicky loved following the two guys unloading the supplies into the greenhouse. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed, hand running through her hair with a nod. </p><p> </p><p>“Probably a rabbit or something” She shrugged. “I’ll go check it out” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, waiting for Rio to disappear into the kitchen before jumping up to hobble over. </p><p> </p><p>Her heart was pounding, blood rushing through her veins fast enough to be felt. She caught herself in the backdoor, balancing on her good foot with a hand holding onto the frame. Agatha sighed in relief once she was steady, looking up to see Rio round the greenhouse. </p><p> </p><p><em>Of course you’re not going inside.. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Maybe it’s inside?” Agatha called out. <br/><br/>Rio jumped, turned over her shoulder with a snicker. </p><p> </p><p>“I was going in there” She said. “Impatient for me to see the body?”</p><p> </p><p>“Something like that” Agatha muttered.</p><p><br/>She watched the older woman look in the grass on the other side, and checked the bushes behind the greenhouse. If Agatha had two perfect ankles, she would have stormed over and tossed Rio inside by now. The waiting was absolutely killing her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was already an impatient person, but this was an entire new level. </p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced over, laughed with a shake of her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you really still watching?” She asked. “I thought you’d be grossed out by a dead animal” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Maybe I want to watch the life drain out of you like my victim in the shed-”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a greenhouse” Rio corrected, pointing her finger with a stern glare. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha put her hand up, head dipped down as her voice dramatized a low, “My dearest apologies, Professor Green Witch” </p><p><br/>Rio laughed, but in a somewhat annoyed tone. </p><p> </p><p>“You know, I’m beginning to think every annoying nickname that started originated from your brain”</p><p> </p><p>“Awe, honey!” Agatha put a hand over her chest. “Such a sweetheart”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed, grabbing the handle as she stared Agatha down. </p><p> </p><p>“You won’t be saying that when I call the cops over this dead body in my green-”</p><p> </p><p>The door opened as she spoke. The loud creak echoed over her words. And if the supplies weren’t packed in there, that noise would have been what silenced Rio into shock. </p><p> </p><p>She stood, back turned to Agatha with no words. Her one hand remained on the handle, other slowly lifted to run through her hair. </p><p> </p><p><em>Is that good?</em></p><p><em>Is this..did I stress her out?</em></p><p><em>It’s too much. Fuck. </em></p><p>An eternity was going by. Only the sound of cars occasionally going down the street out front, birds chirping, wind making the branches and growing leaves sway in the breeze. </p><p> </p><p>And the sound of Agatha’s heart hammering, lungs inflated, never going down as she forgot to breathe. Why was she so anxious? The worst Rio could do was hate it and that’d give Agatha a reason to turn against her. Right? </p><p> </p><p>Or was it the fear Rio would see her in a different light. She’d go home, sit on her couch alone, be damned to think about Rio Vidal for eternity. </p><p><br/>What if she scared her off? They agreed to take it slow, be friends first. Was this too loud of a grand gesture?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was about to find out as Rio slowly turned, meeting the woman’s nervous smile. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t smiling, but she wasn’t frowning either. </p><p><br/>Her lips were parted, jaw dropped as her eyes nearly bulged out of her skull. A hand stayed holding her hair back, the other glued to the handle as she tried to catch her breath. </p><p> </p><p>"I- How did you-"</p><p> </p><p>"Wanda was in the neighbourhood," Agatha shrugged. “She mentioned your garden and..” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha licked her lips, pulled them back to bite on for a moment before continuing. </p><p> </p><p>“Figured I’d..” </p><p> </p><p>She ran out of words. The nonstop rambling nuisance, Agatha Harkness was speechless because of fear. All she could do was shake her head, wave her hand with a chuckle. </p><p> </p><p>“Shit” She cursed. “I’m sorry. Okay? That was..too much and I swear! I promise the friends thing is still there. I’m okay with that. Hell, I am happy about it!” </p><p> </p><p>The woman was happy about them being friends, Rio still being in her life, but not the ecstatic enthusiasm she wanted Rio to believe. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was lost in her tangent. The speechless seconds only lasted for a moment. She went from not knowing what to say to spiraling into a vomit of words. A mouthful of random words tossed together. She repeated a few, not realizing she did so. </p><p> </p><p>So much so, she never saw Rio crossing the yard. </p><p> </p><p>“I just know you love gardening and Wanda said this time of year is when you ordered everything so you could spend weekends working and you’ve done so much for me when I hurt myself breaking into your fucking yard! And!”</p><p> </p><p>A warm hand grasped the nape of her neck. Her eyes had looked up, but only caught the faintest glimpse of Rio before her lips were met with a bruising impact of the soft pair she missed. A dangerous move, something friends definitely did not do-</p><p> </p><p><em>She’s kissing me. </em></p><p>Agatha let go of the doorframe that was keeping her balanced. Instead, her hands held onto either side of Rio’s waist. The woman would realize later on when she couldn’t sleep, when this kiss would be replaying in her mind, how her trust was fully in Rio. </p><p> </p><p>If this was anyone else, any ex she had, Agatha would never let go of that doorframe. Yet with Rio, it felt natural. She knew holding onto her wouldn’t result in a fall. Balancing wouldn’t be an issue. </p><p> </p><p>And that kiss? Was it crazy to say that kept her balanced as well? </p><p> </p><p>Especially when it wasn’t like any other time Rio kissed her. Agatha chalked it up to be the time in between. How they went weeks without even a peck on the cheek. When in reality, it was more. </p><p> </p><p>This was a defining moment for them. Rio wouldn’t be able to verbalize what she was feeling. Unbeknownst to Agatha, it was a mess of emotions. From good, to shock, to feeling as if she wasn’t worthy. </p><p> </p><p>No one ever cared like this. </p><p>No one had ever made this sort of grand gesture for Rio. </p><p> </p><p><em>No one ever loved me like this. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled away, but didn’t take a step back. She still held onto the back of Agatha’s neck. Her other hand had moved to hold Agatha’s arm, keeping her right hand where it was. </p><p> </p><p>And…they stood. Both took a few seconds to take deep breaths, steady themselves and reel back from the heat of the moment. Clarity came to light, reality settled in. </p><p> </p><p>“We suck at this friend thing..” Agatha whispered. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, a smile on her face and yet..Agatha saw past it. There was no regret in that kiss. Not a chance. She would see it in those brown eyes she grew to love gazing into. Agatha would have felt it in the way Rio kissed her. </p><p> </p><p>Though…there was hesitation, still a tiny bit of fear. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha simply smiled, raised a hand to push the messy strands out of Rio’s face. Palm cradled her cheek, thumb brushed over the skin beneath her eye.</p><p> </p><p>“We can still take it slow” She assured. “No rushing. No need to” </p><p> </p><p>And just like that, Rio relaxed. Physically, mentally, emotionally…Agatha would never get used to being the reason behind all of that. How she was the one to ease Rio back, calm her down. </p><p> </p><p><em>I used to be the reason she looked like she was about to explode. </em></p><p> </p><p>It was funny to her how that was. When they were in a better position, lighter mood, Agatha would tease her for it. Agatha would say something along the lines of,</p><p> </p><p><em>“Isn’t it funny how you had steam coming out of your ears and now all I have to do is kiss your forehead, call you honey, and you melt?”</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio would blush, hide away and try to shake Agatha off. Then Agatha would not so much ruin the sweetness, but cause Rio to groan and push her away while saying she wasn’t funny over the joke,</p><p> </p><p><em>“Steam out of your ears before. Now really if you think about it with how wet you get, steam comes from your pus-”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“NO!” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, predicting the moment accurately and feeling it’d be perfect. </p><p> </p><p>She was worried that the friend title would stay. Terrified her mistake jeopardized it all. You’d think with Agatha still on Rio’s couch, them having little moments of domestic bliss- Agatha would’ve known the friends title was never a thing. A figment of their imagination. </p><p> </p><p>But, it took that kiss to eliminate all fear of that being true. </p><p> </p><p><em>She’s mine. </em></p><p><em>She still loves me. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Wanna’ order pizza and watch something?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled. “You read my mind, Vidal”</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to lean in, pull Rio close and kiss her again. For now though, she’d pinch her hip before slipping away. She smiled hard as Rio gasped, a tiny giggle chirped from her. </p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha was able to turn around, she felt fingers wrap around her wrist, stopping her in her tracks. </p><p> </p><p>She turned, lips pursed. “Wha-”</p><p> </p><p>“You really did that?” Rio asked. </p><p><em>Oh. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha had heard Rio’s voice have a sweet tone before. Soft, delicate. But this one? It was fragile, so small and as if she didn’t believe this was real.</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Agatha said. “Wanda did show me the list and all that jazz, so…guess I won’t take <em>all </em>the credit”</p><p> </p><p>“But, you..” Rio shook her head, looking back at the greenhouse with the door still wide open. A glimpse inside the mess of supplies. “Agatha. I don’t know-”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to thank me” Agatha said. “We can call it a thank you for being my hospital” She smirked, but quickly added. “Though just know..”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached up, two fingers held Rio’s chin to turn her eyes back. She waited till Rio was focused on her, smiling as she whispered. </p><p> </p><p>“I’d do this just because I want to” Agatha said. </p><p> </p><p><em>Oh! Shit! </em></p><p> </p><p>Her eyes went wide, mouth dropped as she scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck! I forgot!” </p><p> </p><p>The sudden change of tone made Rio jump. She was too shocked how it went from a quiet moment to an explosive one to laugh at the sight. Agatha hobbled away at the highest rate of speed she could go. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, following her to the living room. </p><p> </p><p>What the hell had she fallen in love with?</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped on the couch, dragging her duffle bag over to rummage through. Wanda had offered to go to her place and grab a few things. Agatha made sure to joke about how she didn't need to break in like her best friend would. </p><p> </p><p>One of those items Agatha requested was the bag of stuff she had bought Rio. When she was going to bribe her to talk again? </p><p> </p><p><em>Not always bribery..</em></p><p> </p><p>True, Agatha adored spoiling the ones she cared for. She was only just learning how to be more vocal and without a doubt, Agatha was doing great. Better than she ever thought possible. </p><p> </p><p>However? Gifts were always better. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha held up the bag with a grin. </p><p> </p><p>“I meant to give this to you sooner” She said. “I totally blanked, you know…injured and all”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, walking over to take the bag. She sat down in the loveseat chair adjacent to the couch. Agatha’s knee bounced, picking the skin off her thumb. </p><p> </p><p>She watched the bag open, Rio’s eyes widened before shaking her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Ag-”</p><p> </p><p>“Open it”</p><p> </p><p>“Why did you get me this?” Rio looked up. “You don’t have to give me things to stay-”</p><p> </p><p>“It isn’t about that, idiot” Agatha said. “Listen, I-” </p><p> </p><p>She sighed, shaking her head. </p><p> </p><p>“I can learn all the right words. I can learn all the right things, but that will never change this” She pointed. “And you can ask Billy because I buy that kid so much fucking food and shirts, whatever- He will tell you I buy people shit” </p><p> </p><p>It was rough how she worded it, but Rio couldn’t even focus on the wording. She bought Billy stuff like that? All the funky polka dot, hawaiian pattern shirts? Floral and super hero socks? </p><p> </p><p><em>Just when I think I can’t fucking find her more loveable..</em></p><p> </p><p>“So shut it and open it” Agatha demanded. </p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes before following orders. </p><p> </p><p>She smiled at the three pairs of boxers. Two dinosaur prints. The other that made her laugh was Dolly Parton’s face in the center. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god” She said. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grinned. “You can wear ‘em, but Jolene there? She ain’t taking my man” </p><p> </p><p>Rio felt her face burn, shaking her head as she pulled out the other things. Her favorite snacks from Pocky to Scooby Doo fruit snacks. Lego kits that had been on her list to collect. Small ones like Animal Crossing ones to just a frog. And a dark green hoodie with the words-</p><p> </p><p>“Best dog mom ever..” Rio whispered with a little smile. </p><p> </p><p>The older woman didn’t know what to say, what to do. It wasn’t just the fact Agatha had bought her anything. Everything was related to how she paid attention in ways no one had. Down to the smallest details of having her best friend show her the list of supplies. </p><p> </p><p>How she somehow knew the Lego sets that had been on Rio’s mind. </p><p>How she remembered Rio’s favorite snacks. </p><p>How she was encouraging Rio wearing stupid boxers with Dolly Parton’s face. </p><p> </p><p>Rio felt seen, heard, and…<em>loved.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, clapped her hands with a nod. </p><p> </p><p>“Pizza?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>It went unspoken for the atmosphere to change. They were vulnerable to a level untouched. Not even the bathroom when they agreed to take it slow matched. </p><p> </p><p>And that only made Rio love her more. Agatha wasn’t just changing the subject for herself, but she knew Rio wasn’t the best at expressing these sorts of emotions. Neither were uncomfortable, but they weren’t ready to push it farther either. </p><p> </p><p>“Wings as well?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Garlic knots too” Agatha reached for her phone. “I’ll tell the driver to just grab my wallet from the car and come inside”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in the middle of putting the hoodie on when she paused, glaring at Agatha who looked up with a tiny snort. The older woman was still not happy with that dangerous, impulsive, reckless plan of her’s. </p><p> </p><p>“Cute,” Rio said. </p><p> </p><p><em>“I know I ammm”</em> Agatha sang with a grin. </p><p> </p><p>“Let me grab my card” Rio got up, walking over to her wallet. </p><p> </p><p>As she walked by, Rio couldn’t hold herself back. Not when her heart was bursting out of her chest. Not when the hoodie fit her perfectly, when gardening supplies were awaiting her for the weekend, when Agatha had looked at her with so much care and she just felt-</p><p> </p><p><em>So fucking loved. </em></p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t anything grand, nothing out of this earth. Rio simply rounded the couch, walked behind it and stopped where Agatha sat. The woman didn’t hesitate. It felt natural for what she wasn’t just supposed to do, but what she wanted- <em>Needed. </em></p><p> </p><p>Her lips pressed a small kiss against the top of Agatha’s head. The smell of her vanilla conditioner filled her nose. Along with Agatha’s own signature smell. Rio would never be able to describe what that scent was. All she knew was the smell was home, comfort, and just..<em>Agatha. </em></p><p> </p><p>She then walked away like it never happened. Never turning to see the way Agatha nearly dropped her phone, how she was more red than an apple or blood ever could be. She was burning, vibrating out while her bones were shaking- Threatening to burst out of her skin with excitement. </p><p> </p><p>Things had changed. Agatha knew they’d still be taking it slow, not putting a label on anything. </p><p> </p><p>But..<em>things had changed. </em></p><p><br/>And what was even better for Agatha? (Even better than Rio handing Agatha her card to order food from the best pizza place in town) </p><p> </p><p><em>She loves me. </em></p><hr/><p>Saturday morning was loud to say the least. At the crack of dawn, Agatha woke up with Nicky under her head. It became a routine how she used him as a pillow and he was more than happy to be that. </p><p><br/>No, Agatha still wasn’t in Rio’s bed. But the couch had grown comfy for her. It was closer to the bathroom and the kitchen combined. So, she couldn’t complain. </p><p><br/>She groaned into his fur as the music played from the kitchen. The smell of coffee filled the air, dishes clinking together with feet shuffling all over the floorboards. </p><p> </p><p>“What is your mother doing?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha regretfully got up from the couch. Her walking was a tad bit easier, but still a little unstable. Nicky loved to walk by her side early mornings. Almost like he knew that’s when the pain was usually at it’s highest of the day. </p><p> </p><p>She rubbed her eye, finding Rio swaying her hips by the kitchen sink. Any other time, Agatha would adore and smile wide at the sight. But when she read the microwave clock to see the fucking time was <em>before </em>six am? </p><p> </p><p>(Five thirty seven, to be exact) </p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “What the hell?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio jumped, looked over her shoulder with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Good morning, mi amor!” She beamed. “Coffee is almost ready! Making us some muffins and-”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s. Saturday. <em>Rio.</em>” Agatha dramatically stated each word. </p><p><br/>The older woman nodded. “Yes, it is!”</p><p> </p><p>“So why the hell are you in the kitchen, high off drugs like you’re in some fucking Disney movie at this god foresaken hour?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head as she gestured outside. </p><p> </p><p>“I have <em>a lot</em> of work ahead of me. Remember? You got me all my supplies” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed, muttering under her breath, </p><p> </p><p>“If I knew getting you that would make you alive at this hour..I wouldn’t have gotten you anything”</p><p><br/>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “It’s okay, mi amor. Go back to bed. I’ll be outside working” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was too tired to notice the little name. Rio was distracted with her excitement to get outside. It was normal, easy. Something neither would catch onto until later, at least. </p><p> </p><p>The younger woman trudged back to the couch, dropping on it with Nicky jumping up beside her. She lazily smiled, snuggling up beside him as they listened to Rio whistle away. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m so glad you’re growing to be more like me. Not a morning person like your mother” Agatha grumbled. </p><p> </p><p>However, she couldn’t be too upset. Not as Rio was dancing around the house, giddy like a child who was on her way to the playground. Her chest swelled, heart grew inside with nothing but adoration. When she was more alert, she’d watch Rio in her element. Sip coffee, read a book, enjoy being in the sun as her girlfriend- </p><p> </p><p><em>No. We aren’t that…not yet. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio worked in the garden. For now though, she’d blissfully drift back to sleep to the sound of her lover’s whistling turning into humming, then faint singing. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled to herself. <em>She’s happy. </em></p><hr/><p>The morning progressed and by ten, Agatha was ready to be alert and a functioning human. She checked the backyard, but found Rio upfront right outside the dining room window. She was on her hands and knees, pulling weeds from the dirt, collecting the dead leaves around them. </p><p><br/>Music played off her speaker as she hummed along. Sweet Thang, Shuggie Otis. </p><p> </p><p><em>Calderu coded. </em></p><p> </p><p>Of course, Rio would pick up music from Lilia. As Agatha grew to learn more about Rio, she saw why the two were good working together and why they got along. Rio had an old soul, she was wise just as Lilia as well. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes looked around, not seeing a chair or anywhere to sit. Just the growing grass in the front yard. And really, okay- Agatha would sit on the grass if needed. As long as she was with Rio, she was content. </p><p> </p><p>But, she was still injured. Could she get a bit more special treatment?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, earning Rio’s attention. </p><p> </p><p>The older woman grinned wide, pushing up to sit back on her heels. </p><p> </p><p>“Morning, sleepyhead” Rio smiled. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunted, still a bit tired, but that wasn’t anything her coffee couldn’t fix. She gestured her hand around the room as she asked,</p><p> </p><p><em>“Well?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “Well, what?” </p><p> </p><p>“You expect me to sit on the ground or..?” The silence lingered at the end of the question, her good foot tapping the porch step.</p><p> </p><p>“Why sit on the ground?” Rio asked, clueless to what she was implying. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared, waiting for her to catch on. She was a bit surprised that Rio didn’t understand what she was saying. They had learned to speak the unspoken, pick up what the other was lying down. </p><p> </p><p>Luckily though, Agatha was about to clarify when Rio’s eyebrows raised and she pushed up on her knees. She took one glove off, pointing with a little laugh. </p><p> </p><p>“Wait- You want to be outside? Like..while I’m-”</p><p> </p><p>“Being a nerd in your garden? Yes. But, preferably not on the ground” Agatha said. “If I have to, so be it. But really, I-”</p><p> </p><p>“Won’t you get bored?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her book up, shaking it in the air. Rio still seemingly didn’t believe her. The younger woman didn't take it that way though. Instead she scoffed, taking a step back.</p><p> </p><p>“What? Don’t like company while you work?” Agatha asked. “That’s fine, I guess. But, I-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio jumped up, ripped her other off and tossed the pair aside. Agatha barely had time to comprehend as she felt the wind from Rio’s speed almost knock her back. One second Rio was in the garden, the next she jumped on the porch and flew into the house, yelling a loud, </p><p> </p><p>“I have the perfect chair! <em>I CAN GET YOU AN UMBRELLA TOO!” </em></p><p> </p><p>Her voice faded as she ran through the house to the backyard. Agatha huffed, shaking her head with a smile. She didn’t think it was possible for Rio to sound happier, more excited about the day. </p><p> </p><p><em>Why an umbrella though?</em></p><p> </p><p>“It’s not raining, dumbass!” She yelled out. </p><p> </p><p>After a bit of muffled, echoed sounds from the backyard- Ones that Agatha could only assume were things being tossed around in the shed. Rio came running back. One chair under her arm, umbrella over her shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “Didn’t you hear me, weirdo?” </p><p> </p><p>She watched Rio put the chair down first, dropping the umbrella down beside. F</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio continued working as she asked the question. The chair was a long lounge one that unfolded, set up within a second. A long dark green, looked comfy as can be. </p><p> </p><p>“No rain. I don’t need an umbrel-”</p><p> </p><p>“With this time of hour out here the sun gets pretty brutal because there’s no shade like in the back and I don’t have sunscreen yet- I have to get that still. So this!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rambled, grunted while she opened the old umbrella. It creaked, shook some dust off as it pushed open. God, Rio really never bought herself new things at all. Which wasn’t a bad thing, but they were total opposites on that for sure. </p><p> </p><p>She stuck it in the ground, the blue umbrella cast shade over the chair. Rio’s hands clapped, arms out to gesture to it with a happy, </p><p> </p><p><em>“Ta-da!” </em>She grinned. An arm tossed over her stomach, the other behind her back as she bowed. “Royalty chair with sun protection, princess” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted, muttering how ridiculous she was as she made her way over. Rio took her hand, steadying her as she sat. Coffee on the ground, book in hand, Rio in front with that stupid smile of hers?</p><p> </p><p><em>Has a Saturday ever looked this good?</em></p><p> </p><p>“You’re so kind,” Agatha said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, tongue in cheek as the look faded into a nervous frown. She picked at her fingers, body shifting side to side. A sign of hers that she was overthinking something. </p><p> </p><p>“And you’re sure you don’t mind being out here?” Rio asked. “I’ll probably be outside working all day. Tomorrow too- If that’s a problem, I-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha crossed a leg over the other. The book opened, eyes glaring above the pages. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio” She said.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up and get back to work” </p><p> </p><p>The older woman paused, but went from nervous to shy. She smiled, nodded as she ran back to where she was working. Agatha focused on her book, Rio played the song over from the beginning as she got her gloves on. </p><p> </p><p>And that’s how the rest of their morning went. Agatha outside with a book, Rio working away in the garden. Neither needed to talk, both stuck in their own worlds but floating in the same orbit. </p><p> </p><p>However as it grew close to noon, Agatha was bored and her book wasn’t a good distraction. She looked over, seeing Rio had moved closer to the chair. Now on the other side of the front porch steps by their bedroom- <em>No. Rio’s bedroom </em>window. </p><p> </p><p>The first distraction lasted probably a bit too long. To the point if any neighbor walked by, they'd think of Agatha as some creep for staring too hard. But how could she not? </p><p> </p><p>Rio was hyperfocused on her work. On her knees, covered in sweat and dirt. It wasn't her white shirt, but instead a black tank muscle tee cut off at her shoulders. </p><p> </p><p>And just like when Rio stretched in front of her…this was worse. Maybe even more than watching her work out. Especially when she had stopped reading, tuned into the grunts between her soft singing. </p><p> </p><p>How her lips would sometimes pull back between her teeth, tongue in cheek. The way her hips would thrust forward and back as she tried to rip the weed from its spot and-</p><p> </p><p>“So! You have two gardens?!” </p><p> </p><p><em>Shit. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha's voice cracked through the question. Her words were frantic, desperate to ignore how hot Rio was making her. Not even the sun could do what she was doing. </p><p> </p><p><em>Why did I think watching her was a good fucking idea? </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio jumped, snapping out of her world to look at Agatha. She was silent for a moment, clearly registering the question before nodding. Seemingly she didn't catch on or ever feel Agatha's eyes on her.c</p><p> </p><p><em>Thank fuck. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Yes- Well..technically three” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “Makes sense why you buy the supply list in bulk” </p><p> </p><p>Rio shyly smiled, going back to what she was doing. More than likely assuming the conversation was over. That’s all Agatha cared to learn. </p><p><br/>But then? </p><p> </p><p>“So, how do your three gardens work? What can I expect to see grow?” Agatha asked, turning to rest on her side. Elbow propped up, hand supporting her head. “And do you take requests?”</p><p> </p><p><em>Whoa. </em></p><p> </p><p>Not just one, nor two, but <em>three </em>questions about her gardens? She was lucky if any ex decided to say hi while she worked, let alone cared to learn about them. </p><p> </p><p>“You really want to know?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>“I wanna’ know it all, toots” Agatha winked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio visibly looked shocked before nodding, lighting up with every word she said. </p><p> </p><p>“So the front yard, here” She stood, gesturing to it. “These are all my flowers, shrubs, and I’m hoping one day to have an apple tree over there” She pointed. “Make the house look pretty, really”</p><p> </p><p>She then gestured to the fence. The exact spot Agatha had crawled and injured herself over. </p><p> </p><p>“Then in the backyard- That’s mainly where I grow my experimental plants. I don’t bring any flowers out here until they grow perfectly and I have the method down. Then my third on the other side of the backyard is where I grow my fruits and vegetables” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed. “So you’ll be my chef from scratch?”</p><p> </p><p>“Without a doubt, princess,” Rio winked. </p><p> </p><p>Without a doubt, flirting had made a comeback since that kiss. What surprised Agatha was how extra Rio became with it. She didn’t flirt in a shy way all the time or let Agatha take the reins. She now had a few flirts of her own, winks, names- Especially the newest addition that had become a regular one..</p><p> </p><p><em>Princess.</em></p><p> </p><p>And Agatha really fucking liked it. </p><p> </p><p>She jokingly said it when she brought Agatha her coffee and breakfast. The younger woman had asked for another napkin and when she said thank you? That’s when it happened. </p><p> </p><p><em>“Anything else, princess?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio must’ve (Without a doubt) seen the way Agatha choked on her eggs. How her skin flushed a deep red. The way she wasn’t able to make eye contact without shivering, burning for a good ten or fifteen minutes. </p><p> </p><p>After that, the name stuck. Rio either used it a couple times a day or saved it when she was bored and wanted to watch Agatha lose her mind a bit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, clearing her throat to collect herself. </p><p> </p><p>“And what about requests?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was grabbing the rake for the other mess of dead leaves when she turned, head tilted to the side. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Like, say I had a flower or food in mind. Would you do it?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned, holding the handle of the rake close to her. “Are you serious?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “How many more times are you going to ask me that?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head. <em>If she only knew. </em></p><p> </p><p>“I’m..sorry- Alright?” Rio chuckled. “This is new. No one cares about this shit. It’s always been me”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I do. So..” Agatha pointed with a tiny smirk. “Get used to it. And also? I've always wanted a pretty garden”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered. “So you’re saying you’ll be living here one day and bossing me around my garden?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not technically living here already?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Sprained ankle stay, actually” Rio shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed. It wasn’t just a chuckle, snicker, one of those little snort sounds she made. It was a full on head thrown back type of laugh. One that made Rio’s stomach flutter, her heart soar through the dead garden begging to be brought to life. </p><p> </p><p>Ironic. Rio had spent years bringing life to gardens, plants, every little piece of nature. Yet, no one brought her to life. She lived life for Wanda, Nicky, and most importantly her job. However, everything was still dull. </p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha barged in. From making her life hell to bringing out a new found sense of living in her? </p><p> </p><p><em>Is this why people love…love? </em></p><p> </p><p>“Oh, admit it. You’ll still want me when I’m back to jumping and dancing around” Agatha said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, pushing the subject back to requests. </p><p> </p><p>“And what would be your request, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>“Azaleas,” Agatha said. “My favorite flower” </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled. “Purple, I presume?”</p><p> </p><p>“You <em>presume</em> correctly, dear”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled. She pushed her tongue in her cheek, looking at the garden for where those flowers could go. Her mind instantly thought of the placement. The stone pathway that led from her driveway to the porch. A spot she always wanted to work on, but never got around to it. </p><p> </p><p>“Will those be in the experimental garden first?” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>“No, actually,” Rio said. “I grew them a while ago. Beautiful things” </p><p> </p><p>“They are..” Agatha agreed. “So? Can you?” </p><p>Rio imagined the flowers vividly. How they could create a border on either side of the path. A pretty field of them, leading to her front porch steps. It’d be a piece of Agatha leading her home. </p><p> </p><p>She pulled her lips back, refraining from the lunatic smile she wanted to let go of. </p><p> </p><p>“I can do that” Rio said, looking back to make sure she watched Agatha as she added, “Any more wishes, princess?”</p><p> </p><p>And <em>perfect.</em></p><p> </p><p>Her skin under the shade grew redder than the sun could ever burn her. She rushed to grab her book, take her eyes away, clearing her throat dramatically as she shook her head. Rio snickered, not caring if she was heard. The sight was too hysterical, adorable, funny as hell to ignore. </p><p> </p><p>“No- Now, chop chop!” Agatha waved her hand, opening her book. “Get to work!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked, nodded, even added a little salute. “Yes ma’am”</p><hr/><p>Another two weeks. Agatha still was still in pain. </p><p> </p><p>…Or, so Rio thought, anyway. </p><p> </p><p>Rio stumbled down the hallway late one night after falling asleep. She woke up from a bit of commotion, but figured Nicky was just getting water or Agatha had gone to the bathroom. Dressed in a giant shirt down to her knees, rubbing her eye while letting out a yawn-</p><p> </p><p>She heard something from the kitchen. </p><p> </p><p>The woman paused, listening closer to the shuffled feet and then noticed the subtle light shadow in the hallway. It was coming from the kitchen, followed by a few beeps signalling the fridge had been open too long. </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed. Maybe Agatha forgot to close the fridge. That had happened before. Especially when she was tired. The woman was scatter brained enough as it was, tiredness never helped. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head, muttering under her breath while making her way to the kitchen. Though her annoyance, frustration, tired eyes were swept away by the sight she found. </p><p> </p><p><em>“Snack time at three am, snack time at three am”</em> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was holding the fridge open with her hip. Her voice whispered those words in a soft mantra, but added her own singing to it as well. She gave a piece of cheese to Nicky, then herself, then Nicky..and herself. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t busting the two for eating late at night, telling Agatha to stop being noisy and go to bed. Rio wasn’t even acknowledging those things. What Rio was focusing on?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s feet were jumping. She was dancing side to side, having no limping or problem moving on her ankle at all. And instead of being mad how Agatha had milked this, faked the injury for longer than it had been?</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked, arms crossed as she cleared her throat. </p><p><br/>The singing stopped, both turned- Two deers in a pair of headlights. Rio wished in that moment she had her camera. </p><p> </p><p>“So! The ankle is feeling better, I take it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared, forgetting why she was asking until it clicked. Only then did she take a loud gasp, hissed as she tilted away. The fridge door shut behind her, only light in the room from the moon outside. Still bright enough for Rio to watch the dramatic scene before her. </p><p> </p><p>How Agatha dragged her ankle with every step, dropped and slouched in the chair. The cheese was tossed on the table, head tossed back as her eyes squeezed. </p><p> </p><p>“Nope! No, pain. Just…<em>ow</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, unable to keep her smile at bay. “How long have you been better? Also, how long has it been, <em>snack time at three am?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked over, realizing the jig was up. She was busted. Not just her ankle, but her and Nicky’s secret routine. To be fair, the boy played hard. Not like he was going to gain fifty pounds from a little bit of cheese! </p><p> </p><p>That didn’t matter though. Not when Agatha was terrified Rio would want her gone by sunrise. </p><p><br/>Even if they were on the up, only getting better and closer day by day- Agatha didn’t want to leave. Borderline living with Rio had made her the happiest she’d ever been in her whole life! She didn’t want to lose that and had to wait for it to return. </p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could reply, Rio shook her head with a little smirk. </p><p> </p><p>“Be up for work tomorrow. I’ll drive” </p><p> </p><p>“Wha-”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re better. Time for you to be on campus” She said. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned. “No! I’ll go next week”</p><p> </p><p>“Ag-”</p><p> </p><p>“Listen,” She pointed, sitting up in her chair. “Wanda will be very upset if I miss Thursday lunch tomorrow”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused. There was no way those two had still been hanging out. This had to be some stupid excuse for Agatha to try and get out of going back on campus. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t lie to me” Rio laughed. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not! Ask her yourself. She’s bringing subs this time and we even have a movie set up” </p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed. She’d choose her battles with this one. Even though the middle of the night discovery was amusing, she was still too tired to put up with it. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine. Monday morning though, you’re going back” She ordered.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll drive?” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Mhm”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lit up, smiling as she asked, “So…I can still be here?” </p><p> </p><p><em>Who said she could leave?</em></p><p> </p><p>Sure, the original plan was for Agatha’s ankle to heal enough to walk and then the woman would be on her way. That was weeks ago though. Before they spent more time than ever together. All before Rio realized how much she loved going home to Agatha being there, waiting to insult her or pester, annoy in one way or another. </p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, crossing the kitchen floor to run her fingers through Agatha’s hair. The younger woman moaned. Not one with lust or any sexual desire. She was content, the brush of Rio’s fingertips on her scalp felt good. Her head tilted back, eyes met Rio’s in the dim light. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re not leaving” Rio said. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha could die of happiness right then and there.</p><p> </p><p>“Guess I can be a patient diagnosed with stockholm syndrome” Agatha mused.</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorted. “Oh, totally. You’re very much a victim of a kidnapper in this situation” </p><p> </p><p>“I am” Agatha snickered. “Now, go to bed old woman”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was about to ask Agatha to follow. They hadn’t shared a bed since the night in Agatha’s where love confessions turned into days of silence, misunderstanding and poor communication. A reason Rio had been so stand offish. </p><p> </p><p>But now with Agatha staying, how her ankle was better, things were looking up?</p><p> </p><p>“Nicky and I were in the middle of a very good movie” </p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked. <em>Okay. Fine.</em> They could wait a little longer. More so, she could wait for Agatha to be in her bed. </p><p> </p><p>“Limit the cheese, Harkness. We don’t need a fat boy running around” </p><p> </p><p>“So, what are you running around as then?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face was serious before turning into a wicked, evil grin. Rio’s jaw dropped, hand moved to push Agatha’s head back. She turned, flipping the woman off behind. Agatha snorted, giggling like a mad woman. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off, Harkness!” </p><p> </p><p>“Night, Vidal!” </p><p> </p><p>She made sure to text Wanda before forgetting. Agatha lied about her ankle. She surely lied about those two making lunch plans together without her even knowing. Rio didn’t have an issue with that. Not at all, but it just felt like an excuse. </p><p> </p><p>By the next morning though, Rio would see the response. A quick, </p><p> </p><p><em>“Want me to bring you something from the restaurant?” </em></p><p> </p><p>She’d laugh in disbelief. How her best friend and whatever the hell Agatha was now were really hanging out on their own. It made her smile, bite on her bottom lip as her body vibrated with excitement. </p><p> </p><p>Not only was Agatha perfectly melting with her, she was fitting into her life like a puzzle piece. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky adored her. </p><p>Wanda had a new friend to hang out with. </p><p>Natasha seemed to like her as well. </p><p> </p><p>None of her exes ever passed the Natasha test. That was always the hardest. But, Agatha? She passed with flying colors the first time they met. Maybe that should’ve been the sign this was meant to be all along. </p><hr/><p>Sunday rolled around, the final day before Agatha was back on campus. Rio was poorly hiding her excitement over that. Even if she thought she was doing great? Agatha could see right through it how she was happy. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had no complaints over that. She grew to love working from home. </p><p> </p><p><em>Rio’s home? Our home? </em>Whatever, she loved being in pajama bottoms and hanging out with Nicky, mid week lunches with Wanda. It was nice. </p><p> </p><p>Alas, her students needed her on campus. Parts of her did miss the classroom, seeing them face to face. She knew Billy was itching to race to her classroom first thing, have lunch with her and help catch her up to speed on all the latest drama (Rio sucked at doing that). It was time to go back. </p><p> </p><p>Especially now with Rio driving and them showing up together. She still wondered how that’d look. What the others would say or do. </p><p> </p><p>Though, Agatha and Rio hadn’t discussed things yet. Would they be out about them? Or just two friends, still enemies, maybe they’d lie how Agatha’s car broke down and Rio was driving her. </p><p> </p><p>There were positives and negatives with Agatha going back to work on campus. Above all, the major perk was Rio down the hall. Not far at all. She loved gazing in between classes and now. And <em>oh hell- </em> it’d hit differently than ever before. Agatha already planned little ways to drive her crazy from afar. </p><p> </p><p>Flirting, teasing, both things had increased day by day. Though they hadn’t kissed since that day, Agatha still hadn't slept in Rio’s bed. It went unspoken they were together in one way or another, but taking it slow. Not pressing into the gas with no brakes like before. </p><p> </p><p>Easy, steady, but that didn’t mean Agatha wasn’t going to be a dangerous flirt from afar. To be fair as Rio’s enemy, she was never an innocent saint to begin with. </p><p> </p><p>They spent the morning at Agatha’s to grab a few things. Neither noticed how three small boxes of belongings were packed in the car. Wasn’t it the lesbian stereotype to move into your girlfriend’s place in a short period of time? At least Agatha was doing it overtime, well..her belongings, anyway. </p><p><br/>And hey, technically they weren’t girlfriends yet. </p><p> </p><p>The afternoon was spent outside. Rio worked on organizing her shed while Agatha played with Nicky. She tossed his ball, he would grab it and run back all happy as if Agatha was making his entire world. </p><p> </p><p>It was nice, calm. A peaceful Sunday. One of many Agatha would love to have a routine, grow accustomed to. </p><p> </p><p>“Ag,” Rio said as she was exiting the house, water in hand. “Billy's calling” </p><p> </p><p>She nodded, tossing the ball before heading inside to grab it. Most likely he was just going over what time Agatha would be there, offer to bring her lunch and definitely would bring a coffee. Plus, he'd been quiet for the last two weeks. Agatha would wait till the next day to pester him on a potential new date though. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey kid,” Agatha said, stepping back outside to grab the ball from Nicky. “What's up?”</p><p> </p><p><em>“Hey! Just checking in. All set for tomorrow? You sure you'll be okay?”</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickered. “No, I'll fall face first the second I walk in and we'll be at the ER as my head is gushing blood out onto the floor” </p><p> </p><p>Rio tossed her head over her shoulder with a snicker. Both of them smiling wide as Billy groaned in disgust. </p><p> </p><p><em>“Ew! No, you know- I'm just making sure” </em></p><p> </p><p>“I know” She said. “I'll text you when I get to my room. Sound good?” </p><p> </p><p><em>“That works!” </em></p><p> </p><p>He then spilled into a full ramble about how he kept Agatha's classroom clean. How the janitor didn't mop there till just last week, his excuse being it wasn't used- So what was the point? </p><p> </p><p><em>“I was having none of that! I even said Professor Harkness is back after an injury. Things should be spotless!” </em></p><p> </p><p>She snickered, saying a soft thanks, but how he didn't need to do that. </p><p> </p><p>It was simple things, little tangents and excitement to catch Agatha up to speed on all the latest drama on campus. Between other professors, students- Billy may come off too innocent for his own good. But that boy <em>loved </em>to gossip. A reason they got along so well. </p><p> </p><p><em>“Oh! And for Miami,”</em> Billy sang. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused. She was in the middle of tossing the ball when her smile faded, hand dropped, and Nicky paused- waiting for the ball to go flying. </p><p> </p><p><em>Where is he going? </em></p><p> </p><p><em>“Everything is nearly ready. I have a list of what you need to do. Plane ticket, packing- I already have an AirBNB for all of us in mind. Gotta’ confirm with Lilia because she wants to pay for that. The rest of us can chip in on other things and-” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Miami?” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had tuned out after Agatha's sarcastic comment about blood and her head. She was focused on rearranging boxes, fixing up and organizing the shelf when the city name entered her head. </p><p> </p><p>She took a step out the shed door, seeing Agatha frozen. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean by our trip to Miami, William?” </p><p> </p><p><em>Shit. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio hated how her stomach turned. How she felt nauseated, sick on the spot. To be fair though the last time Agatha went on a trip? They went from love confessions to silence and on the edge of never speaking again. </p><p> </p><p>What would happen now if she left? They were just getting better and better and-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's eyes shot up at Rio. Shock, confusion, all covered her and was heard through her words as she rushed-</p><p> </p><p>“Did you know about this?” She pointed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio put the box down, wiping her hands off on her jeans as she walked over. </p><p> </p><p>“Know about what?” </p><p> </p><p>“Lilia's retirement trip at the end of the semester. Kid says you signed the sheet to go to Miami with the group from work” </p><p> </p><p><em>“Well, you both signed-”</em></p><p> </p><p>“I signed? When the hell did I sign?” Agatha asked. “I fucking hate Miami!”  </p><p> </p><p>Rio knew Billy was getting nervous on the other line. Agatha did in fact hate cities, especially south where it was always miserably hot. And the shock as well didn't seem to help her reaction. </p><p> </p><p>Besides, Billy already knew the two were more than enemies. Wouldn't hurt to take over. </p><p> </p><p>“Give me the phone, babe” Rio muttered, bringing it to her ear. “What are you on about?” </p><p> </p><p><em>“..Oh my god, Ri- Professor Vid-”</em></p><p> </p><p>“I said you can call me, Rio. Remember?” </p><p> </p><p><em>“Yes! Yes, I'm sorry. I just- I didn't expect-”</em></p><p> </p><p>“What about Miami?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p><em>“When I asked you to sign the sheet to go?” He tried to recall the memory for her. “You signed. It was when you wanted to walk with me and-”</em></p><p> </p><p>“Shit” </p><p> </p><p>Rio turned, seeing Agatha with an arm over her stomach, elbow rested on top as her fingers flickered in the air. </p><p> </p><p>“What's <em>shit</em> mean?” </p><p> </p><p>“The clipboard. The sheets he's been bringing in” Rio said. “It was for the trip to Miami” </p><p> </p><p>They stared in silence before whispering as they turned away in sync, </p><p> </p><p>“Shit!” </p><p> </p><p>Billy stammered, landing on the words.<em> “We've been all talking about this for weeks-”</em></p><p> </p><p>“They've been talking about it for weeks..” Rio said. </p><p> </p><p>“You've been there!” Agatha turned. “See? This is what we get for you refusing to get information from others-”</p><p> </p><p>“Information is drama, Agatha and I hate that shit” Rio said. “And I'm sorry, I've been focused on taking care of your injured ass and had fought with you before. So my <em>weeks</em> have been a bit busy!” </p><p> </p><p>Billy nervously chuckled, reminding Rio he was on the other end of the phone. She sighed, running a hand through her hair. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” She muttered. “Just- When is-”</p><p> </p><p><em>“You both should have two emails from me about it. I just sent the recent one yesterday” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. Great-”</p><p> </p><p>“I hate Miami. This is not in fact <em>great”</em></p><p> </p><p>“Honey, please shut up” Rio muttered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha blushed at the name. Especially since Rio said it so casually, fearless with another person on the phone to hear. </p><p> </p><p>“Just saying..” She grumbled, kicking the grass with a pout. </p><p> </p><p><em>“I mean, if you two don't want to go- I'm sure we can change things and-”</em></p><p> </p><p>“No, no” Rio shook her head. “We're going-”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?!” Agatha whined. “It's so gross down there and-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, reaching over to press her palm against Agatha's lips. Muffling her voice, pushing her a bit back. </p><p> </p><p>“For her retirement, right?” </p><p> </p><p><em>“Right” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Okay. I'll take a look tonight. We'll see you tomor- <em>EW! Don't LICK ME!” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted as Rio jumped back, wiping her hand on her shirt. </p><p> </p><p>“Really? You find me licking your hand gross, but not when I-”</p><p> </p><p><em>“I'VE GOT TO GO NOW! TALK TO YOU TOMORROW!” </em>Billy yelled, saving his own life from more disgust. </p><p> </p><p>Rio dropped Agatha's phone, not caring for a second if it broke as she jumped her. </p><p> </p><p>“You know what's great about no sprained ankle?!” She yelled, laughing as Agatha screamed out with a laugh of her own. “Free to kick your ass!” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha cackled, stumbling with Rio on her back before they both collapsed in the yard. Nicky chased over, circling them as the two tried to tackle the other down. Laughter filled the air, insults and cursing matched.</p><p> </p><p>Ultimately, Agatha had the upper hand. She was on top, Rio's wrists pinned on the ground above her head. Both panting, out of breath, smiling like two fools with dirt marks. Dirty leaves, strands of grass decorated their hair. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said. “Then I won't have to go to Miami- <em>Which I NEVER KNEW ABOUT!” </em></p><p> </p><p>“I didn't either!” Rio smiled. “But we're going-”</p><p> </p><p>“No!” </p><p> </p><p>“It's Lilia's retirement. Come<em> ON.</em> You have to. She's done so much for both of us” </p><p> </p><p>Rio's voice had become sincere. Agatha knew she was right. As much as she hated the idea of going on a trip. Especially down south to a city she despised (For reasons Rio would learn when they got there), they had to. </p><p> </p><p>Besides…a little trip with Rio couldn't hurt, right? Even if they had their co-workers there? </p><p> </p><p>“Fine” Agatha huffed. “But this still wouldn't have happened if you actually listened and did what I asked-”</p><p> </p><p>“Well then don't distract me faking an injury-”</p><p> </p><p>“It was real!” </p><p> </p><p>“Not for that long!” Rio laughed. </p><p> </p><p>They both laughed, smiling at each other like fools. Agatha's hands moved off Rio's wrists to pick strands of grass out of her own hair. Rio watched from below, mesmerized by the goddess straddling her waist. </p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck.</em> She missed this sight. </p><p> </p><p>Instantly her clit felt a pulse that made her body shiver. The memory replayed in her mind at a violent speed. </p><p> </p><p><em>“Come on, baby” Rio whispered. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha panted from above, legs straddled Rio's hips with the silicone strap buried deep.</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“You can do it-”</em></p><p> </p><p><em>“It's so much” Agatha whispered through a little whimper. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>Rio brought her hands up to hold her waist, helping her bounce on the toy. Gently forcing her to go faster than she was before. It ripped out a stronger moan, Agatha's tits bounced with every move. Her head tossed back, mouth open and Rio swore she saw a bit of drool down her chin. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>“Doing so good for me,” Rio rasped. “First time riding and you're taking me so well, huh?” </em></p><p> </p><p><em>“Uh-huh” Agatha nodded. “So good, Rio” </em></p><p> </p><p><em>Not a few seconds later did Agatha's body tremble. She hunched over, held tight onto Rio's shirt as she screamed out Rio's name mixed with curse words in between. The sight was unreal. Rio felt Agatha's cum dripping, sliding off the harness onto her waist. </em></p><p> </p><p><em>She licked her lips, shook her head. “God, that was so fucking hot” </em></p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha smiled as she tried to catch her breath. “Told you so” </em></p><p> </p><p><em>Rio snickered. “Guess I'll say you're right for once” </em></p><p> </p><p>Before Rio was able to act on the memory- A loud beeping noise came from inside the house. Agatha looked up, panicked struck through as she remembered, </p><p> </p><p>“I was cooking. Shit!” </p><p> </p><p>She jumped, nearly falling as she ran back inside to save whatever was in the oven. Rio hadn't asked what was for dinner. Instead, she wanted to be surprised. </p><p> </p><p>Typically she'd run behind her, check to see if everything was okay. However, Agatha didn't call her name and Nicky wasn't losing his mind like there was a fire. </p><p> </p><p>So…she stayed. </p><p> </p><p>Her chest would rise and fall at a fast pace, then slowly became steady as she grounded herself back from where she was.</p><p> </p><p>So close to having Agatha's lips on hers.</p><p>So close to reliving those moments from before. </p><p>So close to fully stepping out of this weird friends, but not friends zone they were in. </p><p> </p><p><em>That I put us in.</em> Rio remembered. </p><p> </p><p>She sighed. Hands over her face, eyes closed with a few thoughts cursing herself out screamed in her mind. Luckily though every insult, complaint, all of her own words settled with one final thought, </p><p> </p><p><em>Miami. </em></p><p> </p><p>This trip could be it. The make or break, time away, summer to reclaim love and not fear it any longer. Maybe this is what they needed. A sign from the universe how they both signed up without realizing it. Too caught up in their own drama to pay attention to anything else. </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled. She thought about the ocean, taking Agatha there and watching sunsets, sunrises. Sight seeing, shopping trips to spoil her with clothes and whatever her heart desired. </p><p> </p><p>The woman loved the idea of teasing her around the others. Maybe she'd even wear a bikini for the first time. But, that'd be out of her comfort zone. No woman ever made her tempted to explore that unknown territory. She'd have to think about it. </p><p> </p><p><em>“Rio!”</em> Agatha yelled.<em> “Do you want to order pizza?!” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered, shaking her head as she pushed up onto her elbows. Head tossed back, neck strained as she yelled, </p><p> </p><p><em>“Is my kitchen still standing?!” </em></p><p> </p><p>The silence is what actually scared her. It's what forced her to jump to her feet, ditch the thought about Miami or the memory that had played in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>She ran in, finding Agatha with a tray of burnt garlic knots and-</p><p> </p><p>“Did you burn pasta?” Rio asked in disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was surprisingly an amazing cook. Rio learned it over the last few weeks when she came home to a cooked meal nearly every night. So to see her a hot mess, burnt food and smoke filled the air. </p><p> </p><p>“The hell happened here?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed. She tossed the tray on the stove, crossed her arms and stood back. </p><p> </p><p>“Miami..” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha said, but didn't sound like the pouting Rio thought was a funny joke. It was serious. Something more than just nothing. </p><p> </p><p>“Fucking Miami..” </p><p> </p><p>Rio frowned. She almost asked, but Agatha left the room without a sound. Leaving Rio to wonder behind her..</p><p> </p><p><em>Why does she hate Miami?</em></p><p> </p>
