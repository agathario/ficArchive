<p><b>London, 1813.</b></p><p>“Where is he?!” Evanora barked, storming through the halls.</p><p>William, for all his faults, did his very best. “Viscountess Harkness, your son is a bit under the weather-”</p><p>She whipped her head towards William, shooting daggers. “Why is he still employing you? Every time I see you, you look one breath away from a fainting spell!”</p><p>“I was never dismissed,” William muttered under his breath as Evanora pushed past him and burst into the room.</p><p>“My god!” Evanora shrieked, her skirt swishing as she frantically ripped the covers from the bed.</p><p>Agatha roused, taking in a sharp breath as the chill hit her body. The women next to her stirred, only then did Agatha realize their current state—naked from the night before. Her chest was still smothered by its bindings, but it did not remedy the current predicament much. “Mother-”</p><p>Evanora flung the duvet down. “Would it cost you a great deal to show this family a modicum of respect?!” She paced at the foot of the bed while Agatha covered herself and her guest. “She is paid for, yes?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha groaned. “Of course.” Her mother might keep Agatha, or rather—<i>Augustus</i>—on a short leash, but she was not daft enough to consort with a lady of nobility. Every partner Agatha took was a prostitute who was compensated handsomely for her humility and silence. “To what do I owe this pleasure,” she grinned.</p><p>“We are to be at the Maximoff’s in less than an hour!” Evanora scowled.</p><p>“I will not be attending," Agatha stated. “I have no desire or use for a wife.” She slumped further into the mattress. “If that is all…”</p><p>Her mother nodded towards another servant, the man then shucking open the blinds. “You will be ready in the next twenty minutes, lest I drag you out by your ear.”</p><p>“I-”</p><p>“<i>Augustus,</i>” Evanora lowered her voice in warning. “This family will die with you unless you take a wife, it is crucial you find a lady of stature this season. I have let you have free rein for long enough.”</p><p>“Take a wife and do what, exactly?” Agatha quirked a brow. “I cannot sire you an heir. The bloodline was already destined to perish with me!”</p><p>Evanora stomped her foot, the black fabric of her gown crinkling as she did so. Even twenty-five years later, she still opted to wear her mourning attire. Agatha secretly thought it was because Evanora liked the way black made her seem cold and unapproachable. “We have a reputation to uphold.” She pointed between Agatha and the other woman. “This will not be the reputation you create for us. A viscount cannot miss a societal gathering to be entangled with a whore!”</p><p>Agatha ran her hands over her face, deflating. “Yes, mother.”</p><p>“I will await your arrival out front,” she stated. “Make haste.”</p><p>William took care of the woman, Maria, Agatha thinks her name was. She took to getting dressed, though there were many servants to aid her, she preferred to do it herself. As she did not get to pick how she presented to the world, she could have power on how she presented within the scope of what was expected. Her hair was exceptionally long, though she kept back in a neat braid. She wore trousers made of fine fabric as men of her station had, followed by a high-collard shirt, vest, and tailcoat. Agatha’s features helped her to pass in society, her sharp jawline, thick eyebrows, and prominent nose. Her mother always said she was destined to be a boy, for she did not possess the beauty to reflect a woman’s.</p><p>She slinked into the carriage, tuning out her mother’s rambles. Ultimately, for Evanora, Agatha’s search for a wife was not about ensuring the bloodline. It was about fitting in with societal expectations. Her mother chose to raise her as a boy after the passing of the former viscount Harkness, Agatha’s father. She was merely a month old when he died, and fearing losing everything, Evanora doctored the birth records and smudged the ink—claiming that <i>Agatha</i> was truly <i>Augustus.</i> As nobody would dare question a grieving viscountess, the legal change was recorded and kept.</p><p>There were pros—formal and higher education, no debut, no entertaining of men. However, she was expected to socialize with men, though not many cared for Augustus. Perhaps she had pointed out their biases one too many times, or did not see the merit in tackling one another to the ground. Men were brutish meatheads who were all obsessed with defining a woman based on arbitrary societal standards. The women were a nice touch, though. She never took any woman under false pretenses, revealing her true form before continuing—for most, it was not a deal breaker.</p><p>“I do not see why the choice is not clear, you and Wanda have been the best of friends since you were small,” Evanora said as they pulled up. “She will accept you while others will fear you.”</p><p>Wanda had been the one female friend Agatha had kept all her life, having grown up so close in proximity to one another. The redhead already knew Agatha’s secret, her real body, but their relationship was always platonic. She was a couple years younger than Agatha, closing in on becoming a spinster if she did not marry this season. The Maximoff’s were scrambling, Wanda needed to be married off despite the dowry, and Pietro needed to marry in order to keep their family afloat.</p><p>“It would be akin to me marrying my sister,” Agatha grumbled. “Wanda yearns for children, a family. I will not deprive her of a life with a <i>real</i> man.”</p><p>Evanora scoffed, the carriage coming to a stop and the footman opening her door. “You will be wed this season, pick a girl and marry her before she realizes your deformity. You are tarnishing your father’s legacy and embarrassing our very name. Do you hear me?”</p><p>She slowly nodded, staring at her hands. “Yes.”</p><p>“Excellent.” Evanora studied her for a moment. “Now, fix your voice. I did not give good money for you to speak in such a manner.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, consciously placing her voice in a lower register. Throughout adolescence, her mother had forced her to go to ‘speech therapy’ every day. No matter if it was a weekend or a holiday. As most who participated in such therapy were considered slow and dull, Agatha was too—however hers was not for a reason other than to condition her to speak in the way men did. In addition, she was made to bind her chest once puberty hit, and Evanora would know if she hadn’t. There were days at a time where Agatha would be locked in her room, weeping for her mother to let her out. The staff would try to take mercy on her, sneak her food, but that always resulted in the servant being dismissed immediately. Her hair was only long as it was now because Agatha was too grown to be pinned down as her mother cut it, a regular occurrence until she had turned eighteen and fought back.</p><p>Agatha got out, rounding the carriage and reluctantly offering her mother her arm and escorted her through the grand hall of the home and out to the lawn. A garden party was a most insipid affair, standing in the sun and sipping bland lemonade in the name of a mating ritual. Evanora almost instantly broke away, finding a group of mother hens to cluck with, whispering and judging the poor girls who were essentially up for auction. Agatha did not hate her masculinity, her relationship with it often ebbed and flowed. Gratitude often filled her lungs as she witnessed these gatherings, for she was exempt. However, she did miss existence before the rigidity of duty.</p><p>As viscount, Agatha managed her family’s estate and wealth—having found she had a knack for numbers early on in life. She participated in the House of Lords, a fancy  name for standing around and holding court with drunken men. She routinely appeared in the House of Commons, though her political ambitions ended there. Most men went away to finish their education prior to university, Agatha did not as Evanora did not want her cohabitating with other boys and coming back indecent. That was before Agatha had assuaged her mother’s fears—Agatha would not be giving Evanora an heir the old fashioned way. It weighed on her, in a perfect world, Agatha would be a mother—well, father.</p><p>“Lord Harkness!” Wanda came bounding across the lawn, improperly bunching the red satin of her skirt to arrive faster.</p><p>Agatha smiled, authentically. She opened her arms to catch the other woman, chuckling as Wanda’s arms encircled her. An improper show of affection, as unwed men and women should not touch, but it was not one of romance. “Wanda.”</p><p>She let go after a beat, grabbing her—his—face. “You have left me destitute for far too long.”</p><p>“I hardly left you destitute,” Agatha snorted. “I have been in the country, at my estate.”</p><p>“Is that not what I said…in essence,” she giggled. “Your mother has been speaking to my mother.”</p><p>“Oh, well that cannot be good,” he grimaced.</p><p>“Apparently you and I are meant to be married by the end of this season.” Wanda then rolled her eyes, clasping her hands in front of her. “My parents are essentially already packing my luggage.”</p><p>“I would not curse you with such a plight,” Augustus pursed his lips. “You want for motherhood, do you not?”</p><p>Her eyes appeared near emerald in the sun, her smile as warm as the summer breeze. “I do, but I also want for a kind husband. I know you would treat me well. I could do far worse.”</p><p>He gave her hand a delicate squeeze. “A life lived as a lie is not a life lived well.”</p><p>“So, pray tell, how will you weasel your way out of this one?” She furrowed her brows. “Evanora is on a warpath, you cannot escape this time.”</p><p>The tension in his shoulder was instinctual. “You say it as though I will have swarms of debutantes after me.”</p><p>“You may famously be a rake,” Wanda scoffed. “But you are handsome, wealthy, and titled. Mothers will be hurling their daughters your way.”</p><p>“And what comes of my wife on the wedding night?” He quietly prodded. “I have trapped a young woman and crushed her hopes, stolen her innocence for my own gain. You cannot call me kind and then detail an exceptionally cruel act.”</p><p>“It is not cruel,” she corrected. “There are many women who would not take issue. Various new girls have presented and entered the pool this season.”</p><p>He huffed out a gruff laugh. “None that should deserve a burden that great.”</p><p>She turned around, interlocking her arm with his as she scanned the lawn. Her finger pointed to one young lady in a lavender gown, flowing brunette locks down her back. “Kate Bishop. Father is a compulsive gambler, but good family.”</p><p>“Wanda, she cannot be more than seventeen.” He whispered in shock. “She should be completing her studies, not sold to some man thrice her age.”</p><p>“You are twenty-five, not sixty.” She began walking with him over the perfectly manicured grass. “Cassandra Lang. Her mother has said she will not settle for less than a duke for her daughter, though.”</p><p>“Why do you keep pointing to literal infants?” He hissed.</p><p>“That is what happens when girls present before eighteen,” she shrugged.</p><p>His gaze swept along the crowd, if not for anything but to humor his friend. Blue tracked along a multitude of women, some he recognized, some he had never seen before. His eyes froze on one girl—woman—in particular. She was off near the pond, crouched down in the most unladylike way, studying the flowers that had taken root near the body of water. She was not smelling them as women often did, no, it appeared to look like she was running her hand over a singular petal, trying to commit the sensation to memory. Her hair ended at her shoulders in soft waves, a rich brown that was stark against the sage green of her dress. He could only make out her profile, but her nose was one he’d only ever seen in his art studies.</p><p>“Who is that?” He nodded towards the pond where the woman was trying to carefully avoid mud on the hem of her dress. “Most peculiar to roll in dirt at a function, is it not?”</p><p>Wanda smirked, tilting her head inquisitively at him. “Rio Vidal. Her family had not participated in years past, she presented this year—at twenty-six, god help her. Rumor has it that her father is on the brink of losing their wealth and his title. Her dowry is apparently <i>barely</i> over four figures, they cannot afford more. Her lineage is rather reclusive, her mother is English but her father is from a Spanish colony in the Caribbean Sea. I believe he was only titled due to his wife being an heiress.”</p><p>“Tweny-six?” He echoed. “She is, by all accounts, a spinster.”</p><p>“They are praying to god that someone will pluck her off the shelf, I fear.”</p><p>He watched as the woman, as Rio, was dragged away from her exploration by what he could only assume was her mother. “Have you spoken with her?”</p><p>She stopped walking, curling her lips. “Why do you ask, my lord? Are you taking an interest in the spinster?”</p><p>“No!” Augustus defended. “She is most odd, and I…”</p><p>“Find it endearing.”</p><p>“You did not answer my question,” he retorted.</p><p>Wanda let out a heavy breath. “She does not talk much to the other girls, I have only exchanged a few words with her. She does not seem pleased to be on the marriage mart.”</p><p>“Well, why ever would she be,” he replied, mostly to himself.</p><p>“You-” Wanda did not get another word in before her brother, Pietro, summoned her. She petted his shoulder as goodbye, a temporary farewell, there was a ball tonight that Augustus was also required to attend.</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably as young woman after young woman approached once Wanda was free of his arm, he didn’t see Rio again—despite the time he spent looking.</p><hr/><p>“Alice, please!” Rio wheezed, half bent over a chair as her lady’s maid yanked the strings of her corset.</p><p>“Tighter,” Rio’s mother demanded. “Men desire a small waist and full bosom, since you spend your days toiling in the garden, you are too lanky. Therefore, we have to squeeze everything we possibly can for your bust to attract a suitor.”</p><p>Alice hesitated, murmuring, “I am sorry,” before pulling again.</p><p>Oh, her ribs were going to <i>crack.</i> “Mama, I cannot breathe!”</p><p>Her mother came around in front of her, getting down so her face was level with Rio’s. “This would not be happening if you were not so insistent on wasting your time playing in mud like a man. Women <i>pick</i> the flowers, they do not plant them. We have staff for that.”</p><p>“We will not have staff for much longer,” Rio bit out, attempting to expand her lungs and being denied by the boning encasing her torso. “So I may as well be useful at a trade.”</p><p>Victoria cocked her head, hands on her hips in offense. “We are still part of society, and we will remain to be just as soon as you find a husband.” She then walked behind Rio, placing a hand on her waist as if she could feel that her waist was now the correct size. She gave an affirmative nod to Alice before stating,  “You will have a full dance card at the ball tonight, or so help me god, I will rip out all those bulbs and flowers and leave it as a dirt patch.”</p><p>She winced as Alice began tying the cords, beginning to feel woozy. “My head is light, please, just let it out an inch,” Rio whimpered. “I will attract no man if I am on the floor!”</p><p>Rio hoped to attract no man at all. Rio wished to return back home, not the countryside but Puerto Rico. She had been raised there most of her life until her mother got homesick and they returned to London, the move costing them most of whatever wealth her family had. Her papá had made several bad investments, mismanaged funds, and here she was. The likelihood of a titled man choosing her of the whole lot of women was already slim, but the ritual of it all made her sick. Her parents scraped the last of what they had as a dowry, and trussed her up like a cow to the highest bidder as a means of recuperating their riches. One could not end up on the streets if their daughter married well—Rio thought she was more to her parents than a piece of property, but you learn something new every day.</p><p>More so than that, Rio did not care for men. She supposed they were the other half of the population and that was…<i>fine.</i> Her dream of living her life unwed and unshackled was slowly deteriorating with each passing day, unfortunately. She wished to keep her family afloat, as every child did, but it came at a cost that she did not know she could pay. Men were oafish fools who considered women objects, nothing more than mother, wife, sister, daughter. Additionally, Rio could not understand why so many women found them attractive, they all resembled thumbs. There was nothing enchanting about being bought and made to push out a man’s child, whether willingly or unwillingly.</p><p>She wanted to go to university, ideally. That idea was crushed nearly immediately when her mother put her in society lessons on how to be a perfect wife and hostess. She was reprimanded for her mouth, or rather, what often came out of it. It was not her fault that most did not seem to see the appeal in a woman speaking her mind, men are often regarded highly for the exact same habit. Her dance card would not be full at this ball tonight, she would not allow it.</p><p>“Just an inch,” Victoria seethed. “No more.”<br/>
</p><p>Alice gave the strings some slack as Rio gulped down air. Her maid then began the ties again, asking, “Better?”</p><p>“Minimally,” Rio answered, short of breath.</p><p>“Get dressed,” Victoria commanded, leaving the room. “And if I see you with that notebook recording the flora and fauna of the grounds, I will drown it in the lake!”</p><p>Once her mother was gone, Alice let the corset out more, whispering, “Do you require your flask tonight?”</p><p>“Well, if she does not permit my notebook…”</p><p>The ball was much like the others she had been coerced into attending—dull. Rio kept to the wall, observing rather than participating. Her mother was off consorting with the rest of the eager and overbearing mothers, flocking together and picking at their daughters like crows. Her dance card remained wonderfully barren, content to watch as young lady after young lady bent over backwards to please a man who would take his company to a different debutante a few minutes later. She could not wrap her mind around how Wanda was still unwed at twenty-three, all the suitors huddled around her as she laughed on cue and said exactly what they wanted to hear.</p><p>Her peace was interrupted by a man—as is the root of every woman’s suffering. He smiled, giving a small bow, which she was obliged to return. He was tall, well over six foot, muscly and hairy. The orange toned hair on his face alone made Rio heave in disgust. “Your name?” He questioned, acting rather entitled to it.</p><p>“Rio,” she politely smiled back, putting her arms behind her back to hide the dance card wound around her wrist.</p><p>“Peter,” the man gave back. “Lord Quill, if we are to be formal.”</p><p>“Goodie for you,” she said, her voice flat.</p><p>“I was hoping to be afforded the pleasure of a dance.” He outstretched his hand in offering.</p><p>Rio flailed her wrist around, the card whipping around before he could actually see. “Full up, my apologies.”</p><p>He swiveled his head. “And these partners would be…?”</p><p>“Yet to surface, I’m afraid,” she nervously chuckled, he probably thought it was her flirting.</p><p>“That is concerning, a beauty such as yourself should not be stuck to the wall,” he smoothly responded.</p><p>Rio anxiously fidgeted with the top of her evening glove, her emerald gown suffocating her very being. “I do not mind the wall, at least it is <i>quiet.</i>”</p><p>“Do you not care for noise? I have always wished for a docile wife, soft-spoken. They make the best mothers, you do not have to concern yourself with backtalk or rebellious children.”</p><p>Her eyes sharpened into daggers at that comment, bile rising in her throat as she tried to digest those words. “And how would that work?”</p><p>“What ever do you mean?”</p><p>“The children.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Well, I suppose my mind cannot calculate how they would come out of the womb considering their father to be so incredibly <i>pigheaded,</i>” she mocked. “The birth canal is only so wide after all.” Rio shrugged. “Though, perhaps my womanly brain is missing a key component.”</p><p>Peter sucked his teeth for a moment, his jaw turning to steel. “Ah, I see now why you are on the shelf. No man in his right mind would take on such an inconvenient woman.”</p><p>She nodded. “I am always amenable to help open one’s eyes.”</p><p>The lord apparently cut his losses, stalking away back to the center of the ballroom. It was stifling, the looks of others as Peter returned to his group, snickering in warning of Rio. She pushed herself off the wall, double-checking that her mother was too occupied to notice her sneaking out to the back balcony. She closed the doors in a huff, standing in the shadows near the stone railing as she rooted around in her corset. Yes, she might be thin, but the extra room in her corset that her bust did not fill made for a wonderful compartment for a flask.</p><p>Rio whipped off the cap, greedily downing the liquor and finding solace in the burn of it. She was too careless  unfortunately, the sound of someone clearing their throat emanating from the other end of the balcony. She choked on the booze, coughing through the swallow as she wiped the corners of her mouth. “Oh-”</p><p>The first thing she noticed was his smile, it was lazy and undone. The next was his attire; his coat slung over the railing, sleeves rolled up, ascot untied, and vest unbuttoned. His fingers, boney and long, clutched a cigarette. His hair was braided and parallel his spine, quite unusual for a man of nobility to wear such a fashion of hairstyle. He languidly below out a drag. “Please, do not stop on my account.”</p><p>“I- I did not see you.” She pointed to the doors. “I would not have…” A debutante drinking during a ball—if her mother caught wind, she’d never see that notebook again.</p><p>“Forgive me,” she rambled. “Mr….?”</p><p>“<i>Lord.</i>” He flicked the ashes over the railing. “Harkness. Augustus if you’d prefer.”</p><p>She scrunched her face. “Do you have a nickname? Or did your parents not consider the history of that name and the Roman dictator that it is associated with?”</p><p>“He was an emperor,” Augustus corrected. “You may call me August if that suits your needs.”</p><p>“I do not have a need,” Rio replied. “It was a simple question.”</p><p>He smiled brighter at that, for some insane reason. August shuffled closer, extending the cigarette. “Want to share?”</p><p>She stilled, because yes, a cigarette would soothe much of her current state. But what man who was only partially appropriately dressed, could be trustworthy. “Is this a trap? Do you mean to get me in trouble?”</p><p>“It was a simple question,” he parroted, wiggling his fingers. “I should require payment in whatever the flask contains, however. It is only fair.”</p><p>“Very well, then.” She forked over the flask, taking the smoke in tandem. An even exchange. “It’s rum.”</p><p>“A woman of good taste,” he hummed. “Oh, wait.” August set the flask on the railing, taking back the cigarette and perching it between full lips as he began to unroll her silk evening glove.</p><p>Rio flinched, taking her arm back. “What on earth are you doing?”</p><p>He held up his hands in surrender. “I assume you are being chaperoned tonight by your mother,” he evenly explained. “Should you return to her smelling of smoke, I do not think she’d be happy.”</p><p>She blinked a few times. Being alone with a man unchaperoned is improper, should someone find them she would be ruined. He would be fine, of course, unharmed and undamaged. But Rio’s family would be out of options. Rio rolled down her own glove, gingerly placing it over the railing, and snatching the smoke out of his mouth. “I do not require assistance for that, my lord.”</p><p>He snorted and it sounded close to the night her and papá went to the symphony. There was something rather entrancing about his face, possibly his nose. It looked to be carved from marble, his cheekbones high but not in the way that most men’s were. “You are right.” He picked up the flask and drank a shot as she inhaled a drag. “Is there a reason you are hiding?”</p><p>“Do I require one?” She exhaled a cloud of smoke, the tobacco easing her woes. “You try being paraded around and valued based on your ability to be kept and bred. It is a wretched tradition, to be sold off like you are an object.”</p><p>“I agree.”</p><p>Her face contorted in shock. “You do?”</p><p>“I have always found it quite strange that society has declared women the inferior sex when we are dependent on them to bear all life,” he rasped. “We discount half the population based on nothing more than the body they are born in. Set up rigid structures and procedures. What sex should possess which pursuits. It is nauseating.”</p><p>“Well, I…” Rio found herself a bit stupefied. “Yes.”</p><p>“I do not blame you for drinking your sorrows away,” he laughed. “My mother has most likely been looking for me, hence my own quest to find respite.”</p><p>“At least that is equal across the sexes—overbearing matriarchs.”</p><p>Rio furiously sucked in the smoke as he capped the flask, handing it back. “This has been most delightful. We should do it again sometime.”</p><p>She took the flask, knitting her brows together. “You wish to speak to me again and yet you did not ask my name.”</p><p>He threw on his coat and languidly buttoned his vest, though Rio’s eyes lingered at the sliver of collarbone still on display. “I already know it.”</p><p>She tilted her head. “You did not fasten your ascot.”</p><p>He tugged on the fabric. “I do not know how, I usually have a person for that.”</p><p>She stuck the cigarette between her lips, the shade of pink her mother had slapped on her before they left now coating the filter. Rio crossed the distance, taking both ends of the fabric and crossing one over the other. “You are meant to be highly educated, you cannot tie a bow?”</p><p>He raised his chin, grinning as he quipped, “Just because men are educated does not mean they are intelligent.”</p><p>She finished the bow, smoothing out any puckering. Rio raised a single brow as she took the cigarette between two fingers again, blowing the smoke off to the side of the man. “Another topic we agree on.”</p><p>“How thrilling,” August smirked.</p><p>“Thrilling indeed,” she deadpanned.</p><p>“Thank you for the help and the conversation.” He sauntered over to the door before adding, “I do hope we cross paths again, Rio.”</p><p>She tucked her tongue against her cheek. “How do you know my name?”</p><p>“How would I not know the name of a woman as fascinating as you,” he winked as punctuation. “Goodnight, miss Vidal.”</p><p>Her cheeks felt unnervingly hot as she echoed, “Goodnight, my lord.”</p><p>His hand was on the door, waving with his other. “It is Viscount, if we are being specific.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, turning to lean over the railing. “We are not.”</p><p>Once back in the ballroom, her glove now back in place, she found Wanda. The girl was nice enough so getting intel on the viscount wouldn’t be too much of a burden. She hooked her arm with Wanda’s, gently pulling her from her engagements. “Wanda, might I ask you a question?”</p><p>The ginger seemed confused but tried to hide it. “I suppose.”</p><p>“Do you know Lord Harkness?”</p><p>“Ah, yes,” Wanda grinned. “Him and I are old friends, why do you ask?”</p><p>“Tell me more about him,” Rio requested. “He is…so confusing."</p><p>“In what sense?”</p><p>“His dress, for one.”</p><p>Wanda blew that off. “He is a romantic, a free spirit. His ancestry is Scottish, it is not uncommon for men of that lineage to keep their hair in plaits.”</p><p>“And the way he carries himself?”</p><p>“He is charming, no?”</p><p>He was, and that was why she was struggling.</p><p>“He seemed rather progressive for a man of his station…”</p><p>Wanda smirked at that. “I am not so sure, he is a notorious rake.”</p><p>“Oh, so he respects women of nobility, only to exploit the working class,” she groaned. And there was the issue, Rio knew there had to be something amiss.</p><p>“It is not exploitation if he pays them well,” Wanda argued. “And, between you and me, he is looking for a wife this season.”</p><p>“The viscount is seeking a wife?” Her jaw dropped. “Can a rake even take a wife?”</p><p>“My dear,” she joked. “Those with knowledge like his make the best husbands.”</p>

<p>The day was warm, stickily so, but Agatha put on her numerous layers anyway. Today she was forced to promenade in the park, which wasn’t the worst thing so long as there was one particularly quick witted debutante in attendance. Wanda hung on her arm, walking along the water as she discussed the many suitors that had called on her this morning. Agatha was happy for her friend, but her insides did slightly curdle at the top contender being a man twice her age, a man willing to pay more than her dowry was stated to be.</p><p>“He is a duke,” Wanda reasoned, gliding alongside him. “He would provide for me.”</p><p>Augustus squinted as the sun hit his eyes, scowling. “And he would be kind to you, treat you as an equal?”</p><p>“No man will see me as an equal,” she murmured. “None except you. Though, that is a special circumstance.”</p><p>“Do you wish to marry me?” He asked, because if this was Wanda’s way of asking for help, he felt inclined to aid. “I know not of Duke Jarvis, but if he is giving you second thoughts-”</p><p>“I wish to marry someone who will value my mind just as much as my appearance,” Wanda interrupted. “But you do not want for me in the way a husband wants for his wife.”</p><p>“Do you want for me?” He inquired, looking at his friend.</p><p>Wanda quietly shook her head. “It has nothing to do with…<i>you.</i> I believe we have known each other too long for me to yearn for us to be anything but as we are now.”</p><p>“I agree,” he replied. “You are beautiful and intelligent, however…”</p><p>“You do not have to soften the blow,” Wanda said. “The feeling is mutual.” Her eyes lit up, adding, “Besides, I am much too young for you, seems as though you have taken a liking to the spinster.”</p><p>“I have not,” he quickly amended. “She is fascinating, though. She hates men, which I do find very intriguing. A spinster, on the shelf, denying any man who dares show interest. I appreciate the way she does not mince her words, there is something refreshing about it.”</p><p>“You like the spinster,” Wanda sing-songed like a child making fun of another in the schoolyard. “She inquired about you last night.”</p><p>He craned his neck to look at her, coming to a stop. “She did? What did you say?”</p><p>“I said you were charming, handsome, and a man-whore,” she flatly stated. “I do not think it was a deterrent for her.”</p><p>“I am not a man-whore!” He furrowed his brows. “I am a lover of women and the female form! There is a difference.”</p><p>“You are a lover of Rio’s form,” she retorted. “You like the spinster, it is not a bad thing. You need a wife, she needs a husband.”</p><p>“She is naive, she would not know what she is getting into,” he said in a low tone. “What if she does not care for me once she knows the truth? And I cannot tell her before proposing because she might tell others, and I cannot pay her off!”</p><p>“The vein in your forehead is popping out, my lord.” Wanda’s index finger poked the line against Augustus’ skin. “Have you ever considered that she might only want to marry you for monetary gain and nothing else? She might never need to know your real state of being.”</p><p>“It is deception,” he mumbled. “I do not need to trick women, I pride myself on it.” Because enduring the upbringing she had, Agatha was made to feel like a predator. And though she did enjoy that in the bedroom, it was only appealing when consensual. She worked tirelessly to tell every bedmate what a night with her entailed, most women did not pine for a monster such as herself. It was why she often took care of herself when copulating, not wanting to force the other woman into something she did not desire. No matter how lonely she got, Agatha was not entitled to her own needs being met.</p><p>Wanda sighed, releasing his arm. “You are too honorable for a man that stalks alleyways for company. Rio is not naive, she is not a child. The woman is aware of her situation and you playing the valiant knight will not remedy her current predicament. If you like her, pursue that connection.”</p><p>“Oh, and how might I do that?”</p><p>Wanda pointed behind him to the patch of grass, there was a bench where Rio sat, scribbling in what appeared to be a notebook. “You talk to her, you fool.”</p><p>He jutted out his lower lip in a pout. “What if she does not take to me?”</p><p>“What if she does?”</p><p>Augustus rolled his shoulders back and set his jaw, attempting to build up the courage. He’d never had to worry about a genuine connection, he’d never had one of those. He turned on his heel, leaving Wanda and pacing over to Rio. Her dress was a pale pink today, and he could only think of how much he preferred the green from last night. “Miss Vidal,” he greeted, standing in front of her.</p><p>Her eyes peered up, the ones that resembled petrified wood with layers and layers of multi color swirling. Agatha thought them to be the most beautiful blend. “Lord Harkness.”</p><p>He bowed, not waiting for her to do the same even if she was seated. “May I accompany you?”</p><p>Her hands slumped into her lap, the open pages of her notebooks displaying crude sketches of plants along with detailed scribbles. “Your prerogative.”</p><p>Augustus cautiously took a seat next to her, leaving a healthy amount of distance. “Are you recording the vegetation?”</p><p>“I am,” she muttered, quickly peeking behind her to make sure the coast was clear. “Do not tell my mother, she will fling it into the nearest body of water if she discovers.”</p><p>“Do you possess an interest in botany?”</p><p>“I do, although it is not a ladylike pursuit.” Rio finished a petal, finally giving him her attention. “I wished to pursue higher education in order to learn more, but as that will not be happening—keeping my own journal is the next best solution.”</p><p>“I applaud your commitment,” he smiled. “I personally loved learning about the cosmos, it is a vast world out there.”</p><p>Rio’s face morphed into genuine interest. “Did you visit the planetarium? I have <i>always</i> wanted to attend.”</p><p>“The nearest one is in the United Netherlands, it was a tedious journey, but all the worth it,” he responded. “They are making great advances, I still have a majority of my textbooks if you wish to borrow them.”</p><p>She smiled, but it was one of discontentment. “My mama would most likely discard them if she found them, she is not supportive of the education of women.”</p><p>“What a tragedy, a woman should not have to be a singularity.” He tilted his head, sliding in just a fraction. “If we take a liking to one another, I would be most overjoyed to take you along the next time I travel to the United Netherlands.”</p><p>“They do not allow women in planetariums,” she chuckled, closing her notebook.</p><p>“If my wife were to long for education, I would not deny her.” And that was true, because who was he to withhold that from his partner. “If they were to take issue with your admittance, perhaps they would not take issue with a bountiful donation.”</p><p>She narrowed her gaze, studying him. “I cannot tell if you are a progressive, or merely trying to bed me.”</p><p>“I would not-” he stammered. “That is not my goal, I can assure you. I was being truthful when I said you were fascinating, that is all.”</p><p>“And what about me fascinates you?”</p><p>Too much.</p><p>“You are older than the rest of the girls, but you hold no shame in it. You are intelligent given the boundaries placed upon you. You do not seem to soften your bite, and I appreciate your candor.” He met her gaze, though she made it difficult with that cute tooth gap peeking out of her smile. “You are enchanting to look at, and so much more,” he added, breaking eye contact and looking forward. “What about that would not fascinate me?”</p><p>“Wanda was not lying when she said you are a romantic,” Rio offered. “And, for what it is worth, I find you fascinating as well.”</p><p>Agatha blushed—not Augustus, though that's who she was being right now—no, the color on her cheeks most definitely belonged to <i>her.</i> “What about me has piqued your interest, if I may ask.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched like she was holding back a snarky remark, but her tone was genuine. “You are not like most men I have spoken with, but do not let that go to your head, the bar is exceptionally low.” She set her notebook aside as she turned her body to face his. “You harbor a disdain for society in the same vein as I do, another woman has spoken highly of you when she would gain nothing from doing so.” Her voice got low as she then added, “And your eyes—they remind me of azurite. There is green intermingled in the blue as if they are spilling together in your irises. You can only source the stone from France, but it is the only adequate comparison I have when I look at you. They are beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught as she worked harder than usual to keep her voice in the correct register—nobody had used such a feminine term to describe anything about Augustus’ appearance. Not positively, anyway. “Men, um, men do not possess beauty.”</p><p>“I did not say <i>men,</i> I said <i>you,</i>” Rio softly corrected, changing the topic quickly afterwards. “And what of you, if you are indeed such a romantic, why are you hiding at balls and taking up with prostitutes?”</p><p>“You really do not hold your tongue, do you,” he grinned. “There is more than just the surface of a person, there is reasoning in the way I live.”</p><p>And Rio, of course, would not be satisfied with that answer. “I’m all ears.”</p><p>He exhaled all the air from his lungs, hoping it’d equip him for the reaction of the next words he spoke. “I cannot have children, and seeing as most women want them, I feel it unfair to place that burden upon a wife.”</p><p>“That is hardly a reason to discount a real connection,” Rio responded. “You should let the woman make that decision rather than making it for her.”</p><p>“Do you wish for children, Rio?”</p><p>She pressed her lips together for a moment, contemplating her answer. “I do…but I do not <i>only</i> wish for children.”</p><p>“And what else is that?”</p><p>“I wish for knowledge, I wish for a garden of my own in a home of my own.” She was apparently unmoored by his confession, which should have made him undesirable by societal standards. The only reason people wed was in order to make sure their titles and lineage lived on, but Rio didn’t see it that way. “I wish to travel, there is so much written of scientific expeditions and I would like to witness some for myself. I wish to visit home, back to Puerto Rico at some point in the future.” She smiled at him as she said, “I wish to live a full life that is unrestrained by my sex.”</p><p>“And, if you were able to obtain the other wishes you listed,” he slowly reasoned. “Would you be content not to experience motherhood, you could live with that?”</p><p>Rio quirked a brow. “You speak as though you have already decided to court me.”</p><p>“Would that be a bad thing?”</p><p>“You have not asked my permission,” she pointed out. “And I do mean <i>my</i> permission as I would rather die than be treated like a child whilst you ask my father in a separate room.”</p><p>Suitors often negotiated courtship and marriage with the debutante’s father, not the woman herself—much like a business deal between farmers estimating the value of a sow. But she thought of Rio more highly than that, there was a certain empathy Agatha shared with her. There were moments in her childhood where she would question why Evanora did not raise her as a girl and marry her off to the highest bidder in order to produce an heir that way, her mother always responded, <i>“Your insolence is something only excused by men, no husband would deal with such an inconvenient woman.</i>”</p><p>“How terribly illbred of me,” he quipped. “Can you find it in your heart to forgive my misstep?”</p><p>“Mmmm,” she hummed in thought. “No.”</p><p>He tilted his head back in a cackle—this woman was not easy, and Agatha wanted to unwind her and learn how she worked like one does with the gears of a clock. “You are much too good at playing coy for someone who seems to like the chase.”</p><p>“I am not playing coy, my lord,” Rio nearly whispered. “I have yet to discern how I feel about you.”</p><p>“Well.” He stood, offering his hand out. “Can I interest you in a stroll while you figure it out?”</p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered from his face to his hand, then to her mother off in a gaggle of other mothers. She took his hand and rose to her feet, the cream satin of her gloves felt like butter against his palm. “I shall go inform my mother, give me a minute.”</p><p>Her tongue felt thick as she nodded in agreement, letting go and watching as Rio stuffed the notebook down her dress and walked over to her mother. Agatha’s fingers tingled, flexing and retracting at the simplest of contact. Their skin hadn’t even touched, and Agatha thought it as one of the most intimate passing moments she’d experienced in a while. Rio’s mother looked shocked as Rio relayed the invite to promenade, excitedly fixing her daughter’s hair and dress—both were already perfect in Agatha’s opinion. Rio’s mother led her back to Agatha, a beaming smile on her face. “Viscount,” she bowed.</p><p>Agatha bowed back out of necessity. “Lady Vidal,” he chirped, pointing to Rio. “Your daughter has been most pleasant company.”</p><p>Lady Vidal twisted her features in disbelief. “She has?”</p><p>“Why would she not be.” He offered his arm to Rio. “Thank you for allowing me to continue our time together.”</p><p>Rio took his arm, smirking as they began to walk in step with one another, her mother a few paces behind as chaperone. “I did not think you were a liar, August.”</p><p>If only she knew.</p><p>He chuckled. “I am many things, darling, just you wait.”</p><p>Over the course of the next week, Agatha set her sights on Rio—even if Evanora did not care for her pursuing a spinster. Agatha called on Rio in the mornings, strolled with her in the afternoons, and engaged with her at balls. She learned that Rio was interested in the variation of soils, the breakthroughs in electricity, and most notably—bugs. The woman would not shut up about how strong and smart certain bugs were, how she longed to have the freedom to study them. Both Agatha and Augustus did not care for bugs, which was revealed in the most embarrassing form ever.</p><p>They were sitting on the lawn together, blanket beneath them, with Rio’s mother a few yards away. The whole ton was out that afternoon to watch the polo match. Agatha could have suggested the stands, but didn’t care to be packed in with that many people. At first, she believed the sensation on her fingers to be Rio’s own, trying to hold it. A show of indecency but she would not protest the touch—until she peered down to see a spider crawling over her knuckles. She shot up, frantically whipping her hand and shrieking, “Holy shit!”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped up as she saw the humiliation unfold, unabashedly laughing at the sight. She hastily got up and took off her gloves, cradling Agatha’s hand as she gently shuffled the spider into her open palm. “It is only an arachnid."</p><p>Agatha’s breathing did not even out, her heart hammering against her ribs. “<i>Only?!</i>”</p><p>She squeezed Agatha’s hand, now spider free. “I assure you, it is more scared of you than you are of it.”</p><p>“Then why was it on me?” he pouted, being grounded in Rio’s thumb soothingly running along his knuckles. Rio’s skin was warm and Agatha wanted to feel it for much longer, wanted to feel the skin on other parts of her body. “And why are you holding it?”</p><p>Her eyes were reduced to slits due to the sun, snickering as she replied, “Did you know you scream like a girl?”</p><p>His jaw dropped in offense and shock. “I do not!”</p><p>“You do,” she refuted. “I did not know a man’s voice could pitch so high.”</p><p>Well, Agatha was certain no man’s voice could—but hers could. A tsunami of shame crushed the viscount, because shrieking was not what men did.</p><p>He swallowed, pulling his hand out of her grip. “My apologies, it was inappropriate of me.”</p><p>“You do not have to feel sorry about it,” she giggled. “It was a normal reaction, I meant nothing by the comment.”</p><p>“Not very manly to cower at the sight of a spider,” he murmured, fixing his vest. “Is it okay?”</p><p>Rio looked at the spider safe in her hand. “It is fine.” Her hair was silky and her lips were a faint pink as she said, “And I prefer a man who cares about an innocent creature rather than appearing tough.”</p><p>“You do?” he gawked. In most interactions with men that Agatha had endured, it was always a pissing contest to see who could be more dominant. After being mocked and laughed at as an adolescent teen for being ‘effeminate’ or ‘too tender,’ Agatha made it a point to remain stoic in public. “Most women-”</p><p>“I am not most,” she cut in, placing the spider in the grass and fixing her gloves back on. “It is refreshing to know that you are capable of more than just acting gallant.”</p><p>“You are too kind.”</p><p>“No…I am not.”</p><p>The next day, when Agatha sat in the Vidal’s sitting room, Rio accepted her notion that they might enter a formal courtship. “I suppose it would get both our mothers off our backs.”</p><p>“No other reason?” He drawled, hopeful that she might return his affection.</p><p>Rio flushed from the opposite settee across from him. “Should there be?”</p><p>It was mutually beneficial, yes. But the guilt silently gnawing at the back of her brain did not ease, because Agatha was taking advantage of Rio’s circumstances. Her age might be a bump in the road, but Rio should have her pick of men, not wind up stuck with someone who lied day in and day out. Rio was smart, Rio was beautiful, Rio was captivating and ravishing—all that, wasted on Agatha.</p><p>“I guess not,” he muttered.</p><hr/><p>One month, that is how long Rio has spent being courted—one fucking month. August was a dog with a bone, and she didn’t know why he was focused on her out of the whole lot of women. She saw how the other debutantes giggled at his jests during formal events, how they gave judgemental glances when she and him strolled together. Even Rio’s own mother could not process why the viscount would yearn for a spinster on the shelf, commenting, <i>“Is the Viscount…a molly?”</i> Which was the elitist way of asking if he was a homosexual, and as far as Rio could surmize—no.</p><p>August did not startle at Rio’s words, or her ideals. He was a great conversationalist, always open to eagerly listen to or debate whichever topic Rio found most interesting that day. He was quite the artist, she learned, having only discovered by demanding to see what he was scribbling down on a piece of paper. She had been peacefully reading while he silently sat next to her in the drawing room, her mother on the other end trying to overhear.</p><p>“It has been a while, do you wish to talk or are you feeling unusually silent today?” Rio marked her page in the book, ignoring the way her mother motioned for her to toss the novel aside.</p><p> “Fear not, for I have not fallen mute—though I would hedge that you would not mind if I had.” He looked up from his paper, tucking the pencil behind his ear and turning it around for her. “The light was hitting you…”</p><p>She blinked a couple of times, gingerly taking the paper which now reflected her own face. “You drew this just now?”</p><p>“You sound astounded,” he snorted. “You draw as well.”</p><p>“Those are crude renderings of flowers that nobody but I can differentiate!”</p><p>“Oh, I bet I could,” he shot back, tone low and enticing. “And I appreciate a little crudeness.”</p><p>He often said things like that, words that were harmless on the surface, but that Rio’s stomach took as more. The man loved to try and make her squirm, and to his credit, it often worked. She folded the paper and stuck it in the back of her book, speaking through the buzzing in her chest. “Yes, well, your pension for vulgarity does not surprise me.”</p><p>“My dear,” he murmured, a glimmer in his eye. “You have yet to see my vulgarity.”</p><p>Okay, she was too hot now. It was <i>sweltering</i> in this room all of a sudden. No man she’d ever interacted with had similar speech to the viscount, the lord toyed with his words, twisted them to gauge Rio’s reaction.</p><p>“I think I shall retire now,” Rio breathily declared.</p><p>He reached out, delicately holding her wrist. “Shall I visit tomorrow?”</p><p>“Yes,” she squeaked, his hand retracting a moment later—the phantom sensation etched itself into her skin, itching for it to return. “Yes, I will see you tomorrow.”</p><p>He straightened out his vest and grabbed his coat, bowing and uttering, “I look forward to it, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>“As do I,” Rio gave as farewell, not returning the bow and rushing to her bedroom. Why did that happen each time they touched? She’d had fleeting touches with men before, even a kiss or two, she wasn’t a nun, and it was more out of curiosity than burning desire. She had decided that love simply was not for her, but the viscount’s touch set her skin on fire like those tiny red ants in the forest, it ached when he touched her. He was restrained in his physical affections, as society required him to be—but no matter how small, her body responded.</p><p>It was getting harder to ignore; the way her lips curled around whenever he was around, the twisting of her gut, the shivering of her spine. She laid awake that night in bed, the cotton of her nightgown tangled around her legs, the sheets suffocating her. Water, she needed water. Rio roused out of bed, content to get it herself rather than wake one of the staff. With her candle being the only source of light, she tiptoed down the hall, warmth seeping out the the door of her father’s office. She hesitated in the corridor, her parent’s voices were hushed, but she could hear them crystal clear.</p><p>“The Viscount <i>will</i> propose, I know it, we just need more time,” Mama confidently stated.</p><p>Papá shuffled around, exhaustion lacing his voice. “We do not <i>have</i> more time. We are defaulting on debts, we will have to dismiss the staff before the end of the month.”</p><p>“Then we entertain Lord Pym’s vie for Rio’s hand,” Mama sighed. “He will propose by the end of the week if we promise her to him.”</p><p>Lord Pym? He was seventy and had multiple servants accuse him of abuse. He was ancient, he still believed women’s time of the month was punishment for not reproducing. Lord Pym would be a monster, he was of the generation that thought it only right to control what their wives wear, eat, say. Rio covered her mouth to smother the gasp.</p><p>The thunder outside cracked, the rain pounding against the glass windows of their home.</p><p>“Perhaps the Viscount needs some competition to spur him on,” Papá hedged. “Although that man is rather cork-brained.”</p><p>She felt a defensive pinch spread through her at that comment, August was not stupid or daft—he was amusing, and interesting, and even charming…on occasion.</p><p>“Whether it is Pym or Harkness, we will be fine,” Mama said, but Rio had already heard enough.</p><p>She rushed to the maid’s quarters, shaking Alice awake. Rio would not roll over and play damsel as everyone else made decisions for her, she was an adult with her own constitution, not an animal to trade for profit. Her lady’s maid roused, furrowing her brows as she asked, “Rio? What time-”</p><p>The lightning flashed outside, projecting a white hot light into the room for a millisecond.</p><p>“I require your help. Can you quickly and quietly procure a driver?”</p><p>The viscount didn’t live far, maybe only ten minutes away. Rio hadn’t even properly dressed, just tied a cloak over her nightgown and put on her oldest pair of shoes since mama would wring her neck if she ruined a new pair due to the puddles pooling in the streets. The rain soaked through her layers as she banged with the ornate doorknocker, rapidly and repeatedly, until a footman answered the door.</p><p>“Yes?” He asked, confused given the time of night.</p><p>“I need to speak with the Viscount,” Rio demanded. “Now.”</p><p>The footman ushered her inside—the home was obviously not decorated by August, she couldn’t imagine him picking the coldest blue and purple tones for every piece of furniture or decor.</p><p>The viscount turned up a minute later, a closed dressing gown colored in a rich dark purple tied around his frame. Huh, without his boots, the man was almost shorter than her. His hair was hastily tied back rather than braided, wavy and untamed, his eyes crinkled in confusion. He looked somewhat delicate in this state. “Rio, what is the matter?”</p><p>“Marry me,” she blurted, sopping wet in this man’s foyer.</p><p>His mouth opened, knitting his brows together. “Pardon?”</p><p>“My parents are planning ship me off with a seventy year old man who will essentially keep me prisoner,” she anxiously explained, ignoring her drenched locks sticking to her face. “If I were to marry any man, I would want it to be you.”</p><p>“Which man?”</p><p>“Lord Pym.”</p><p>“Lord Pym?!” He spat. “His first wife died under mysterious circumstances, there are still rumors he threw her down the stairs and your parents are ready to sell you to him?!”</p><p>“Marry me,” Rio repeated. “I understand how informal and inappropriate this is, but I am out of options. I can read, I can write, I’m beginning to thrive in pianoforte. I will be the most perfect hostess, if that is what you wish. I can be a good wife, well not <i>good</i>, but good enough. Adequate, at the very least.”</p><p>“Rio, slow down.” August soothed, taking a few steps forward and carefully grasping her hands in his. “You do not need to debase yourself to prove anything to me.”</p><p>The tears welled, and her throat closed. “Please, will you just-” Rio’s voice broke as her desperate plea slipped between her lips. “<i>Marry me.</i>”</p><p>He tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, eyes wide with an emotion she could not identify, softly responding, “I will come by with a ring tomorrow and propose properly.”</p><p>A wave of relief washed over her bones, catapulting her forward and throwing her arms around his shoulders. “Thank you.”</p><p>His arms coiled around her, holding her tightly at the waist. His lips brushed against her temple as he quietly replied, “Of course.”</p><p>The branches tapped against the widows, the wind whistled through the brick of the house, the thunder rumbled, the lightning strobed—by all accounts, the storm was untenable, but Rio felt more comfort in his embrace than she had in <i>years.</i> She tilted her head back, gazing into those orbs, the ones that mimicked azurite. Something genuine laid dormant behind the beauty, something real and authentic. The viscount was manicured, his appearance told people a story of an unserious man cursed with a duty, but Rio suspected more than that. August was a gentleman despite his rakish tendencies though he did not crave notoriety for it, he was humorous to keep others at arms length. He was kind, even if he did not realize it.</p><p>Her own eyes dropped to his lips, pink and plump, not so much as a whisper of facial hair. She let her forehead rest against his for a beat, the distance between them mere inches apart. August’s fingers scrunched in her cloak, as if he was holding himself back from something. Her blood thrummed as his breath fanned over her face, her hands tangled in his robe. She let her eyes close as she let her lips part—an open invitation.</p><p>He hovered, he didn't pull back, yet didn’t make any motion to lean forward. She rooted herself there, not necessarily waiting for more, but not dissuading it either. Her heart was in her ears, the banging of it drowning out the rain.</p><p>August released her suddenly, clearing his throat. “You should get back…before your parents discover you have left.”</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open, the cold draft of the home replacing the warmth of his body. “Yes, I-I suppose you are right.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Miss Vidal,” he strained out, every word coated in agony.</p><p>Rio raised the hood of her cloak, though it was already wet and would not provide any protection. She wiped her face of tears, the embarrassment setting in, the shame in begging for a man to take pity on her. “Goodnight, Lord Harkness.”</p><p>She climbed back into the carriage, face glued to the window as the wind rattled. Marriage was a business proposal, she knew that, so why did this feel like more?</p><p>Less than twenty-four hours later, Rio was engaged to the viscount.</p>
