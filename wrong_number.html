I will try to post regularly as soon as I have a new chapter finished and corrected. I really hope you'll like it because this fic is really important to me &lt;3</p><p>If people didn't understand from the tags, Rio is a famous actress in this, and she accidentally texts Agatha as a wrong number.

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Where was the Declaration of Independence signed? <em>On the bottom of the page.</em></p><p>Agatha stares at the answer for a full three seconds, her brain trying to debate whether it's a joke or an actual answer. She really, <em>really</em> does hope it's the first option. Then, she exhales slowly through her nose, tight-lipped, and draws a clean red line through the words, replacing them with surprisingly still good handwriting: <em>the Pennsylvania State House, later renamed Independence Hall, in Philadelphia.</em></p><p>She can't believe a student wrote this. An actual teenager, who supposedly attended the class where she explained this exact thing, even showed a picture of the damn building, circled the date on the board. Not knowing the answer is one thing—God knows she's not unreasonable, they're kids, they forget, they zone out—but this feels pointed. As if one of them decided to make a joke of the whole thing, of her, as if all her hours of teaching were nothing, and now she's sitting at her dining table at 1 a.m., surrounded by two precariously leaning towers of papers, sipping lukewarm coffee and playing red-pen therapist to a classroom's worth of teenage nihilism.</p><p>She then rubs at one temple and sighs, while trying not to think about how much more she has to grade. A class and a half, by her estimate. It's not so much the content—to her surprise, there aren't that many wrong answers or stupid ones like the one she just corrected—but the handwriting, the smudges, the loose glitter from someone's colorful decorative pen, make it way harder.</p><p>Agatha told her students many, many times to only write in either blue or black, with a pen that does not smudge and that does not have fucking glitter (it's a high school test, goddammit, not a romantic journal!), but alas, they're teenagers. They do not listen and certainly don't take care of their handwriting, which, at the end of the day, is the hardest part of her job.</p><p>If she really can't read an answer, she just counts it as false. She told her class about this, and some still decided not to write properly. Well, their loss then. It might seem rude, but as a history teacher that corrects hundreds of copies per week, she's tired of all this. And anyway, she <em>is</em> rude. She knows about the chatter behind her back. She knows her nickname in the student and teacher circle is '<em>the witch</em>,' because she sometimes can be heartless and rude. She doesn't even do it on purpose, it's just how she is. And in all honesty, she doesn't even mind the nickname. The Salem Witch Trials is actually the reason she chosed to be a history teacher.</p><p>The silence of the house doesn't help Agatha focus on her copies. Besides the annoying, buzzing sound of the refrigerator and the ticking of the wall clock (that she will absolutely remove the batteries from very soon because the noise makes her want to smash it on the floor), it's silent. It's so unusual for her.</p><p>Agatha has never liked the silence; it reminds her of her childhood. Reminds her how she grew up with an abusive mother who wished she was never born, who never allowed her to watch tv or listen to music, who raised her in silence, where the only things she allowed her to say were her daily prayers. At the table during lunch and dinner, at night before going to bed.</p><p>Agatha has never believed in God—especially not with a mother who forced religion on her and only swore by Jesus' name—but she didn't have a choice other than to obey her mother. Pray every day with the lines she was forced to memorize at a young age, limes that she didn't even understand.</p><p>The silence reminds her of those lonely days she spent at home, locked in her room, punished for doing something she didn't even know was wrong. She usually corrects her copies with some music as a background noise (mostly Fleetwood Mac and other vintage stuff), but not today. It's way too late and she doesn't want to wake up her seven-year-old son who, unlike her, needs his eight hours of sleep.</p><p>Even though correcting copies late at night is far from enjoyable, Agatha loves her job. She really does. She teaches history to juniors four days a week. From a young age, she has always been passionate about history, especially witches, so teaching everything she knows is enjoyable. Well, when her class doesn't make her want to jump off the window—or worse, throw a <em>kid</em> out the window. Some of them provoke her on purpose, as if making the witch angry will make them win a bet, but besides those annoying kids, everything's great. So is her schedule, which leaves her her Wednesdays and weekends free so she can spend some time with her son.</p><p>Her cute, amazing, smart seven-year-old son, who still insists on dinosaur-shaped pancakes and already dreams of being a paleontologist. Even at his young age, he can already name so many dead lizards, and even corrects his mom when she makes a mistake while trying to speak with him about his passion. She remembers how, one day, she made the mistake of talking about a Quetzalcoatlus as a dinosaur. Nicky had immediately corrected her, telling her that flying reptiles were not dinosaurs. Well, sorry she isn't a dino nerd like him. She teaches history, not earth science.</p><p>She didn't mind the correction, though. While everyone thinks she's a mean witch, her son is her entire life and she absolutely loves hearing him talk for hours about the things he likes.</p><p>As a kid, Agatha was alone, unloved. Her mother hated her, her father was gone. She had no one to speak to about her hobbies and obsessions. Well, she did try to talk to her mother about the Salem Witch Trials, which she... didn't like. She said that witches are a creation of the devil, and that Agatha shouldn't be interested in them. The poor kid had spent an hour locked in the closet—a place Evanora arranged as a praying point, sort of. She hung a cross there on one of the four walls, and pages of the Bible on the others, as if locking her daughter in for hours would change anything. It never did, obviously. It only gave Agatha claustrophobia and religious trauma.</p><p>So she now makes sure that Nicky knows that he can talk to her about anything, absolutely anything. Even if it's hours of babbling about dead reptiles, she doesn't care. If it makes him happy, then it makes her happy too.</p><p>For the next ten minutes or so, she silently continues to correct the copies. Her spine protests every time she shifts in her uncomfortable chair and her wrist has developed a faint, persistent ache. Her eyes keep threatening to blur; not surprising considering it's past 1 a.m. And still, the pile waits.</p><p>A single, sudden vibration of her phone against the wood of the table makes her jump in her seat. She didn't expect someone to text her so late at night, and it can only be a text, as the woman doesn't have any social media and all her other apps are silenced.</p><p>Who the fuck could it be?</p><p>Quickly, she turns her phone on and looks at the notification hovering above her beautiful lock screen: a photo of her and Nicky her friend took a few weeks ago. They're both laughing, Agatha holding him from behind after she chased him at the park.</p><p>The message is from an unknown number, and there's only an attachment.</p><p>That's... strange.</p><p>Her brow furrows as she unlocks the device, thumb hesitating for just a second over the message before she decides to open it. If it's a scam, she'll just delete it. At least it's not a link—though she'd never click on one coming from an unknown number. She might be a middle-aged woman, but she's not stupid; she knows how scammers scam people. It won't work on her.</p><p>As soon as she opens the message, her breath leaves her in a quiet, startled sound that is not quite a gasp but definitely not neutral.</p><p>It's a photo, as she expected. What she didn't expect, however, was the content. It's a woman. Topless, arm slung across her chest to hide her breasts. The focal point, though, is the tattoo she has on her underboob and around. She immediately recognizes the flowers as azaleas, her favorite. They're in bloom, delicate purple-ish blossoms etched into the soft skin just beneath the curve of her right breast, following the line of her ribcage on one side and her boob on the other. It's still in the plastic wrap, so the colors are more pigmented than they will be in a few weeks, but Agatha can't lie, the tattoo is more than beautiful anyways.</p><p>The teacher has never been a big tattoo girl (though she thought about getting one when she was younger just to piss off her conservative mother), but she does enjoy them on others. Especially if it's a woman.</p><p>The whole thing is unexpected enough that Agatha just stares at it, caught in the moment between shock and amusement. The tattoo isn't the only beautiful thing. Though she can't see the woman's face as the photo stops at her neck, the glimpse she has of her body is enough to tell she's a pretty one. Her eyes linger—unconsciously, of course—enough to notice a few clear lines on her hips, right above what seem to be a pair of green pajama shorts, or even boxers, she can't really tell from this angle.</p><p>
<em>Stretch marks.</em>
</p><p>She has some too. She used to hate them, but now she's learned to accept her body as it is. She had a child, of course her body is covered in them. She never minded them on other women, though, even finding them beautiful, so she just... learned to love hers. Learned to love <em>herself.</em></p><p>Shaking her head, she finally decides to type something.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:13 AM</strong><br/>I think you got the wrong number</p><p>A wrong number, there's no doubt there. At least, it's a beautiful woman and not a creepy man. The last thing she wanted right now is to be flashed by a naked torso. Ew. Just ew.</p><p>She then puts her phone back down on the table to focus on finishing correcting her copies, but she's interrupted by another buzz.</p><p>Already? She opens the message.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:14 AM</strong><br/>Shit, I'm sorry :/</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:14 AM</strong><br/>It's fine, it happens</p><p>She can't help but immediately type another message.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:14 AM</strong><br/>Nice tattoo, by the way</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:15 AM</strong><br/>Thank you ;) I just got it</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:15 AM</strong><br/>The text was meant for my friend, but she's got a new number and I probably typed it wrong. Sorry about that</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:15 AM</strong><br/>As I said, it's fine. It happens</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:16 AM</strong><br/>:)</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:16 AM</strong><br/>Well, good night then, stranger. Or maybe afternoon or morning</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:16 AM</strong><br/>Night. 1 a.m. here</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:16 AM</strong><br/>You?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:17 AM</strong><br/>10 p.m. About to head to bed. What are you doing up at this hour?</p><p>The teacher lets out a snort.</p><p>Good question: why is she still up at this hour, working on stupid, unreadable history copies instead of sleeping? If she doesn't go to bed soon, she won't even have four hours of sleep. And it's better for everyone (especially her students) that she isn't sleep-deprived. Bit late for that, but well.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:17 AM</strong><br/>Working</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:18 AM</strong><br/>Working? In the middle of the night??</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:18 AM</strong><br/>Unfortunately</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:18 AM</strong><br/>Working on what?</p><p>This stranger is curious. Too curious, even. Agatha quickly looks at the time on her phone, and lets out another sigh. It's almost one-thirty in the fucking morning, and she still has over an entire pile to correct for tomorrow.</p><p>Okay, maybe she should have done it before, but she didn't have time. Being a mother comes before being a teacher, so as Nicky was sick this week, Agatha called sick at work to take care of him. And taking care of her sick son meant being with him all day. Cooking some nice stews and soups, reading books to distract him, cleaning up his clothes and his bed after he threw up in the middle of the night. No matter what happens in her life, her role as a mother will always, <em>always</em> come first.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:20 AM</strong><br/>Look, I don't want to sound rude but it's late, I don't know you, and I have some work to finish ASAP so I can finally get some rest. So goodnight, unknown number</p><p>She stares at the message for a second before sending it. She doesn't have the energy or time to talk to this stranger, no matter how tempted she is.</p><p>Maybe if this had happened during the day, she would have let it unfold, played along a little, let it distract her from the ever-growing pile of stress that comes with teaching teenagers and parenting alone. But it's past 1 a.m. Her coffee's now completely cold, her back is killing her and her wrist aches. And the exams still aren't finished.</p><p>So she puts the phone down, then picks the pen back up.</p><p>The next hour drags. She finishes the last half-class of exams slowly, painstakingly. Her handwriting gets sloppier with time and her eyes are closing themselves. She's <em>this</em> close to falling asleep on the dining table, which would be an awful thing. Her spine would not be happy about it.</p><p>By the time she finishes the final one (fucking finally!), scrawls the last red note and lets the pen drop with a soft clatter, it's 2:25 a.m. Her whole body feels like it's been compressed into the shape of this chair, every joint stiff and sore. She leans back with a groan, stretching until her spine pops, then slowly gathers the corrected papers into a single pile before putting them back in her teacher's purple leather cross-body bag.</p><p>She lets herself sit there for a while, not moving, eyes closed, head tilted toward the ceiling.</p><p>She could fall asleep like this. She probably would, if not for the thought nudging at the back of her mind. For some reason, she can't stop thinking of this tattoo. About this woman.</p><p>Azaleas, her favorite flower. Funny, isn't it? And purple. Her favorite flower <em>and</em> her favorite color, etched on that woman's skin.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, almost smiling, like she can physically dislodge the moment. It doesn't matter, anyways. It was nothing. A random photo from a wrong number, it happens. A fleeting coincidence in the middle of a long, exhausted night.</p><p>She'll never talk to that person again.</p><p>Probably.</p><p>After another minute or so, the woman finally gets up from the chair, her whole body aching from staying in the same position for so long in an uncomfortable wooden chair. She stirs some more, then grabs her mug of unfinished cold coffee before dumping it into the sink. With a grimace, she rinses the ceramic out like muscle memory so she doesn't have to in the morning, then turns the kitchen lights off and makes her way towards the staircase.</p><p>It's past two in the morning. Tomorrow—no, today, technically—is going to be hard, physically and mentally. If she's lucky, if she doesn't lie awake thinking too much, if she doesn't check her phone or remember that photo or replay that brief, strange exchange with that <strike>beautiful</strike> stranger, she might get three hours of sleep. Maybe. Probably not. Unfortunately, Agatha is one of those people who just can't lie in bed and immediately fall asleep. She's not even wearing pyjamas yet and she didn't brush her teeth after dinner. Her outfit for tomorrow isn't chosen either, so she'll have a lot to catch up on before finally being able to lay down and rest.</p><p>As a teacher, she also loves to read, especially before sleeping. It helps her relax, both physically and mentally, and distracts her brain so she doesn't think of the things that are bothering her in life. But right now, it's way too late to read, and her eyes are already closing themselves anyways. No reading time before sleep, meaning no distraction, meaning she might think of <em>her.</em> Or something else, someone else, but there's no way Agatha will be able to fall asleep so quickly, no matter how tired she is. Her body might be exhausted, but her brain isn't.</p><p>With another sigh, the woman makes her way upstairs. The first creak of wood underfoot makes her wince and freeze mid-step, breath caught in her throat.</p><p><em>Fucking stairs!</em> She tried to be discreet, walking on her tiptoes wearing only a pair of purple socks, yet the wood decided to scream under her. Her hand flattens against the wall for balance. The last thing she needs right now is to wake Nicky. Her boy, her entire universe, is a light sleeper. Unlike her, he can fall asleep pretty fast, but if he's awoken during the night, well... that's a whole other kind of night. She knows how those go. She's lived them, especially these past few days when he was sick.</p><p>"Fucking old stairs," she murmurs under her breath, barely a sound, and shifts her weight more carefully. She climbs the rest of the way srtill on her toes, hoping this time, the stairs will shut up. And on her way to her bedroom, she pauses outside Nicky's door to check on him, to make sure he's peacefully sleeping and well.</p><p>The door is cracked open just enough for her to slip inside. The glow-in-the-dark stars stuck to his ceiling are barely visible in the gloom. The light from the corridor lights the room enough so she can see Nicky, who is out cold, a little tangle of limbs in his dinosaur pajamas, lying facedown with one arm flung above his head like he's mid-dream gesture, the other curled tight around Señor Scratchy (his favorite stuffed animal—a white and brown rabbit Agatha got him a few years ago. Well, it used to be white, but now the color looks more like cream with time. But alas, Nicky doesn't want to let go of it, even if she had to sew one of his arms back once).</p><p>His snores are soft, barely there, but Agatha hears them in the silence of the house. He's still deep asleep, thankfully, and oh so cute.</p><p>She's really happy that he's feeling better now, because the last few days have been hell. He had a fever, refused to eat—or if he did, he ended up throwing up. He spent the days sleeping on the couch, curled against his mother and his nights were restless. He also refused to let go of Agatha, scared to be left alone to sleep, so she had him sleep in her room. Well, sleep is a big word, more like cuddle while she read to him, hoping he'd finally fall asleep.</p><p>These days were awful. The doctor said it was a small flu, that he'd get better soon with medicine, but as a mother, Agatha was terrified. He's the only family she has left. If something ever happened to him... fuck, she doesn't know what she'd do. Her child is her whole life, and seeing him so sick, so unwell for three entire days and nights, was pure torture. She had wished she could take his place, take his pain—she had to endure much more pain than a simple flu when she was younger, she could've handled it—but there was nothing she could do, and she felt useless.</p><p>The medicine, besides lowering his fever and making sure the very few things he drank and ate stayed in his body, didn't really help. The virus was still there, making his whole small body ache, and Agatha had to be there and watch it.</p><p>Nicky hasn't been so sick in over a year, and she had forgotten how bad it was. Now, he seems to be better and ready to go back to school, though she had told him he could spend the rest of the week at home to rest some more. He refused, though, telling his mother he wanted to see his friends and learn new things.</p><p>How she loves him, her little nerd.</p><p>She leans against the doorframe for a few more minutes, watching him breathe. He's still under the blue blanket she tucked around him earlier, still warm and safe in the dark. That's good. He needs the sleep, needs to catch up on this awful past few days.</p><p>Eventually, after a while, Agatha decides to step inside, still on her tiptoes. She stops at his bed and brushes a soft curl away from his forehead, making sure he doesn't have a fever as she does. Thankfully, his forehead isn't warm. He does seem to be healed and ready to go back to school—though, as an overprotective mother, she would've kept him at home for the rest of the week to be sure he's fully healed.</p><p>She kisses his head gently, then mutters a quick "Good night, buddy," before discreetly returning to the corridor, making sure to leave the door ajar, as she knows he doesn't enjoy sleeping with it entirely closed.</p><p>Then, the teacher quickly heads to the bathroom to brush her teeth and change into a pair of pyjamas—lilac Juicy Couture top with matching shorts—before heading straight to bed. She lays down and closes her eyes, but to her surprise, instead of seeing black (or technically a dark gray color called <em>eigengrau</em>—looks like black but isn't black; Nicky, being the nerd that he is, had told her this not long ago), no. Instead, she sees an azalea tattoo and a bare chest covered by toned arms.</p><p>Fuck.</p>

<p>The next morning, Agatha is finishing her coffee at the dining table with her head tilted slightly to the side and eyes half-lidded as she fights the urge to let her forehead drop against the surface. The mug between her hands is warm, but barely; she's been nursing it for too long, distracted by exhaustion and the sound of the rain outside.</p><p>Agatha usually loves the rain—she loves the vibe, the calm and soothing sound of it, even the gray of the clouds—but not today. She's been freezing since she got out of bed, even with her floral robe she wears over her work clothes to keep her warm. According to her phone, temperatures outside are only thirteen degrees celsius, which is not that bad, but when your body lacks sleep, it's always cold. The rain won't help, nor will the wind. Plus all these annoying teenagers so early in the morning... ugh, Agatha is certain that this day will be awful.</p><p>Across from her, Nicky, who unlike her had the <em>immense</em> privilege of getting his full eight hours of sleep, is already wide awake and munching away on a bowl of unhealthily chemical, colorful cereal. He asked for <em>Froot Loops</em>—could also be called diabetes in a bowl considering all the chemicals and sugar in them—but Agatha wasn't in the mood to argue this morning.</p><p>She's a good mom, don't get her wrong. Even on three hours of sleep, she'd still whip up eggs and bacon or pancakes shaped like dinosaurs if that's what he wanted. But when she offered, he scrunched his nose and insisted on the cereal with the weird bird on the box. She really shouldn't have bought this and will make sure to never buy it again, because her son deserves to grow up eating healthy things. At least a normal breakfast, homemade, with no weird artificial colors and a crazy amount of sugar and shit.</p><p>While eating, Nicky hums under his breath, and Agatha recognizes the tune almost immediately as <em>The Ballad of the Witches' Road</em> by Lorna Wu. It's been playing on a loop in their house for weeks. He's completely obsessed with that song and the entire album it comes from, and though she'd never say it aloud, Agatha might actually like it too. Let's say it's not that bad. Kind of similar to Fleetwood Mac, but without Stevie Nicks' iconic voice. That's actually what Agatha got him for Christmas: a vinyl of the full album, the fancy edition with the purple cover and silver lettering. He screamed when he opened it and immediately went to his room to play it on his record player. Now, every time she hears the intro chords, she finds herself tapping her foot before she even realizes it.</p><p>She's just about to tell him to hurry up and get dressed when her phone buzzes on the table.</p><p>Her heart skips a beat.</p><p>Shit, is she late? Did she lose track of time somehow? She fumbles for the phone, blinking hard to get her tired eyes to focus on the screen, and when she finally does, she exhales with quiet relief. 7:02 a.m. Still plenty of time before she has to leave for school. It's not, as she expected, a message from the school, no. It's a new message from the unknown number.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 7:02 AM</strong><br/>Sorry for interrupting your work last night. Hope you managed to finish everything</p><p>Agatha stares at the message for a second, caught off guard by how oddly considerate it is. She should probably delete it—ignore it, move on, pretend none of this ever happened because this woman is nothing but a wrong number—but something makes her pause. And before she can stop herself, she types back.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:03 AM</strong><br/>I did, thankfully</p><p>The reply comes instantly, as if the stranger had been sitting there, waiting for her to respond.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 7:03 AM</strong><br/>Good to hear :)</p><p>That woman is nice. She always uses those weird emoticons and does seem like a sweet person. Agatha now realizes how rude she was yesterday, and she feels the need to apologize—something she normally never does (except to Nicky, of course).</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:05 AM</strong><br/>I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't want to sound mean or anything, I was just exhausted and wanted to finish my work ASAP to be able to get a few hours of sleep. I was rude to you while you did nothing wrong. I apologize</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 7:05 AM</strong><br/>It's fine, don't worry</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 7:05 AM</strong><br/>I shouldn't have asked too many questions. We don't know each other, as you said</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:06 AM</strong><br/>Still. I was mean. Sorry about that</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 7:06 AM</strong><br/>I like mean ;)</p><p>Her eyebrows raise a little, one corner of her mouth twitching up in reluctant amusement. She doesn't exactly know what to make of that last message, and she's too tired to decipher any implied flirtation—if that's even what it is—so she lets it hang there and replies with something completelly different.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:07 AM</strong><br/>To answer the question you asked yesterday, I was working on high school history exams. End of the semester, I had 3 classes to correct. Took me a very long time</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 7:07 AM</strong><br/>Ooh, you're a teacher?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:07 AM</strong><br/>Unfortunately</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 7:08 AM</strong><br/>You don't like your job?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:09 AM</strong><br/>I do, but sometimes it's hard. I got, like, maybe 3 hours of sleep today? Something like that. I can barely keep my eyes open and I'm about to face annoying teenagers in an hour</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 7:09 AM</strong><br/>Shit. Good luck</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:09 AM</strong><br/>I'll need more than luck to survive the day</p><p>The teacher gives another glance at the time, and something clicks in her head.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:10 AM</strong><br/>Wait, why are you up this early? What time is it? 4 a.m. or something?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 7:10 AM</strong><br/>Yup, it's 4. Couldn't sleep so I thought I'd text you to apologize. I wasn't expecting you to respond so quickly tho</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:10 AM</strong><br/>Fuck</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:10 AM</strong><br/>Go to sleep. At least you can</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 7:11 AM</strong><br/>Yes ma'am ;)</p><p><em>Holy shit.</em> No, no, no, she can't say this. She just can't...</p><p>Agatha's eyes widen a bit at the unexpected message, before a new one comes in.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 7:11 AM</strong><br/>And good luck for today. I'm sure it'll be okay</p><p>The teacher can't stop the smile forming on her lips. She then sets the phone face-down on the table and glances up just in time to see Nicky looking at her, spoon paused halfway to his mouth and milk dripping down his chin.</p><p>"Mama, who are you texting?" he asks, curious. She doesn't wonder why. Agatha Harkness isn't the kind of woman to have her eyes glued to her phone—when she texts, which is very rare, it's either to the school, her colleagues, or her best friend Wanda. But considering she lives in the house next door, they just meet up in person to talk instead of exchanging texts. So it's no surprise that Nicky is curious about who his mom is texting so early in the morning, and especially why she's smiling like an idiot at the screen.</p><p>Agatha, panicking, simply clears her throat and says, "No one important." It's real. It's no one important, just a wrong number. Nicky doesn't have to worry about that. "Finish your bowl, sweetie. You still need to get dressed for school."</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>By the time Agatha gets to Westview High, right after dropping Nicky at his own elementary school, it's already 8:13 a.m. Thirteen whole minutes late. Between helping her son get dressed (which included a twenty-minute hunt for one missing shoe), struggling to do her own makeup without poking her eye out and getting stuck in the morning traffic, she ended up arriving late for the first time in nearly three month. And Agatha Harkness is <em>not</em> a woman who arrives late. She prides herself on punctuality; it's part of the image, part of the persona. How else are her students supposed to respect her—or better, fear her—if she doesn't at least show up on time?</p><p>But not today. No, today, on a Friday of all days, she walks into the main hallway and sees a group of her students already waiting outside her classroom. Some are sitting cross-legged on the floor, heads leaned against their backpacks or the lockers behind them, while others are simply standing around in loose circles, chatting like it's recess in middle school instead of the start of a junior history class.</p><p>Shit. Agatha really hopes her colleagues, who unlike her started their class on time, won't say anything about her being late and leaving her loud students bothering the whole hallway during class time. If there's one thing she hates above all, it's being scolded like a schoolgirl by adults.</p><p>"You're late, Professor Snape," one student jokes when he sees the teacher walking towards the locked classroom.</p><p>Ugh, seriously? She hasn't even been there for five fucking minutes and she already wants to throw a student out the window (come on, it's the ground floor, it's not like they're gonna break a bone or anything).</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Agatha turns around in a swift movement, twirling her long royal blue coat as she approaches the door. Okay, <em>that</em> is probably the reason why that one student called her Professor Snape, but she won't stop doing it. This coat is her favorite, and if she wants to dramatically move it like the Slytherin's robe, well, she fucking will. Agatha Harkness isn't scared of a seventeen-year-old child, for fuck's sake. If someone should be scared, it's them, because the history teacher is not known for her patience, especially with three hours of sleep and an unhealthy amount of caffeine in her body so early in the morning.</p><p>Once she arrives in front of the closed door, she takes out her key (which has a cute rabbit keychain on it, matching the one Nicky has on his schoolbag), but not before turning her head and giving the courageous student that called her Snape a dark glance. But not any kind of angry glance, no, the kind that will certainly make him shut up for the rest of the semester, the kind that screams <em>'if I had powers, I'd cast Imperio on you and force you to ridiculize yourself in front of the whole school.'</em> Of course, Agatha is not heartless, she is a mother herself and would never truly harm a child even if she could. So no <em>Crucio</em> spell on anyone.</p><p>The boy quickly looks away from her scary glance, pretending to talk to a friend, though his flushed ears betray him. Not so brave now, huh?</p><p>Without wasting another second, Agatha finally unlocks the door and strides into her classroom, with her dear coat moving behind her. She tosses her purple leather cross-body bag onto the desk and begins pulling out the neat stack of graded exams she worked on for half the night.</p><p>Those fucking copies, ugh. Sometimes she isn't sure if she's teaching high schoolers or preschoolers, considering their ridiculous false answers and their unreadable writing. Maybe she should send a few back to preschool so they can learn how to write properly, in a readable handwriting. Even Nicky can write better than them, can you believe it?</p><p>Her students file in behind her and sit down at their assigned seats.</p><p>Her class isn't that big, fifteen teenagers only, but this doesn't mean it's any easier. Some are evil. Pure evil. Making fun of her as soon as she has her back turned, laughing and throwing paper balls at her. Her response is usually yelling at them about how immature they are for juniors, which works for some because they stop their shenanigans right after, but some resist and don't care about getting yelled at, like the boy who called her Snape. Pretty courageous boy—she'll make sure to keep an eye on him.</p><p>Once everyone is more or less seated and semi-silent, she walks to the front of the classroom and stands tall, arms crossed to look more intimidating. If her demons—sorry, <em>students</em>—realize that she's sleep-deprived and that she can barely keep her eyes open, if they realize that today, she's not at her best, weak even, they'll take advantage of it to make her day a living hell. Agatha knows them well, especially a small group that loves to test her patience, see how far she'll go.</p><p>"Good morning, class," she begins. "Sorry I'm late today. As you may have noticed, I've been absent the past few days. My son had the flu and I had to take care of him twenty-four seven. This morning, I had to speak with his teacher about his homework and the things he missed, which made me run late. Anyway, moving on. I corrected your copies, and I have to say... this is catastrophic. Even my son could have done better than some of you."</p><p>She spends the whole hour talking about the exam with her students. Then, finally, they're out of the room and Agatha has a ten minutes break before her new class arrives. She's about to close her eyes to rest them a bit, but of course, her phone buzzes again. She hesitates for half a second before pulling it out, secretly hoping that it's that stranger again.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 9:03 AM</strong><br/>Good morning, teacher. How's the day going?</p><p><em>Bingo.</em> That's her. Agatha huffs out a soft, amused snort, and she's already typing back before she can talk herself out of it.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:03 AM</strong><br/>Awful. I'm sleep-deprived and those assholes are not respecting me. One of them called me Professor Snape</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 9:04 AM</strong><br/>No way lol. Why? Do you have black straightened hair and dress in all black? Wait, you're a woman, right?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:04 AM</strong><br/>Yes, I'm a woman. And no, I have long brown hair. But I do have a long navy blue coat that I swirl around when I walk. And I'm mean, apparently</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 9:05 AM</strong><br/>You, mean? ;) Nah. I refuse to believe that</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:05 AM</strong><br/>I like discipline</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 9:05 AM</strong><br/>Is that so? ;)</p><p>She can't help but blush at that response. It's stupid, really, why would she blush at that like a teenager who's just been flirted with? Maybe that stranger wasn't even talking about the innuendo with that response. Or maybe she did. Fuck it.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:06 AM</strong><br/>What are you still doing up, stranger?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 9:06 AM</strong><br/>Still can't sleep. And I've got an appointment in an hour, so it's not like I can rest now</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:06 AM</strong><br/>An appointment at 7 a.m.? Seriously?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 9:07 AM</strong><br/>Unfortunately</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:07 AM</strong><br/>You still haven't told me what you do for a living</p><p>This time, a new message doesn't come in in the next few seconds like the previous ones.</p><p>Shit, maybe she shouldn't have asked that. Too personal, they don't even know each other. She's about to type an apology when finally, the stranger responds.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 9:09 AM</strong><br/>I have to go, sorry</p><p>Fuck. She really scared her away. <em>Congratulations, Agatha, really.</em></p><p>To her surprise, another message follows almost immediately.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 9:09 AM</strong><br/>Good luck with your day :)</p><p>Before Agatha can respond to this—maybe wishing her good luck for her mysterious early-morning appointment or just say goodbye—the second wave of students starts filing into the classroom. They don't even wait till the teacher opens the door for them, no, they enter the room as soon as the bell rings, not even bothering to say hello or acknowledge the older woman half-asleep at her desk.</p><p>Agatha quickly locks her phone, without even taking the time to respond to that stranger, and sets it aside, putting on her most authoritative expression as she calls for everyone to settle down.</p><p>Well, this day is just getting better and better. Obviously, that's a joke. This class is the worst; they don't respect her, keep chatting when she speaks, use their phones during lessons. She hates them all, as much as they hate her. If they see just an ounce of hesitation in her expression, something that can tell them that she's not as bossy as she wants them to think, or that behind her Professor Snape statue is just a soft, overprotective mom, they'll make her pay for the rest of the school year. They're even worse than her previous class.</p><p>Clearing her throat, she starts the lesson, trying hard not to think about how the stranger reacted that way when she asked her about her job. Sensitive topic, maybe, or too early to talk about as they've known each other for not even a day.</p><p>The morning passes in a blur, and Agatha already wants to go home. All she wants to do right now is lay in her bed, close her eyes and sleep all the afternoon. Alas, she still has a class to teach after lunch before she'll be able to go home. And then, she won't even be able to rest because she'll have to clean the house, go get Nicky at his own school, then prepare him a snack, then eventually make dinner, and then, fucking finally, she'll be able to sleep.</p><p>This day is absolutely endless.</p><p>Thankfully, though, now is the lunch break. Agatha isn't that hungry—she never is when she's sleep-deprived—but she forces herself to eat a few bites anyway to give her body some strength. She'll need it if she wants to survive the rest of the day in one piece.</p><p>So she forces herself to sit at the teacher's table in the break room, fork lazily poking at her half-eaten salad, trying her absolute best not to rest her head on the table and fall asleep in front of her colleagues.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Jen asks, frowning at her from across the table. Jen—a short nickname she let her colleagues use instead of her full name, Jennifer Kale—teaches English, and thank God she's one of the good ones. Agatha can't say she's her best friend, but she's not that bad to be around.</p><p>The history teacher lifts her head slowly, blinking at the voice breaking the silence of the room. "Hm?"</p><p>"I asked if you were okay. You look like death."</p><p>"I feel like death," Agatha mutters, rubbing her temple. "I spent half the night correcting the history exams."</p><p>"Oof," Alice says from her seat nearby, stirring her yogurt. Alice Gulliver is the music teacher, also known as Jen's love interest (or secret girlfriend, who knows?). "That bad?"</p><p>"That bad," she confirms with a sigh. "Even Nicky could have answered better than some of them, and he's seven."</p><p>"I mean, with Agatha Harkness as a mother, that boy must be a genius," Alice chuckles.</p><p>"I'm not that authoritarian as a mom."</p><p>That's true. Though the woman terrifies a lot of students—and even some teachers, the ones she doesn't particularly get along with—she is a soft mom. Nicholas is her whole world, her only family left. Her own blood. She loves him with all her dark heart and can't help but be soft and overprotective with him.</p><p>How could she not? That boy is nice, smart, respectful. If they go to the store, he always says hello and goodbye. If he sees their elderly neighbor Sharon carrying her groceries, he insists on helping her (though Agatha keeps repeating he doesn't have to, but alas, he's a very polite guy). Nicky is the easiest person to love, and Agatha can't see her life without him. Not making him shitty dinner, not reading to him before sleeping, not hugging him while they watch movies that he's way too young to watch... Her life would be so miserable without him.</p><p>Besides yelling at him when he really does something bad (which is extremely rare, and when she does, she always feels guilty afterward), she's not authoritarian at all. She lets him do many things, does anything to make him happy. She lets him live his child life. Lets him do the things she never got to do as a kid because her mom was a bitch who hated her daughter for simply existing.</p><p>When Nicky was born, Agatha was so scared she'd be a bad mom. That she'd be like Evanora. She promised herself to never, ever hurt her baby like that evil woman did, and she kept that promise. Nicky is her sweet, spoiled baby, and so loved.</p><p>Her thoughts are interrupted by her phone buzzing on the table. Instinctively, she glances down, and she can't help the smile that spreads across her face when she sees who it is.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:06 PM</strong><br/>Sorry about earlier. I didn't want to sound rude</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:06 PM</strong><br/>How's your day going, Snape? ;)</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, leaning back in her chair as she types a response.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:07 PM</strong><br/>Stop calling me that, Dumbledore</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:07 PM</strong><br/>Dumbledore? Ouch. Please, I'm hotter than this old gray man</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:07 PM</strong><br/>How would I know? All that I saw is your tattoo</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:07 PM</strong><br/>Come ooon, you saw a bit more than that ;)</p><p>Her cheeks heat up unconsciously as her mind goes back to that photo. How the stranger's strong arm was covering her breasts, how the tattoo—Agatha's favorite flower and color, mind you—was etched to her skin. How those white-ish lines stood out on her hip, right above what seemed to be green boxer briefs. How her tanned skin framed the photo...</p><p>
<em>Fuck, no. Shut up.</em>
</p><p>Quickly shaking the photo out of her head, the teacher types back.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 1:09 PM</strong><br/>I'm hotter than Snape too, asshole</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 1:09 PM</strong><br/>I wouldn't know about that...</p><p>The heat she felt on her cheeks now starts spreading to her neck.</p><p>"Who's making you smile like that?" Jen's voice interrupts her and her smile drops immediately, replaced by embarrassment.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat and turns her phone off. "No one."</p><p>"So <em>no one</em> is the reason why you're blushing so hard right now, huh? Jeez, Harkness, don't tell me you're sexting at work."</p><p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>"Jennifer! Are you crazy? I'm not! I don't even know her."</p><p>Alice and Jen exchange a glance, and the music teacher is the next one to speak with a smirk on her lips. "So that's a <em>she</em>. Come on, Agatha, spill."</p><p>She crosses her arms over her chest, her half-eaten salad now abandoned on the table. She's not hungry anymore anyways, and the school's food is far from being the best. Obviously, she didn't have time to pack her own lunch, unlike the two other women who reheated some stuff they brought in tupperwares. Stuff that looks so fucking delicious. "There's nothing to tell."</p><p>"The blush on your face says the contrary."</p><p>Damn you, stupid teachers!</p><p>"Ugh!" She sighs in defeat. She knows that if she keeps the secret, they won't stop harassing her about it. "Fine. Yesterday, a girl sent a photo to the wrong number and we kept talking for some reason. That's all." At the weird face the two women make, she clarifies, "A photo of a <em>tattoo</em>. She said it was meant for her friend, but she changed her number and typed it wrong or whatever. As I said, nothing important."</p><p>Jen smirks. "And yet, you keep talking."</p><p>"She keeps texting me."</p><p>"And you keep answering. Is she hot?"</p><p><em>Yes</em> is the only response that comes to her mind. Sure, she didn't see her face, but fuck, the few things she saw were indeed very hot.</p><p>"I don't know," she lies, "she didn't send her face. Just her tattoo."</p><p>"So how do you know she's a woman? Did she tell you?" Alice asks.</p><p>Fuck, why are they so nosy? "Well... uh, it was an underboob tattoo. Kind of. Vines and flowers going around the... breasts."</p><p>Both women gasp at that, as if it's something scandalous. And it's not. It was just a tattoo, nothing else.</p><p>"Agatha Harkness—"</p><p>"Don't <em>Agatha Harkness</em> me, Jennifer! Her boobs were covered by her arm, obviously, you perv. But still. Could clearly tell it was a woman."</p><p>"Okay, okay, you absolutely need to show us this photo."</p><p>"Absolutely not."</p><p>"And why's that? I thought it was just an underboob tattoo, huh?"</p><p>She nods, "Yes, it is. And it wasn't meant for me. I won't show this photo to anyone, it's private."</p><p>"How considerate of you," Alice jokes with a smile. "But you're right. So, what have you been talking about, then?"</p><p>Honestly? Nothing besides some (flirty?) jokes. But Agatha enjoyed it, enjoys talking to her. She makes her smile.</p><p>"Nothing," she replies honestly.</p><p>Jen chuckles. "Nothing? You were texting her two minutes ago. What did she say?"</p><p>"You're such a nosy one, Jen."</p><p>"Come on, Agatha! This is exciting. You never talk to anyone, your life is so boring. Entertain us a bit."</p><p>Okay, she's not wrong. Her life <em>is</em> boring. While she does enjoy working as a history teacher, the lessons are always the same. Every year, she teaches the same thing to the new classes, and every year, she gets the same wrong, stupid answers to tests. On the weekends and breaks, she spends time with Nicky, which is probably her only source of entertainment. But besides him and Wanda, her life is indeed boring.</p><p>She hasn't had a girlfriend—or even got laid—in years. She went on a few dates with women she met on dating apps months ago, but they just ran away as soon as they learned Agatha had a son. She can't blame them, though. Who would want an old single mother, huh? She also did have a few one-night stands here and there because she missed having sex, but she quickly got bored of it and rarely came. The women she had sex with were... boring. She didn't know them for more than an hour. They didn't know what she needed, didn't know what to do to please her, and Agatha never tried to tell them. She just faked an orgasm so it would end and she could finally go home. Ever since, she's had her own solitary pleasures with her dear toys. Way better. At least, she knows what she needs, knows what her body needs.</p><p>After a moment, Agatha clears her throat. "We were just joking," she responds, talking about that unknown number. "I told her one of my students called me Professor Snape this morning, and she made fun of me. So I called her Dumbledore, and we kept joking about it, that's all. As I said, nothing interesting."</p><p>Once again, Jen and Alice exchange a silent, understanding glance before returning to their lunch.</p><p>Agatha sighs. She can't wait for this endless day to end so she can <em>finally</em> go home.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>As soon as Agatha gets home from work and from picking up Nicky at his elementary school, which thankfully is just five minutes away by car from the high school she teaches at, she kicks the door shut with her foot and drops her bag by the entrance, not even bothering to hang her coat. Her body aches, her mind is fried, and her eyes are already begging to close.</p><p>This day was one of the most horrible she'd had in weeks, and she's not even surprised. End of the semester; the kids are taking the opportunity, since they don't have any more tests before the next semester starts, to cause some mayhem. In her afternoon class, she had entered the classroom only to find a <em>penis</em> drawn with white chalk on the blackboard. Seriously, what the fuck? What are they, twelve? No, they're freaking teenagers—teenagers that, in a year, will be considered adults once they reach eighteen years old.</p><p>Agatha had sighed at it and immediately removed the disgusting, silly drawing while waiting for her students to arrive. She wasn't even sure how they managed to get inside the locked classroom, or even who did it, but she has an idea. However, without proof, she can't just go and accuse a student, so she just shut up and spent an hour speaking about the American Civil War, aka one of the things she hates the most.</p><p>Yes, the woman is a history teacher, and no, she isn't interested in every single thing she has to teach. Wars are her least favorite subject to talk about and, without any surprises, her favorite is the Salem Witch Trials and Colonial America, which she taught last semester. She just never understood why people fought—and why they <em>still</em> fight—for absolutely no reason, like two kids fighting over a toy. It's just ridiculous, and she really hates lingering on it. But alas, that's her job, so she doesn't have a choice, even when her students don't listen to a single thing she's saying.</p><p>With a tired sigh, the teacher stumbles into the living room and falls onto the couch. Finally, some calm. Finally, more than ten seconds of silence. High school? Nah, more like a zoo. Agatha spends her days teaching some wild animals who can't understand a single word of English and just do stupid things all day long. Maybe she should switch to elementary school—she's sure the kids would be easier to handle.</p><p>"Are you okay, mama?" Nicky asks from the hallway as he drops his schoolbag on the floor. It's a brown and green one with a t-rex and all sorts of dinosaurs on it that Agatha got him before the new school year started. They had seen it at the store, but it was a bit pricey, so Nicky didn't say anything about it.</p><p>His mother, however, noticed how he looked at the bag, noticed that he wanted it but never said anything. As if he had to care about her money. So obviously, she bought it and surprised him with it before going back to school. He was so happy when he got it and gave his mama a big hug before hanging a silver rabbit keyring on the zipper as an accessory, matching the one Agatha has on her own bag. Like that, they both have a part of each other with them, and if they have a bad day, they just look at it and smile.</p><p>Agatha smiles. She loves how worried he always is, how caring he is. He's such an amazing kid, the best in the world. "Yes, sweetie, I'm good. Just tired, you don't have to worry about me. Just do your homework, okay? I'm right here if you need help."</p><p>He nods at her, smiling, then sits on the floor next to the couch where she is sitting and pulls out his notebooks. He always does his homework on the coffee table, even though he has a desk in his bedroom and the dining table is free too, if he wants to be downstairs. But no, he always chooses the coffee table. Agatha knows it's because he likes being near her, and she's glad for it, though sometimes she wonders how long that'll last before he becomes one of the teenagers she teaches every day, rolling their eyes and pretending they don't care. For now, he still looks up to her. For now, she's still his favorite person in the world.</p><p>"Do you need help?" she asks after a moment, when he starts writing something.</p><p>"I'm good for now, ma!"</p><p>Ah, yes, this nickname. A short for <em>mama</em> that he often uses when he's focused or, on the contrary, in a rush. It's sweet, and she doesn't mind it at all. At first, Agatha was surprised that he didn't use <em>mommy</em> or just <em>mom</em> like the other kids, but at the same time... she also wasn't that surprised. His father, if we can call him that, was a Latino man. Nicky, no matter the fact that he has never seen or heard about the man that helped with his conception, has a part of Latino in him. Agatha never denied it. She isn't sure, however, where he heard that word for the first time, but he's been using it ever since, and she doesn't mind at all. It's cute.</p><p>She watches him for a second, making sure he's all good and doesn't need any help (though she doubts he will; Nicky's a smart kid), then gets up from the couch. She quickly kisses his head before dragging herself into the kitchen. If she doesn't have a boost right now, she's gonna fall asleep, and she can't allow that. Not when Nicky still hasn't done his homework and needs dinner.</p><p>Sighing, Agatha opens one cabinet and after a few seconds, she decides to grab the bottle of Italian wine Wanda gifted her ages ago. She wanted to keep it for a special occasion, but that never came. She's already birthed a child and isn't going to do it again, she has no partner to get married to, no special occasion ahead. But surviving a day of class surrounded by loud, annoying teenagers while being sleep-deprived can totally count as one, yeah.</p><p>So the woman pours herself a glass and leans against the counter. She's not even much of a drinker—usually only when she's out with friends or celebrating something—but she really needs it right now. A small moan escapes her lips as soon as the expensive taste of red wine touches her lips. Agatha isn't an expert when it comes to wines, but she can't deny that this one is a great one. This is different than anything she's tasted before, with a rich aroma yet delicate. It's simply perfect.</p><p>She closes her eyes for a second, trying not to think about how much she still has to do tonight before she can finally go to bed and get some well-deserved rest. She's gotta feed Nicky, and not just chips or toast, though both sound tempting right now. She has to come up with something halfway nutritious, even if the fridge is basically empty and her brain isn't working anymore.</p><p>She could skip dinner herself, honestly. Wouldn't be the first time. But her lovely seven-year-old needs a proper dinner, so she'll have to find something. Hopefully. She was supposed to get groceries today, as she only had one afternoon class, but she was too tired to go. Just the thought of being in a store for more than five minutes, surrounded by loud people, made her headache worse, so she decided not to go. Which was a mistake, considering the fridge is basically empty.</p><p>She takes another long sip of wine before she feels her phone buzz in the back pocket of her pants. The sound alone is enough to make her heart skip a beat. She already knows who it is. It can only be <em>her.</em></p><p>She turns her phone on, and a smile immediately stretches across her lips as she reads the new message from that stranger. It's stupid, really, but she can't help it. Even if it's a wrong number—a complete stranger—she actually enjoys talking to her. Besides Nicky, she's currently her only source of distraction, and for once, Agatha allows it. At least for now.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:42 PM</strong><br/>How was your day?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:43 PM</strong><br/>Survived. Barely. How about you?</p><p>As she expected—and hoped—the reply comes immediately.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:43 PM</strong><br/>Long. But it's fine :)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:43 PM</strong><br/>Did your mysterious early morning appointment go well?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:43 PM</strong><br/>I do hope so</p><p>The teacher raises an eyebrow and takes another sip of her glass of wine.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:44 PM</strong><br/>You don't know how your own appointment went?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:44 PM</strong><br/>It's complicated. It was an appointment related to my job. Nothing bad, but I don't really want to talk about it, sorry</p><p>Her job. Here we go again. What kind of job can this woman have that she can't even talk about it? Agatha raises an eyebrow at the vague response but decides not to push. Maybe she just wants to keep her privacy, which she completely understands, though revealing her job wouldn't put her in danger. It's not like she'd tell her where she lives exactly, or where she works, or anything.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:45 PM</strong><br/>It's fine. Sorry for asking. Just curious</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:45 PM</strong><br/>Don't worry about it, sensei :)</p><p>Another nickname. Better than Snape, she supposes. She laughs softly, then grabs her glass of wine and a pack of chips for Nicky before heading back into the living room.</p><p>"Here you go," she says, placing the chips on the coffee table. Nicky murmurs a quick thanks before opening the package and returning his attention to his homework.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:47 PM</strong><br/>Sensei?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:47 PM</strong><br/>What? Don't tell me you prefer Snape?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:48 PM</strong><br/>I don't, McGonagall</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:49 PM</strong><br/>Hey, not nice :( I don't have gray hair yet</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:49 PM</strong><br/>How would I know? You never told me your age</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:49 PM</strong><br/>You never asked</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:49 PM</strong><br/>I'm asking now</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:50 PM</strong><br/>I'm 26 ;) you?</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath as she reads the response. She blinks once, then twice, like maybe she read it wrong, or maybe her phone glitched, or that woman's autocorrect had some wild stroke and replaced the real number with another one.</p><p><em>Twenty-six.</em> Holy fucking shit. That's a <em>child.</em> That's someone who was a baby when <em>Friends</em> was airing live, someone who probably never had to memorize a landline number or rewind a VHS, someone who uses slang she doesn't understand. Agatha didn't think about the fact that she never asked her age. And fuck, she should have. What was she thinking? She sets the wine glass down on the coffee table a little harder than she means to, the bottom clinking against the granite as her stomach does a slow roll.</p><p>She's thirty-seven, a high school teacher with back pain and a seven-year-old son who still calls her Mama and sometimes crawls into her bed at night after a bad dream. What the hell is she doing? What kind of midlife crisis is this, exactly? Is she <strike>flirting</strike> talking with a college student? Is she the creep now, the older woman who lurks around younger ones? Okay, twelve years younger isn't <em>that</em> bad, but for Agatha, it is. She's a mom, a woman who never goes out anymore, who works all day and takes care of her son. That stranger is so... young. Their lives are so different. <em>They</em> are so different.</p><p>Fuck. What would she even do with someone that young? More importantly, what would someone that young want with her?</p><p>After a moment, she finally replies.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:54 PM</strong><br/>I'm 37</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:54 PM</strong><br/>Niceee</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:54 PM</strong><br/>Not very nice. I already have back pain, can you believe it?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:55 PM</strong><br/>Come onnn you're not that old</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:55 PM</strong><br/>You'll see when you're my age</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:55 PM</strong><br/>Omggg you're not a fossil. And I'm not a child. I'm 26, I'm a woman</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:55 PM</strong><br/>You're 12 years younger than me</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:56 PM</strong><br/>Exactly. 12. It's not that bad at all. Don't talk about yourself like an old lady, stranger. You can't even really be considered a milf yet</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:56 PM</strong><br/>A milf?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:56 PM</strong><br/>You don't know what a milf is?? Okay, you're old</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes at this and makes a mental note to check the term later. Then, she gives a glance at the time and types another message.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:57 PM</strong><br/>I'll have to leave soon</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:57 PM</strong><br/>Already? Are you going to sleep?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:57 PM</strong><br/>I wish. But no. I have to make dinner</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:58 PM</strong><br/>Can't you order something?</p><p>She hesitates before typing, fingers hovering above the keyboard. She could order something, yes. She'd do that—or even skip dinner altogether—if she didn't have Nicky. But her sweet boy deserves a real dinner, especially since tomorrow's their usual game night at the Maximoff's, where they order takeout. Once a week is more than enough.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 5:59 PM</strong><br/>I can't</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 5:59 PM</strong><br/>Why? I know it's not the healthiest type of food ever, but it's a lifesaver when you don't want to cook</p><p>Agatha looks down at Nicky, who's silently finishing his homework at the coffee table. One of his hands is busy scribbling something in his notebook, while his free one reaches into the bag of salt and vinegar chips. He's completely unbothered by her, focused on whatever he's doing.</p><p>Should she talk to that woman about him? They've known each other for two days. But she does enjoy talking to her, and she already saw that she's a woman. A beautiful one. She's not a creepy man, just a wrong number who happens to be fun to talk to.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:01 PM</strong><br/>I'm not the only one eating here</p><p>She finally decides to respond something mysterious. It's their thing, after all, isn't it?</p><p>To her surprise, she doesn't receive a response for the next three minutes or so. Which is strange, considering how fast she usually answers. Maybe she's just busy with her mysterious job, or just something else.</p><p>Agatha finishes her glass of wine in one long sip and takes the opportunity to look down at what Nicky is doing. Unsurprisingly, he doesn't need any help, answering each question one by one. And from what she's seeing, they're right. Obviously they are.</p><p>Finally, a new message comes in.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:05 PM</strong><br/>Oh</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:05 PM</strong><br/>So... you have a boyfriend? Or a husband?</p><p>Oh.</p><p>
<em>Oh?</em>
</p><p>A small smirk forms on Agatha's lips at the thought of that pretty stranger reading the message, wondering who she was talking about. And the thought of a man sharing her house, her bed, makes her want to throw up.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:06 PM</strong><br/>I'm a lesbian</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:06 PM</strong><br/>But no, no partner</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:07 PM</strong><br/>Oh. Nice to know. So...</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:07 PM</strong><br/>I have a son</p><p>Better to be honest here. If she plans on continuing to talk to that woman (which she definitely plans to, as of now), she wants her to know who she is. A lesbian, middle-aged woman who has a seven-year-old nerdy son. The kind of woman people don't usually want to be friends with. Besides Wanda and her colleagues—who Agatha refuses to call friends—she has no one. No one wants to hang with <em>the witch.</em></p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:09 PM</strong><br/>Oh</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:10 PM</strong><br/>That's where you're gonna tell me that you don't want to talk to me anymore because I'm old and not fun?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:10 PM</strong><br/>Are you crazy? No</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:10 PM</strong><br/>Sorry, it just surprised me. Didn't expect it</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:10 PM</strong><br/>But?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:11 PM</strong><br/>There's no but. You're funny and definitely not old</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:11 PM</strong><br/>How old is your son? :)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:11 PM</strong><br/>7 years old</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:11 PM</strong><br/>That's sweet</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:11 PM</strong><br/>I do have a question, though. If you feel like answering. You really don't have to, I'm just curious...</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:12 PM</strong><br/>I'm listening</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:12 PM</strong><br/>You said you're a lesbian. So how...</p><p><em>How did she make Nicky.</em> Everybody she meets who learns that she's a lesbian asks this question. Which is understandable, and Agatha has never been ashamed to admit the truth.</p><p>She was getting older—twenty-nine at that time—and she knew that if she wanted a child, she'd have to have one fast before she got too old. But as a lesbian and with no partner? It would've taken forever. IVF is expensive, long, and not guaranteed to work. Adoption was out of the picture, as Agatha wanted her own child, from her own blood. So the last solution was getting drunk and sleeping with a man. She and Wanda spent days at the bar, trying to find a decent man. They eventually found one—a Latino guy, respectful and smart. Agatha had flirted with him beforehand, until he nicely offered to go back to his place. With no pressure, he made sure she was okay with it, and she had agreed, thinking he was a decent man. And then, she just let it happen.</p><p>It was gross, but necessary. She lied to that guy, telling him she was on the pill, hoping one fuck would be enough—and thankfully, it was. She had planned everything; made sure she was in her fertile window and all of that. That man—that she can't even remember the name of—never knew about it. About Nicky. It might seem rude, awful even, but that's exactly what Agatha is. She wanted a child, and she found a way to have one. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. And according to Wanda, he moved not long after that drunken night, which made things much easier for everyone.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:13 PM</strong><br/>I wanted a kid. So I made one. Call me a slut if you want, I don't care</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:13 PM</strong><br/>I would never do that, stranger. So you just, what, had a one night stand?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:13 PM</strong><br/>Bit more complicated than that, but that's basically what happened</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:14 PM</strong><br/>Oh. Well, I respect it. The most important question is, are you happy?</p><p>Is she happy? She's never been this happy in her life. Having a kid really changed her, for the better and for the worse.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:14 PM</strong><br/>I am. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:14 PM</strong><br/>What about you?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:15 PM</strong><br/>What about me?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:15 PM</strong><br/>Do you have a boyfriend? Or a kid?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:16 PM</strong><br/>No, no girlfriend ;) and no kid either. I'm all alone</p><p><em>Girlfriend.</em> Not boyfriend. Obviously. How did she even doubt it for a second? I mean, she could've been bisexual. Or straight. No, not straight. Not at all.</p><p>"Mama, can you help me?" Nicky's voice interrupts her thoughts.</p><p>Agatha finally looks up from her phone, only for her eyes to meet her son's curious ones. "Yes, of course, sweetie. What do you need help with?"</p><p>Nicky shows her his textbook page. Math. Ugh.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:17 PM</strong><br/>Nicky needs help with his homework. I'll be back soon</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:17 PM</strong><br/>Cute name :) good luck</p><p>For the next twenty minutes or so, Agatha helps Nicky with his homework. Though he rarely asks for help, she's happy to be there for him whenever he needs to, for whatever he needs. She wants to be a good mom. She <em>is</em> a good mom.</p><p>Once Nicky is done, he runs upstairs to take a shower while Agatha starts preparing dinner. Or, well, trying to find something to cook for dinner. With the fridge empty, it's not that simple.</p><p>A new buzz from her phone interrupts her thoughts. With a smile, she closes the fridge and looks at the new message. This time, she doesn't even wonder who it is, she just knows.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:48 PM</strong><br/>Hi again :) How is it going?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:48 PM</strong><br/>Hi again. Good. Homework done, now I'm trying to cook</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:48 PM</strong><br/>Trying? Are you a bad cook?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:49 PM</strong><br/>Let's say that I'm not the best. And the fridge is basically empty</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:49 PM</strong><br/>I'm sure you'll find something</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:49 PM</strong><br/>Doubt it, but I don't have a choice</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:49 PM</strong><br/>Don't say that. Tell me what ingredients you have and I'll help you create a nice dinner for you and Nicky :)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:50 PM</strong><br/>Are you a chef or something? Is this your secret job, stranger?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:50 PM</strong><br/>No ;) but I'm not too bad at it. So, tell me what you have</p><p>Sighing, Agatha searches through the fridge and cupboards. As she expected, nothing much left.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:53 PM</strong><br/>I have frozen ground beef and eggs. I'm not gonna go far with this</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:53 PM</strong><br/>Do you have pasta? Or potatoes?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:53 PM</strong><br/>No. I was supposed to go to the store today but I was too exhausted</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:53 PM</strong><br/>Hmm, okay, let me think...</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:54 PM</strong><br/>Do you have onions and tomato sauce?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:54 PM</strong><br/>Yes</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:54 PM</strong><br/>Okay, great. By any chance, do you have bananas?</p><p>The woman frowns. Bananas? Why? She does have a few—Nicky likes to eat fruits as a dessert or a snack—but how will that be useful for dinner? They're not even ripe yet, as the store only had green ones. She'll have to wait a few days for them to be edible.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:55 PM</strong><br/>I do, but why bananas? They're not even ripe</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:55 PM</strong><br/>Perfect, then. You can make Pastelón. It's delicious. It's like lasagna but with bananas instead of pasta. Well, normally you have to use plantains, which are less sweet bananas, but normal ones will do, especially green ones. Trust me with this, it's amazing</p><p>Agatha snorts. She has not a single clue what Pastelón is and thinks it's really weird to make dinner with fruit.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:56 PM</strong><br/>Not a chef, huh?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 6:56 PM</strong><br/>Still not a chef. But I'm not too bad at cooking</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 6:56 PM</strong><br/>Alright. What's the recipe, chef? ;)</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>"That was so good!" Nicky says, placing his cutlery on his empty plate. "Where did you get the idea of cooking bananas for dinner, ma?"</p><p>Agatha smiles. That was, indeed, delicious. Making it wasn't that hard, especially with that stranger's detailed instructions, and it was really good. "A friend gave me her recipe."</p><p>"A friend? Who? Auntie Wanda?"</p><p>"No, sweetie, not Auntie Wanda. You don't know her, actually."</p><p>"What's her name? Why don't I know her?"</p><p>The exhausted woman gets up from her chair and starts cleaning the table. "It's late, why don't you go watch an episode of that cartoon you like while I finish cleaning, huh? I'll come read you a story later, sweetie."</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 8:47 PM</strong><br/>Thanks for the recipe. Nicky loved it</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 8:47 PM</strong><br/>I'm glad :)</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 8:47 PM</strong><br/>What about you? Did you like it?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 8:48 PM</strong><br/>It was fine</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 8:48 PM</strong><br/>Just fine?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 8:48 PM</strong><br/>Alright, it was great</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 8:48 PM</strong><br/>Told ya ;)</p><p>Later that night, Agatha lies next to Nicky in his bed, his favorite book open in her hands.</p><p>"This one, again?" she asks, fake-sighing. She knows how much Nicky likes this book, and she doesn't mind rereading it over and over again if it makes him smile. "It's the third time this week."</p><p>"Please, mama. I love this book. One more time?"</p><p>One more time. One more time <em>this week</em>, yeah.</p><p>The book Nicky is talking about is called <em>The Legend of the Christmas Witch</em>, written by Rio Vidal and illustrated by a woman called Lilia Calderu. It's a great book, Agatha has to admit it, but she doesn't necessarily enjoy rereading it over and over again. Nicky, however, doesn't mind.</p><p>"Alright," she smiles. "One more time, huh? Then I'll see if the author has written other books so I can order them. What do you think about it?"</p><p>"Yes! I heard she wrote a second book to this. I want to know what happens to Kristtörn next. Oh! And I think she's working on a new book."</p><p>"I'll check it out tomorrow and see if I can order it."</p><p>Nicky turns to her and throws his arm over her belly to hug her. "You're the best. I love you, mama."</p><p>This? She wouldn't trade it for anything in the world. Agatha kisses her son's head, then starts reading as she caresses his hair with her free hand. "Twas the season of Yuletide, and as the Cold Moon shone down, the Christmas Witch traveled to each little town. While Mother and Father slept soundly in bed, some children snuck to their windows instead. They fixed their eyes on the falling snow, in hopes for a glimpse of the witch's shadow."</p><p>It doesn't take long for the boy to fall asleep, just ten pages or so. Kissing his forehead one last time, Agatha gently slips away, trying not to wake him. Thankfully, tomorrow is Saturday, and they will both be able to get some rest.</p><p>Finally returning to her room after a long, exhausting day, Agatha falls into her bed. Literally. She lies there, on her stomach above the blankets, still in her work clothes, and she just closes her eyes. She falls asleep within a few minutes.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Twelve hours. That's how much sleep Agatha had today. Does she feel guilty about it? Not in the fucking slightest. That rest was much needed and more than well deserved.</p><p>When she wakes up in the morning, at eleven, she stretches in her bed, still above the blankets, and notices that she's still wearing her work clothes. White button-up with purple slacks. How the fuck did she manage to sleep with her bra on? She must have been really tired, because this shit is the most uncomfortable thing ever, and she wishes she could just never wear one again. Unfortunately, she can't. If she had smaller breasts, she probably would, but she doesn't, so she has to keep wearing uncomfortable bras all day long.</p><p>She sits down on the bed and gently rubs her eyes, blinking slowly. She feels much better than yesterday, full of energy and ready for their usual Saturday game night. That's something she, Wanda and the kids do every single week. Agatha and Nicky head over to their house around six-thirty, sometimes earlier if everyone is free, and start the day with some snacks. Usually a mix of chips, cheese, and cold cuts before they order a late-night dinner—always takeout, because neither Agatha nor Wanda has the energy to cook after a long week of work, and it's better for everyone if her husband doesn't approach the kitchen (Agatha still doesn't understand what her best friend is still doing with this man... but well).</p><p>So Saturday nights are their unhealthy day. They often eat pizza or Thai, or whatever can be ordered online and delivered to the house. Today, it's the Maximoffs', and next week will be the Harknesses'. They do a week each. Then it's board games until late, with the adults drinking cheap wine while the kids argue over the rules of Uno or scream about someone cheating (often Agatha, but shhh, they don't need to know about this).</p><p>Saturday game night is a tradition they've been following for the past year. They never miss a single week. It gives the two friends a chance to decompress, catch up on the latest gossip, and for Nicky to run around with Wanda's twins, who are both two years older than him but still young enough to include him in whatever ridiculous game they've invented. They've built blanket forts together, turned the living room into an obstacle course, staged battles with stuffed animals and action figures, and once, memorably, tried to summon a ghost with a homemade Ouija board in the twins' room. That one ended in tears, and Agatha had to remind them that fifty percent of horror movies always start like that, and that they should never touch a fucking Ouija board. Don't fuck with death (except if she's a hot cosmic entity as sometimes described in medias).</p><p>Nicky loves it. He counts down the days to Saturday like it's Christmas. He starts asking on Wednesday if he can sleep over, and most of the time, Agatha can't refuse. He's just too cute to say no, especially when he does his sad puppy eyes. This always works—Agatha can't resist those sweet eyes even if she tries really, really hard. And anyway, Wanda lives in the house on her right, so if there's any problem, she can go get her son in barely three minutes. He always packs his bag hours in advance, triple-checks it for his toothbrush and favorite pajamas, then stands at the door until his mother finally says it's time to go. And when the night's over, when the games are done and the takeout boxes are stacked on the counter, Agatha helps him change into his pajamas and puts him to bed before kissing his head and walking home, alone.</p><p>She really loves her son with all her dark heart, but she must admit that sometimes, it's nice to be home alone. She has plenty of time to watch bad movies with unhealthy snacks, she can spend hours touching herself if she wants to, she can do absolutely anything and everything she can't when Nicky's around. Or she just needs a break, which is understandable. While her sweet, nerdy boy is perfect most of the time, he's still a seven-year-old kid. He gets loud. He asks her to play with him. He makes her watch silly cartoons.</p><p>A little break once in a while is really nice. Especially after a Sunday. The weekend is the only time of the week where Agatha spends it with Nicky, the only time of the week when they can have fun all day. And by fun, it means playing video games, playing <em>Just Dance</em>, doing karaoke, sometimes going to the store. It's a very, very long day. But she isn't complaining. Agatha is glad to have this kind of complicity with her son. As a kid, she never got to do any of these, never got to play or be happy. So now that she's a mom, she's doing everything in her power to make Nicky happy, so he can have the childhood she never had. He deserves it. He really does.</p><p>With no surprise, a new message from the wrong number is there when she turns her phone on for the first time after falling asleep.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 9:07 AM</strong><br/>Good morning, stranger :)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:12 AM</strong><br/>Do you ever sleep? Or your secret is that you are a vampire?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:12 AM</strong><br/>Look who's finally awake :)</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:12 AM</strong><br/>It was only 6am here when I texted u</p><p>Six in the morning, what the heck? Seriously, does this woman ever sleep?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:13 AM</strong><br/>You never told me where 'here' is</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:13 AM</strong><br/>Los Angeles :)</p><p>The West Coast. All across the country. Fantastic.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:13 AM</strong><br/>Well, 6am is early for a Saturday</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:13 AM</strong><br/>I have to work</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:14 AM</strong><br/>On a weekend? Jeez, what kind of job are you doing? You never sleep, you can't talk about it</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:14 AM</strong><br/>It's not that I can't. I just don't feel like sharing too much right now</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:14 AM</strong><br/>I know. It's fine. How much sleep did you get?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:14 AM</strong><br/>Enough</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:15 AM</strong><br/>Always so mysterious...</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:15 AM</strong><br/>:) What about you? Did you get some rest?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:15 AM</strong><br/>Thankfully yes. I just woke up, I think I got like 12 hours of sleep</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:16 AM</strong><br/>I'm glad to hear that</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:16 AM</strong><br/>Honestly, if I didn't have to care for Nicky I would've just skipped dinner and slept. But, alas, I am a good mom. Thanks again for the recipe, you were a real life saver. I never thought cooking bananas could actually be good</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:18 AM</strong><br/>You're honestly so cool. And no problem, I'm glad I was able to help. This recipe is one of my favorite</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:18 AM</strong><br/>I'm not cool. I'm just doing my job as a mom. Which includes reading him the same book over and over again... I'm SO GLAD he told me the book has a sequel. I'm gonna order it so I can finally read him something else</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:19 AM</strong><br/>You are cool, stranger. And you're an amazing mom</p><p>The praise warms her heart. She knows she's a good mom—or at least she's trying to be one—but hearing it from someone else is actually so... different. In the right way. It helps her realize that yes, she's doing her best for her child. She's making him happy, giving him all her love, raising him to be a gentleman.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:20 AM</strong><br/>I try to be. He's a great kid, I don't know what I'd do without him</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:20 AM</strong><br/>But I swear if he makes me read that damn Christmas Witch book again...</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:20 AM</strong><br/>The Legend of the Christmas Witch??</p><p>The teacher raises an eyebrow at the new message. The book is quite famous in the parents' circle as it's a sweet Christmas story focused on old traditions, magic, and family, but how can this woman know about it? Agatha already knows that she doesn't have any children, as she mentioned it previously, so how does she know about this book? It's not the kind that adults read for fun (except if they have a crush on the author—is that the case here?)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:20 AM</strong><br/>Yes?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:20 AM</strong><br/>How do you know a book meant for kids under 10?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:21 AM</strong><br/>Had to read it to children before</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:21 AM</strong><br/>Are you a teacher?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:21 AM</strong><br/>Nope :) Did you like the book?</p><p>Did she like the book? She hates to admit it, but she did. It's well-written, it's a sweet story she enjoyed reading, way better than the other books she used to read to Nicky before bed. Some stupid ones about stupid characters and stories. But now, all those other books are forgotten, and the boy only ever asks for <em>The Legend of the Christmas Witch.</em> While Agatha found the book interesting, she doesn't exactly appreciate having to re-read it almost every single day.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:21 AM</strong><br/>Not that bad</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:22 AM</strong><br/>That's it? Not that bad? I found it cool and original</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:22 AM</strong><br/>I guess it is. But what kind of name is Kristtörn?? I had to google the pronunciation</p><p>And that's true. She'd bought the book a few weeks ago during one of their monthly bookstore shopping trips and ended up googling the character's name pronunciation while Nicky was in the shower, just so she wouldn't look ridiculous mispronouncing it during story time. She does admit it's a very unusual name, but it made sense. She remembers scrolling through a few websites about the name's etymology and realizing how perfectly it suited the main character. Its roots are Icelandic: <em>Kristtörn</em> means <em>holly</em>. Like a wreath of holly leaves, like the Christmas holly spirit; the choice wasn't random. The character of Kristtörn is tied to old Yule traditions and wild nature magic, so it fits the story's theme perfectly.</p><p>The author had done their research, and it shows. It's nice to see. Most authors, especially ones writing for kids, don't usually go out of their way to pick names with real meaning as they assume kids won't care (and most adults won't either). But this <em>Rio something</em> did, and it's fantastic. It makes sense. Though the name is very... different. Agatha has never heard it before—which is not surprising considering it's Icelandic—and she doesn't personally like it much. But the story and the etymology of the name are interesting, so it doesn't matter.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:22 AM</strong><br/>It's just pronounced as it's written...</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:23 AM</strong><br/>I didn't know that. But yeah, now he wants me to order the second book. I don't even know what it's called</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:23 AM</strong><br/>The Return of the Christmas Witch</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:23 AM</strong><br/>Ah, yes. How original</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:23 AM</strong><br/>Hey, don't be mean to the author. Kids love these books</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:23 AM</strong><br/>I never said the contrary</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:23 AM</strong><br/>By the way. I have a question</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:24 AM</strong><br/>Do tell</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:24 AM</strong><br/>What's your name?</p><p>She isn't expecting a response to this considering how private Wrong Number has been since they met. But hey, it's worth the try.</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:25 AM</strong><br/>Mysterious is our thing, isn't it?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:25 AM</strong><br/>This is just adding even more questions to my list...</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:25 AM</strong><br/>So you have a list about me? I'm flattered ;)</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:26 AM</strong><br/>You can call me Evil Hag, if you want</p><p>Agatha snorts at the nickname. What kind of name is that?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:26 AM</strong><br/>Seriously?</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:26 AM</strong><br/>Dead serious</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:26 AM</strong><br/>You're not evil, nor a hag</p><p><strong>Unknown Number 11:26 AM</strong><br/>You don't know me enough to tell, stranger ;)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:27 AM</strong><br/>Annoying Hag would fit you more, but whatever</p><p align="center">
<em>You renamed Unknown Number to Evil Hag</em>
</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:27 AM</strong><br/>I have the pleasure to inform you that you are no longer Unknown Number but Evil Hag</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:28 AM</strong><br/>How will I explain this if my friends ever see that name...</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:28 AM</strong><br/>Not my problem ;)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:28 AM</strong><br/>I understand now. You're indeed an evil hag</p><p>Setting her phone aside, she can't help but smile. Even though this all started as a wrong number, she still looks forward to <em>Evil Hag</em> texting her. She doesn't even know that mysterious woman, and yet... yet, she can't stop talking to her. She makes her smile. She gave her a recipe that Nicky loved. She's nice and, as much as she hates to admit it, funny. Agatha doesn't want to stop talking to her. Maybe they can be friends. Everyone has an online friend. Well, mostly teenagers or young adults, but still.</p><p>With a sigh, Agatha finally finds the courage to get up and head towards the bathroom. She's still in her work clothes, as she fell asleep immediately after collapsing on the bed yesterday, and she desperately needs a shower.</p><p>Her face in the mirror after she turns the lights on makes her jump.</p><p>Fuck, she looks like shit. She has dark circles under her eyes so big she looks like a Tim Burton character; her makeup is smudged all over her eyelids like she took part in a bar fight last night, and her lipstick's faded around her lips. Her hair... fuck, that's even worse than what she expected. Her hair's a mess, probably full of knots and so dry.</p><p>She has to admit that recently, with her job, Nicky, and the very little free time she has for herself, she hasn't taken care of herself in a while. She stopped using expensive hair creams that she has to leave on for a while before rinsing; she stopped slathering her face with moisturizer before bed, and it's been a long time since she's had a good night's sleep, causing dark circles to accumulate and make her look like a zombie. And then there's the rest. The part she always pretends not to see. The fine lines starting to form around her mouth and eyes, more visible when she's this tired. The faint creases between her brows, deepened from years of frowning—at papers, at students, at her own reflection. And just above her right temple, a single silver strand catches the light. Actually, no, two. Maybe three. Shit.</p><p>She leans in closer to the mirror, squinting at herself, and pushes her hair back behind her ears with both hands, trying to flatten it into something passable. She takes the time to look at her face, at every close detail of it. And fuck. There's no denying it, she looks older. Not <em>old</em> old, she's only thirty-seven, she knows that, but older than she felt five years ago. No wonder she's still single looking like that. She's never been the type to obsess over wrinkles or spend a fortune on creams that promise to erase time. But still. She notices. She sees it all.</p><p>And on mornings like this, when the exhaustion sticks to her skin and motherhood has left another invisible bruise on her soul, she feels it. The slow, relentless passing of time. She's growing older. Uglier. One day, she'll look like an old dried prune and she'll spend the rest of her life alone. With no partner, with no son, as Nicky will be grown and probably would prefer to spend time with his friends than his boring, old mom.</p><p>Agatha finally sighs and looks away from the mirror. She needs a shower.</p><p>The water takes a moment to heat up, so she lets it run as she undresses slowly, peeling off the work clothes she never meant to sleep in. She drops everything in the laundry basket without folding, without caring. And finally being free from her uncomfortable bra is so fucking good. When she turns to enter the shower, she catches herself in the mirror again, this time fully. And yeah. That's not much better.</p><p>There's a softness to her stomach now that never really went away after Nicky was born. The skin is stretched and loose in some places, marked by pale, silvery lines that no cream ever managed to erase. She runs a hand over them without thinking, then quickly pulls it away like she just touched a bruise. Again, Agatha doesn't mind it on other women. Stretch marks are pretty on them. But on her... they don't look pretty. She's maybe just too harsh on herself because that's what she's always known, and today is harder than the other days. Maybe it's just the exhaustion of the week. Maybe not.</p><p>Her thighs are touching, her hips are wide. Wider than before she gave birth to Nicky. Her chest lower; she could blame gravity, or time, or genetics. But mostly, she blames herself for not taking care of herself earlier. She only started using creams and all that after she met Jen. The teacher has a side hustle where she sells bio creams and lotions for the body, the hair, for age. She gave a few different ones to Agatha for free, and the woman had used them for a few weeks. Until her job as a history teacher and a single mother left her no more time for herself. So she just forgot about it, didn't care for her skin, didn't care for her hair. Weekdays were focused on her job, after work for cleaning the house and preparing dinner, and the weekends dedicated to Nicky. Not to herself. The rare times when she's home alone, she often uses that time to rest or for self-pleasure. But not for taking care of herself like she knows she should.</p><p>The steam finally starts to fill the room, fogging the edges of the mirror until her reflection blurs.</p><p>Good...</p><p>She finally steps into the shower and let the hot water hit her back first, rolling down her spine, easing the tension she didn't even realize had built up in her shoulders. It feels good. So, so good. She stays under the spray for longer than usual, letting her hair soak through until it hangs down her back, dark and tangled and wild.</p><p>With a sigh, she reaches for the expensive hair cream shoved in the back of the shelf—the olive oil one Jen gave her ages ago. It doesn't smell that good, but it's amazing for her hair, to make it all soft and light and hydrated. She scoops a generous amount into her palms and works it into her hair, strand by strand, finger by finger. She remembers the directions said to leave it on for ten minutes, but she gives it fifteen. Because fuck it, she deserves fifteen.</p><p>While the hair cream sits, she scrubs her body with her purple loofah that's on its last leg, tracing the curve of her belly that she hates so much, the underside of her arms, the soft parts she always tries to hide under her work clothes. She's not ashamed of it—all of that shows that she birthed a boy, a little human that she loves with all her heart. But it's just... she doesn't find herself pretty anymore. She never really did (her mother did a great job at making her feel ugly growing up, criticizing her strong nose, her hair, her body, her attitude), but now that she's aging, it's even worse. Who would want a thirty-seven-year-old single mother? No one. No wonder she can't find a girlfriend. She's old and ugly and boring.</p><p>Shaking the thought away, she finally rinses herself and the cream out of her hair. It feels softer already—less like straw, more like the healthy hair she used to have. Then, she grabs a towel and tries to smile. Today's the weekend, meaning the entire day will be dedicated to her lovely son and their weekly game night. Today is going to be a good, funny day. She can't let stupid thoughts ruin that.</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>When she's dried and dressed (in comfortable purple Juicy Couture pants and a white t-shirt from the same brand), she finally goes downstairs. As she expected, Nicky is sitting on the couch, still in his dinosaur pyjamas, watching cartoons. She's never worried about him—even at seven years old, he's already an independent boy, and he knows that if he needs anything, he can just wake up his mama.</p><p>Agatha smiles and walks toward him, then kisses the top of his head. "How did you sleep, sweetie?" she asks him.</p><p>Nicky's eyes don't leave the tv as he answers, "Good. You slept for a long time, mama."</p><p>"I know. I'm sorry, I was very tired."</p><p>"You don't have to be sorry. I'm a big boy, Ma, I can take care of myself!"</p><p>Her heart melts at this. "Have you had breakfast?"</p><p>He shakes his head. "I wasn't hungry when I woke up, but I ate some Froot Loops earlier."</p><p>"But are you hungry now? What do you want for lunch?"</p><p>"Huh-huh. Can I have pancakes? Please? With a looot of maple syrup. And sausages too."</p><p>Fuck. Pancakes are one of the things that she can't bake. The first ones always come out burnt or undercooked, and there are usually only two or three edible ones that she obviously leaves to Nicky.</p><p>"Pancakes?" she smiles. "Alright. Just wait here, okay? I'll be back soon."</p><p>
<em>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</em>
</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 12:32 AM</strong><br/>By any chance, do you have a good pancake recipe?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 12:32 AM</strong><br/>Maybe</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 12:33 AM</strong><br/>Please share it with me, it's a life or death situation</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 12:33 AM</strong><br/>Why? You're scared of your little gremlin?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 12:33 AM</strong><br/>No, I'm scared to be a bad mom</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 12:34 AM</strong><br/>Messing up breakfast won't make you a bad mom, you know?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 12:34 AM</strong><br/>Please, I need a good recipe. The one I have doesn't work, the pancakes are always either burnt or undercooked</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 12:35 AM</strong><br/>I'll send it to you but stop stressing out. Give me a minute</p><p>Thank God, that woman is a lifesaver. Agatha has tried all the recipes she could find on the internet—from cooking blogs to random Tiktoks (Jen introduced her to the app... sadly. At first, Agatha found it stupid, how teenagers followed 'trends' and danced weirdly, but the app itself isn't that bad. She can find many interesting things on it)—but none of them worked. Every single time, the pancakes came out either completely burnt, or raw in the middle, or stuck to the pan.</p><p>Evil Hag is clearly a good cook (maybe she's lying and it's actually her job?), and the banana recipe she gave her yesterday was delicious. Agatha had never thought of using fruit for dinner—not in that way, at least—and yet it ended up being one of the best things she's ever had, or even managed to cook herself. So yeah. She trusts the woman. She trusts her enough to believe her pancake recipe will save her lunch (or brunch? Whatever this late-morning snack is called). More importantly, from disappointing her son again.</p><p>A few moments later, she receives a new text from Evil Hag: a photo, a close-up shot of a notebook, open across two pages, the pancake recipe written out neatly by hand in black ink. But Agatha doesn't see the words at first, no. Because right in the center, holding the book open, is a hand.</p><p>And <em>fuck</em>. What the actual fuck?</p><p>Agatha can't help but stare. The fingers are long. Weirdly long. Not in a creepy, horror-movie Slender Man kind of way, but in a stupidly attractive kind of way. Her nails are short, clean, not polished, simply natural. Her skin is tanned, darker than Agatha's pale tone. The woman blinks, realizing she's still holding the phone in one hand and a half-empty mug of cold coffee in the other, standing there like an idiot in her kitchen with the fridge door still slightly open behind her. She zooms in. Not on the recipe, no, but on the hand. Because apparently, that's who she is now, a creep who's zooming in on fingers like they're porn.</p><p>And for a second—a long, dangerous second—her brain runs with it.</p><p>She imagines those long, pretty fingers playing with her hair while they're watching a movie on the couch. She imagines those soft fingers on her waist, caressing her sides while murmuring sweet nothings. Sliding up her thigh under her dress. Stroking down her stomach, making her feel loved and pretty. One of them lazily circling her nipple. Two of them slipping between her legs. She's even certain that they're long enough to reach her cervix—</p><p>Agatha chokes on nothing and physically jerks her head back like someone slapped her.</p><p>No. Absolutely not. Unacceptable. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is wrong with her?</p><p>This woman is a <em>stranger</em>. A stranger who sent her a freaking <em>pancake recipe</em>. A stranger she calls <em>Evil Hag</em> because she doesn't even know her real name. A stranger she has never even seen, whose hands have now hijacked her brain and turned her into a walking sex-starved succubus mess over nothing but a photo of a hand.</p><p>Fuck, she needs help. Or to get laid. Or both.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head hard to remove the unholy thoughts from her mind.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 12:39 AM</strong><br/>Here you go. The secret to not burn them is to not use butter. You can add some oil with paper towel so it doesn't stick to the pan, but no butter. And you have to flip them once you see the bubbles forming</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 12:40 AM</strong><br/>Thank you so much, you're a lifesaver</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 12:40 AM</strong><br/>Anytime ;) I have to leave for work now, so talk to you later?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 12:40 AM</strong><br/>Sure. Good luck with whatever mysterious work you're doing, stranger</p><p>The pancakes come out perfect. Delicious, not too sweet, and most importantly not burnt or undercooked. They're simply perfect. Agatha followed Evil Hag's instructions to the letter, from the handwritten recipe (she still can't get over how delicate her handwriting is, just like her long fingers) to the little tips she sent afterward by text.</p><p>This time, she used oil instead of butter—just like Evil Hag said—and it worked. All the recipes she tried from blogs or videos before never said not to use butter. So she always did, so they wouldn't stick. Turns out that's what made them stick. Crazy... But now, with a tiny bit of oil, the pancakes didn't stick to the pan. They didn't burn. They cooked evenly, golden and fluffy and warm. And most importantly, Nicky loved them. He ate three with maple syrup, then two small sausages and a slice of bacon.</p><p>"That was so good," Nicky says, smiling, his hair still wet from the shower he took while his mother was cooking, as he sits at the dining table with maple syrup all over his face. "How did you not burn them this time?"</p><p>"My... <em>friend</em> gave me a new recipe and a few tips."</p><p>"The same friend that gave you the banana recipe?"</p><p>She smiles. "Yes, that one."</p><p>"What friend is this, mama? Why don't I know her?"</p><p>Agatha shifts in her seat. What is she supposed to say? "She lives in Los Angeles, and we met recently. It's a long story."</p><p>"Oh!" Nicky's eyes gleam as he remembers something. "Speaking about stories, did you order my book?"</p><p>Ah, yes. The book. "The Return of the Christmas Witch?"</p><p>"Yes, that one!"</p><p>"Not yet. Sorry, sweetie, I slept a lot and then I immediately showered and prepared breakfast. I didn't have time to look it up, but I will do it later."</p><p>"Promise?" He holds up his pinky in the middle of the table.</p><p>Smiling, Agatha links their pinkies together. "Pinky promise, my little spoiled gremlin."</p><p>As promised, Agatha grabs her laptop as soon as lunch is over. She and Nicky are curled up together on the couch now; he's half-watching cartoons with syrup still crusted near the corner of his mouth, and she's scrolling through her tabs, fingers sticky from helping him with the maple bottle earlier. She should be cleaning up the kitchen, but today's the weekend and she deserves a long break. And she knows how excited Nicky is about this book, so she needs to order it now if she wants it to arrive soon.</p><p>She types the title into the search bar: <em>The Return of the Christmas Witch</em>. The page loads immediately. First result. She clicks on the link.</p><p>There it is.</p><p>The cover is an illustration of the white-haired main character Kristtörn standing next to Santa Claus behind the title written in a Nordic-looking font in a beige color. The background is blue with weird mushrooms, and at the bottom, there's a bubbling cauldron. On it, the name of the author: <em>Rio Vidal</em>, written in a green font, and right under, <em>illustrated by Lilia Calderu</em>, written in a light blue color.</p><p>The price is okay. Nineteen ninety-nine, free shipping. She finds it a bit expensive for a children's book, but every book is expensive these days. Curious, she reads the details.</p><p align="center">
<strong> <em>From The Witching Hour star Rio Vidal and creative partner Lilia Calderu comes the long lost tale of the Christmas Witch, Santa Claus's much misunderstood twin sister. The perfect gift for the holiday season and beyond!</em> </strong>
</p><p align="center">
<em>Gather 'round the fire to hear a Christmas legend that has never been told before... until now. Each year a mysterious figure sweeps into town, leaving behind strange gifts in the night. No, not Santa Claus, but his sister...</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>The Christmas Witch.</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>Her story begins many, many years ago when her brother was torn away from her as a child. Raised alone by a witch of the woods, Kristtörn's powers of magic grew, as did her temper. Determined to find her long lost twin, she set out on a perilous journey across oceans to find him. But what she found instead was a deep-seated fear of her powers and a confrontation that would leave the fate of Christmas hanging in the balance.</em>

<strong> <em>From award-winning producer and actress Rio Vidal and her creative partner and illustrator Lilia Calderu comes a holiday story unlike any told before. With all the richness of classic folklore, they've woven a tale of bravery, love and magic. Whatever you thought you knew about Christmas... think again.</em> </strong>
</p><p>Sounds good. Agatha clicks on <em>Add to Cart</em>, then proceeds to checkout.</p><p>Order confirmed. It should arrive on Wednesday, which is rather quick.</p><p>Satisfied, Agatha closes the tab, sets the laptop aside, and leans back into the couch. Nicky shifts closer to her without saying anything, tucking himself under her arm while he lets his head rest on her side. With a soft smile, Agatha brushes a hand through his hair, damp but already drying wild, enjoying the few moments of calm before the storm.</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>The two Harknesses spend the whole day at home, just the two of them. No errands, no cleaning, no adult responsibilities—just tv, games, and each other. That's usually how they spend their weekend, just the two of them. They start with cartoons, then move to their old karaoke mic set Agatha bought last year. It's cheap, the reverb is awful, and the green one always crackles, but it doesn't matter. Nicky begs to sing the Moana soundtrack, and Agatha, being the softie that she is (despite what her students thinks), ends up belting Disney songs until her throat hurts.</p><p>She hates to admit it as well, but she loves karaoke, even if it's Disney songs. She has a good voice, she can control it quite easily. It's one of her favorite activities to do; alone, with Nicky, or drunk at a bar with the girls singing her lungs out to <em>Don't Stop Believing.</em></p><p>They move on to board games in the afternoon, then dance-offs, then a movie. Nicky insists they watch <em>The Good Dinosaur</em> again, and Agatha has seen it so many times she could recite the lines by heart, but his smile makes it worth every second.</p><p>These are the kind of days she lives for. Just them. No rush, no obligations, just quality time with her son. And she's aware, maybe more than she wants to admit, that these days are numbered. Nicky is already seven. In a few years, he'll be more interested in his friends, in school, in whatever weird video games kids will be playing then. He won't want to spend his Saturdays watching cartoons with his mom, singing duets and cuddling on the couch. So she holds onto this. Tight. She already doesn't know what she's gonna do when that day happens.</p><p>Later, around six, they head over to Wanda's place for their usual Saturday game night.</p><p>Wanda's already walking around the living room, balancing snack bowls and wine glasses while the twins argue over which game to play first. Vision hovers nearby, trying (and failing) to make sure they don't make a mess. But it's a bit too late for that. There are some open game boxes on the floor with papers scattered around, and the boys are arguing. Billy wants to play <em>Uno</em>, but Tommy wants to play <em>Monopoly</em>, while Nicky prefers <em>Clue</em>. Vision tries to tell them that they'll play each game as the night is still young, but they don't seem to listen. Wanda is way better at this, but she's currently busy going through the cabinets to find snacks.</p><p>Agatha sits on the couch cross-legged while she sips on a glass of red wine. She loves these nights, even if the volume level sometimes makes her ears ring. This is supposed to be relaxing, but well.</p><p>"Should we order pizza?" Wanda asks, putting different snacks on the coffee table in front of Agatha. There's a mix of chips, cured meats, sliced cheese, some nuts tossed in a little bowl. Enough to eat while they relax in the living room.</p><p>"If you want," Agatha answers, shrugging. "I'm sure the twins and Nicky will be happy. I'm not that hungry, but we can ask for later delivery."</p><p>"Exactly what I was thinking." Wanda plops down beside her, letting out a long, exhausted sigh after giving a glance to her sons. "Finally, some rest."</p><p>"Long day?"</p><p>"You can't imagine. Vision had a work thing at the office, so I had the twins all day. They're little demons when they're together. Especially Tommy."</p><p>Agatha smirks into her glass. "You know you can dump them at mine if you need a break. Nicky would be overjoyed. And unlike you, I can be authoritative. How do you think I got the name Snape? I earned it, and I'm proud of it."</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>"Absolutely."</p><p>The redhead lets out a pleased sigh. "Thank you so much, Agatha, you're a lifesaver. Okay, I'm gonna go search for the pamphlet of that pizzeria so I can call and order. Be right back."</p><p>As Wanda gets up from the couch after taking a sip of wine, Agatha's phone buzzes. A smile immediately spreads on her face.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 7:19 PM</strong><br/>Hey there :)</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 7:19 PM</strong><br/>Sorry, been busy</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:20 PM</strong><br/>It's fine. Been busy too</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 7:20 PM</strong><br/>Nicky?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:20 PM</strong><br/>Yup. He made me sang Disney songs...</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 7:21 PM</strong><br/>Ouch, how torturous</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:21 PM</strong><br/>Are you laughing at me?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 7:21 PM</strong><br/>Me? No, that would be evil ;)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 7:22 PM</strong><br/>I hate you</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 7:22 PM</strong><br/>Sure you do :)</p><p>Agatha snorts quietly to herself, then Wanda returns with her phone against her ear. "Hey, Ags, what kind of pizza do you want?"</p><p>"Oh, uhm... Margherita? Nicky loves it. We'll share."</p><p>"Noted. Kids!" The redhead then raises her voice so she can be heard through the arguing. "What do you want?"</p><p>"Pepperoni!" Billy shouts.</p><p>"Hawaiian!" Tommy yells over him.</p><p>Agatha pinches the bridge of her nose. It sounds awful to say this, but she never really liked Tommy. He's such a complicated kid, always trying to argue over something, always causing chaos. Unlike his twin brother Billy, who's a real sweetheart. She's not even surprised that this demon wants a pizza with fucking pineapple slices on it. It's a real insult to Italy. "Oh God. Hawaiian? Pineapple on pizza should be illegal."</p><p>Wanda laughs. "Tommy likes it. I don't, and I agree with you. Atrocious."</p><p>They settle the order. Pizza's scheduled for delivery in an hour and a half, which leaves them enough time to eat the snacks and start a game. They choose <em>Clue</em>, as it's way quicker than Monopoly, and it's also Agatha's favorite. Solving crimes? That's her thing. She always wins. After all this time, she knows the trick. She has a technique to remember who has what card, and it always works.</p><p>They play a few games of Clue (because Wanda can't stand losing) while eating the pizza. And then, during the game, Agatha's phone buzzes again. It's Vision's turn to play, and she already knows all his cards, so she can take a minute to check the message. She doesn't need to be a medium to guess who this is from.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 9:43 PM</strong><br/>Still okay? :)</p><p>She hides a smile while typing back.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:43 PM</strong><br/>Are you worrying about me?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 9:44 PM</strong><br/>Me? Nah. It's just that you haven't answered for a while</p><p>She was worried. Oh my God. That's so... sweet. Strange?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:44 PM</strong><br/>So you were indeed worried...</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 9:44 PM</strong><br/>Meanie</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:45 PM</strong><br/>You're the one to talk, evil hag</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>She lifts her head, startled. "Hm?"</p><p>"It's your turn," Wanda says, clearly amused at something her husband said.</p><p>"Oh. Right." She sets her phone aside and rolls the dice. She's this close to winning once again... she just needs the room to solve the crime. But alas, the room is always the hardest thing to find. She knows that Wanda has the kitchen and the study; Vision only has the hall; Nicky has the ballroom, Tommy doesn't have any, Billy has the lounge, and Agatha has the conservatory and the library. Vision can't have any, as she knows all his cards, and she only misses one to find the right one.</p><p><em>Four.</em> She can't go anywhere, so she moves her pawn—the purple one, obviously—towards one of the rooms she doesn't have.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 9:46 PM</strong><br/>:) So, what are you doing?</p><p>Agatha glances around to make sure no one's watching too closely, and then types back.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:51 PM</strong><br/>Playing Clue. Every Saturday, Nicky and I go to my friend and neighbor's house for our weekly game night</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 9:51 PM</strong><br/>Ohhh, so that's why you're slow at answering :) sorry, I won't bother you anymore. Enjoy your night, Professor Plum</p><p>Agatha huffs a laugh.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:52 PM</strong><br/>Rude. I'm not that old, thank you very much</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 9:52 PM</strong><br/>You're a teacher, though, and I'm sure you have glasses ;)</p><p>She frowns at the screen. She does, indeed, have glasses. She only wears them to read, though.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:52 PM</strong><br/>Are you spying on me, Mrs Peacock?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 9:53 PM</strong><br/>Heh, rude too. I'm not a mrs and I'd immediately change my name if I had 'cock' in it lol</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:53 PM</strong><br/>Gross</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 9:53 PM</strong><br/>Cocks are gross</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:54 PM</strong><br/>Are you always this crude?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 9:54 PM</strong><br/>It wasn't crude. Just the truth. Don't you agree?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 9:54 PM</strong><br/>I do agree</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 9:55 PM</strong><br/>Okay, I'll leave you now, Professor Plum. Go arrest the suspect ;)</p><p>"Agatha. Your turn."</p><p>She blinks up. Already? "Right... sorry." She puts the phone down again and rolls.</p><p>Wanda leans in. "So... who's the mystery texter?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"You've been glued to your phone all night. Who is it?"</p><p>"Oh. Uh..." Agatha clears her throat. Right. She hasn't told her best friend about that mysterious stranger yet. With work and all, she didn't have time to talk to her. "It's no one. A girl texted the wrong number by accident."</p><p>Vision raises an eyebrow. "Yet you've been talking to her all evening."</p><p>"Uh... well... since yesterday, actually. I mean, Thursday night."</p><p>Wanda's eyes widen. "Wait, wait, wait! You've been texting a wrong number for three days!? You can't be serious right now."</p><p>"Dead serious."</p><p>"Okay, now I need details. Spill."</p><p>"There's nothing to spill," Agatha insists, though her face is starting to betray her. "She accidentally sent me a tattoo pic—"</p><p>She gasps. "Wait, what kind of tattoo?"</p><p>"Relax, Maximoff. It was just an under-boob tattoo."</p><p>Wanda laughs so hard she nearly spills her wine on the game board. She's already tipsy, which is not surprising considering it's her third glass. "Agatha Harkness! Are you sexting a stranger!?"</p><p>Oh my God. Is she crazy? Agatha hisses, glancing toward the kids to make sure they're not paying attention. They're busy chatting, thankfully, and she doubts they heard that. "I am not sexting!" she whisper-yells. "She sent it by accident. Said it was for a friend. We started talking after that and... I don't know. It's fun. She's funny."</p><p>Wanda's expression softens. It's been a while since she saw her best friend so... happy. "Fun how?"</p><p>Agatha hesitates. She takes another sip of wine—her second glass of the evening. The thing with her is that when she drinks, her filter completely washes off and she doesn't hesitate to say what she's thinking. "I don't know, she's... easy to talk to. Witty, clever. She makes me laugh. She shares recipes with me. Yesterday, I had no idea what to make for dinner and she gave me a great recipe from her culture. It was delicious, Nicky loved it. Even if she's a wrong number, I enjoy talking to her."</p><p>The redhead's smile turns into a knowing smirk. Oh, she can't fool her. They've been friends for a while, she knows when Agatha has a crush. "Sounds like you're into her, huh."</p><p>"Don't start. I don't even know her name or what she looks like. And she's twenty-six, Wanda. Twenty-six! That's twelve years younger. She's a kid! And I've known her for, like, two days."</p><p>"Twelve isn't that bad at all. She's an adult. Sure, she's younger than you, but twenty-six is still an adult. Also, two days is like two weeks in lesbian time. And, wait, what do you mean you don't know her name?"</p><p>"She won't tell me. She likes to keep things mysterious."</p><p>Wanda tilts her head. "Weird. But kinda hot."</p><p>Agatha groans. "Don't make this a thing."</p><p>"So what are you going to do?"</p><p>"I don't know. Keep talking to her? She's nice. Long-distance friends are a thing, you know?"</p><p>Before Wanda can tease her further, Nicky tells Agatha it's her time to play once again.</p><p>The teacher rolls the dice. <em>Six.</em> Perfect. She goes to the room she wanted to go in—the dining room. "Miss Scarlet with a revolver in the dining room."</p><p>Billy shows her a card. The room one. Bingo.</p><p>With a smirk, she rolls the dice again since she did a six. <em>Five.</em> It's enough to go to the middle. She moves her pawn there and says, "Miss Scarlet with the revolver in the billiard room."</p><p>Vision checks the result, and damn right. She won. Again.</p><p>"No!" Wanda groans, slamming her cards on the table. "You're cheating."</p><p>"I'm not. You're just bad at it, honey."</p><p>She scoffs. "This conversation isn't over. I need all the details of your mysterious texter, huh."</p><p>They're interrupted by Nicky. "Can we play Monopoly now?"</p>

<p>The package arrives on Wednesday afternoon, when the sky outside is covered in gray clouds and the temperatures are still low for the season. Agatha didn't expect them to be high—it's still the end of February—but she didn't expect them to still be <em>this</em> low. It's been raining for the past few days, and today won't be an exception. The air outside has that strange earthy, fresh smell that's always there right before it rains.</p><p>She hears the doorbell ring while she's still in the middle of slicing carrots, the knife halfway through the orange root when the sound pulls her from her task. Her fingers pause instinctively, her head jerking up in the direction of the door. She took the opportunity that Nicky is still at school (he doesn't have school on Wednesday afternoons, only the mornings, but he almost always insists on staying with the other kids at the school's daycare to play with his friends) to try to cook something new.</p><p>It's another recipe that Evil Hag sent her from her notebook, and to Agatha's dismay, this time she didn't have her pretty hand in the middle of the pages to keep them open. Well, it's not really a full recipe as it's quite simple, but the teacher never thought of eating that for a snack. It's sliced carrots with a special homemade sauce. She's going to put half in vinegar to do some pickles and keep the other half to eat with the sauce. Hopefully, Nicky will like it—the kid needs some healthy things too.</p><p>As soon as she hears the doorbell, she places the knife next to the cutting board and completely abandons what she was doing. Her hands are slightly wet from rinsing the carrots, so she wipes them on her jeans absentmindedly before stepping out of the kitchen.</p><p>The package is there, just on time, waiting for her on the floor in front of the door. It's not big, just the size of a book, and meticulously protected by a carton.</p><p>With her long and busy days at work, she forgot it was supposed to arrive today. She actually didn't even think it would arrive on time. But it did, and fuck, she's excited, especially to see how happy Nicky will be to finally be able to read the continuation of his favorite story.</p><p>She quickly picks it up before the rain starts and goes back inside.</p><p>Oh, Nicky will be over the moon when he gets back from school. He's been waiting for the book since Agatha ordered it. He talked about it every day since Saturday, asked her if she checked the mailbox even when she told him it was too early.</p><p>She sits on the couch and takes some time to open it. No rush. She grabs a pair of scissors and carefully slices the tape along the top edge of the carton, careful not to cut a part of the cover or the pages. Inside, cushioned between two sheets of folded brown paper, is the book. <em>The Return of the Christmas Witch</em>. The author could've chosen a better title... but well. The book is exactly like on the website, with a pretty cover with colors brighter than on the photo. There are fifty-six pages, just like the first one. All good.</p><p>She flips through the first few pages slowly, though she makes sure not to read to avoid spoilers.</p><p>Yes, she's a thirty-seven-year-old woman, and yes, she actually enjoys the book. There's no maximum age limit to like a story, after all. The illustrations are pretty, just like in the previous book. That Lilia Calderu woman did a great job at drawing Kristtörn, the other characters and all the pretty landscapes. Everything is so magical—Nicky will love it. It's definitely worth the price for such a great story and quality.</p><p>Agatha sets the book down on her lap and stares at the cover again. She has to admit that she prefers this one to the one from the first book. There are more magical elements, with the bubbling cauldron at the bottom and the weird blue glowing mushrooms a bit everywhere.</p><p>Whoever that Rio Vidal author is, she has a great imagination.</p><p>With a small grin tugging at the corner of her lips, Agatha picks up her phone and quickly texts Wanda to tell her that the book finally arrived. She actually lent the first one to the twins; even if they're two years older than Nicky, they might enjoy the story too. At least Billy, who likes to read unlike his brother. And when she opens the message app, she isn't surprised to see new texts from Evil Hag. They haven't stopped texting since Saturday, talking about everything and anything. She enjoys her company quite a lot.</p><p>She quickly texts Wanda, then hurries to open the stranger's text.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 2:50 PM</strong><br/>Hey there, stranger :) How are you today? Sorry I couldn't text earlier, I've been kinda busy at work. But now I'm on lunch break so if you wanna talk... I'm free</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 2:53 PM</strong><br/>Sorry if I'm bothering you, you must be at work. I forgot about our time difference. By the way, you never told me where you live</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 2:57 PM</strong><br/>Hey there</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 2:57 PM</strong><br/>I only work in the morning on Wednesdays so I'm free. I'm at home right now. And I'm from New Jersey :)</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 2:57 PM</strong><br/>You're here! :) Ohh, New Jersey? That's nice</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 2:58 PM</strong><br/>I guess it is. By the way, I finally received the book. The one I told you about last time, The Christmas Witch</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 2:58 PM</strong><br/>Ohhh, that's great! Do you like it?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 2:58 PM</strong><br/>I like the cover and the illustrations. I haven't read it yet, it will be Nicky's bedtime story tonight. But I have to admit that I did enjoy the first book. Way better than the other ones I had to read for my son</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 2:58 PM</strong><br/>Glad to hear that :)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 2:59 PM</strong><br/>How's your mysterious work going?</p><p align="left"><strong>Evil Hag 2:59 PM</strong><br/>Good. I love my job so I'm not complaining, even though some days can get kinda intense. Wbu? Did any student bother you today?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 2:59 PM</strong><br/>As always. But many students skip on Wednesdays, so the most bothering ones were absent. I'm actually glad they skip so I can have a break</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 2:59 PM</strong><br/>Hahaha that reminds me of myself... used to skip school a lot too :3</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 2:59 PM</strong><br/>Such a bad girl</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:00 PM</strong><br/>What can I say? School was so boring. And people bullied me. Don't tell me you've never skipped school?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:00 PM</strong><br/>You never met my mother. I don't know what would've happened if I skipped</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:00 PM</strong><br/>Shit, I'm sorry :( didn't wanna make u remember bad stuff</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:00 PM</strong><br/>Don't worry about it. My dear mother is currently somewhere in the Bahamas or wherever tropical with her rich old husband living her best life far away from me and Nicky</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:01 PM</strong><br/>Old husband?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:01 PM</strong><br/>Yeah. I'm one hundred percent sure she doesn't like him. He's old and ugly. Like close to death old. She's just waiting for him to kick the bucket so she can inherit his money. As long as she stays away from my family, I could care less about her life</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:01 PM</strong><br/>I'm sorry</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:02 PM</strong><br/>Don't be. She's a bitch and I'm way better without her. It's just me and Nicky and we're very much happy together</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:02 PM</strong><br/>I'm glad you feel that way. Is Nicky with you right now?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:02 PM</strong><br/>No, he's still in school. He doesn't have class on Wednesday afternoons but he always insists on staying at the school's daycare so he can play games with his friends. I'm actually glad, it's nice to have a break sometimes. I love him to death but he's still a 7yo kid, he can get annoying</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:03 PM</strong><br/>I'm sure he's a smarty</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:03 PM</strong><br/>He is. He's a real dino nerd</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:03 PM</strong><br/>No way! I love dinosaurs too!! What's his favorite??</p><p>Seriously? Out of all the women she could've talked to, she's talking to a dino nerd. As if she isn't talking about dinosaurs enough with Nicky.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:03 PM</strong><br/>Oh my god, not you too... His favorite is the spinosaur. What's yours?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:03 PM</strong><br/>I'm going to sound clichée but I love diplodocus and parasaurolophus</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:03 PM</strong><br/>It's not that cliché. I thought you were gonna say a t-rex</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:03 PM</strong><br/>Nahhh, too mean. I love herbivorous dinosaurs. Or the fish eating ones. But not the carnivorous ones</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:04 PM</strong><br/>Softie</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:04 PM</strong><br/>Oh fuck off &lt;3</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:04 PM</strong><br/>A heart? My my, how lucky am I</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:04 PM</strong><br/>:) What's your favorite dinosaur?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:04 PM</strong><br/>You're asking me as if I know their names. Because my son loves them doesn't mean I do</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:04 PM</strong><br/>Aw, you're breaking my heart :( Do you like plants?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:04 PM</strong><br/>Just azaleas. You?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:04 PM</strong><br/>I LOVE plants. Any kind</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:04 PM</strong><br/>Is your mysterious job a florist?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:04 PM</strong><br/>Nope :)</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:05 PM</strong><br/>Didn't know we were playing the 20 questions game btw</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:05 PM</strong><br/>But if you do want to, we can. I'm bored</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:05 PM</strong><br/>Oh</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:05 PM</strong><br/>We don't have to if you don't want to</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:05 PM</strong><br/>No no I do. It's just that I thought you wanted to stay mysterious?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:06 PM</strong><br/>I will. No personal questions. Do you wanna play?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:06 PM</strong><br/>I do. I'll start. What's your favorite book?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:06 PM</strong><br/>Shit, I'm gonna be clichée again... I don't have much time to read but my current favorite is The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. I must be a masochist lol. What's yours?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:06 PM</strong><br/>Never heard of. Mine's Crime and Punishment. Classic</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:06 PM</strong><br/>Well it's the story of a bisexual actress in the 60s... it's amazing. And sad. And gay</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:06 PM</strong><br/>Sounds nice. My turn. What's your hair color?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:07 PM</strong><br/>Curious, are you? ;) I'm a brunette. You?</p><p>A brunette. Agatha doesn't particularly have a type (any woman interested in her who get along with Nicky is her type, no matter her hair color) but brunettes are hot.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:07 PM</strong><br/>Me too</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:07 PM</strong><br/>So hot. Eye color?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:07 PM</strong><br/>Blue. But I have central heterochromia so like half my eyes are green. You?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:07 PM</strong><br/>Even hotter. Mine's hazel. Pretty boring compared to yours</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:07 PM</strong><br/>Don't say that. Brunettes with brown eyes are hot</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:07 PM</strong><br/>Ouhhh what I'm hearing is that I'm hot? ;)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:07 PM</strong><br/>How would I know?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:07 PM</strong><br/>You know ;) Your turn</p><p>She lets out a small chuckle at this, remembering the tattoo photo. She actually saved it in her gallery... by accident. It's also <em>totally</em> accidental that she sometimes look at it before sleeping like a horny teenager.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:07 PM</strong><br/>Favorite movie?</p><p>While she waits for a response, the teacher returns to the kitchen to her abandoned pieces of carrots on the cutting board. As planned, she puts half in a clean jar and the other half in the fridge. She then boils a mix of water and vinegar for the jar.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:07 PM</strong><br/>Ohh hard one. I don't know. I love a lot. But... Mamma Mia's my comfort movie. Wbu?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:10 PM</strong><br/>The Silence of the Lambs</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:10 PM</strong><br/>Woah. Didn't expect it. It's an amazing movie tho. Okay, my turn. Uhhh your favorite animal?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:10 PM</strong><br/>I'm not a big animal girl. But I'd say rabbits. It's Nicky's favorite. You?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:10 PM</strong><br/>Don't know if it counts but I have a tarantula :)</p><p>She makes a face. Agatha hates spiders, or any kind of insect or thing with more than four paws.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:10 PM</strong><br/>Absolutely disgusting. Favorite food?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:10 PM</strong><br/>Don't be mean to my baby :( she's an amazing girl okay??</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:11 PM</strong><br/>I love anything Puerto Rican or Italian. You?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:11 PM</strong><br/>Not sure. I love everything</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:11 PM</strong><br/>My tuuuurn. Fav country?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:12 PM</strong><br/>Probably Italy or France. Anywhere in Europe. Yours?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:12 PM</strong><br/>Italy as well ;) Especially Sicily. Taormina is one of my favorite places in the world with San Juan</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:12 PM</strong><br/>You talk about Puerto Rico a lot. Are you Puerto Rican?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:12 PM</strong><br/>From my father's side, yes</p><p>Ah. This explains the amazing Latin American recipes she shared since they met. So this stranger is Latina... hot. This also explains the pretty color of her skin.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:13 PM</strong><br/>It's beautiful. I've never been but I'd love to</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:13 PM</strong><br/>Okay, my turn now. What's your favorite season?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:13 PM</strong><br/>Really hard... I love spring because all the pretty flowers bloom, but I also love autumn for Halloween and the whole spooky vibe</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:13 PM</strong><br/>I get that. Mine's probably autumn. I hate the cold but I also hate when it's too warm. Autumns are perfect and I love going trick-or-treating with Nicky</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:13 PM</strong><br/>Cute :) Fav singer or band? Mine's Megadeth and Bon Jovi</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:13 PM</strong><br/>Metal and rock? Didn't expect it. I don't really know, I love a lot of things, mainly Fleetwood Mac</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:13 PM</strong><br/>Ohh, Stevie Nicks. I love her, she's amazing</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:14 PM</strong><br/>She is. What's your favorite color?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:14 PM</strong><br/>Guess ;)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:14 PM</strong><br/>Easy. Green</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:14 PM</strong><br/>Damn, are you a witch?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:15 PM</strong><br/>Don't need to be a witch to guess considering you love plants and dinosaurs. Mine's purple, by the way</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:15 PM</strong><br/>Cute. Hmm lemme think...</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:15 PM</strong><br/>First date? What would you want it to be?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:15 PM</strong><br/>I haven't been on a date in ages, I don't know</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:15 PM</strong><br/>Come onnn what would you like?</p><p>Tricky question. Her last date, ages ago, was with a woman who took her to a fancy restaurant. The kind that has a live piano player, where you can't enter unless you're wearing a proper outfit, and where everything is so... different. She remembers that while they were talking, a waiter came to sweep up the crumbs on the table with a kind of table brush. Like, what the actual fuck? She hated it. Not her vibe, and her date was boring. Only talked about herself, didn't show any interest in Agatha. Never again.</p><p>Her idea of a perfect date would be something simpler and more intimate. Not a room full of rich people. Maybe a simple movie marathon at home with supermarket popcorn, or a cute picnic in the middle of a flower field. But no restaurant. Especially not the fancy kind.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:17 PM</strong><br/>Something private. No fancy dinner or anything like that. Maybe a cute picnic date?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:17 PM</strong><br/>Same, honestly. Nothing fancy, I hate that. My perfect date would be in a museum, then a picnic near a river. Something calm and sweet and intimate</p><p>Nice to know they're on the same page. Not like they're ever going to go on a date, anyway... that stranger lives all the way across the country, and, well, she's a stranger. Even if they've been talking non-stop for six days straight.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:17 PM</strong><br/>Should've expected the museum one. You're such a nerd</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:17 PM</strong><br/>Yes ma'am :3</p><p>The teacher has to close her eyes for a second and take a deep breath at this. Praises are her soft spot.</p><p>Noticing that the mix of water and vinegar is boiling in the saucepan, she turns the heat off and carefully pours the liquid into the jar of sliced carrots. That's what the recipe said, to make pickles with other vegetables. Then she closes the lid and lets it rest on the side.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:21 PM</strong><br/>Okay, my turn. What's your dream job?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:21 PM</strong><br/>Oh, deep. I love my current one but it gets overwhelming often... I'd love to open a small greenhouse café. You?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:21 PM</strong><br/>Not a clue. Maybe open a bookstore? Being my own boss sounds amazing</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:21 PM</strong><br/>Omg yes absolutely</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:21 PM</strong><br/>Okay, my turn</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:22 PM</strong><br/>Top or bottom?</p><p>Oh. My. God. She didn't expect that. Not at all. She lets out a surprised gasp and can't help the blush growing on her cheeks.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:22 PM</strong><br/>JUST KIDDING</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:22 PM</strong><br/>Curious little thing, aren't you?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:22 PM</strong><br/>But if you really wanna know, I'm not sure myself</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:22 PM</strong><br/>How are you not sure?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:23 PM</strong><br/>It's been a while since I had a real relationship. The past few years have been one-night stands where I did everything because those chicks couldn't tell what I liked</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:23 PM</strong><br/>Oh</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:23 PM</strong><br/>Fuck, that sucks :(</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:23 PM</strong><br/>Yeah</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:23 PM</strong><br/>You?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:23 PM</strong><br/>I'm a switch. I don't really have a preference, I just adapt to what my partner likes</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:24 PM</strong><br/>That's sweet</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:24 PM</strong><br/>Shit, I'd love to talk to you more but igtg</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:24 PM</strong><br/>Already?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:25 PM</strong><br/>Lunch break's over :(</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:25 PM</strong><br/>Oh</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 3:25 PM</strong><br/>Well, talk to you later?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 3:25 PM</strong><br/>Ofc :)</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>At the end of the day, Agatha is standing outside Nicky's elementary school with a purple umbrella protecting her from the rain and the wind messing with her hair. She has some strands in her mouth, some in her eyes. It's even worse than when she left the house. The teacher does enjoy the rain... when she's not the one under it.</p><p>As soon as Nicky sees her in the courtyard, he runs toward her. His dinosaur backpack bounces on his back and his curls are damp from the rain, as his green coat doesn't have a hood and he didn't have an umbrella. They were in a rush this morning and Agatha forgot to give him one. Her fault. She just hopes he won't get sick; she'd feel so guilty if he did. His cheeks are flushed from the cold, a bit red, but he doesn't seem to care. Agatha crouches a little when she sees him running toward her and she opens her arms, and he crashes into her with full force, hugging her waist tightly like he hasn't seen her in weeks, even though it's only been a few hours. But hey, he's a clingy boy, and his mama doesn't mind in the slightest.</p><p>"Hey, sweetie," she says with a smile, kissing the top of his head and hugging him with one arm while the other holds the umbrella. "Come on, let's get out of the rain."</p><p>They walk back to the car, and on the way home, Nicky talks non-stop about the daycare—what he ate at lunch today, what he drew, what game he played with his friends. Agatha listens and gives him a few hums to inform him that she's still listening, and when they're a few minutes away from the house, she finally speaks.</p><p>"I have a surprise for you."</p><p>She looks in the rear-view mirror to see his reaction to this. He raises an eyebrow, curious. "A surprise? What is it?"</p><p>"You'll see when we get home. It's something you wanted for a while."</p><p>His eyes sparkle. "A rabbit?"</p><p>Ah, yes, the rabbit. He's been asking for one—a real one, not a plush one—for months. But Agatha said no. And it broke her heart because she really hates saying no to her son, but a pet is not a toy. It demands time and patience and money. She only has one, the money part. Being a teacher makes a nice salary. But with this job, she also doesn't have much time, and she doesn't see the point of having a pet if she or Nicky are never there to take care of it.</p><p>"No, still not a rabbit," she rolls her eyes with a small smile. "It's not alive."</p><p>"Oh." His voice drops, sounding disappointed, and Agatha's heart breaks.</p><p>"We already talked about this, honey. A rabbit is not a toy, it's a living soul. It needs attention, time, patience. I know how much you want one, but right now we can't. I don't see the point of having a pet if you're gone all day. You understand, right? You wouldn't want it to be all sad and lonely at home when you and I are at school?"</p><p>"Oh... right. I don't want it to be sad."</p><p>When they arrive home, they both remove their soaked shoes and leave them at the door. Then they hang their coats, and Agatha points toward the living room. "Your surprise is on the couch."</p><p>Nicky doesn't waste any time and runs into the living room. As soon as he sees the book, his eyes widen and a smile spreads across his face. "It arrived! Mama, look how pretty the cover is! Can we read it now?"</p><p>"Not now. You still haven't had dinner. And I made you something for a snack. Come see."</p><p>He follows her into the kitchen with the book clutched to his chest like a stuffed animal. She opens the fridge, takes out the small glass jar and sets it on the table. Nicky watches with curiosity as she twists off the lid.</p><p>"They're pickled carrots," she explains. "I tried one earlier, they're really good and homemade. There's also a few sticks to eat with the sauce I made."</p><p>Nicky makes a weird face at it. "Since when do we eat healthy stuff?"</p><p>"Since you eat way too much chemical stuff. Now please, try one. If you don't like it, you don't have to eat it. But you'll never know if you don't try."</p><p>Agatha isn't the kind of mean mom who forces her kid to eat things he doesn't like. She can't force him to like something, everyone has different tastes. But she always encourages him to at least try it. If he likes it, that's great. If he doesn't, then it's fine too, she'll know not to cook it again.</p><p>With a small sigh, Nicky sits down on a stool, poses his book on the counter and grab one of the carrot sticks from the jar. He dips it generously in the creamy sauce Agatha took out from the fridge, and bites down. The bone-cracking sound break the silence of the house. "It's... sour."</p><p>"It's like pickles but with carrots. Do you like it?"</p><p>He waits a few seconds, takes another bite and chews, as if he's focusing on the taste to know if he likes it or not. "It's not too bad. You made this?"</p><p>She rolls her eyes. At this point, everyone knows she can't cook or bake, even her lovely son. "I did. My friend gave me the recipe. Y'know, the one who gave me... well, all the other recipes of the good things I've made recently."</p><p>"Your friend from Los Angeles?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>Agatha laughs under her breath and sits next to him, watching him eat more of them. He doesn't even need to be convinced, he just keeps going. It makes her feel weirdly proud. Nicky is not a complicated child, but like many kids, he isn't the biggest fan of vegetables, and it's sometimes hard to get him to eat some. She'll have to thank Evil Hag later, once again.</p><p>Dinner goes by quietly. She reheats leftovers from yesterday—some pasta, grilled vegetables, a bit of chicken from the stranger's recipe again—and Nicky eats everything without complaining. As soon as he's done, he runs to the bathroom to brush his teeth before she can even remind him. And she knows why: he's excited to finally read the book. She made him wait until bedtime, because that's their ritual, and he's been excited all evening.</p><p>Later, in bed, he crawls under the covers in his dinosaur pajamas and settles against her side with the book in his hands. Agatha adjusts the pillows behind her back, stretches her legs, and pulls the blanket higher up around them both. Then she takes the book from him, opens it slowly, and starts reading aloud.</p><p>"The Christmas Witch was dreaming. For hundreds of years, buried deep in the ice, she had slept while the world changed around her, dreams swirling through her head like snowflakes. In them, she saw those she had known—Lutzelfrau, Elsmere, Malachi. The animals of the wood, the people in the small towns she'd visited."</p><p>Halfway through the book, Agatha glances down and realizes Nicky's eyes are closed. His head is resting against her arm, his breath slow and even. He fell asleep.</p><p>Smiling, she folds the corner of the page and closes the book. She slides it onto the nightstand, then carefully shifts out from under Nicky, adjusting the blankets so he won't get cold. Thankfully, he doesn't stir.</p><p>She then leans over and kisses his forehead. "Goodnight, baby," she whispers.</p><p>And then she steps out of the room, gently closing the door behind her while leaving it ajar, just the way he likes.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>"Come on, Agatha, you have to come!"</p><p>Agatha sighs at her best friend's insistence, leaning back against the kitchen counter with her phone pressed to her ear. She just finished doing some cleaning, finally taking advantage of the fact that Nicky isn't around to get it done without him constantly interrupting to ask her to play with him. He left this morning for the neighbors' house with a little backpack on his shoulders and his favorite bunny plushie squished under one arm, practically bouncing from excitement as he talked about all the things he was gonna do with the Maximoff twins.</p><p>It's not unusual for him to have sleepovers with them. Agatha is sure she'd be more protective if it was at any other friend's house, but she's not worried. She knows he's in good hands, and if for some reason he has a problem, she's just a few steps away. And honestly, she's not complaining. She loves her son more than anything in the world, obviously, but being alone—even for just twenty-four hours—is something she absolutely needs from time to time to not go completely insane. Being a single mom of a seven-year-old boy is not always easy.</p><p>Sleepover at the Maximoffs' means Agatha has the house to herself. It's been a while. This morning, she did some cleaning—tidied Nicky's room, cleaned her own, swept under the couch and other furniture that she usually neglects. She also cleaned the oven and microwave, sorted through the refrigerator and threw away everything that was expired.</p><p>And okay, she hates that there was quite a lot of things... like leftover food she had put in a Tupperware a week ago then completely forgot about. It had mold and she couldn't even tell what it used to be, and the simple thought of opening it made her want to throw up, so she threw the Tupperware with it. It's just some plastic stuff anyway, she can buy it again. Who fucking cares.</p><p>"I'm too old to go to the bar, Wanda," she mutters into the phone, responding to her best friend.</p><p>"Oh my God, you're not a fossil, you're thirty-seven! And there's no age to enjoy a night out. Please, I don't want to be Jen and Alice's third wheel again."</p><p>Thirty-seven. Almost forty. Agatha's at the age where staying home on a Friday night sounds ten times better than going out to some noisy-ass bar with her friends. Because what's the point, anyway? Jen and Alice are gonna get drunk and start flirting with each other like they always do, probably forgetting she and Wanda even exist halfway through the second round of drinks. She's certain they're secretly dating, or in a friends-with-benefits relationship, because there's <em>no way</em> these two have never fucked.</p><p>Wanda's gonna want to do karaoke, that's for sure, and Agatha will be stuck standing awkwardly by the bar while some guy with beer breath and a wedding ring tries to hit on her just because she looks straight and he thinks he's got a chance. And even if she <em>did</em> wear something a little more obviously gay like a carabiner or even a white t-shirt with red scissors scissoring, those drunk idiots wouldn't even get the hint.</p><p>Or even if they do, they'll just say some shit like <em>you'll never know if you like it until you try</em> (she already did and she, in fact, didn't like it) or even <em>you're too pretty to be gay.</em> And yes, this unfortunately happened before. Men. Men who don't even care about her sexuality, even after she explicitly says she likes to eat pussies. No wonder she's a lesbian; men are so disgusting, in every way possible.</p><p>Just to say, that's not the kind of night she wants to have. Not after the week she's had surrounded by hormonal teenagers who think they're smarter than her, the fucking history teacher, and dealing with parents emailing her asking why their kid got a C when they never do the damn homework.</p><p>Agatha loves her job—teaching history, one of the things she likes the most, is a dream—but it's not always easy. Teenagers are, well... teenagers. They're loud, annoying, always trying to cheat on tests or piss the teacher of. At the end of the day, that's the hardest part of the job. Teaching is easy; dealing with the kids and their parents is not. Especially those who are way too overprotective with their kid, who defend them even if they did something bad.</p><p>During the last PTA meeting, Agatha had told a single mom about how her son cheated in class. He had a piece of paper hidden in his pencil case with all the test's answers written on it (very subtle... could've done better). And you know what happened? The mom denied it. Said her son probably wrote this when studying with his friends and forgot to take it out of the case. Literally a fucking joke. As a single mom herself, she gets it—how she wants to protect her baby—but she'd never go that far. Agatha hates those kinds of parents with all her heart, maybe even more than their kids. But as we say, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh.</p><p>So after this long, annoying week, all she wants to do right now is take a hot shower—or even a relaxing bath with sweet candles and a face mask from Jen's brand, it's been a while—and then order take-out, because there's no way she's gonna bother cooking if Nicky isn't here, and then just crash in bed for twelve hours straight. And maybe talk to Evil Hag too, if she ever texts back.</p><p>They've been talking basically non-stop since last Wednesday. It's been almost two weeks now, since that stranger accidentally sent her that tattoo pic. Two weeks of talking every day with a woman she only knows as Evil Hag, a silly nickname she uses to refer to her. She actually can't believe they're still talking. She had hoped so—she's a really entertaining person—but she's still surprised.</p><p>They keep talking, yet they know nothing about each other's identity. They only know where they're from; Agatha knows she's from the City of Angels, but Evil Hag only knows she's from New Jersey, no specific city. Considering how small Westview is, she prefers not to share her exact location, just in case. Even though she knows her now. She doesn't, but at the same time, she does. She's an accident, a wrong number, nothing more. Not a creepy guy named Joe who's gonna stalk her then come murder her in her sleep.</p><p>Evil Hag is a woman—and from that little snippet she saw, she's a pretty one with tanned skin and toned arms and a very pretty tattoo—she's a real person who enjoys talking to her. Agatha also knows about her favorite things, as they shared a lot during their twenty questions game, but she still doesn't know what she looks like. She imagines it in her head, though. She knows she's a brunette with hazel eyes and tanned skin. She imagines a soft face, a cute smile, a soft voice.</p><p>They've been talking for two weeks. Nothing too personal, that's kind of their thing, but somehow they never run out of things to talk about. Books, movies and shows, music, food. They always find something to talk about while keeping their identities secret. Which is kind of funny; after all this time, they could share more. They both know the other is not a creepy man and they could easily call each other friends, so why not? But Evil Hag doesn't overshare. Never. She's always mysterious, especially about her job, which makes Agatha wonder what is it for her to be so secretive about it.</p><p>What is she, a drug dealer? A hitwoman? An FBI agent who can't share her job for safety? Who knows. She just hopes that one day, she'll feel safe enough to share more. She already knows that Agatha is a teacher and that she has a son called Nicky—though his real name is Nicholas, but she only uses it when he needs to be scolded or in more formal settings—but Agatha doesn't know anything else about her besides the fact that she has a tarantula, which is absolutely disgusting. Just thinking about it makes her shiver. She wouldn't call herself arachnophobic, but thinking of all those eyes looking at her... ew, no.</p><p>Agatha's been looking forward to her messages a little too much now, refreshing her texts way more than she should, especially the past couple of days. She knows, deep down, that it's stupid. That refreshing is useless. Her phone is not that old—if Evil Hag texts, she'll simply get the notification on her lockscreen or control panel thing. But she can't help it.</p><p>She hasn't replied in two full days. Which is fine, she's probably just busy with her mysterious job, but Agatha can't help overthinking it anyway. What if she got bored of her and blocked her? No, no, otherwise she wouldn't be able to text her anymore. Then maybe she's just ghosting her... Maybe Agatha said something weird or made her uncomfortable somehow. Or maybe, again, she's just working and it's nothing, just her mind making up things. That's most likely what's really happening. But still.</p><p>She hates how much she misses her. It's dumb, but she does. She got used to the attention, to the easy back-and-forth, to the flirty little jokes that always made her smile like an idiot. The thirty-seven-year-old teacher is now glued to her phone all day like the teenagers she teaches. Funny, isn't it? Not the best role model to Nicky, who as for now only has a tablet he only gets to use a certain amount of time a day.</p><p>Agatha is lucky, because when she says stop, he doesn't fight her. He just hands her back his tablet without complaining. And he's so polite and sweet that Agatha always lets him finish whatever he was doing before his screentime got to an end. If he's watching a movie—depending on the time left, of course—she lets him finish. If it's a game, that's the same thing. And maybe that's why he's so good about it, because she's doing a great job at parenting while taking consideration of her son's feelings.</p><p>Without Evil Hag, everything just feels kind of... boring. She's the only entertaining thing in Agatha's life right now, and with her gone and Nicky not home either, the house is way too still today. The morning was fine because she was busy doing some cleaning, but now, it's different. She could watch tv, catch up on the latest shows and movies on Netflix or any other overpriced streaming platform she subscribed to, but she's sure she'd be too distracted to follow whatever she's watching.</p><p>Maybe Wanda's right. Maybe she should go. Get dressed, go out, get drunk, forget about everything. Maybe she'll even enjoy herself. Or maybe she'll spend the whole night regretting not staying in her pajamas, binge-watching a shitty show and eating unhealthy, greasy take-out on the couch with a beer.</p><p>"I don't know," she finally mumbles into the phone with another sigh, shifting her weight to her other leg and glancing around the kitchen, only to notice how spotless everything is. Well thank fucking God, she spent over an hour cleaning it.</p><p>"Come on, it's gonna be fun! Vision's babysitting the boys. Please, Agatha. It's been forever since we went out and had fun together."</p><p>She looks at the time on the microwave, then sighs again. It's still early. Too early to go to sleep and too late to be productive with anything. Thankfully, this week she doesn't have any copies to correct.</p><p>She thinks for a moment, then agrees. "Fuck, alright. But if some guy flirts with me, I'm stabbing him with a broken beer bottle."</p><p>"Amazing! I'll help you hide the body. I'll pick you up in an hour, be ready by then! Love you, see ya soon!" And just like that, Wanda hangs up before Agatha can even answer.</p><p>An hour. Fucking seriously? She still needs to shower, wash her hair, find an outfit, then do her hair and makeup. There's no way in hell she'll be ready to leave in an hour.</p><p>With yet another loud annoyed sigh, she rushes to the bathroom, where she strips in record time and steps into the shower. She doesn't even wait for the water to heat up, which might actually be a good thing because the cold shock wakes her up a little and she's gonna need the energy if she wants to survive the night. She's already half-regretting her decision... but Wanda is right. It's been a while since they got out together, and with Jen and Alice, they all need it.</p><p>The moment the water hits her skin, she shivers, but she ignores it and grabs her shampoo bottle. It's the olive oil one Jen gave her from her shop, the one that doesn't smell really good but makes her hair incredibly soft. And she really needs this now because her hair looks like a bird took a nest in it. She squeezes out a generous amount and tries to cover as much of her hair as possible, which is always a bit of a struggle considering how thick and long it is.</p><p>Once it's lathered in, she lets it sit while she grabs the body wash and scrubs down as fast as she can. The whole thing is rushed, but she doesn't have time to waste. After she's rinsed and out of the shower, she wraps herself in a towel. A quick look down at her phone posed next to the sink confirms that she already has only half an hour left. How the fuck did she spend this much time in the shower? Jeez, she really has no concept of time.</p><p>She grabs a brush and quickly runs it through her wet hair, not even bothering to dry it since she knows it takes forever and it always looks better when it air-dries anyway.</p><p>Still wrapped in her towel, she heads to the bedroom so she can finish drying off while figuring out what the hell she's going to wear...</p><p>...And fuck. It's going to be harder than she thought, because she has nothing to wear. Not <em>nothing</em> as in her closet is empty, <em>nothing</em> as in most of the stuff she used to wear to go out doesn't fit anymore, not since she had Nicky. Pregnancy did a number on her body, and while she's mostly made peace with it, her closet hasn't.</p><p>Half of her old dresses are too tight, too short, or she now finds them ugly. Time really changed her tastes. And the stuff that does fit, well, it's either way too formal for a night out or not comfortable enough. The simple fact that she'll have to wear a bra for god knows how many hours already makes her want to cancel. She spent the entire day braless, wearing old comfy clothes she now wears as pajamas, so thinking about her boobs being compressed again... damn it.</p><p>She finally decides on a simple pair of black slacks with a white button-up. Something safe, not too sexy (so men won't try to flirt with her) and not too uncomfortable either. The slacks don't have a zipper and don't make Agatha feel compressed, which is a win, especially since she hasn't eaten for hours and the alcohol she'll probably drink tonight might make her feel bloated later. It's not the most exciting outfit ever, but it'll do.</p><p>Her thoughts are interrupted by three knocks on the door of her bedroom. Agatha jumps, startled, and immediately turns her head toward the sound, only to find her best friend standing there, already fully dressed in a beautiful red dress that reaches her knees, hugging her body just enough to make it hot but not slutty. Her heels are the exact same shade, matching perfectly.</p><p>Red has always been her color—it makes her hair pop and it brings out the green in her eyes. Her ginger hair is curled and falling over her shoulders, and her makeup is soft, subtle, nothing too much, just enough to highlight everything that's already pretty. She looks amazing. Like always. But there's absolutely no way she wasn't at least half-ready when she called Agatha, because an hour to do all of this is just impossible, even for the one and only Wanda Maximoff.</p><p>"Wanda, what the fuck!" Agatha gasps, a hand flying to her chest. "Ever heard of knocking?"</p><p>The redhead leans against the doorframe, arms crossed over her chest. "I did. Three times. You didn't hear."</p><p>"How did you even—"</p><p>"Spare key under the weirdly shaped rock," Wanda cuts her off with a smirk, looking at her up and down with a slight frown. "I know you, Agatha. First of all, that's such a bad hiding place, literally anyone could find it and break in. And second, what the fuck is this outfit?"</p><p>Agatha shrugs. "My outfit for tonight. And by the way, you're early."</p><p>"Well, thank God I am. You can't fucking be serious."</p><p>"What?" Agatha frowns. "I look good."</p><p>"You look like you're going to a fucking PTA meeting. We're going to a bar, not the school. You need to look sexy."</p><p>"And attract drunk ugly men? No thank you."</p><p>"That doesn't mean you have to look like you're about to give someone detention."</p><p>The history teacher groans, throwing her hands in the air. "I don't even own anything sexy! Have you seen me? I'm not the skinny twenty-something I used to be. Half my closet doesn't even fit me anymore. You know my body changed with the pregnancy."</p><p>Wanda sighs, stepping fully into the room. She's been there for years, hearing her complain about how her body changed, then start accepting herself again. She lived it all. "You were hot before having Nicky, and you're still hot after having Nicky. Got it? Your body is different, yeah, but it shows that you birthed a literal human. You created life, Agatha, that's huge. You don't need to hide that. I'm sure you have something less... formal to wear. And there's no way I'm letting you go out with wet hair, Jesus."</p><p>Agatha flops onto the bed and smiles at Wanda's reassurance. How is that woman straight, she wonders. She always calls her hot, or sexy, or gives her many weird pet names old married couples use. And just to say, she never uses any with her dear husband. That's not a very straight thing to do... but alas, Wanda Scarlet Maximoff is a straight woman. Sadly. Agatha would've fucked her years ago if she had any interest in girls back then and wasn't married.</p><p>The redhead, while her best friend watches her from the bed, starts going through her closet. "By the way," she breaks the silence, "did Nicky enjoy the book?"</p><p>Did he enjoy it? Fuck yeah he did. It took them three days to finish it, since he kept falling asleep before they could make any real progress, but he loved it. Totally obsessed, as his mother had hoped and expected. "He did," Agatha says, smiling at the memory. "But now he's sad there isn't a third book in the series."</p><p>"Yet."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I checked the author's Insta last time. I was curious to see if she had one and what she looked like. She's really hot, by the way, totally your type. But she's not super active. Her last post was, like, a month ago and she said she's working on the third book. The final one, apparently. But she also has a new book coming soon. Not part of the Christmas Witch series, but I think Nicky might still like it. If I remember right, it's about a witch too, Luna something."</p><p>Oh? Agatha raises an eyebrow, surprised. "You stalked her social media?"</p><p>Wanda rolls her eyes. "I didn't <em>stalk</em> her. People have social media for a reason, you know. To engage with fans, announce new stuff, post about their projects. She's also an actress, by the way. Four million followers. Just a few posts, some highlights too, she's the discreet kind."</p><p>"Jeez, do you have a crush on her now?"</p><p>"I'm straight," the redhead reminds her for the umpteenth time with a small chuckle and a roll of her eyes. She's still going through all her clothes, muttering a few <em>nope</em>, <em>ugly</em>, <em>ew</em> and <em>what the fuck</em> here and there.</p><p>"Yeah, and so am I," Agatha deadpans.</p><p>"Oh, sure you are. Anyway, you should follow her. She's your son's favorite author. Wouldn't hurt to keep up with her work, y'know. I can't remember when exactly but I'm almost certain her new book releases next week. You should follow the illustrator too, that Lilia Calderu woman."</p><p>"You're literally never gonna beat the bi allegations."</p><p>Wanda groans. "Agatha, for the last time, I'm straight! I can find <em>some</em> girls hot without it meaning anything. And Lilia's like, sixty or something. I'm only following her because she's an amazing artist. And Rio's just a good author, okay? Billy loved the book. Tommy not so much, but I'm still one hundred percent getting the next one. You should too."</p><p>"I don't even have Instagram anymore."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I uninstalled it. I never used it," Agatha shrugs.</p><p>It's true. Technically, she still has an account—Wanda made her sign up months ago—and she posted a few pictures here and there, but she never really got into it. The app wasn't fun for her. Her feed was just teenagers doing dumbass trends and random shit she didn't care about. Wanda tried explaining how the algorithm worked, how she had to follow people for her to see content she was interested in, but even then, Agatha never liked it. She felt too old for all that. So eventually she just deleted the app. Problem solved, and she saved some storage on her phone to take many more pictures of her son doing everything and anything she thought would be nice to remember.</p><p>"Well, reinstall it," Wanda says while holding up a long black dress with a neckline so high it looks like something a nun would wear. "What the fuck?" she mutters, turning the dress around to show her best friend. "When are you ever gonna wear this? At a funeral?"</p><p>Agatha snorts. She actually wore that once, right after Nicky was born, back when she didn't feel as confident showing skin. But now that she looks at it again, now that she feels more comfortable in her body and that her clothing style changed a lot... absolutely the hell no. What the fuck is this ugly thing? How did she even wear it in the past? It looks like something her mother used to force her to wear at her Catholic school. Hard pass.</p><p>"I'm saving it for when my mom finally kicks the bucket," she jokes.</p><p>"If you wanna really piss her off, you should show up to her funeral dressed in rainbow from head to toe. She'd probably crawl out of her grave just to call you a dyke and be homophobic about it."</p><p>"She totally would. Can't wait to be haunted by her ghost and have to call a fucking exorcist."</p><p>Wanda laughs as she keeps digging through the closet. The problem is, half the clothes Agatha owns are too small now, and the other half is basically what she wears at work. High-waisted slacks, button-up shirts in like ten different colors. A few pairs of jeans, t-shirts, comfy pants she wears on her days off that totally double as pajamas. But something she can wear to a bar? Yeah. That she doesn't really have. It's been so long since she went out that she's forgotten what even counts as 'going out' clothes. Last time, she threw on a Fleetwood Mac tee with high-waisted jeans and called it a day. She could technically do that again tonight, but she already knows Wanda would strangle her before letting her walk out the door like that.</p><p>Finally, Wanda pulls something out. "This," she says. She's holding an olive green knit long-sleeved midi dress with lace detail at the chest and a squared neckline.</p><p>Fuck. Agatha forgot she even had that. She wore it once last Christmas over a red sweater. It was objectively ugly as hell like that, but it matched the holiday colors, so it felt festive enough to spend the night at the Maximoffs'. Agatha was only celebrating Christmas for Nicky, and because it's similar enough to Yule that she can celebrate it as a pagan holiday and not a Christian one. Otherwise, she hates it. An entire holiday focused on a man people have never seen but believe in because it's written in an old-ass book... yeah, no. She never believed in it, and with the way she grew up, she could even say she hates it and anything related to Christianity. Once the holiday was over, the dress went right back into her closet and never saw the light of day again.</p><p>"It's perfect," Wanda continues with a proud smile. "And forget the bra. It'll look sexier without and way more comfortable."</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow. Is she serious? The dress is cute, yeah, she'll admit that. But braless? In public? At a straight bar? Absolutely not. She'd do it if they were going to a lesbian bar, no hesitation. Girls, even the gay ones, are way more respectful than straight cis men. But the only one in Westview's closed for renovations, so they're stuck going to a regular bar. With men. Drunk, straight, married men who will forget they have a wife at home and try to flirt with any girl.</p><p>"I'm gonna freeze my tits off," she scoffs.</p><p>"Yeah, and you'll look hot. Worth it. Come on, Ags. You can't show up looking like a teacher about to give a lecture on the dangers of vaping. This is literally the only acceptable outfit in your closet tonight."</p><p>Grumbling, Agatha grabs the dress from Wanda's hands and accepts her fate. "Ugh, alright! But I swear to Hekate, Wanda, if a man tries to flirt, I'm leaving."</p><p>She starts unbuttoning her shirt without giving a single fuck that Wanda is still standing right there in the room (it's not like she hasn't seen her naked before, anyway) and once the fabric is off, she reaches behind her to unclasp her lilac bra and tosses it on the bed next to her slacks. She doesn't even bother folding anything. She'll probably end up putting everything on the floor later if she's too drunk, or even fall asleep over them. Doesn't matter. She'll put the clothes back in her closet tomorrow... if she's not too hungover to do that.</p><p>She then slips the dress on, adjusts the sleeves, pulls it down over her hips, and smooths out the fabric a little before walking over to her full-length mirror.</p><p>She takes a breath and looks at herself properly. As expected, the dress hugs her figure more than she's used to. It's not tight, exactly, but it's close-fitting. Her hips definitely look bigger than they do in jeans or slacks, and her tummy shows a bit more than she'd like. She shifts uncomfortably, eyes focusing on the way the fabric outlines the small swell of her stomach. She tries to remind herself that it's fine. That it's normal. She's thirty-seven, she created life, her body's changed, and that doesn't make her less hot. Maybe if she repeats it enough times, she'll actually start believing it.</p><p>If she forgets about how her curves show more in this outfit for a second, she does kinda love the dress. The neckline dips lower than what she usually goes for, shows off more cleavage than she's used to, but... she doesn't look too bad. Her boobs look good, actually. Great, even. She just adjusts the fabric a little so it hides more skin—that part of her boobs that is now covered in stretch marks from the pregnancy, when her boobs got bigger for breastfeeding, then smaller again after. Nothing wrong with them, she knows that, but she's not very comfortable showing that yet. Especially in a straight bar.</p><p>The fabric is soft and stretchy, the fit is comfortable and the olive green color suits her. It's far from her favorite purple shade, but it works with her hair, brings out her skin tone, and somehow reminds her of nature. A smile grows on her face when she remembers that green is Evil Hag's favorite color and that she's a nature kind of girl.</p><p>"So?" Wanda mumbles from behind her. "It looks great. You look great."</p><p>Agatha switches angles in the mirror, turning slightly to the side. Her eyes stay fixed on her reflection as she places a hand over her tummy. The small swell reminds her of those first few weeks of pregnancy, when she'd started to show just the tiniest bit. She'd been so happy back then, so excited even though she already knew her body would never be the same. And that was okay. That was normal. It didn't mean she couldn't still be attractive. Some people might even prefer how she looks now. But all the bullshit her mother filled her head with growing up still lingers, and sometimes it's hard not to believe it.</p><p>"If you say so," she mutters, still looking at herself at different angles.</p><p>Wanda tosses a gray cardigan her way, and Agatha catches it out of reflex. "Wear this," the redhead says. "Wouldn't want you to freeze to death, huh? Now come on, sit down, I'm doing your hair and makeup. There's no way I'm letting you leave the house like that."</p><p>"It's gonna take forever," Agatha groans. "What about Alice and Jen?</p><p>"They'll wait for us at the bar. And I'm sure they'll be very happy to be alone... together." Wanda grins.</p><p>"Hm. Yeah, you're right."</p><p>Half an hour later, they're finally ready to go. Agatha's hair is dry now, loosely styled, and she's got just enough makeup on to feel presentable without overdoing it. Even in her everyday life, the teacher has never been a big fan of makeup. She wears some mascara and lip gloss if she feels like it, but that's it. Nothing too heavy or colorful.</p><p>Before leaving her bedroom to follow Wanda downstairs, she snaps a quick mirror photo of her outfit to send to Evil Hag. Obviously, her face is cropped out, but everything else is visible. The tip of her long brown hair, her cleavage, her outfit, even her shoes.</p><p>She opens her conversation with her and clicks on the gallery option. Her fingers hover over her photo for a moment... and she hesitates. Will she find her pretty? It would be the very first time she sends a photo of herself, and even if her face isn't visible, the rest is, and she's scared that woman won't like her. What if she doesn't find her good enough? What if she stops flirting because she doesn't like how she looks?</p><p>After a few more seconds, Agatha let out a sigh and decides to send it anyway.</p><p align="center">

<p>And that's how they ended up on stage, singing their lungs out to <em>Piano Man</em> on a Friday night.</p><p>Jen has an arm wrapped around Alice's shoulder, Wanda is singing with her glass of whiskey in hand, taking a few sips in between like she's not even singing but just lip-syncing, giving Michelle Phillips vibes when she ate that banana on stage during the <em>Mamas and the Papas</em> performance of <em>California Dreamin'</em> on the <em>Ed Sullivan Show</em> in nineteen sixty-seven after they were told they had to lip-sync, and Agatha is probably the only one really focused on the song.</p><p>It's not exactly surprising considering she's the one who actually likes karaoke (and is actually good at it). No offense to her friends, but they're really out of tune.</p><p>She's standing at the front, one hand around the mic and the other doing some weird movements as the song goes by. She doesn't even bother looking at the lyrics scrolling across the screen. She knows them by heart anyway, and she's too drunk to be able to read and sing at the same time, especially when the words are in yellow font on a black background. It hurts her eyes just looking at it, and the fact that she doesn't have her glasses on doesn't help in the slightest. And obviously, she didn't bring them with her. What kind of middle-aged woman brings her reading glasses on a night out? She's not there to read or do stupid crosswords, for fuck's sake, she's here to get drunk and relax with her friends.</p><p>"He says,<em> Bill, I believe this is killing me, </em>as a smile ran away from his face.<em> Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star if I could get out of this place,"</em> she sings into the mic, hitting all the right notes even with two glasses of whiskey and a shot of an alcohol she doesn't even know the name of in her system.</p><p>It's funny, but she's almost certain she sings best when she's drunk—or at least tipsy enough to forget about the dozen strangers watching her in the room. When she's drunk, she feels like she can do anything, that she won't get judged or made fun of.</p><p>She glances around the room while she keeps singing, just letting her eyes wander because it's better than staring at the screen. The yellow color makes the words seem like they're fading, and it fucking hurts. Who had the great idea of using this shade, seriously? Is black on white overrated, or what? Thank God she doesn't need the lyrics.</p><p>And that's when she notices her. A woman sitting at the far end of the bar, alone. From here, she looks like she's in her late twenties or maybe early thirties—Agatha can't really tell with the dim light of the room and the distance between the stage and her table. She has brown hair that seems to reach just above her shoulders without exactly touching them, and from what the teacher can see from here, she's wearing a black top under a leather jacket. In her right hand, she's holding a glass of something that looks amber-colored, maybe whiskey or rum.</p><p>Their eyes meet, and the woman raises her glass slightly in her direction before taking a slow sip, still holding her gaze.</p><p>What the fuck.</p><p>She doesn't stop singing, though. Doesn't even miss a beat. Her eyes stay on the girl as she sings, and the girl doesn't look away either. She smirks wider, almost like she knows she's being watched. Like she's doing it on purpose. And Agatha is certain that she does. But why?</p><p>"Oh, la, la-la, di-dee-da," she continues the song, "la-la, di-dee-da, da-dum."</p><p>During the rest of the song—which is three full minutes, one hundred and eighty fucking seconds—she can feel that woman's eyes on her, and to say that Agatha is intrigued is an understatement. Even from here, she can just tell that this stranger is gay. Her gaydar never misses (which is why she insists on the fact that Wanda isn't as straight as she thinks she is). It's maybe the hairstyle, or the outfit, or even just the vibe she gives off. Some people just look like lesbians. And this one? She absolutely does. Agatha's not sure how to explain it, it's not just one thing, it's the whole vibe. She can't see if she wears a carabiner as she's sitting, but she's almost certain that she does.</p><p>One thing she's completely sure of is that this woman likes women. If not a lesbian, she's at least bi or pan, which makes the whole thing even weirder and harder to ignore. Is she just appreciating the fact that Agatha can sing and hold a note even while drunk, or is she actually checking her out? With the way she keeps smirking like that, Agatha would definitely bet on the second option, and she doesn't really know how to feel about it. It's not like it's the first time someone's ever flirted with her at a bar—far from it, her twenties were really funny years of discovery—but it's been a while since it happened, especially with someone that pretty.</p><p>Her brain is spinning a little from the alcohol, and it's stupid, but she can't stop thinking about Evil Hag. She still hasn't responded. It's been over two hours, and she hasn't said anything about the picture Agatha sent. And yeah, sure, maybe she's just busy, maybe she hasn't seen it yet, but that doesn't make it any easier to ignore. Especially now, with that stranger looking at her like that, and Agatha thinking that she somehow kinda looks like what she imagines Evil Hag would look like. Brunette, hazel eyes—she obviously can't tell the woman's eye color from so far and with the lights of the bar, but they look dark, maybe brown or dark green—a pretty smirk on her lips, a sharp jaw, pretty hands with crazily long fingers—</p><p>Oh, fuck. Yeah, she's drunk. She's so fucking drunk. Her brain's obviously playing tricks on her now.</p><p>When the song finally ends, the girls hand the mics back to the DJ and step down from the little stage, and Agatha feels like she's being watched. A quick turn of her head towards the far end of the bar confirms that yes, indeed, she's being watched. That woman is still looking at her, with that annoying smirk that never left her lips for the past three minutes and her glass now empty.</p><p>But Agatha doesn't do anything about it. She simply ignores her and follows her friends back to their table.</p><p>"Fuck, that was amazing!" Wanda says, throwing herself into her chair, out of breath. Funny considering she barely sang. "I love this song."</p><p>"Please," Jen says with a playful scoff and a roll of her eyes, "you weren't even singing."</p><p>"I was!"</p><p>"No, you weren't," Alice grins. "You were drinking."</p><p>Wanda scoffs. "Okay, yes. And? I deserved it. It's been forever since I had whiskey. You two don't have kids, you can get drunk whenever the hell you want. I can't. I'm a responsible mother."</p><p>She's got a point. Agatha isn't really a heavy drinker either—besides a few glasses of wine here and there after an exhausting day at work, that's about it. She doesn't mess with the strong stuff too often. She's a mom before anything else, and even now, when Nicky isn't with her, she still feels weird about drinking too much.</p><p>When she got pregnant, she promised herself she'd never become like her father. That she'd never lose control like he used to after coming home drunk in the middle of the night, screaming shit and throwing plates at the wall—or worse, at her face. That man had a short temper, especially after a few drinks. Even sober, he hated her, but drunk... fuck, that was the worst.</p><p>Agatha always thought her mother was the worst—starving her, locking her in the closet, insulting her—but her father wasn't a saint either. His way to show hate to his unwanted daughter, unlike Evanora, was physical. He used to slap her, hit her, push her so hard he could accidentally break a bone. Just the thought of him makes her want to scream.</p><p>Agatha promised that she'd never hit her kid or make him feel scared or small like her parents did. That she'd care for her son like he's the most important thing in the world (and to her, he is), that she'd love him forever no matter what. So yeah, she only drinks when she knows she's safe and won't be around him until the next morning. It's the only way she allows herself to let go, and even then, she tries not to drink too often anyway. Can't risk becoming her father. That's one thing she won't ever allow. Nicky deserves to grow up feeling loved because fuck, he <em>is</em> loved.</p><p>"I'm gonna go order a cocktail. The mango one looks so fucking good," Alice says, standing up from her chair. "Anyone want anything?"</p><p>"Same thing as you," Jen answers.</p><p>"And just a glass of water for me," Wanda says with a grin. Very responsible of her. Agatha respects that. The Maximoff woman knows her limits and stops when it's time to stop. She's always been like that, especially after she gave birth to the twins.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>"Uh, just some water too, please."</p><p>"Got it. Be right back!"</p><p>Once Alice is gone, Jen and Wanda start talking about something that Agatha doesn't even catch—probably because she's not listening at all. Her eyes are on her phone again. Evil Hag still hasn't answered. They've been talking nonstop for two whole weeks, and now nothing for two whole days. That's a long time, and Agatha is honestly starting to get worried. She can't even see if she has read her messages because it's the phone's text app, not a social media, and she can't see if she's online either.</p><p>She's trying not to overthink it, but she's starting to spiral a bit. Okay, maybe the alcohol made it worse too, like when you're trying not to think about your ex but the drinks make you text her back and then you end up regretting it the next day once you're sober again. Whatever it is, she can't stop thinking about her and the reason why she hasn't given a sign of life in two days.</p><p>What if something happened? A car accident, a disease, anything could've fucking happened and Agatha wouldn't even know about it because she doesn't know who she is. Or what if she just got bored and found someone else to flirt with? Maybe she was just playing a game and now the game's over. The problem is, Agatha's starting to realize she liked the game more than she expected. It's stupid how fast it all happened... but she misses her. She misses waking up to a stupid text, misses their weird little convos. Misses feeling <em>wanted</em>.</p><p>Okay. Fuck. The alcohol is definitely fucking with her head. Good thing she ordered water, because clearly she needs it.</p><p>Lost in her thoughts, she can't help but give her phone screen two little taps every few seconds, as if a text will magically appear if she keeps doing it. It's stupid. It won't, she knows it. But hey, she has the perfect excuse of being drunk and not thinking straight. Pun no pun.</p><p>"Oh my God, stop doing that," a voice interrupts her thoughts. She isn't sure, but it sounded like Jen's annoying tone.</p><p>"Huh?" She blinks, looking up from the screen.</p><p>Jen, who's sitting across from her, rolls her eyes. "You know staring at your phone won't make her answer faster, right?"</p><p>"How do you know it's a <em>her</em>?"</p><p>"I don't," she shrugs. "But I know you, Agatha, and you look like a teenager in love. So? Who is she? Did you reinstall Tinder or something?"</p><p>"What? No." Agatha frowns. She did have a few different dating apps a while back, but it never worked. People don't want to date a single mother, she came to this conclusion years ago.</p><p>"Then who are you texting? No offense, but literally all your friends are in this bar."</p><p>Right. She hasn't talked about Evil Hag to Jen since the very first day they started talking. Agatha had told Jen about it during lunch at school when she asked who she was talking to. But unlike Wanda, Agatha isn't very close to Jen. She's her co-worker and her close friend's friend (or girlfriend, who fucking knows) so she doesn't really have a choice other than to get along with her.</p><p>"No one," she mutters.</p><p>"Yeah, my ass. Who's your secret girlfriend?"</p><p>Agatha looks up, confused. "What? She's not my girlfriend."</p><p>Jen grins. "And I'm straight. Come on. You hate being on your phone more than, like, two hours a day. You've been glued to it all night. Spill, Harkness."</p><p>"She's just... fuck. Remember that wrong number?"</p><p>The woman raises an eyebrow. "Tattoo girl? That was, like, two weeks ago."</p><p>"Huh-huh."</p><p>"Wait. You're still talking to her?"</p><p>"I am. She's my friend."</p><p>Jen's already mid-laugh. "Oh my God. Have you never watched a single episode of Criminal Minds? You have no survival instincts."</p><p>"I've watched Criminal Minds, thank you very much—team Jemily, by the way—but what the hell does that have to do with her?"</p><p>"Her? Or <em>him</em>. What if this wrong number is actually some creepy bald guy pretending to be a hot woman, huh? What if he's watching you through your phone camera right now? What if he's waiting for you to accidentally share your address or something so he can show up and kidnap you?"</p><p>"Ew," Wanda groans. "Jen, shut the fuck up. That's disgusting."</p><p>"I'm just saying," Jen shrugs. "That's how they do it. Old men in basements pretending to be sexy lesbians."</p><p>"I appreciate the concern, Agent Prentiss, but I'm telling you, she's not a creepy dude. Tattoo pic, remember?"</p><p>"She—or he—could've found that online. Pinterest exists, you know? You type 'underboob tattoo' and boom, dozens of results. Did you reverse image search it?"</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes so hard it almost gives her a headache. Why is Jen so worried about her? They're not enemies, but they're not friends either. "Seriously? You think a bald guy downloaded a random mirror pic of some girl in her bathroom just to catfish me of all people?"</p><p>"Yes," Jen deadpans. "That's exactly what I think."</p><p>"Well, you're wrong. I know her."</p><p>"Oh yeah? What's her name? Where does she live?"</p><p>Oh, man. She's never gonna leave her alone now. "She, uhm... she's very secretive, okay? She didn't give me her real name, just a nickname."</p><p>The other woman's mouth falls open. "Are you fucking kidding me?"</p><p>"Stop looking at me like that! She's just private, okay? And I get it. I haven't told her my full name either."</p><p>"You're literally using your real phone number. She could've found your address already."</p><p>"God," Wanda mutters, interrupting them. "This conversation is giving me a headache."</p><p>"And she's from Los Angeles," Agatha says while ignoring her best friend.</p><p>"Oh great, that narrows it down. One million possible suspects. You feel safe now?"</p><p>"We have a lot in common. She's not a creep."</p><p>"A lot in common?" she laughs. "That's exactly what a manipulative creep would make sure of. Learn all your likes and dislikes, pretend to match with you on everything, build trust and then boom. You're kidnapped. Or worse."</p><p>Wanda reaches across the table and smacks Jen lightly on the arm. "Let her have this, Jesus. She's finally flirting with someone again."</p><p>She understands they're protective, but this is overreacting... right? Right. She knows her. Fuck, they've been talking for two weeks. That tattoo pic couldn't just be fake, and everything she told her. She's a real woman, she's certain of this.</p><p>"She's flirting with a stranger she's never seen! A faceless text bubble! This is literally how people die."</p><p>"Well, I'm still alive," Agatha scoffs, starting to get annoyed. She just doesn't like how Jen is talking about her friend, that's all.</p><p>"For now."</p><p>And right before the conversation can go further, Alice comes back with a tray carrying their drinks. "So, what did I miss?"</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>It's been about an hour since the karaoke. The vibe's slowed down a little—fewer people dancing, more sitting and talking, the music still loud but more like background noise now instead of something to move to. The girls have been chatting ever since, taking advantage of the lowered volume to finally have an actual conversation without having to shout, and Agatha's glass of water has been empty for at least twenty minutes. She didn't drink it all in one go or anything, just took a few sips here and there to stay hydrated, hoping the cold liquid would somehow cancel out the four drinks and that random shot Alice handed her earlier.</p><p>It helped a little, but not enough, which is not surprising considering she hasn't eaten anything since lunch, and drinking alcohol on an empty stomach isn't the best idea ever. One small glass of water won't fix it. It's not magical. She can still feel the alcohol in her blood, still feel it mess with her head. It makes her giggle at things that she wouldn't usually find funny, at least not enough to giggle like a schoolgirl.</p><p>Midway through a sentence, Wanda's phone starts buzzing on the table, and she frowns as she picks it up, muttering a quick <em>Vis</em> to the girls before answering. "Hey? What's wrong?"</p><p>Agatha sets her phone down face-up and watches, a little worried. It only takes maybe fifteen seconds of listening before Wanda's already moving, gathering her things with one hand and shrugging into her coat with the other. "Billy's sick," she says with a small worried sigh. "He threw up and now he's crying and asking for me. Mom duty, I have to go. Sorry, guys. I know we were supposed to stay longer."</p><p>"It's okay," Agatha says immediately, already standing too. If there's someone here who can understand, it's her. Nicky always comes first too. "Kids come first. Should I get Nicky too?"</p><p>"No, no. Don't worry," Wanda waves her off as she buttons her coat. "Vis told me he ate an oyster and, well, apparently he's allergic. He's not contagious or anything, so I can keep Nicky for the night if that's still what you want."</p><p>"Oh, fuck. I hope he's okay. You're really sure it's fine if Nicky stays?"</p><p>"Promise. It's so rare that you get a night out, Ags. Go enjoy yourself with Alice and Jen, really."</p><p>"Okay, alright," Agatha nods, grabbing her cardigan from the back of her chair. "I'll walk you out."</p><p>"You don't have to—"</p><p>"I'm not letting you stumble to your car alone, Maximoff. You drank tonight."</p><p>Wanda shoots her a look. "I stopped over an hour ago. I've been drinking water and I ate. I'm fine. I don't feel drunk, I'm literally just tired."</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms. "Still. I'm not letting you walk out there alone. Are you sure you don't want to call a cab?"</p><p>"I'm fine. I promise."</p><p>So they head out together, stepping into the cold night air, which hits like a slap. Agatha did expect today to be cold—not surprising for the end of February—but as the idiot that she is, she didn't bring a coat. Just her gray cardigan, which barely protects her from the cool wind. She told herself that it would be fine, that she'd barely be outside for more than a few seconds and that she didn't want to be bothered carrying a heavy coat around. Stupid mistake. She's dreaming of something warm right now.</p><p>It's not even the worst. The cardigan, while very thin, at least protects her a bit. But her face is completely bare against the cold wind, and she struggles to keep her tired eyes open.</p><p>The street outside the bar is half-dead now besjdes just a few people smoking near the side entrance, some couple fighting across the sidewalk, and a girl puking into a trash can. None of them are wearing coats, which is not surprising. She just hopes she won't get sick, because going from very hot to very cold to very hot again in just a few minutes is really not good for her body. Plus the hangover... she'll be stuck in bed, that's a fact.</p><p>Wanda unlocks her car with a loud beep, and Agatha keeps her eyes on her as she opens the door and tosses her bag into the passenger seat. It's true, she doesn't look drunk and she did eat a few chips and nuts earlier, but she's still worried. Accidents happen easily. "Text me when you get home, okay?" she asks her.</p><p>"I will."</p><p>"Drive safe, and text me news about Billy."</p><p>"I will," Wanda says again, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>"Seriously. If you feel even a little weird on the road, pull over and call me. I'll order you a cab myself."</p><p>The woman groans. "Agatha. I'm okay. I swear to you that I feel good. I didn't drink much alcohol, then I drank some water and ate something. I'm probably not one hundred percent sober yet, but I feel sober enough to drive. I'll be careful." Seeing her best friend's face, she adds, "I promise."</p><p>Agatha sighs. "Fine. Go."</p><p>They hug quickly before Wanda closes the door, starts the engine, and gives her a small wave as she pulls away.</p><p>Agatha stands there another ten seconds, maybe fifteen, making sure her best friend's driving safely and in a non-drunk way, before she finally turns around and heads back toward the bar, already bracing herself for the wall of sweat and heat and god-awful body odor she knows is waiting inside.</p><p>That's the part she didn't miss. It's later now and the place has thinned out a little, but not enough. There are still drunk guys dancing around like idiots, way too loud and reeking of cheap cologne and beer and cigarette.</p><p>She's honestly just glad no one tried to flirt with her tonight—the last thing she needs is to end up punching someone and spending the night in jail. She's a high school teacher, and as much as she hates it, her reputation still matters. If the school's headmaster hears that one of his teachers has been violent, she'd probably be fired. Can't risk letting a crazy woman around children. And Nicky, fuck. She can't risk being separated from him because she tried to kill a guy who flirted with her. So no punching for tonight.</p><p>She pushes through the crowd, trying not to make eye contact with anyone, and heads back toward their table... only to find it empty.</p><p>What the fuck.</p><p>She does a quick scan of the dance floor just in case, thinking maybe Jen and Alice decided to go dance now that Wanda left, but they're nowhere in sight. Not even near the bar or outside or anything.</p><p>Great. Just great. They were so drunk and all over each other earlier that maybe they didn't understand that Agatha was staying, that she wasn't going home with Wanda. They probably misunderstood and are now fucking somewhere.</p><p>With a sigh, she drops back into her chair and grabs her phone, waking the screen with two small taps of her thumb. Still nothing. No messages from Evil Hag. Two whole days... She knows she's probably overthinking it, knows the woman is busy, maybe even overwhelmed, that her job (whatever the fuck it is) keeps her from being on her phone 24/7, but still.</p><p>Would it kill her to just answer? Just a simple <em>hey, I'm okay</em> so she can stop worrying? She isn't asking her to explain why she's been gone for so long—she knows she likes being mysterious and avoids talking about her job or private life—but just a little something so she knows she's okay and just simply busy. Literally anything to stop her from spiraling like this. Especially when she's drunk. It's so much harder to keep the bad thoughts away when she's drunk.</p><p>She's still overthinking, maybe even on the verge of sending another just checking text, when a shadow suddenly falls across her screen.</p><p>"Mind if I sit?" a feminine voice asks.</p><p>Agatha looks up.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>It's her. The brunette from earlier. The one who'd been watching her from across the bar during karaoke like she was fucking dinner. That smirk is still there, curling her lips, and now that she's closer Agatha can tell she's even hotter than she thought. Black top, black leather jacket, tight jeans, a carabiner clipped to her belt loop (fucking told you!). Her gaydar really never misses. The woman smells like cigarettes and beer, but not in a gross way compared to all the drunk guys around. It fits her, fits her vibe. She looks like the kind of girl to ride motorcycles, and fuck, that's hot.</p><p>She turns her phone over so the screen is face-down and gestures toward the chair across from her. "Be my guest."</p><p>The woman sits down with a smile. "You were really good up there."</p><p>"What, at humiliating myself in front of half the town?"</p><p>"No. I mean it. You were great. You've got a good voice. You actually hit the notes, and you did it while drunk. That's talent. What's your name, mysterious singer?"</p><p>"Agatha."</p><p>"Agatha," she repeats, like she's tasting the name. "I like it. It's cute. I'm Harper. What are you doing here all alone?"</p><p>The teacher sighs, shaking her head a bit. "My friend had to leave, and when I came back from walking her out, my two other friends were gone. Maybe they thought I left too."</p><p>"Damn. That sucks. You staying?"</p><p>"Alone, surrounded by a bunch of drunk straight men?" she chuckle-scoffs. "I was going to leave."</p><p>Harper tilts her head with a smirk. "But you're not alone anymore now."</p><p>Oh. Okay. Some flirting—Agatha hadn't planned this when she got here, but well... this woman is hot. And it's been a while. And she's drunk. So why not.</p><p>"Can I offer you a drink?" Harper asks, obviously flirting.</p><p>"Uh... no thank you. I drank enough for tonight."</p><p>Harper shrugs. "Non-alcoholic, then?"</p><p><em>You really need to get laid,</em> she remembers Wanda telling her this. And maybe it's true. Maybe she's been really stressed with work recently and needs to get laid.</p><p>"Fuck... okay," she accepts after a few seconds of thinking.</p><p>Harper grins at that and stands up. "I'll be right back," she says, then disappears into the crowd with a flick of her hair, leaving Agatha sitting there with her elbow on the table, cheek resting against her palm, wondering what the fuck she's doing.</p><p>She's drunk. She's alone. She's waiting on a text from a woman she's never even seen before, who ghosted her for two whole days, and instead of calling a cab like a normal, responsible mother of a seven-year-old, she decided to stay here, at this smelly bar full of drunk men. And that's not even the worst. The worst part is that she's letting this younger woman flirt with her, let her sit at her table and buy her a drink. And the night's still young.</p><p>Harper comes back with two drinks, one glass of water and a ginger ale, both sweating cold. "Didn't know which you'd prefer," she says as she sets them down.</p><p>Agatha shrugs and takes the water. "Thanks."</p><p>"No problem."</p><p>For a while, they just sit like that. Sipping drinks, letting the conversation come and go in waves. It's not that deep. Harper talks about how she's in town for the weekend visiting her cousin, how she lives in Philly most of the time, how she hates beer but drinks it anyway because it's cheap and she doesn't make enough to allow herself to spend it on alcohol. She makes a couple jokes, mostly flirty, and Agatha finds herself laughing. Not because it's that funny but because she wants to. Because it feels good. Because Harper's not bad company and she hasn't flirted with anyone in a long fucking time and maybe it's okay to let herself enjoy this a little. Just for tonight.</p><p>Harper's got a flirty kind of charm. She leans forward when she talks, keeps her eyes locked on Agatha's face, smiles in a way that's not too cocky but definitely intentional. There's something about the way she touches the rim of her glass with her finger that makes Agatha's skin warm. Something about the way her knee brushes against hers under the table and doesn't move away.</p><p>Agatha lets herself flirt back. Just a little. A smirk here, a comment there. Nothing too much. Nothing that screams<em> I want to fuck you.</em> But she doesn't stop the knee contact. She doesn't shift away when Harper leans in to tell her something and their shoulders touch. She doesn't cut the conversation short when Harper compliments her laugh or tells her she's pretty. She hates to admit it, but she's having fun for once. It's been forever since she got out and flirted with someone. She kinda missed it.</p><p>After a while—maybe twenty or thirty minutes, time feels weird when she's this buzzed—Harper finishes her drink, sets it down and stretches her arms over her head. "I need air," she says. "You wanna come with me?"</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Agatha hesitates. She might be close to forty, but she still understands this kind of thing. The cliché <em>I need air</em> that actually means <em>wanna go out and fuck?</em></p><p>Does she? Wants to go out and fuck? Maybe. It's been a while, and this woman's hot. Agatha hesitates, but then she looks at Harper, who's already half-standing, waiting for her with that same smile, and she doesn't want to sit here alone anymore waiting for a stupid message that she knows isn't gonna come.</p><p>"Yeah," she finally says, pushing her chair back. "Okay."</p><p>Harper grins. "Cool."</p><p>They step outside without saying anything. The cool air hits her again, making her wrap her arms around herself to try to get warmer as she follows Harper down the alley behind the bar without asking why or where they're going. She already knows. She's not dumb. The alley is barely lit, just a few shitty streetlamps buzzing weakly above them, and there's a pile of broken-down cardboard boxes stacked beside an overflowing trash can.</p><p>It's far from being romantic. It smells like someone definitely pissed somewhere nearby, that's disgusting. But when Harper stops walking and turns around to face her, none of that really matters. Her eyes are dark in the shadows (she still isn't sure whether they're brown or green, she never really made eye contact), and she's looking at her like she's already undressing her with her gaze, like she's the only thing in the world worth looking at right now.</p><p>And for once, Agatha feels wanted. She missed that feeling. She really did.</p><p>Before she can say anything, Harper's hands are on her hips, pushing her gently—but not that gently—against the brick wall behind her. It's cold and rough under her back, but she doesn't complain. Harper leans in and immediately kisses her, and Agatha lets her. Her lips are soft, a little too wet, but still nice, and she doesn't taste like cigarettes like Agatha expected. It's more like beer and maybe cherry lip balm or something. Agatha kisses her back without thinking too hard about it. It's been so much time since she kissed someone, and she must admit, she missed that feeling.</p><p>They make out for a while. Maybe a minute, maybe more, she doesn't keep track. She's drunk, horny, tired, lonely, whatever the fuck this feeling is. And it's fine. It feels fine. Not amazing, not terrible, just fine. She enjoys kissing her, she enjoys her hands pressing against her hips, but she probably won't see her again after this. She never does. One-night stands are just... a one-night thing. No feelings, just release. It doesn't mean anything. Harper doesn't mean anything. She's hot, but they don't even know each other. Well, it's not like they had a deep conversation earlier anyway, it was just some meaningless flirt.</p><p>After a while, Harper's right hand slides under her cardigan, down her waist, tugging at the hem of her dress. And Agatha doesn't stop her. She lets it happen. Lets her lift it up, bunching it around her hips, lets those fingers slip past the waistband of her underwear.</p><p>"Okay?" Harper asks, already out of breath between a messy kiss.</p><p>Without thinking, Agatha responds, "Yes, yes."</p><p>That's all she needed. Harper's fingers immediately gather some wetness, then move to her entrance and she slips two inside with no warning. Agatha lets out a heavy moan at this—half because she didn't expect her to finger so early, and half because of the feeling.</p><p>She can't even remember the last time fingers other than her own touched her there. It's been a while. Harper moves her fingers in and out—not exactly Agatha's favorite thing to do, but it's not like they had the time to talk about it beforehand—and she goes back to kissing her. It's wet and messy, but Agatha lets it happen.</p><p>But then... fuck. What the fuck. She lets her head rest against the brick wall, eyes closed, but what she sees isn't black (or that dark gray color called eigengrau). Instead, she sees a brunette. But not Harper, no, it's someone else. A faceless brunette with an underboob azalea tattoo and long fingers she can't stop thinking about. Long fingers she wished were inside her right now instead of Harper's.</p><p>Fuck. She's thinking about her. Evil Hag. She shouldn't think of her while she's here, being fingered in a dark alley by a stranger. But she does. She thinks of when they met, of the way she makes her laugh, the way she makes her feel important...</p><p>And suddenly, Harper's hand feels wrong.</p><p>What the fuck is she doing? No, no, this is wrong.</p><p>Agatha's eyes snap open and she stiffens, suddenly grabbing the woman's wrist to stop her. "Wait," she breathes out, her voice shaky with her breath catching in her throat. "Stop. I can't."</p><p>Harper freezes and blinks. "What? Did I do something wrong?"</p><p>"No, no. It's not you. You're... it's not that. I just... I'm sorry. I can't."</p><p>"Oh." She sounds a bit disappointed, but she respects her decision and takes her hand away. "I thought you wanted to."</p><p>"I thought I wanted to, too. But... it's complicated. You're very pretty and hot and funny, but it's just..." she sighs, struggling to explain herself.</p><p>Harper smiles a bit. "Okay. I understand. There's someone else, isn't it?"</p><p>She doesn't even think about the question and nods.</p><p>"Okay," Harper pulls away. "Okay. Whatever is going on with that someone else, good luck. You're a nice woman, Agatha."</p><p>"T-Thank you."</p><p>With one last smile, Harper walks away.</p><p>Agatha stays in the alley even after Harper disappears back into the bar, probably to find someone else to flirt with. Which is fine. She doesn't care. She told her to stop, and she did—she's a good person. If she wants to go back inside and find someone else to fuck tonight, then it's fine. Agatha could care less. What just happened meant nothing. It was just a mistake she thought she wanted to make. But she just couldn't.</p><p>With a sigh, she lets her head fall back against the brick wall with a soft thunk, eyes closing for a second. Her thighs are still trembling a little, though she didn't get to come. God, she's so fucking pathetic. She wants to blame her drunk self so bad, but deep down, she knows she meant it. And that's what makes her even more pathetic. She deprived herself of getting laid just because she was thinking of another woman. A woman whose name she doesn't even know. A woman she has never seen before. A woman who's been ghosting her for two days.</p><p>She was so close to letting Harper fuck her against this wall. And she wanted it. Or, at least, she thought she wanted it, until Evil Hag popped into her head and she started imagining it was her kissing her, touching her, instead of that random woman. She imagined her long fingers inside her, pleasuring her, and she almost feels guilty about it. She would, if she wasn't drunk and not thinking straight.</p><p>Isn't it crazy? Wanting someone you don't even know? And fuck, she did want her. Wanted her so much it made her pull away from a real person with a real mouth and real hands just to stand here, alone, shaking from the cold in that dark alley. She's now alone, frustrated and horny because she didn't get to come. She wanted to so bad... but not with her. Not with Harper's fingers.</p><p>Yes. She's fucking pathetic.</p><p>And just like that, as if the universe is sending her a sign, her phone buzzes in her crossbody bag. She looks down in a hurry.</p><p><strong>Wanda 01:18 AM</strong><br/>Just got home. Nicky's already asleep. Have fun xx</p><p>Right. Of course it would be Wanda. She's glad to see she's home safe.</p><p>And then, right before she was about to turn her phone off again, she sees it. New messages from Evil Hag from a few minutes ago—she probably was too busy with Harper to notice it. Fuck.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:10 AM</strong><br/>WARN A GIRL FIRST</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:10 AM</strong><br/>You're literally so fucking hot wtf</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:11 AM</strong><br/>I'm so sorry I've been MIA for the past 2 days.

I wanted to text you yesterday but I fell asleep and I've been busy all day today too. I'll be busy next week as well. I'm so sorry</p><p>She finally responded. And she... finds her hot? Agatha grins at that.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:18 AM</strong><br/>look whos finally answering</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:18 AM</strong><br/>im glad u enjoyed the photo ;) i took it just for u. thought youd like it</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:18 AM</strong><br/>Oh believe me, I did like it. This dress looks amazing on you. And the color... you're gorgeous</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:18 AM</strong><br/>:)</p><p>Her fingers are shaking a little as she types, but not just from the cold anymore. Her pulse is too fast, like she's back in that alley again. Except this time, it's worse. This time, it's <em>her</em>. This woman she's never even touched, but who somehow owns every filthy corner of her brain.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:19 AM</strong><br/>So, are you still with your friends?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:19 AM</strong><br/>im at the bar</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:19 AM</strong><br/>Yeah, I understood that.

And I don't mind the texts, but not when you're drunk. I need to know that it's real and that it's not the alcohol talking. We should continue this discussion once you're sober, alright?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:30 AM</strong><br/>So you're alone right now?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:30 AM</strong><br/>yeah in the alley</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:30 AM</strong><br/>You're alone, drunk, in a dark alley???</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:31 AM</strong><br/>i told u i cant find my friends. then harper came in and we flirted and she offered me a drink then she took me to the alley</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:31 AM</strong><br/>You agreed to this?

Text me when you go home?</p><p>While she waits for a response, she tries to click on Wanda's text to respond... but it disappears before she can, and her finger lands on the call button in her conversation with Evil Hag.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>"Fuck," she mutters to herself, trying hard to click on the arrow button to go back, but it doesn't work. "Fuck, fuck, fuck, no, don't do that."</p><p>Suddenly, she hears a voice. "Hello?"</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>She responded. Fuck. Her voice is soft, as she expected, and laced with surprise.</p><p>"You're here?"</p><p>For a few seconds, Agatha just breathes and stares at the screen, wondering whether she should answer or just hang up. After a moment, she decides to speak. "Uhm, hi," she mutters.</p><p>"You called me," Evil Hag says. "Is everything okay?"</p><p>Agatha drags a hand over her face. It's a good thing she's outside right now, because her entire face and body is burning. "Yeah. I mean. No. I mean... fuck, I didn't mean to call. I was trying to click on my friend's text, but it disappeared before I could and... yeah. I'm sorry if this is against the rules or whatever, it was an accident."</p><p>"You really do sound drunk. You're still outside?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"And alone?" she asks, worried.</p><p>"Yes. I mean, no. Like, I can hear people laughing and I think I can see a girl puking in a trash can."</p><p>"But you're still alone. Where are your friends?"</p><p>She sighs. "I don't know. One had to go home 'cause her kid's sick, and the two others were gone when I got back inside. They probably left."</p><p>Evil Hag lets out a sigh too. "So you're alone. You're drunk, alone in a dark alley. Look, stranger—"</p><p>"<em>Agatha</em>," she interrupts.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Agatha. You can call me Agatha. It's fine if you don't want to give me your name, I know you wanna stay secretive and that's fine. But now you have mine. I want you to know mine."</p><p>There's a short pause before Evil Hag repeats the name in a sweet, slow voice. "Agatha... I like that. Beautiful name for a beautiful girl."</p><p>"Are you hitting on me right now?"</p><p>"Ask me again tomorrow once you're sober." After a few seconds of silence, she continues, "Okay, Agatha, now you're going to listen to me carefully."</p><p>"Okay?" she hums.</p><p>"I need you to order a cab. If you're too drunk to do it yourself, go ask a waiter or someone working at the bar. But do not under any circumstances give your address to a drunk man there, okay?" She actually sounds worried, which makes Agatha smile.</p><p>"I can do that," she responds. "I'm not that drunk, y'know?"</p><p>"You are, and you're going to regret everything you texted me today in the morning."</p><p>"I won't. I meant everything I said. I just would've never said it if I wasn't drunk."</p><p>"Exactly. You're going to regret this. Can you call a cab now? Do you have the app? I'll stay on the phone with you in case you need help."</p><p>"I do," she confirms. "I'm calling one now."</p><p>"Okay. Okay. Don't hang up, okay?"</p><p>"You really think I'm going to hang up after I finally get to hear your voice?" Agatha says with a smirk. "I love your voice. So pretty. So sexy."</p><p>"Agatha," Evil Hag groans, "please call a cab. Now."</p><p>"Yes ma'am."</p><p>Agatha manages to call a cab from one of those apps Wanda made her download, and then she waits. "Cab should be there soon."</p><p>Evil Hag lets out a breath of relief. "Alright. Don't hang up. Please. Keep me on the phone until you get home."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"So I know you're home safe."</p><p>"I'm just a few minutes away by car, I'll be fine. Not that I don't wanna hear your voice."</p><p>"Yeah, and you're a drunk woman, alone in the middle of the night. Anything could happen. I just want to make sure that the cab's driver isn't a creep and will try to take advantage of you, and that you make it home safe. Okay?"</p><p>She doesn't respond just yet. Her head feels like it's gonna explode, and now that the adrenaline's gone, she's freezing.</p><p>Noticing that she isn't responding, Evil Hag calls her again. "Agatha?"</p><p>"Yes. Yes, okay."</p><p>"Good, good. You're still outside?"</p><p>"Huh-huh."</p><p>"What are you wearing?"</p><p>"Oh, baby, I'd love to tell you but you already know that," Agatha smirks, remembering the photo she sent her.</p><p>"Nothing else?"</p><p>"Hmm, I'm wearing purple lace underwear and no bra."</p><p>"Oh my God! Agatha, I'm asking if you're wearing a coat."</p><p>"Oh," she murmurs, almost disappointed. "No. I just have a gray cardigan."</p><p>"Fuck, you're gonna freeze to death."</p><p>She raises an eyebrow. "How do you know that it's cold? You don't know where I live."</p><p>There's a short pause, as if she's thinking about her response, before Evil Hag speaks again. "You told me you're from New Jersey, remember? Please, now go back inside while you wait for the cab to arrive. I don't want you to get sick tomorrow."</p><p>"Think it's a bit too late for that."</p><p>"Please, do what I ask. You're drunk and alone in a dark alley, wearing nothing but that dress and a small cardigan. Go back inside, okay? It's safer for you to be around people right now, and in a warm place."</p><p>Groaning, Agatha agrees. She takes a few steps toward the entrance, stumbling a bit from the alcohol and the uncomfortable wetness between her legs, and she follows Evil Hag's instructions and goes back inside.</p><p>"I'm inside," she informs her. "Now you can stop worrying, <em>mommy</em>."</p><p>Evil Hag's breath catches in her throat. "Oh my God. Shut up. You can't just say that."</p><p>"Why?" Agatha smirks. "Does it turn you on?"</p><p>"I'm so not answering this question," she groans. "So you really have no filter left when you're drunk, huh?"</p><p>"Apparently not. And I hate you for making me go back inside, y'know? It's so fucking gross. It smells like sweat. And there's men. And the music is shit."</p><p>"Yes, but at least you're safe."</p><p>Agatha lets out a dry chuckle. "Safe? Around all these drunk men? We don't have the same definition of safe, sweetheart."</p><p>Evil Hag doesn't say anything about the nickname. Or maybe she's smiling or smirking, who knows. Sighing, she speaks again, "You're safer here, believe me. There's a lot of people, meaning witnesses. If somebody tries anything, someone will see it."</p><p>"Damn, you're really worried about me, aren't you?"</p><p>"Of course I am. You're my friend, aren't you?"</p><p>"<em>Friend</em>," Agatha repeats, shaking her head with a grin. "Sure, we are. I missed you, you know? Two entire days without you. I thought you got bored of me and ghosted me on purpose."</p><p>Evil Hag sighs. "I'm really sorry. Work's been really busy."</p><p>"Right. Work."</p><p>"Hey, don't use this voice with me. I promise it's the truth. I've had a lot of days off recently, but I started working again two days ago and... I thought I'd have enough time to talk to you, but I didn't. I have to wake up really early, then go to sleep really late."</p><p>"What kind of job do you do for working so much, jeez," Agatha scoffs, but it's not a question. She knows the other woman won't respond, and it's fine. Mysterious is their thing. "So, it's... like, 10 p.m. in L.A.?"</p><p>There's another short pause before she responds, "Yeah, yeah. 10 p.m."</p><p>"You're weird, you know that?"</p><p>Evil Hag chuckles. "I know."</p><p>They stay on the phone until the cab arrives.</p><p>"Cab's here," Agatha informs Evil Hag as she steps inside the car. "Wait a minute."</p><p>"To where, miss?" the driver asks her.</p><p>She quickly mutes the call before responding—because, well, mysterious is their thing. "2804 Sherwood Drive."</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Agatha makes sure to put her seatbelt on, and she's surprised to see a new text from Evil Hag, though they're still on the phone.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:52 AM</strong><br/>You don't have to keep talking if you're not comfortable with the driver being here. Just keep me on the call</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:52 AM</strong><br/>okay. youre sweet</p><p>Halfway through the drive, Agatha realizes that she doesn't have any money left. She gave her last bill for her glass of water earlier, and she obviously didn't take her credit card. "Fuck," she mutters.</p><p>"Everything's okay, miss?" the driver asks, because of fucking course he heard.</p><p>"Yes! Yes, no worry."</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:56 AM</strong><br/>help</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:56 AM</strong><br/>What's going on??</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:56 AM</strong><br/>i dont have money. like i spent everything on drinks</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:56 AM</strong><br/>fuck what am i supposed to do??</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:56 AM</strong><br/>Okay, hey, don't panic. Do you have Venmo?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:57 AM</strong><br/>yeah i think i do</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:57 AM</strong><br/>Perfect. Give me your username</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:57</strong><br/>no</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:57 AM</strong><br/>???</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:57 AM</strong><br/>im not lettin u pay for my ride</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:57 AM</strong><br/>I don't mind. And it's not like you have any other option</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:57 AM</strong><br/>Look, my work has a decent salary. I really don't mind paying for you. Give me your username</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 01:57 AM</strong><br/>Please</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 01:58 AM</strong><br/>fuck okay. its @agathahark2018</p><p align="center">
<em>@evilhag paid you $20.00 – cab money</em>
</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 02:00 AM</strong><br/>that much??</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 02:00 AM</strong><br/>Get yourself something to eat tomorrow</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 02:00 AM</strong><br/>im not poor?? im a teacher, remember. i make a descent salary</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 02:00 AM</strong><br/>Too late</p><p>Once the cab stops in front of her house, Agatha transfers him the money (thankfully, he does have Venmo too—she should've asked before). Ten bucks only, meaning she has ten left from Evil Hag.</p><p>"Okay, I'm home," Agatha finally talks back, now that she's alone.</p><p>"Inside?"</p><p>"Not yet. Give me a minute."</p><p>She struggles to find her key, then to put it in the hole, but when she's finally inside, she immediately kicks off her shoes. "I'm inside," she informs the other woman.</p><p>"Okay. Now listen to me. I want you to lock the door and double check that you did."</p><p>"I'm not a kid, Hag," she groans.</p><p>"You're drunk. Lock the fucking door."</p><p>Agatha smirks at the tone. "I like when you give me orders, baby."</p><p>"Good, because I'm not done. Now I want you to go drink a glass of water—room temperature if you have to avoid thermic shock. I also want you to take a pill for the headache you'll soon have. Two pills of Advil. Believe me, you'll thank me later."</p><p>"Fuck, are you always this bossy?"</p><p>"Only with you," she chuckles. "Now do what I asked."</p><p>"Yes, ma'am."</p><p>Agatha does everything Evil Hag asked her to do. She locks the door and double checks that it is, indeed, locked; then she moves to the kitchen and serves herself a tall glass of water. She takes a few sips, then swallows two pills of Advil.</p><p>"Done," she tells her on the phone, taking another few sips of water to hydrate her throat. "What else now?"</p><p>"<em>Good girl</em>," Evil Hag praises her, and fuck, it does something to Agatha. "Now I want you to go to your bedroom. Don't shower or brush your teeth, you're too drunk for that. If you can, change into your pyjamas, and if you can't, just undress and sleep naked or in your underwear if you prefer."</p><p>"So you want me to get naked, huh? Kinky."</p><p>"To sleep, Agatha, to sleep. You're lucky there's a big chance you won't remember what happened tomorrow."</p><p>"I was just kidding! Oh my God, you're not fun."</p><p>"I am fun. Just not when you're drunk."</p><p>"You care about me," Agatha teases as she walks up the stairs towards her bedroom. "That's cute."</p><p>"We already talked about it. I <em>do</em> care about you, Agatha."</p><p>In her room, Agatha removes her cardigan and dress, tossing them on the floor with the outfit she tried on earlier, and she quickly changes into a Fleetwood Mac tee and a pair of shorts—the first thing she found in her drawer. Then, she slips under the blankets and puts her phone back against her ear.</p><p>"I'm in bed now," she tells Evil Hag in a sleepy voice.</p><p>"Perfect. I'm going to hang up now, okay? You need to sleep."</p><p>"Hmm," she mumbles, already half asleep.</p><p>"I see you're already drifting off. I'll hang up now. Put your phone on your bedside table so you don't accidentally crush it during the night. Goodnight, Agatha. It was a pleasure to finally hear your voice."</p><p>But Agatha doesn't hear this. She doesn't respond, now asleep.</p><p>"I hope I'll be able to tell you the truth soon," Evil Hag continues anyway, sighing. "I enjoy talking to you. A little bit too much, if you ask my friends. And Lilia... fuck, she was really mad to know I'm sharing so much with a stranger. But it doesn't matter. I know you're asleep, and that's why I'm telling you all this. Because I know you're not listening. Or maybe you are, who knows. I promise that one day, there will be no secret left between us. You're one of my closest friends and I'm always looking forward to a new text. Anyways... sleep well. I hope you won't be too hungover tomorrow."</p><p>And then, she hangs up.</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Finally the voice reveal and name for Agatha 🫡</p><p>If you follow me on Twitter and saw my little mental breakdown, no you didn't 🤓 Also you might have noticed that the tag "regular updates" is gone. Don't worry—I will try to update at least once a week but I preferred to remove it just in case I can't keep the promise of updating regularly. I'm gonna be honest with you, I have an disorder called ARFID. It's considered as an eating disorder. I've had this for almost a year after a stupid accident involving food that really traumatized me, apparently, so now I'm having big difficulties eating, especially when I'm somewhere else than my home. I can never tell when it's gonna go bad, and when it does like the past 2 days, I just lay down in bed all day because I feel like shit and can't do anything as I feel sick, even if it's just in my head. This is really affecting my everyday life, including when I can write. So I might not always be able to write/give regular updates because of this. I wanted to let you know 🫶🏻 I'll probably go to therapy soon to fix this too</p><p>Anyways, I hope you liked this long 10k chapter. Next one might take some time to be posted because I need to think about what to write :)</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha wakes up with a headache, and she can't help but groan as she tries to open her eyes, only to shut them again immediately.</p><p>Of fucking course. It's been raining for days, and today's the one day the sun decides to show up, just when she feels like she's been run over by a bus and forgot to close the blinds before going to sleep. I mean, it's no surprise she didn't close the blinds. She's pretty sure she fell asleep immediately after getting home.</p><p><em>Home.</em> How the fuck did she even get home from the bar?</p><p>Everything's so foggy right now. She has no clue how the hell she got to bed last night. No memory of changing into her Fleetwood Mac tee, or why she fell asleep with her phone in hand. She remembers what happened at the bar—this, she remembers very well. Agatha remembers the karaoke, and... the girl. What was her name, yet? Avery? Aline? Harper. Yes, definitely Harper. She remembers Wanda going home, then Jen and Alice being gone when she got back inside. And then... Harper. She sat down and flirted, and Agatha let her. She even remembers flirting back, because why the hell not? She was drunk, alone and sexually frustrated.</p><p>She has no idea for how long they flirted, but after they did, they went to the alley behind the bar. Barely lit, calm, smelly. Everything's still foggy in her head, but Agatha remembers very well what happened in this alley. How they made out against the brick wall, how Harper started fingering her and, fuck, being touched by another woman after all this time felt so good.</p><p>But then... that's where it gets complicated. She pushed her away, she's certain of that. Because... oh. Right. Because Evil Hag popped up in her head, and she felt like she was cheating, which is ironic because they're nothing. They're not together—hell, they don't even know who the other is—they're just friends. Close online friends. But after Harper left Agatha alone in the alley, the older woman has trouble remembering what happened, especially how she ended up in bed.</p><p>Sighing, she lies there for a second, completely still. Her mouth tastes gross and her eyes are burning and everything in her skull feels too loud, even the silence.</p><p>It's been a while since she got drunk, or even drank more than three glasses of wine, and she forgot how unpleasant the aftermath was. She missed having girls' nights out, but the hangover? Nope. She did not miss that. Thank God Nicky's still at the Maximoffs', because there's no way she'd be able to take care of him right now. She doesn't want him to see her like this either, all hungover with makeup all over her face and pillow, still smelling like alcohol and sweat because, apparently, she didn't shower before bed.</p><p>After a few seconds of staring at the inside of her eyelids and debating if she should just go back to sleep and hope the world resets, Agatha sighs and forces herself upright. Her stomach flips the second she moves. Not enough to puke, thankfully, but enough to remind her how much she drank and that she won't do it again any time soon.</p><p>She slowly blinks her eyes open again, squinting hard against the bright sun, then drags a hand through her tangled hair, trying hard to piece together the end of the night.</p><p>She tries. But nothing. After Harper left, it's like a black hole. No memory. The only thing she remembers is... wait. She texted Evil Hag, didn't she?</p><p>Agatha hurries to grab her phone (it's a miracle she didn't crush it in her sleep) and opens her conversation with the other woman, only to find a new text from her already waiting.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 09:25 AM</strong><br/>Good morning. I hope your headache isn't that bad... and that you remember what happened yesterday</p><p>Agatha stares at it for a second. What happened yesterday... so she knows? Wait... oh, fuck.</p><p>And then her whole body goes cold.</p><p>The messages.</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>She scrolls and scrolls and scrolls until the very start of last night's conversation... and fuck. What the avtual fuck. Did she really write this? It's even worse than what she expected.</p><p>
<em>i havent stop thinking about ur hands since. like cmon how tf are your fingers so fucking long... i bet they can reach the cervix</em>
</p><p>Oh. My. God. She remembered that she was all horny and frustrated because she pushed Harper away before she had the time to come... but horny to the point where she sent <em>sexts</em> to Evil Hag? Holy shit. All Agatha wants to do right now is hide under a blanket and never go out. She feels so ashamed of herself, ashamed of the way she acted.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:06 AM</strong><br/>Okay, wow. I'm so sorry about last night. I was very drunk and clearly had no filter... I'm so sorry if I made you uncomfortable, and I'd understand if you don't want to talk to me ever again</p><p>She hits send, then groans and buries her face in her hands.</p><p>Fuck. She fucked it up. She definitely fucked it up.</p><p>Surprisingly, her phone buzzes a minute later.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:07 AM</strong><br/>You didn't make me uncomfortable. Surprised for sure, but not uncomfortable. I promise, it's okay. You were drunk. I'm not mad</p><p>Agatha peeks out from behind her fingers.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:07 AM</strong><br/>If anything, it was... very flattering :) I didn't know a single photo of my hand would make you spiral like you did, tho</p><p>She blinks.</p><p>Wait, what?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:08 AM</strong><br/>That's so fucking embarrassing. I'm sorry</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:08 AM</strong><br/>Don't be. It was fun</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:08 AM</strong><br/>Do you regret it? Saying all these stuff</p><p>Does she regret it? Part of her does, because it was so fucking embarrassing. But another part...</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:08 AM</strong><br/>What if I say no? That I don't regret it</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:08 AM</strong><br/>Do you?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:08 AM</strong><br/>I don't. As I said, it was pretty fun</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:09 AM</strong><br/>Oh. Okay, good, that's good</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:09 AM</strong><br/>I also wanted to thank you. I reread the texts and you were a perfect gentleman with me</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:09 AM</strong><br/>No need to thank me</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:09 AM</strong><br/>No but really. Many people wouldn't have done that. I told you so much things... and you just told me that I was drunk and would regret it in the morning. Which I really don't. But I appreciate you not taking advantage of the fact that I was drunk</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:09 AM</strong><br/>I wouldn't have done that. It was fun, but not drunk</p><p>Feeling bold, Agatha's lips turn into a grin as she types back.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:10 AM</strong><br/>So not drunk, you'd find it fun?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:10 AM</strong><br/>Maybe</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:10 AM</strong><br/>You know, I'm really happy to know how much you like my hands</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:10 AM</strong><br/>Fuck don't remind me that. That was so embarrassing...</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:10 AM</strong><br/>I told you. It's fine</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:10 AM</strong><br/>And you're very hot ;) Green definitely fits you</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:10 AM</strong><br/>Yeah?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:10 AM</strong><br/>Yeah</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:11 AM</strong><br/>How's your head?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:11 AM</strong><br/>It hurts. I haven't got drunk in a while</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:11 AM</strong><br/>Poor Agatha</p><p>Wait. That's her name. What the fuck.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:11 AM</strong><br/>How do you know my name?? Are you a stalker or something?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:11 AM</strong><br/>Ah. So you really don't remember that, huh?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:11 AM</strong><br/>You accidentally called me. And you told me your name. I didn't tell you mine. Then we stayed on the phone until you got home, and you fell asleep before hanging up</p><p>Oh. Fucking hell, are you serious? She finally had the chance to hear her voice and she doesn't even remember? Rude, man. Very fucking rude. Now that she's thinking about it, she does remember taking a cab home, but she didn't remember the call. That part of the night is still very foggy—between the alcohol and the tiredness, no wonder she forgot.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:12 AM</strong><br/>I'm sorry. I kinda forgot that part...</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:12 AM</strong><br/>I didn't expect you to remember, honestly. You were pretty drunk and tired</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:12 AM</strong><br/>I know. I never do this, y'know? I'm not an alcoholic, I swear</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:12 AM</strong><br/>I never thought you were</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:12 AM</strong><br/>Is Nicky with you?</p><p>The worry is quickly replaced by warmth. The fact that this woman doesn't even know her, yet she asks about her son as if they were longtime friends. That's sweet</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:13 AM</strong><br/>Not here. He had a sleepover at my friend's house. Tonight's our usual Saturday game night so he's staying until then</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:13 AM</strong><br/>That's great. So you can be hungover in peace :3</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:13 AM</strong><br/>Don't laugh at me. It hurts</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:13 AM</strong><br/>Sorry, sorry, I'm not laughing</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:13 AM</strong><br/>Drink a lot of water and try to eat something light if you can, like crackers or a fruit. And if it's too bad you can take another Advil. It should help. You can also take a cold shower, it'll help</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:14 AM</strong><br/>How on earth do you know so much? Do you drink often?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:14 AM</strong><br/>Not me. I never get drunk, alcohol isn't my thing. But my friend loves to party, so let's say I had to deal with her a few times in the past</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:14 AM</strong><br/>I'm sure there's better clubs in L.A than here at least. The town's only lesbian bar was closed so we had to go to a straight one. It was awful. I hate men</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:14 AM</strong><br/>Hmm yeah. L.A does have pretty nice gay bars. I'm sorry you had to be around men for so long, must've been awful</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:15 AM</strong><br/>It was. So gross. I don't understand what girls see in men... I'm so glad I'm a lesbian</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:15 AM</strong><br/>I'm glad too ;)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:15 AM</strong><br/>That you're a lesbian? Or that I am a lesbian?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:15 AM</strong><br/>What if I say both?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:15 AM</strong><br/>Seriously, what were the odds that the wrong number I texted is a hot lesbian woman? Crazy. It could've been anyone. A man, or a straight girl, or a grandma, who knows</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:15 AM</strong><br/>It's at least the third time that you call me hot</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:15 AM</strong><br/>What?? You are. Especially in that dress</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:15 AM</strong><br/>You're the one to talk. YOU are hot</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:15 AM</strong><br/>How's the tattoo, by the way?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:15 AM</strong><br/>It's healing. It was itchy the first week and I couldn't even wear a bra to avoid friction. I mean I rarely wear a bra so I didn't really care tbh</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, trying hard not to imagine that woman braless in a white top with her tits showing through...</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:15 AM</strong><br/>The colors are also better. It's not fully healed yet as it's a sensitive area but we're almost there</p><p>That's one of the reasons why Agatha doesn't want to get a tattoo. The needle, plus the healing... not her thing. Maybe she'll get one one day, a small triple goddess one on her wrist or ankle, but nothing big. She finds it pretty on others (women, always), but she can't imagine having a tattoo covering her whole arm or leg on herself. It wouldn't fit her, and she already knows that she wouldn't be able to handle the pain.</p><p>Evil Hag sends another message, but to the teacher's surprise, it's not a text. It's a photo.</p><p>
<em>Fuck fuck fuck.</em>
</p><p>It's a selfie of her torso. Evil Hag is laying on what seems to be a white blanket—her bed, most likely—and her white top is rolled over her breasts, covering the nipples, and a part of her healed tattoo is visible. The colors do look better. So does the woman. Agatha almost gasps at it. Almost.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:17 AM</strong><br/>Fuck</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:17 AM</strong><br/>Warn a girl first</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:17 AM</strong><br/>Hey, that's my line</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:17 AM</strong><br/>Do you like it? :)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:17 AM</strong><br/>Well, you're hot. And the tattoo is pretty</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:17 AM</strong><br/>Glad to know I'm hot</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:17 AM</strong><br/>You already knew that. I'm sure I'm not the only one telling you this</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:17 AM</strong><br/>No. But you're the only one whose opinion matters</p><p>Oh.</p><p>
<em>Oh?</em>
</p><p>Agatha doesn't know how to feel about that. Yesterday, they got closer. The texts, the call she can't even remember, and now this. What the hell is she doing? She's a thirty-seven-year-old history teacher, a mother of a seven-year-old, and there she is, flirting with her online friend like some horny teenager. That might actually be what she is. Teen, no; horny, yes.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:18 AM</strong><br/>Why?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:18 AM</strong><br/>I like you. You're funny. I enjoy talking to you. You make me smile. And you're nice</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:18 AM</strong><br/>Don't you have friends in L.A? Or, I don't know, a love interest?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:18 AM</strong><br/>I have one best friend. And my co-workers. But I can't really say we're friends. We just work together. And no, no love interest</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:18 AM</strong><br/>Why? L.A is big. I'm sure there's a lot of hot women here</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:18 AM</strong><br/>It's too complicated</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:18 AM</strong><br/>Speaking of work, I have to go. Will be busy all week, so don't be surprise if I don't answer. I'll try to, but I can't promise anything</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:19 AM</strong><br/>Mysterious work again...</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:19 AM</strong><br/>Do you ever sleep? Or eat? Or just rest?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:19 AM</strong><br/>These past few days have been busy. Hella busy, that's why I couldn't respond earlier</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 11:19 AM</strong><br/>Well, good luck with whatever you're doing</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 11:19 AM</strong><br/>Thanks :) Have fun at your game night, and good luck with your hangover</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>Agatha spends the whole morning—or well, what's left of it—curled up on the couch, barely functioning.</p><p>After texting Evil Hag goodbye, she drags herself to the bathroom and takes a cold shower like she suggested. It helps a little. Her headache's still there, but at least she doesn't feel like puking anymore. She swallows an Advil pill, wraps herself in her favorite floral robe and spends the next two hours watching a random show with the volume way too low and her face buried in a throw pillow, almost falling asleep.</p><p>For lunch, she forces herself to eat a little. Just a small sandwich with whatever she finds in the fridge—two slices of ham, half a tomato she doesn't even remember buying and the last slice of cheese that isn't moldy. She doesn't have the energy for more. Even if she doesn't feel like puking anymore, she still feels like shit, and the simple thought of eating more makes her stomach churn.</p><p>By the afternoon, she's upright enough to do some basic house cleaning. She vacums the sandwich crumbs she left on the floor, wipes the counters, folds a pile of laundry that's been sitting in the corner of her bedroom for five days that she completely forgot about. None of it makes her feel better, but at least the place looks cleaner, and that's something.</p><p>And by the time she has to leave for the Maximoffs' house for their usual Saturday game night, she doesn't even bother changing. Her purple Juicy Couture tracksuit pants are, well, technically <em>tracksuit</em> pants, not <em>pajamas</em>, so she tells herself it's fine. Comfy is the only thing she gives a shit about right now. She throws on a white tee she finds at the bottom of her closet, then zips up the matching jacket. She doesn't even bother with her hair, just lets it down.</p><p>"You look like shit," Wanda opens the door with a grin.</p><p>Agatha walks in and lets out a long sigh. "Thanks. I'm hungover as shit."</p><p>"Could've guessed that." Wanda shuts the door behind her. "You came home late."</p><p>"You didn't even worry when I didn't text you that I was home," she scoffs.</p><p>"Because I saw you entering your house completely drunk. What even happened?"</p><p>"Long story."</p><p>"Skip to the important parts, then," Wanda insists.</p><p>"Ugh, I hate you. When I came back inside the bar, Jen and Alice were gone. I think they thought I left with you, so I was alone. Then a girl sat with me, flirted, then we ended up making out in the alley. She fingered me, then I pushed her away, then I called a cab and went home. Here, the important parts."</p><p>The redhead's eyes widen in shock. "You did what—"</p><p>"<em>No</em>," Agatha cuts her off. "Shut up. No questions. I don't want to talk about it."</p><p>"Okay, but I'm gonna need the full story later. You can't just drop this and not tell me more."</p><p>"There's literally nothing more to tell. We almost fucked, I pushed her away, went home and slept. That's it. And before you ask, no, we're not planning on seeing each other again. It was just a... a almost one-night stand."</p><p>Before Wanda can ask another question, the loud thump of footsteps comes from the hallway. "Mama!" Nicky appears around the corner a second later, his hair still messy from playtime, and before she can say anything, he's launching himself into his mother's arms. She barely has time to open them.</p><p>"Hey, baby," she murmurs, hugging him tight.</p><p>God, she missed him. It's been only a day, but it always feels too long. And when she's not feeling good like right now, she loves having him close and taking care of him. It really helps get her mind off everything.</p><p>"I missed you," he mumbles against her chest, holding on like she's been gone a week and not a day. He's always been clingy, but she doesn't mind. Quite the opposite.</p><p>"I missed you too," she says, brushing his hair back after kissing his forehead. "Did you have fun?"</p><p>Nicky proceeds to tell her everything they did last night and today, then grabs Agatha's hand and pulls her toward the living room where Billy and Tommy are sitting with a stack of board games. He's already chattering again, telling her which ones they've played and which one they're playing next, and Agatha lets herself just sit down and breathe for a second while they all sort through the pieces of Monopoly.</p><p>Oh, this is going to be a long one. Good thing she's great at this game.</p><p>After about an hour, they decide to take a break. Agatha follows Wanda into the kitchen, where she pours herself another glass of water (no wine today, she's already hungover enough), and leans against the counter. The kids are with Vision, telling him what they want to eat so he can order.</p><p>"Hey, look what I just saw," Wanda says, holding her phone out.</p><p>Agatha takes it without thinking. The screen shows a post from an Instagram account of a bookstore, in collaboration with one named @vidaderio, with a blue check next to the username. The post is about a book tour, with dates and locations across the United States.</p><p>"Rio Vidal's having a book tour," Wanda tells her. "She's in New Orleans right now. Then there's a few more dates, and the last two days are in New York. It's a weekend event. Two entire days where kids can have their books signed, meet the author... she'll even read parts of the book out loud. We absolutely should go. Nicky would be over the moon."</p><p>Oh. A book tour? Of the one and only author of <em>The Legend of the Christmas Witch</em>? Wanda's right: Nicky would be over the moon. But this needs some planning. It's definitely not going to be a small event.</p><p>Wanda takes her phone back and clicks on Rio's profile. Then she opens one of her recent posts.</p><p>It's a photo of Rio standing outside some building with another girl next to her, probably a friend or assistant or something. She's wearing tight black jeans and a white cropped top that reveals the skin of her stomach. Her dark brown hair is loose over her shoulders, and she's smiling at the camera. Even from the distance, Agatha notices the gap between her front teeth, and she has to admit that it's cute.</p><p>"She's hot, right?" Wanda says with a smirk, fully aware of what's going on inside her best friend's head.</p><p>Does she find her hot? Yes. Oh, yes. Not only hot, but also pretty. She's gorgeous and really does look like a good person, not the bitchy celebrity kind. "She's alright," Agatha clears her throat.</p><p>Wanda snorts. "Liar. Seriously though, New York's just an hour away. Nicky would lose his mind if he met her. You know that."</p><p>Agatha hesitates.</p><p>She knows Wanda's right. Nicky would absolutely lose his mind. This is the author of his favorite series, the woman behind the books he keeps re-reading over and over again. But it's still a lot. It's a big city, in a big bookstore that will probably be packed. Agatha can already imagine how annoying it'll be to drive there and, most importantly, find somewhere to park. New York's already hell to park in, but with a huge event like this? Forget it. She doesn't even know if she needs tickets. She can't just decide to go on a whim.</p><p>"I'll think about it," she finally responds, sighing.</p><p>Then they head back to the living room to continue their game of Monopoly, everyone unaware of the fact that Agatha steals money from the bank when no one's looking.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha and Nicky are, in fact, going to New York for the weekend. She booked a hotel room for the night so they don't have to drive an hour both days (because yes, Nicky insisted on going both days, and his amazing, perfect mother just couldn't say no to this—meeting his favorite author for the first time, and twice? That's a one time opportunity they just couldn't miss).</p><p>She's finishing drinking coffee at the dining table, fighting hard against her eyes closing themselves. Today, she woke up at six in the morning, took a quick cold shower to help her wake up (it didn't work, which is not surprising considering she slept less than five hours), and she made herself a big cup of coffee, hoping it will help.</p><p>Nicky is still asleep because, unlike her, he doesn't need to prepare anything. His bag is ready, posed on the floor next to his bed, packed with a change of clothes and his Christmas Witch book that he's gonna bring to have Rio Vidal sign it. Agatha, however, isn't ready. Not mentally, at least. There's a reason she decided to live in a small town lost in the middle of New Jersey, and it's not the lack of money. She just hates big cities. They're loud, crowded, impossible to park in and so not her vibe. Which is why going to New York is stressing her out.</p><p>The hotel she booked is walking distance from the bookstore, a four-star thing she found online for three hundred and seventy bucks a night. Kind of expensive, yeah, but considering the location, it could've been worse. And the fact that there's a restaurant in the lobby is a bonus. She's not planning on wandering the streets of Manhattan alone with her kid at night. While they are in a usually safe area, Agatha doesn't want to risk it. She's used to her peaceful small town where nothing ever happens, not this big place full of pickpockets and drug dealers at every corner of the street.</p><p>Her own bag is almost done, stuffed with a change of clothes for tomorrow, snacks, and her favorite lilac water bottle. She still has a few last-minute things to do before leaving though, like their toothbrushes and hairbrush. She needs to get gas, set up the GPS (because knowing her, she'd get lost without it), and it's not even the worst. The worst part will be to park in New York. She's already dreading it.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:45 AM</strong><br/>20250308_004836.jpg</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:45 AM</strong><br/>Agatha, meet Victoria :3</p><p>Agatha looks down at her phone, now suddenly a little more awake.</p><p>It's been a week since the bar accident, if we can call it that. And to the contrary of what she expected, nothing changed between them, besides maybe the fact that they seem to flirt more, or whatever you'd call what they have. They still talk about everything and anything, from plants to dinosaurs to movies and books.</p><p>The teacher, still, is always looking forward to a new text from her mysterious woman whom she still doesn't know the name of. And it's fine, really. They've been talking for three weeks, though Evil Hag has been busy these past few days, as Agatha expected. She still wonders what her mysterious job is. And honestly, she has no clue. Her schedule makes no sense. Sometimes, she texts her during the day as if she's just at home resting instead of working, and sometimes she's unavailable until late, or even the next day. It's so weird. But weird is their thing, and she's not complaining. Talking to her is amazing. Agatha laughs—really laughs—for once. She just hopes that one day, she'll know who she really is.</p><p>Clicking on the message, the teacher gasps at the photo Evil Hag sent her. She expected another mirror pic, or maybe a new selfie of her torso—sorry, her tattoo—but no. Far from it. And suddenly, her tired eyes widen in pure disgust.</p><p>A tarantula. A giant black tarantula wearing a fucking pink ribbon on her back.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:46 AM</strong><br/>EW</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:46 AM</strong><br/>What the fuck is that thing?? Do you want me to have a heart attack?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:46 AM</strong><br/>Excuse you. Her name is Victoria and she's a lady</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:47 AM</strong><br/>No, that's a hairy demon</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:47 AM</strong><br/>Hey, be nice to my baby</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:47 AM</strong><br/>That's so not a baby...</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:47 AM</strong><br/>She's MY baby</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:47 AM</strong><br/>Don't you like cats? Or dogs? Or rabbits? Or anything else than this</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:48 AM</strong><br/>I do like dogs. But I just can't have one right now, it's too much responsibility</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:48 AM</strong><br/>What are you doing up at this hour? It's like 3 a.m. in L.A</p><p>She takes a sip of her coffee, waiting for a response that never comes.</p><p>It's late. Maybe she just went to sleep...</p><p>Once the mug is empty, she rinses it in the sink and starts making breakfast. They have a long day ahead and she's not letting Nicky leave the house with just sugar cereal in his system. They both need energy, and most importantly, real homemade food.</p><p>"Morning, Ma," Nicky greets when he enters the dining room later that morning, rubbing his eyes, still dressed in his dinosaur pajamas. "What are you making?"</p><p>Agatha smiles. "Morning. I'm making pancakes. Are you excited for this weekend?"</p><p>Immediately, his eyes light up as he sits down on one of the kitchen stools. "Yes! I can't wait to meet Rio. She's very pretty. And I'm sure she's very nice."</p><p>Oh, Agatha can't deny it. Rio, indeed, is very pretty, that's a fact. She has to admit that after Wanda showed her that one picture last Saturday, she got curious and decided to search a few more photos of her. The ones she found on Google were mostly from big events, but she managed to find a few, simpler ones, including some where she doesn't have makeup on. And <em>woah</em>. She clearly doesn't need makeup to be beautiful. She's so natural and really, really looks like a nice person. She just hopes that she is, and that Nicky won't be disappointed.</p><p>"When are we leaving?" the seven-year-old asks as his mother puts a plate with two pancakes and maple syrup in front of him.</p><p>"When we're ready. Not too late to avoid the traffic, and I need to go get some gas before taking the road."</p><p>"I can't wait! Do you think we'll have time to go to the Museum of Natural History? They have real dinosaur skeletons, Mama!"</p><p>Agatha shakes her head with a little sigh. "I doubt it, honey. We're only staying two days."</p><p>"But the book thing is at four p.m! We'll have all mornings free."</p><p>Why is her son so smart? She hates to admit it, but he's right. The event starts at four p.m, meaning they'll have all the morning and part of the afternoon to visit the surroundings. She'll have to check on Google Maps if their hotel is far from the museum. While spending over an hour looking at fossils of dead animals (to Agatha, they just looks like rocks) isn't her favorite thing to do, she knows Nicky would love it. This plus meeting Rio... she'd have the award of the best mom of the year.</p><p>"We'll see about it," she responds to Nicky as she serves herself a plate of pancakes.</p><p>They leave for the Big Apple at nine. Unfortunately, Wanda couldn't come, but on the other hand, this gives her a nice mother-son weekend. Agatha just hopes it won't be too hard to manage. Nicky is an amazing kid, don't get her wrong, but he's still a kid. Sometimes, he can get excited to the point that Agatha is overwhelmed. When it happens, Wanda just proposes to babysit him for a few hours so her best friend can get some rest in a calm house. The redhead is more used to it—with her twins that always fight and yell and run everywhere, she knows how to handle it.</p><p>"How long till we get there?" Nicky asks after they get some gas.</p><p>"About an hour if the traffic's clear. You can take a nap if you want."</p><p>"Can we put some music on?"</p><p>Agatha shrugs, then turns the radio on. As every morning, they're talking about the weather and some useless, unimportant news, so the teacher switches frequencies until there's an interesting song. She finds one by Duran Duran, but she doesn't have time to read the title. Her eyes are focused on the road, and thankfully, the traffic is clear, at least for now.</p><p>
<em>Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Just like the river twisting through a dusty land.</em>
</p><p>Nicky lets out a giggle at the lyrics. "Mama! You heard that? Rio!"</p><p>
<em>And when she shines, she really shows you all she can.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Oh Rio, Rio, dance across the Rio Grande.</em>
</p><p>Agatha snorts at it and decides to let the song play. It's funny, isn't it? As if the universe is sending her a sign.</p><p>Yes, universe, they're gonna meet Rio today, no need to remind them.</p><p>They arrive at the hotel over one and a half hours later. The road from New Jersey to New York was alright, but once they entered the city... that's another story. So much traffic, plus a wrong turn and the fact that Agatha struggled to find the hotel. But now they're here. Finally parked, ready for the day.</p><p>"Woah," Nicky mutters, looking around at the tall buildings. "They're huge."</p><p>Then they enter the hotel for the check-in. It's usually in the afternoon, around four p.m, but Agatha paid extra for early check-in because there's no way she's leaving her bags in the car (not with all the creeps around here) and there's even less of a chance she's hauling them around the city. She might be adventurous enough to bring her kid to a book signing in a big, unknown city, but she's not insane.</p><p>Their room is pretty simple, but really nice. Two single beds with white sheets, two bedside tables, a mini-fridge, a desk, a bathroom and an amazing view over the city.</p><p>Nicky immediately runs to press his face to the glass. "Woah, we're so high up!"</p><p>Agatha doesn't answer. She just lets herself fall backward onto one of the beds with a long sigh. Her entire body aches from the drive, and the lack of sleep doesn't help.</p><p>"Mama, can we go now?"</p><p>She groans into the pillow before turning her head to look at him. "The book signing isn't for another three hours."</p><p>"But it's noon, Mama, I'm hungry."</p><p>Right. She has a child to feed. Goodbye, nap.</p><p>The woman sits down on the comfortable mattress, sighing. "You're right. There's a restaurant in the lobby—"</p><p>"Can we get hot dogs?"</p><p>"Hot dogs?" she raises an eyebrow. "Nicky, that's not very healthy."</p><p>"Well, we're not healthy."</p><p>"Hm, good point. Hot dogs from Central Park?"</p><p>"Yes! Can we feed the ducks?"</p><p>"If you want, hon."</p><p>Thankfully, Central Park is just a ten-minute walk away. They find one of those hot dog stands with the big yellow and blue umbrellas and a guy who doesn't say much but makes the best damn hot dogs Agatha's had in years. She gets two—one for Nicky, one for herself—and they eat them while walking slowly along one of the park paths.</p><p>Nicky talks the whole time, mouth full of ketchup and mustard. He talks about Rio, about how excited he is to see her and even ask her questions about the book if he can. He brings up the museum again, begging for his mother to go tomorrow morning (she just can't say no to him, especially about one of his biggest passions, so she said yes). Then they make it to the lake, where a few ducks are floating around near the edge.</p><p>Nicky runs ahead to sit on a bench and pulls off a piece of leftover bread from the hot dog bun where there wasn't any sauce or sausage left, then starts tossing little crumbs into the water. One of the ducks swims over immediately, making him smile.</p><p>Agatha watches him for a second, standing there with her half-eaten hot dog in hand. Unlike him, she prefers to eat slowly, especially since they walked at the same time. It was pricey but oh, so good. Now she understands why the characters of these 2000s rom-coms always eat hot dogs at Central Park.</p><p>New York is a big change of scenery. The whole thing reminds her why she doesn't live in a big city. It's just so loud. Cars honking non-stop, sirens every ten minutes, people everywhere. Tourists with fanny packs and knockoff handbags, street vendors selling tiny plastic Statues of Liberty and those ugly "I ♡ NY" shirts that no real New Yorker would ever wear that were probably made in China anyways. It's overstimulating. But also kind of beautiful, in a weird way. Central Park is just so pretty, with the view on the buildings.</p><p>Still, that's when she realizes how happy she is in her small town. It can get boring sometimes, but she just can't imagine living in a big city with noises twenty-four/seven and being scared of pickpockets and other psychos.</p><p>Agatha takes a few pictures of Nicky feeding the ducks and sends them to Wanda, along with a little caption: <em>He's already in heaven.</em> Then she opens her conversation with Evil Hag and scrolls for a second.</p><p>Still nothing. It's ten in the morning in Los Angeles, she should be up by now. But she did say she'd be busy today, just like she's been the last few days, so Agatha doesn't let herself overthink it once again. She's probably working. Or sleeping in, who knows. It doesn't look like she had rest in a week—that poor woman definitely needs it.</p><p>They spend another hour or so walking through Central Park. It's so fucking huge. Nicky insists on getting ice cream, so they stop at a little cart—chocolate for him, vanilla for Agatha—and sit on a bench to eat them in the shade. They watch a guy play the saxophone near a fountain and Nicky gives him a dollar bill from his pocket. Then, when his cone is half-melted down his wrist, they finally decide to head back to the hotel to get ready.</p><p>As soon as they get to the room, Agatha goes straight to the bathroom and splashes her face with cold water to feel more awake. She's exhausted. And she already knows she'll need every bit of patience and energy she has to handle the bookstore event. She's already stressed. It's going to be packed; probably loud, probably full of kids crying or screaming. And what if Nicky gets lost in the crowd? What if that Rio Vidal girl is actually a bitch and Nicky will be disappointed and sad? Anything can happen, and that's what scares her.</p><p>"Let's go, Mama, we're going to be late!" Nicky says from the bedroom, more than excited.</p><p>The teacher looks down at her phone. They have over thirty minutes left before the event starts, they've got time. "Not so fast. Come brush your teeth and wash your hands."</p><p>"But—"</p><p>"No buts. Do you know how many disgusting things you touched today? You sat on a public bench. You touched a duck. You touched souvenirs hundreds of hands touched before you. All of this is full of germs. Wash your hands or we're <em>not</em> going to the bookstore."</p><p>The last thing she needs right now is for Nicky to get sick. He touched everything: one of the ducks, the bench, some souvenirs many people touched as well. This city is a nest of bacteria.</p><p>After hearing this, Nicky rushes to the bathroom to brush his teeth and wash his hands, while his mother returns to the bedroom. Agatha lets out a small sigh and starts getting the last few things ready. She tucks Nicky's book into her handbag, adds two bottles of water, some crackers in case he gets hungry, and checks to make sure her phone's charged. 69 percent—how ironic—this will do.</p><p>When they finally arrive at the bookstore, it is, indeed, crowded. It's not open yet so people are waiting outside, parents with their kids. Agatha makes sure to hold Nicky's hand and keep him close to her.</p><p>Once inside, after over twenty minutes of waiting, Nicky gasps. The bookstore is huge, way bigger than the ones they have in Westview, which is not surprising considering how small the town is. There are two floors, with metal railings on the second one that let you look down over the main area, and the whole place is full of books. I mean, of course, it's a bookstore. But Agatha has never seen this many books in the same place.</p><p>The closest thing to this they have in Westview is the town's library where everyone can borrow, but the books are not interesting. Mainly old dusty stuff, books about religion or sciences or anything else kids borrow for school. Nothing interesting. And the other stores, where they actually sell the books, are all small. They mainly sell the new releases and forget about the more ancient books, which is why Agatha often has to order online.</p><p>The event is being held on the ground floor, where they've cleared space near the center, moved all the display tables to the sides, and set up a bunch of folding chairs in uneven rows. There's a little stage at the front with two chairs next to two small tables. Both have a bottle of water, and the one on the left has a copy of the Christmas Witch book and a mic.</p><p>The place is very well decorated for the kids. There are cardboard cutouts of the Christmas Witch everywhere, some with holes instead of the faces to take photos; there's also a long table off to the side already stacked with copies of Rio's books, and what seem to be coloring books. Whoever was in charge of this nailed it.</p><p>The whole place is already packed. Most of the chairs are taken, as Agatha and Nicky weren't the first in the line, and some kids are sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of the stage. Some are even in little costumes: a few with elf ears, one girl with a sparkly cloak that's definitely homemade, and some kid in a Santa onesie. Employees are handing out tiny candy canes, paper bookmarks the teacher recognizes as the covers of the first and second book, and the planning of the day.</p><p>Agatha takes a bookmark for Nicky and a planning. The first thing is a public reading of a few chapters of the first book, then a thirty-minute Q&amp;A followed by the autographs.</p><p>They end up sitting at the very last row, squished between a stroller on one side and a dad holding two toddlers on the other. The chair creaks when Agatha sits down, and she immediately regrets not bringing coffee. She's still exhausted, as she didn't get to take a nap, and the noise is going to give her a headache.</p><p>As expected, it's loud. There's a mix of kids screaming in the background and parents talking. But she can't even understand what they all say, as they all speak above each other, meaning it just sounds like a cacophony. It's awful. Nicky doesn't seem to mind, though. He's sitting silently, with his hands on either side of the chair and his legs moving. He's so cute like that; his feet don't even touch the ground.</p><p>Ten minutes later, an old woman walks up to the front of the stage, holding a mic. She looks like she's either about to read tarot cards or curse someone (or both, who knows) and Agatha isn't sure if she looks like that to fit the witchy theme or if it's her everyday style. She has dark gray hair pulled up in a messy bun or ponytail, she can't really tell, and she's wearing a long patchwork crochet cardigan that looks handmade, in purple, red, blue and green colors. The perfect fake-medium cliché in fun fairs.</p><p>"Hello, everyone," she speaks into the mic. "I'm Lilia Calderu, illustrator of The Legend of The Christmas Witch and every other book Rio has written," she chuckles. "Welcome to New York, and thank you for joining us today. Rio will be there in a few minutes."</p><p>"She's coming, Ma!" Nicky mutters as people start clapping.</p><p>"Hm-hm. Are you excited?"</p><p>"Obviously! It's Rio Vidal!"</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but she can't help but smile.</p><p>She made the right decision, coming here. Even if the road was hell and she can't wait to be back in the hotel room to finally get some sleep, the smile on Nicky's face makes it one hundred percent worth it. And a little mother-son trip to New York City might be beneficial for her dear, fucked-up mental health, because being surrounded by loud, annoying teenagers every day sometimes makes her want to jump out the window. It's obviously a metaphor—she'd never leave her son behind like that, but that's how she feels inside, sometimes.</p><p>Not long after, Lilia comes back to the stage with her mic in hand, and speaks. "Ladies and gentlemen, humans and supernatural beings, please meet Rio Vidal!"</p><p>And that's when Agatha sees her. Her son's favorite author, half walking half running towards the stage, wearing a long red cloak over a black dress and moon-and-stars sheer tights. With this, she's also wearing a matching red witch's hat decorated with what seems to be a Christmas wreath. Her hair is dark brown, arriving a bit under her shoulders.</p><p>She's even prettier in real life than in her photos. Agatha isn't sure how old she is—she forgot to check—but she looks young. Younger than her, at least.</p><p>As soon as the public spot her, they start clapping and the kids start screaming. That... doesn't help with Agatha's forming headache.</p><p>Once on the scene, Rio grabs her mic and steps forward to face the public. She greets them quickly in a witchy way, which makes the kids laugh, including Nicky. "I'm so happy to be here today for my last stop. Now, I'm going to read some of my favorite chapters of The Legend of the Christmas Witch, and then I'll answer some questions."</p><p>Smiling, the woman then sits down on her chair and takes her copy of the book that is placed on the small table, and she flips it open to a bookmarked page. Then, she starts reading, and she's way better at it than Agatha. She could be a voice actor, because the way she's doing every character's voice is so professional.</p><p>In the middle of the chapter Rio is reading, Agatha looks down next to her, only to see Nicky fixing the author with big puppy eyes, focused on everything she's saying.</p><p>"She can jump on a reindeer," she explains, talking about the Christmas Witch, "and fly on the reindeer up into the sky. They call that <em>barebacking</em>."</p><p>Wait.</p><p>What?</p><p>No she didn't just...</p><p>There's a moment of total silence for a few seconds before the parents start laughing, and Agatha can't help but smile at that like an immature teenager laughing at a sexual word. She bites the inside of her cheek, but the laugh still slips out anyway.</p><p>"Uh—Bare... what is it?" Rio struggles to find the word she was searching for, so she looks at Lilia, who's sitting on the chair next to her, for help. But when she sees the smirk on the older woman's face, she chuckles nervously, as if reading her mind, "That's not!" Agatha can't see that from afar, but she's certain that Rio is blushing hard right now. "Whatever! Riding... <em>riding bareback!</em> She can fly on the reindeer up into the sky."</p><p>Agatha then feels Nicky tugging at her sleeve. "Mama, why is everyone laughing?"</p><p>Oh, no. No, no, no, it's way too early for that.</p><p>"Oh, uh... the word she said actually means something else."</p><p>"What does it mean then?"</p><p>"Nothing important."</p><p>
<em>Please don't insist. Please don't insist.</em>
</p><p>Thankfully, Nicky just nods and returns his attention to his favorite author.</p><p>After the parents stop laughing, Rio continues reading.</p><p>Agatha zones out a little after that, not because it's boring—Rio's actually great at this, with her voices and the way she exaggerates little things to make the kids laugh—but because she's too focused on not thinking about barebacking again. God, she's really frustrated and does need to get laid. Rio doesn't help either, because fuck, she's hot, there's no denying here.</p><p>When Rio finally finishes the chapter, the room bursts into applause. Nicky claps like his life depends on it, accidentally knocks his bookmark under the chair, then crawls down to get it and bumps his head on the way up, which makes Agatha chuckle (after she made sure he's not in real pain, of course).</p><p>"Okay!" the author says, taking the mic again. "Before we move on to pictures and autographs, we've got time for some questions. Who's got one?"</p><p>At least twenty tiny hands shoot up immediately, including Nicky's.</p><p>Agatha leans back in her chair and sighs. This is going to be long.</p><p>And she is never going to hear the word barebacking the same way ever again.</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>After the Q&amp;A ends (Agatha missed a few questions because Nicky had to go to the toilet), Rio moves behind the table to sign autographs. She removes her cape and witch's hat, which is not surprising, she must be hot wearing them, revealing the pretty black dress she has underneath.</p><p>Parents start lining up with their kids and their camera phones out, books clutched under their arms. Nicky tugs at his mother's sleeve and practically drags her toward the end of the line. "Come on," he says before there's too many people in front of them.</p><p>The line moves slowly—of course it does, kids are talking to Rio and she happily responds to each of them—and Agatha keeps glancing around the bookstore every few minutes, taking in the way it's decorated with colorful drawings from the book and Christmas Witch merchandise all over the place. There's a big table near the entrance filled with brown reindeer plushies (Nicky already eyed those the second they walked in), and another one with pointy witch hats in every size, including baby ones and reindeer antlers headbands. Another table is stacked with sugar cookies shaped like brooms and crescent moons and other witchy-themed shapes, all iced with different colors and a lot of detail.</p><p>Oh, this isn't good. At least for Agatha's wallet. She might not be a medium, but she can predict with <em>perfect</em> accuracy that they're <em>not</em> leaving this bookstore empty-handed. One plushie and one box of overpriced cookies <em>minimum.</em></p><p>After what feels like forever (fifteen minutes, maybe), it's finally their turn. They step up to the table, and Rio looks up from the book she just signed. She smiles at them, and now Agatha can see from up close the gap she has between her two front teeth. It's so cute.</p><p>"Well, hello there," Rio smiles.</p><p>"Hi!" Nicky giggles. "I love your hat. And your books, of course. Are you planning on writing a third one?"</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but she's smiling too. "Honey, don't overwhelm her with questions."</p><p>"No, it's fine," Rio says right away. The last thing the author wants is to make the kid sad. "I'm happy to know you like my books. And my hat." She gives Nicky a playful wink. "About the book, I'm actually working on the last one of the series."</p><p>"Oh. So that'll be your last one?"</p><p>"Not my very last. Just the end of the Christmas Witch series. But don't worry, Lilia and I have a lot of ideas for new ones. You might like my next book, it's about a witch too. It'll be out pretty soon."</p><p>Ah, yeah. Agatha remembers hearing about that one. <em>Luna the Witch</em>, or something like that; she isn't sure about the title. Nicky would probably love it just as much, because the boy has a new obsession with witches and magic. He absolutely got that from his mom, that's for sure.</p><p>Nicky's eyes light up at the confirmation that his favorite author isn't done writing books. "So cool! I can't wait."</p><p>Then he hands over his book, and Rio takes it with both hands, flipping it open to the first page. "What's your name, sweetheart?"</p><p>"Nicholas!"</p><p>Nodding, Rio starts writing, adding a little message next to his name before signing her own with a loopy signature and a tiny heart at the end. "Nicholas. Well, nice to meet you. Will you be there tomorrow too?"</p><p>He quickly nods, excited.</p><p>"Amazing. Tomorrow, Lilia and I are organizing some activities for the kids in the afternoon."</p><p>"Activities?" Agatha raises a brow.</p><p>"Mhm. We did them during the week and the kids loved it. One's a treasure hunt inside the bookstore, with a map and little things they have to find and will be able to keep. We'll also help them write their own short witchy story, and Lilia will illustrate the winner's."</p><p>"That's amazing," Agatha says, and she means it. It really is. She's seen book events like this before, but the author never really bothered doing activities. You can see that Rio loves her job and isn't doing it for the money or fame—she's truly passionate about it and love the kids.</p><p>"I do hope so," Rio says with a grin. "But, fair warning, no parents allowed. So I don't know if that'll be okay with you. Some parents get nervous leaving their kid, which I totally get. But if it helps, they'll be really well supervised. Lilia and I will be with them the whole time, and there'll be some bookstore staff helping too."</p><p>Immediately, Nicky looks up at her with huge eyes. "Mama, can I go? Please?"</p><p>Agatha hesitates for a second. Yeah, she is reluctant to just drop her kid off with strangers in a new city, even if they're friendly and famous and seem trustworthy. A hot woman and an older one that looks like a grandma, they're clearly not psychopaths. But she can't help but worry anyway. New York's a big city; anything can happen. But she also knows he'd have a blast. They didn't drive to the city just to not take advantage of the event. And honestly, the idea of a quiet afternoon alone in the hotel doesn't sound so awful.</p><p>"Oh... well, uh... yeah. Sure."</p><p>Rio raises her eyebrows at her. "Sure?"</p><p>"Yeah, yeah," Agatha nods. "I'll be able to rest a bit. Our hotel's just a few minutes away."</p><p>"Oh, you're not from here?"</p><p>She shakes her head. "Nope. We drove an hour to get here. Well, more like two with the traffic. So, uhm, what time do the activities start?"</p><p>"Activities are from one p.m to four," she explains. "But if he wants to leave early, that's totally fine. We're not gonna keep them prisoners or anything," she chuckles, then looks down at Nicky and winks, then back up at Agatha. "You'll just have to register on the paper list at the entrance, as places are limited for obvious reasons. It's free. There's still a few left."</p><p>"One p.m. Okay, alright. We'll be there."</p><p>"Amazing." Rio closes the book and gives it back to Nicky, then glances up at Agatha again. "Have we met before? You sound... really familiar."</p><p>Oh, she'd remember if she met her before. She's too pretty to forget. "Not that I remember."</p><p>"Oh... I must be mistaking you for someone else, then." Rio looks back at the boy. "Do you wanna take a picture?"</p><p>"Yes, please!"</p><p>Rio stands up from her chair and moves to the side, and Agatha pulls out her phone. She snaps a few photos of them smiling together—because one is never enough—then thank the author before moving out of the line before the other parents and their kids get impatient.</p><p>But before they can walk away, Rio asks, "Hey, what's your name? If I can ask."</p><p>Agatha turns back and smiles. "It's Agatha."</p><p>They walk off before Rio can respond to that.</p><p>"Mama, can we get the reindeer plushie? And some cookies!"</p><p>See? Not a medium, but this one was an easy guess.</p><p>They move to Lilia's table to get the book signed by her too, quickly chat with her, then they stay a little longer in the bookstore, because Nicky doesn't want to leave yet. He wants to check out the kids' section, so they sit on the floor next to a shelf while he pulls random books and flips through the pages. Agatha scrolls on her phone for a bit, but she can't focus. Because the whole time they're there, she can feel someone watching her; she feels like a prey being watched by a predator. And when she turns around, she sees Rio across the room talking to Lilia, but very clearly looking in their direction. Their eyes meet for a second before the author breaks the eye contact and turns her head away, returning to whatever she was doing.</p><p>What the fuck.</p><p>"Mama, can we buy this book?" Nicky interrupts her thoughts, showing her a book.</p><p>"Uh, yeah, sure." She's not gonna say no to that. She's proud that her son loves reading, even if she's the one who ends up reading to him half the time. Still, imagination and creativity are important.</p><p>Once they're back in their hotel room, Agatha falls onto the bed with a long sigh.</p><p>"That was so cool!" Nicky exclaims, jumping on his own bed. "Rio is so nice! And very pretty. Did you find her pretty, Mama?"</p><p>Did she? People would be crazy not to think she's pretty. "Yes. She was."</p><p>Agatha quickly sends the photo Nicky took with Rio to Wanda with a little text telling her how it went.</p><p>She receives another text as she sends it.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:09 PM</strong><br/>Sorry I couldn't respond earlier, been busy</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:09 PM</strong><br/>How was your day?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:10 PM</strong><br/>Amazing.

Why?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:10 PM</strong><br/>Rio Vidal's tour</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:10 PM</strong><br/>You know, the kid's author.

She read a few chapters of the book and then signed autographs</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:10 PM</strong><br/>Wait, Nicky got a pic with her</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:11 PM</strong><br/>20250308_001014.jpg</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:11 PM</strong><br/>Nicky looks so happy</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:11 PM</strong><br/>Oh he was</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:11 PM</strong><br/>Rio is hot. Don't you think?</p><p>Agatha chuckles to herself. At least she's not the only one thinking so.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:12 PM</strong><br/>She is. Did you notice she has a gap between her teeth? That's cute</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:12 PM</strong><br/>Yeah I noticed that. I saw on her insta that she'll be there tomorrow too. Are you going?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:12 PM</strong><br/>Obviously. We booked a hotel room for the weekend for this reason. But tomorrow is a non-parent thing. Activities for the kids. I'm a bit scared to leave Nicky alone but it's not like I have a choice lol. We came here for him to meet his fav author</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:13 PM</strong><br/>Understandable. I don't have kids but I'd be scared to leave them too. I'm sure Rio will take good care of him, don't you worry about it</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:13 PM</strong><br/>By the way, is Nicky a nickname? I mean, it's not very common tbh</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:13 PM</strong><br/>Yeah. His full name is Nicholas, but he hates that I call him that. His teachers call him Nicky too. At least the nice ones. Nicholas is only for when I'm scolding him or for formal stuff like the autograph</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:14 PM</strong><br/>That makes sense. Nice pic, by the way. He looks like you</p><p>The teacher raises an eyebrow, before another text immediately comes in.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:14 PM</strong><br/>He looks like you?*</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:14 PM</strong><br/>Sorry, forgot the question mark lol. He's cute. Does he look like you?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:14 PM</strong><br/>I think he does. People usually tell us we look alike</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:15 PM</strong><br/>I'm sure you're very pretty then :)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:15 PM</strong><br/>Are you using my kid to flirt with me?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:15 PM</strong><br/>Sorry, that might've been weird</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:15 PM</strong><br/>No it's fine</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:15 PM</strong><br/>Okay. Then yes, I am flirting with you</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:15 PM</strong><br/>Do you have Instagram?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:16 PM</strong><br/>Nice try.

But I don't know her personally. I do know you. You're funny and nice and I love talking to you. You're pretty inside and I'm certain you're very hot outside too</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:19 PM</strong><br/>Cute. Wrud now?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:19 PM</strong><br/>Just got back to the hotel. Nicky's eating the cookies I bought at the event and I'm talking to you. What are you doing?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:19 PM</strong><br/>Oh nothing much. Just chilling at home</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:19 PM</strong><br/>No work?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:20 PM</strong><br/>Nah not right now. My day's finished</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:20 PM</strong><br/>I hope you'll feel comfortable to tell me what work you're doing soon because I'm so intrigued... your schedule is so weird</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:20 PM</strong><br/>One day :)</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:21 PM</strong><br/>You should definitely redownload Insta</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:21 PM</strong><br/>Did you follow me?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:21 PM</strong><br/>Not yet but I will soon</p><p>"Who are you texting?" Nicky asks, interrupting her thoughts.</p><p>"Curious little thing, aren't you? I'm texting my friend from Los Angeles."</p><p>"Oh, her again. You still don't know her name?"</p><p>"Nope. But being mysterious is our thing, y'know?"</p><p>He shrugs. "That's still weird. What if she's a psychopath? You know, that's usually how creepy men do this."</p><p>What the fuck. "Nicky," Agatha sighs, sitting up on the bed, "did you happen to watch a show called Criminal Minds?"</p><p>And the boy is silent for a moment, looking down at his feet as he bites into another cookie.</p><p>"Nicholas Harkness, I asked you a question."</p><p>"I did, I'm sorry, Mama!"</p><p>"When did you even watch it?"</p><p>"Auntie Wanda. She loves this show. She fell asleep on the couch watching it, and Tommy and I got down to get some cookies and we saw it. We were curious so we watched the episode, and it was about a man talking to young girls on social media."</p><p>Oh, she's so going to kill her.</p><p>Her seven-year-old son should not know what this show is, or even worry about this kind of thing. I mean, it's great that he's aware of danger, sure. But he's still too young to be concerned with predators and online safety like that. He should be thinking about dinosaurs and snack time, not cybercrime.</p><p>"Please don't be mad at her," he continues. "That's not her fault."</p><p>"I know. And I can assure you that my friend is real, and she's a woman. And please, stop eating those cookies now. You're going to get sick and won't eat dinner."</p><p>"But they're so good!"</p><p>"That's why you should save some for tomorrow."</p><p>"We can just buy them again tomorrow."</p><p>She fake gasps. "Since when did you become so bold, huh?"</p><p>"I'm sorry, Ma, I'm just excited!"</p><p>"I know. That's why you've had enough sugar for today."</p><p>Sighing, Nicky closes the box of cookies and puts it on the nightstand.</p><p>"Hey, you wanna see something?" Agatha asks, waving him over. "Come here." Then she scrolls up through the conversation with Evil Hag until she finds the picture she's looking for. "Look at this. That's my friend's tarantula. Her name's Victoria. She's scary, right?"</p><p>Nicky jumps on her bed and leans closer, peering at the screen with curious eyes. To her surprise, he doesn't scream, flinch, or even make a face. Just studies the spider intently. "I find her cute. She has a pink bow."</p><p>"Cute? Ew, that thing is <em>not</em> cute, Nicky."</p><p>"Well, I find her cute."</p><p>She rolls her eyes. "Alright, my little weirdo. Why don't you go shower before we go downstairs for dinner?"</p><p>Nodding, he disappears into the bathroom, leaving Agatha alone in the bedroom.</p><p>She opens Playstore to download Instagram again. She hates this app, or any kind of social media, but she really wants to see Evil Hag's account. She doubts she has pics of herself there considering how private she is, but this would get them closer somehow.</p><p>As soon as it's downloaded, she opens it and connects to her account.</p><p>@agathaharkness69. Her account is private; no one except her friends follow her. 18 followers, 18 following. Six posts: two selfies of herself, one selfie with Nicky, one picture of Nicky on the swing at the park, one of her beautiful purple azaleas in her front yard, and one of a pink and orange sunset.</p><p>She notices that she has a notification waiting.</p><p>
<em>@thelittledeath69 has requested to follow you</em>
</p><p>Agatha clicks on the account. There's no profile picture, and there's a blue <em>new</em> in the gray area, meaning it's a new account. Zero followers, zero following, and it's private too.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:30 PM</strong><br/>Did you request to follow me on Instagram?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:30 PM</strong><br/>Yup</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:30 PM</strong><br/>@thelittledeath69?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:31 PM</strong><br/>That's me ;)</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:31 PM</strong><br/>You're a new account. Why?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:31 PM</strong><br/>I need to keep the mystery, don't I?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:31 PM</strong><br/>Right. So, 69 too? Dirty girl. What does the username even mean?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:31 PM</strong><br/>The little death is the translation of the French la petite mort. It's a metaphor used to talk about an orgasm. And the 69, well... you know ;)</p><p>Agatha chuckles out loud. Obviously, her username had to be dirty.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:32 PM</strong><br/>You're so obsessed</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:32 PM</strong><br/>Please, you have 69 in your username too. And may I remind you who said she thought my fingers could reach her cervix?</p><p>Oh my God.</p><p>She groans, hiding her face in the pillow in embarrassment. They never really talked about it, not after the hungover morning.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:32 PM</strong><br/>Fuck you</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:32 PM</strong><br/>Sure you'd like that, baby</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:33 PM</strong><br/>Now can you accept my follow request?</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Agatha switches back to Instagram and accepts the request. She follows back, and a few seconds later she gets the notification that her own request's been accepted too. Not really useful, as her profile is empty, but she's proud to be her first follower.</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:34 PM</strong><br/>I was right. You're fucking hot, Agatha</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:34 PM</strong><br/>I love your eyes. And your nose. And your smile</p><p>Agatha's cheeks go warm at the compliment. She's really not used to this, especially not people complimenting her nose. She always thought it was too big, she even considered surgery to make it smaller when she was younger. But over the years, she grew to tolerate it. Accept it, maybe. It depends on the day.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:35 PM</strong><br/>Wish I could say the same about you. All I have is two tattoo pics and your ugly hairy monster</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:35 PM</strong><br/>LEAVE MY BABY ALONE</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:35 PM</strong><br/>She's very cute, okay? And she's not a monster. She's very nice. You know tarantulas have feelings too, right? She's my baby</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:35 PM</strong><br/>If you say so...</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 06:35 PM</strong><br/>I showed the pic to Nicky, by the way. I hate to say that he found her cute</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 06:35 PM</strong><br/>Ohh, I love that lil guy :3</p><p>They keep talking for a few minutes before the mysterious woman has to leave again. Agatha quickly checks on Nicky in the shower, making sure he's fine and doesn't need help, then decides to open Instagram again.</p><p><em>rio vidal</em> she clicks on the search bar.</p><p>@riovidal_fan01</p><p>@riovidalswife</p><p>@riovidal1</p><p>@vidaderio</p><p>The fourth one is the only one with a blue check mark, so Agatha clicks on this one.</p><p>It's the right account. Almost five million followers—what the fuck?—and just a few posts, most about her books or some selfies. Agatha quickly hits the follow button and clicks on her story.</p><p>There's a few. The first one is from a few hours ago. It's a photo of the bookstore, empty, with a caption: "can't wait to meet you all there :)" The next one is a photo of New York's buildings, taken from up, probably from her hotel window. The next one is the sugar cookies, and the last one is from a few minutes ago, with a white caption that says, "today was wonderful, can't wait for tomorrow &lt;3"</p><p>Agatha smiles to herself, then decides to post the picture Nicky took with her. It's her first post in forever, but thankfully, she remembers how to use the app.</p><p>As a caption, she simply writes: <em>Thanks for today @vidaderio</em></p><p>And then, she posts it.</p>

<p>Chapter Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello everyone... been a while haha. Lots of things happened since I posted chapter 9. I did, in fact, go to London for the Wednesday premiere and got to see the first episode of season 2 in the same room as the actors. I also met Tim Burton and took a photo with him and have his autograph. That was a crazy week. Then some other things happened. I met the funniest and coolest girl (thanks to Wrong Number, can you believe it??) and we've been talking a crazy lot ever since. She's also helping me with this fanfiction, so it's a big win, hahaha. Anyway, I'm very sorry for the delay. Real life and writing blocks got in the way, and also the big lack of motivation. That's why I decided to cut this chapter in half so I can post the first part now. The second half is almost finished, and hopefully I'll be able to finish it soon. I can't promise anything, though... so here's the first part :)</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>New York City is not the only thing that never sleeps.</p><p>To say that Agatha had a bad night is an understatement. It's a miracle if she managed to sleep more than five hours, because all night long, there were noises of sirens, honking, people fighting in the street, and even weirder sounds she couldn't identify. It was just so fucking loud. And even though she was exhausted, her brain wouldn't shut off.</p><p>She kept turning from one side to the other, adjusting her pillow, kicking the covers off then pulling them back up, hoping the sounds would fade or she'd eventually pass out, but no. It felt like every time she was about to fall asleep, another fucking car alarm would go off. Then one time she needed to pee, so she had to get up. Another time she got thirsty and couldn't find her bottle of water. Another time, she had to tuck Nicky back in because he woke up too. That night was absolute hell.</p><p>Nicky didn't sleep much either, but unlike his mother, he's already up and ready for the day. He's still in his pajamas, but he's wide awake, bouncing on Agatha's bed to wake her up. "Come on, mama!"</p><p>"Nicky," she groans against her pillow, "go back to sleep."</p><p>"But I'm not tired anymore. I wanna go see Rio!"</p><p>She turns to her side on the bed and double taps on her phone screen on the bedside table. It's only eight in the morning. "The event doesn't start for five hours. Go back to sleep or you'll be tired later."</p><p>Nicky sighs, sitting down at the end of the bed. "But mama, I'm awake. I don't want to sleep anymore. And I'm hungry."</p><p>There's no way Agatha will be able to go back to sleep now. She doubts she'd be able to fall asleep anyway—her body is exhausted, but her brain is already wide awake and overthinking. She spent a big part of the night thinking about tomorrow, actually. Or, now, today.</p><p>Nicky will be alone at the bookstore for three hours; it'll be the very first time she leaves him with strangers for that long, and in a big, unfamiliar city. Obviously, she trusts Rio. She doesn't know the author personally, but she really seems to be a good person, especially around kids. You can tell when someone's genuinely good with children, and Rio definitely gave off that kind of vibe from the few moments they shared the same air yesterday.</p><p>Agatha saw how she took her time with each child: answering their questions during the Q&amp;A, even the most absurd ones; taking the time to talk to them during the autographs, then taking pictures with those who wanted to. She was really sweet. She made this higher-pitched voice while talking to them, like a mother talking to her baby, that Agatha would usually find annoying (why do they feel the need to talk to them like they're imbeciles and not little humans?) but she didn't get that feeling with Rio. It was actually cute. Plus, Nicky adores her already, that's more than a known fact.</p><p>On top of that, he'll be well supervised. Lilia and the other staff members will be there the entire time, so realistically, Agatha knows she has no reason to worry. Right?</p><p>And yet, her brain won't shut up. What if he gets lost? What if, somehow, he manages to wander outside while no one's watching? She knows her son isn't stupid—he's actually one of the smartest kids she's ever met—but he's still seven years old. What if someone tries to talk to him, or worse, take him? Or what if a random guy walks into the store with a gun and starts shooting?</p><p>I mean, it's not impossible. It's New York: anything can happen here. She's seen enough <em>Criminal Minds</em> episodes to understand that nowhere is safe in this fucking country, and that there is so many things that could go wrong in just a fraction of a second. Hell, people even get mugged in broad daylight. She saw that in one of her late-night crime documentaries she likes to watch with a glass of wine and microwave-reheated food when Nicky's away. This gives her a good reason to worry, doesn't it?</p><p>Sighing, Agatha sits up in bed and straightens her back. Her hair is a mess, she's pretty sure she has bags under her eyes so big she looks like a Tim Burton character, and her eyeballs are burning like hell from the lack of sleep. She's tempted to close them again to stop the feeling, but when she looks up, she notices Nicky staring at her with those big, round eyes.</p><p>While they do look a lot alike—people tell her this all the time—his eyes aren't blue like hers. Agatha's not even sure what exact color they are. There's a ring of brown around the iris, but the rest is more greenish. Sometimes, depending on the light, they look darker, and other times they get really pale, almost gray. They change depending on the weather too. It's very weird, but at least he's unique.</p><p>He's sitting on his knees in his favorite dinosaur pajamas, which are getting a little too short at the ankles, and he's looking at her with that impatient face she knows all too well.</p><p>"Are you awake now?" he asks, not even blinking.</p><p>"I'm awake now," Agatha confirms with a tired grin. As annoyed as she is that she didn't get more rest, she can't deny that her son is just the cutest thing ever. And when he does those damn puppy eyes... she's hopeless. "Go brush your teeth, then we'll go down for breakfast."</p><p>She isn't hungry. Like, at all. The simple thought of eating makes her stomach churn. But Nicky's hungry, obviously, and there's no way she's letting him go down to the breakfast room alone, so she'll go with him, and maybe grab a little something for later. And drink some coffee too, because she's absolutely going to need it.</p><p>"Then can we go to the museum?" Nicky asks, already rushing to the bathroom to brush his teeth.</p><p>Ah, right. The museum. That, unfortunately, he didn't forget.</p><p>"Honey, I don't think we'll have the time to go—"</p><p>"You said we have five hours left before the bookstore thing. By the time we eat breakfast and get ready, we'll have four hours left. It's enough time, mama!"</p><p>Of course he's her son. Smart and stubborn, just like her.</p><p>She pulls the blanket off her legs and rubs her face with both hands, trying to wake herself up. If they hurry through breakfast, they should be back in the room in around twenty minutes, and then take maybe half an hour to get ready. That gives them a good three hours to visit the museum. Maybe even a little more, depending on how long it will take them to go to walk there. It's doable, technically.</p><p>While Nicky's brushing his teeth, Agatha grabs her phone and checks the museum's website. She scrolls through the front page and clicks on the ticket section.</p><p>"Seriously?" she scoffs when she sees the prices. Thirty dollars for one adult, eighteen for a child. Just to walk around and look at some bones and other things. At least the Natural History Museum in London is free, just like a bunch of other museums over there. But of course, Americans have to charge for every little thing, then they act all shocked when people aren't well-educated and can't date the attack on Pearl Harbor or situate Italy on a world map. No wonder, when every single cultural thing is fucking expensive and some aren't even taught in school.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she clicks the box for two tickets and pays online anyway. She knows how sad Nicky would be if they missed it. It'd be such a shame not to go, especially since they're already in the city and only a few blocks away.</p><p>After breakfast—pancakes with maple syrup for Nicky and a black coffee for Agatha—they head back up to their room to get ready. Agatha changes into a simple purple sweater and a pair of blue jeans that fit just right. She pulls on her boots, ties them lazily, and looks at herself in the mirror. Warm enough for the weather, yet still pretty and comfortable. She decides to leave her hair down like usual; she doesn't have the time to do a certain hairstyle, not that she often does this anyway. She's always loved her hair, especially how long and wavy it is, and she often prefers to let it down. She decides not to wear a jacket: today's a sunny day and her weather app is announcing rather nice temperatures. A sweater will be enough.</p><p>"Mama, can we go now? Come onnnn," Nicky whines, already waiting at the door of the room that he's holding half-open.</p><p>"Don't be so impatient," Agatha groans as she throws her bag over her shoulder. "Your dinosaurs won't go anywhere. They're already more than dead."</p><p>The boy rolls his eyes at her but still laughs a little. "I know, but if we don't hurry we won't have enough time to visit. Ugh, we should've booked another night at the hotel."</p><p>Agatha doesn't answer right away. Unlike her, Nicky doesn't seem the least bit bothered by being in a big city. But Agatha hates it, and all she wants right now is to go back home. <em>Home</em>, as in her peaceful, small, quiet town in the middle of Annandale, with no tall buildings and constant noise. Her quiet little town where she feels safe walking around even at night—nothing ever happens in Westview. She can't, however, say the same thing about New York.</p><p>Technically, she could book another night. She's pretty sure the hotel is not full, especially considering this isn't the holidays or any big event. And even if this room isn't available tomorrow, another one will be. But the teacher is already stressed enough just from this one weekend, and she's got work waiting for her at home.</p><p>"Shall we?" Agatha exits the room, quickly followed by Nicky.</p><p>The walk to the museum takes around twenty minutes, but with the sun out and the fact that they had to walk along Central Park, it was really agreeable.</p><p>"Happy now?" Agatha asks once they arrive in front of a tall T-Rex skeleton. She crosses her arms with a smile on her face, while Nicky hums as a response before stepping closer to read the little sign next to it, that probably tells where it was found and in what year, and all other boring information that, for some reason, Nicky finds fascinating. She can't even tell if these are real bones or not, but in all honesty, she doesn't care. Dinosaurs have always been her son's passion, not hers. And apparently, it's Evil Hag's too.</p><p>Evil Hag... She hasn't texted since last time, but once again, this isn't surprising. She's probably at work or doing whatever mysterious thing she does in L.A, and will message Agatha once she's free. And if she doesn't, then Agatha will take the first step; because yes, they're two in this relationship. <em>Friendship</em> relationship. Evil Hag can't always be the one to text first, because it would make it look like Agatha doesn't care, which would be a huge lie. She <em>does</em> care, quite a lot. Probably more than she should.</p><p>The teacher pulls out her phone and snaps a few pics of Nicky standing in front of the T-Rex. One where he's squinting at the text, one where he's looking up with his mouth slightly open, and another blurry one because he turned around too fast to tell her some random facts about it he's read. She sends one to Wanda—obviously, she loves sharing her day with her best friend—and another one to Evil Hag. She knows she'll probably be interested. And even if she's not, well... at least she texted first.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:21 AM</strong><br/>20250309_001015.jpg</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:21 AM</strong><br/>Thought you'd like to see this skeleton</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:22 AM</strong><br/>You're at the Museum of Natural History??</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:22 AM</strong><br/>Yes. Nicky insisted on going, obviously</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:22 AM</strong><br/>I mean, how could I have refused? He loves dinosaurs, and the museum was just a twenty minute walk from our hotel</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:22 AM</strong><br/>And I'm not planning on going back to NYC anytime soon. Way too crowded and loud</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:22 AM</strong><br/>I'm glad you're having fun. Good morning btw. Sorry I didn't text you first, I've been a bit busy and didn't want to bother you</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:22 AM</strong><br/>Don't be stupid. You never bother me</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:22 AM</strong><br/>And looking at bones is not fun. I'm just happy to see my son so happy, that's all</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:23 AM</strong><br/>It's early in L.A. On your way to work?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:23 AM</strong><br/>Yes. Won't be able to text much today either, I'm sorry</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:23 AM</strong><br/>So you're at the museum, then you're gonna go see Rio?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:23 AM</strong><br/>That's the plan. We'll grab something to eat or stop at a restaurant before, then I'll leave him there for 3 whole hours</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:23 AM</strong><br/>Are you nervous?</p><p>Agatha trails behind Nicky as he moves from one skeleton to another, actually taking the time to stop to read all the signs and descriptions, unlike many other kids and even adults. She watches him read something else, then looks down back at her phone. He's clearly busy and doesn't mind that his mother doesn't really give him attention right now. As long as there are dinosaurs, he won't care for anything but them.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:24 AM</strong><br/>Obviously</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:24 AM</strong><br/>But I'm telling myself that it will be fine. I trust Rio</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:24 AM</strong><br/>You do?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:24 AM</strong><br/>Yes. I saw how she was with the kids yesterday. And Nicky already loves her. And there will be other staff members to take care of him</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:24 AM</strong><br/>I just can't help but still worry a little though. And I know it's stupid because he will be in good hands, and even if there's a problem the hotel is just a few minutes away</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:25 AM</strong><br/>It's not stupid. You're a mother, of course you're gonna worry about your son. It's human</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:25 AM</strong><br/>And I'm sure Rio will take very good care of him. She's great with kids</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:25 AM</strong><br/>How do you know that?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:25 AM</strong><br/>Interviews. She's an actress too, you know. And she was nice with Nicky yesterday, right?</p><p>Right. She almost forgot about the fact that Rio Vidal is not only an author but also an actress. Where does she find all this time and motivation, she wonders.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:25 AM</strong><br/>Obviously</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:25 AM</strong><br/>Well then there's no reason to worry :)</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:25 AM</strong><br/>Plus you find her hot so it's a bonus</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:26 AM</strong><br/>I'm going to start thinking you're jealous</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:26 AM</strong><br/>Why would I be?? It's totally fine. You find her hot, good for you. Atp you should just ask her out</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:26 AM</strong><br/>Wow</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:26 AM</strong><br/>You ARE jealous</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:26 AM</strong><br/>I'm not. I have no reason to be. I'm hot too</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:26 AM</strong><br/>I don't know about that, I'm having trouble remembering...</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:27 AM</strong><br/>Maybe you should remind me ;)</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:27 AM</strong><br/>Wow, Agatha, you're sooo desperate</p><p>The teacher scoffs-chuckles out loud.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:27 AM</strong><br/>Come onnn I already sent you many pics. That's only fair if you send me some too, right?</p><p>That's true. Lately, Agatha has been sending her more photos. Some of Nicky doing silly things, some of herself (it's so much easier now that she knows what she looks like and the teacher doesn't have to hide her face anymore). She sent a couple of sunsets from her backyard, and any other random things she wanted to share with her. She knows it's not even interesting, but the act of sharing all these with her made her feel... something. Something she can't really name just yet.</p><p>Evil Hag, however, hasn't shared anything since the almost-healed tattoo mirror pic. And Agatha really doesn't want to pressure her—she knows she wants to remain anonymous, yadda yadda—but she's also getting impatient. Why is she so secretive? They've known each other long enough now to confirm she's not a psychopath, a creepy man pretending to be a hot mom. Evil Hag has seen her face multiple times, she has seen her son too. She knows she can trust her, so why doesn't she share more?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:27 AM</strong><br/>Fuck, that sounded weird, I'm sorry</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:27 AM</strong><br/>I didn't mean like sexy pics or whatever. I just want to see you. Outfits of the day, even just your morning coffee or food or anything</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:28 AM</strong><br/>And now I sound really greedy and I overshared as always</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:28 AM</strong><br/>No, it's okay</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:28 AM</strong><br/>And you're right. I'll try to share more</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:28 AM</strong><br/>Wanna see the matcha I got earlier?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:28 AM</strong><br/>This shit's disgusting, but sure</p><p>A few seconds later, she receives a photo of two iced matchas in clear plastic cups in a cardboard tray she holds in her left hand, while her right hand is busy snapping a photo of them and her shadow on the pavement. It's clearly sunny—which is not surprising for California—and probably warmer than New York.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:29 AM</strong><br/>Two?</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:29 AM</strong><br/>For my co-worker</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:29 AM</strong><br/>And matcha is very good. You just need to taste a good quality one</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:29 AM</strong><br/>The quality is not the problem. The problem is that it tastes like grass</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:29 AM</strong><br/>Well, I like grass then :)</p><p>Smiling to herself, Agatha finds herself looking back at the picture, hoping to maybe see some more of the mysterious woman. Unfortunately, her fingers are holding the cupholder tray out of frame, and her shadow doesn't show anything besides the fact that she's a human walking on pavement with a phone in hand.</p><p>Still, it's better than nothing.</p><p>Her eyes catch a name written in a lilac color on one of the plastic cups. Half the letters are hidden, but she recognizes it anyway... because they walked past a coffee shop with the same name and same color earlier.</p><p>Raising an eyebrow, she quickly looks up to make sure that Nicky's still around (he is, now waiting for his turn to read yet another sign) then types again.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:30 AM</strong><br/>Weird coincidence, we walked past a The Road coffee shop on our way to the museum</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:30 AM</strong><br/>Didn't know L.A had one too</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:30 AM</strong><br/>Oh. Crazy coincidence. Didn't know NYC had one either</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:30 AM</strong><br/>Sorry, I have to go. I'll try to text you tonight?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:31 AM</strong><br/>Good for me. Good luck with your mystery work</p><p><strong>Evil Hag 10:31 AM</strong><br/>Thanks :) enjoy the dinosaurs</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:31 AM</strong><br/>Hardly</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes with a tired smile tugging at her lips, then drops her phone back into her bag. She adjusts the strap over her shoulder and looks up at the dinosaur skeleton in front of her, about to call Nicky over so they can continue the visit instead of lingering on the same dead reptile's bones. But when she turns her head to where he was standing just a minute ago, he's not there anymore.</p><p>Her smile drops instantly.</p><p>"Nicky?" she calls out with a frown.</p><p>She spins around slowly to try to spot the back of his head in the small crowd, but all she sees is strangers. Some adults, some kids, some tourists wearing ugly New York t-shirts, some families pushing strollers and holding guidebooks, but no sign of her seven-year-old son. Her chest tightens immediately, and she starts walking faster, weaving between people, heading back to the spot she last saw him. She looks around the skeleton, thinking maybe he wanted to see the back of it or from another angle, but he's nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Her heartbeat speeds up. Fuck.</p><p>He wouldn't wander off like that. He knows not to, he's a smart kid. She's had the 'don't talk to strangers' conversation with him a thousand times before, especially after watching all those shows and documentaries about psychopaths in the wild. And yet... yet, she can't see him. He's not there. He just disappeared.</p><p>Quickly, she walks into the next room, scanning the space, and finally spots a familiar head of messy brown curls standing by the grand window. He's talking to someone.</p><p>Agatha's pace immediately picks up as she rushes towards him, relieved that he's there and okay, but also mad that he's talking to a stranger and that he wandered off without her. "Nicholas!"</p><p>Nicky turns his head immediately, eyes widening at the sight of his furious mom. "Mama!"</p><p>"What were you thinking? You're not supposed to leave without me! And you're not supposed to talk to strangers, you know that!"</p><p>"But, mama, she's not a stranger," Nicky says, all innocent and comfused.</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to argue, but then follows his hand as he gestures to the woman standing next to him... and her words catch in her throat. Because standing there is a familiar woman smiling awkwardly at her. A familiar woman who has a gap between her two front teeth and who's watching her with her big brown eyes.</p><p>"Hey," Rio says in a sheepish voice, then gives her a small wave of her hand with a light nervous chuckle. "Sorry for scaring you. He kinda ran up to me and started talking about the T-Rex skeleton..."</p><p>Unlike yesterday, she's wearing simpler clothes. No red lipstick, no witchy hat or cloak, just a white David Bowie t-shirt and slightly faded black jeans. Her hair is free, and her makeup very light—if she even wears some. Either way, she's pretty. Lilia is standing next to her too, once again in a very strange patchwork outfit Agatha can't even begin to describe, and way too many jewelry.</p><p>What the hell are they doing here?</p><p>"I saw them and wanted to say hi," Nicky explains in a small, guilty voice for scaring his mother like that.</p><p>"Still. That's not a reason to run off like that. You really scared me."</p><p>"Sorry, mama," he mumbles.</p><p>She exhales, then looks back up at the pretty woman in front of her.</p><p>"Agatha, right?" Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha nods. "You remember my name?"</p><p>"Of course I do." Rio shifts slightly, stuffing her hands into the back pockets of her jeans, then clears her throat. "Fancy seeing you here. You like dinosaurs?"</p><p>"I could not care less," Agatha chuckles. "But Nicky's obsessed."</p><p>"Oh, I get it. Lilia dragged me here too. She wanted to do some visits before we head back to L.A."</p><p>Lilia looks at her friend with a strange expression, but doesn't say anything about it. "Yes. I wanted to visit, I <em>love</em> museums."</p><p>"Hm. Anyways, are you going to the bookstore later?" Rio asks Agatha.</p><p>The teacher nods. "Do I have a choice?"</p><p>"No," Nicky chuckles. "So, Miss Rio, have you seen the T-Rex skeleton yet? It's in the next room. It's huge!"</p><p>"Nicky, stop bothering her."</p><p>"It's fine," the author shakes her head. "He's not bothering me, don't worry. And please, just call me Rio. I haven't seen it yet, but you can show me if your mom's okay with it?" she looks back up at the woman.</p><p>What the hell is happening? Meeting your son's favorite author at the museum is already a big coincidence, but her asking him to show her the dinosaur skeleton? Why is she giving him attention? She's an author, and an actress too. A celebrity. Why is she being so nice with a random kid she met once yesterday? That's so weird.</p><p>"Uh," Agatha mumbles, not knowing what to respond. "Yeah, sure."</p><p>That's all it takes for Nicky to grab Rio's hand and drag her to the other room where the skeleton is standing, leaving Agatha behind with the older woman.</p><p>"She's going to be the death of me," Lilia sighs, rolling her eyes, though she can't hide the small smile on her face. "I'm Lilia, by the way. We met yesterday."</p><p>"I remember. Does this... happen often?"</p><p>"What happens often?"</p><p>"This," she points at Rio and Nicky with her eyes. "She's nice."</p><p>"Oh, <em>this.</em> Well, as you may have noticed yesterday, Rio loves kids. But that's the first time she meets a fan outside the events. Most kids don't even know what she looks like, they just want their book signed."</p><p>Together, the women slowly walk to the other room. Agatha remains silent; she just doesn't know what to say.</p><p>"So you're Agatha," Lilia breaks the silence.</p><p>She raises an eyebrow. "That's my name."</p><p>"Rio talks about you a lot."</p><p>What the actual fuck.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I mean... She's been talking about you since yesterday."</p><p>"Me? Why?"</p><p>Lilia pauses, as if thinking of a response. "She... uh... she found you pretty. And as you can see, she loves your son. Finds him smart."</p><p>As if this day couldn't get weirder.</p><p>She found her pretty? The author-slash-actress who's more than gorgeous thinks she's pretty? A tired high school teacher who barely gets rest between the teenagers she teaches and her son? Are we sure she's talking about Agatha? Agatha, who has bags under her eyes and looks like a zombie?</p><p>Nope. Absolutely not. This has to be a joke.</p><p>I mean, she's hot. She knows she is—even if she's still self-conscious about her scars and stretch marks and overall look, she can be confident, especially at work. She dresses well in designer clothes, puts on her more authoritarian expression and orders people around. But when she's not that persona? When she's not that strong, unbothered teacher? That's another thing.</p><p>Today, she looks like shit. She's not the hot mean history teacher anymore, she's an exhausted mother who, once again, barely got any sleep. She's not wearing anything particularly hot or attractive, just a sweater and jeans. Her hair is down, barely brushed, a few strands falling forward in that annoying way she hasn't bothered fixing. She looks like shit. Not the worst she's looked, but not the best either.</p><p>How on Earth does Rio Vidal find her pretty? What the fuck.</p><p>When they arrive in the other room, Agatha spots Rio talking to Nicky next to the T-Rex skeleton. The enormous fossil looms above them, and Rio is crouched down, pointing at a bone. She seems to be explaining something to Nicky, who's standing right next to her, chin tilted up, looking at what the author is pointing at and listening carefully.</p><p>"She likes dinosaurs?" Agatha asks Lilia, because it really does seem like she does. Crazy coincidence that her son, the stranger she's been talking to for almost a month, and this pretty author all love dinosaurs, isn't it?</p><p>"Uh, not that much. I mean, she likes Jurassic Park. Who doesn't?"</p><p>"I don't. I mean, I suppose it's a nice movie, but after watching it a hundred times because your son's obsessed with it, you get to hate it."</p><p>"Understandable."</p><p>"I thought you liked dinosaurs? Isn't it why you came here?"</p><p>Lilia's eyes widen slightly, but she manages a response. "I love museums. Learning new things is extremely interesting, don't you think?"</p><p>"It is. But I could care less about dead reptiles from the Jurassic," she scoffs.</p><p>"Actually," a new voice interrupts from behind, "they appeared about 230 million years ago during the Triassic period. Dinosaurs are way older than the Jurassic. In fact, <em>Cretaceous Park</em> would be a more accurate name, because most dinosaurs shown in the movie or mentionned in the book didn't even exist during the Jurassic yet."</p><p>When Agatha turns around, she's face to face with a nerdy Rio looking at her with a big smile. For someone who's not supposed to like dinosaurs that much, she surely knows a lot. Maybe she's just a nerd who followed her Earth Science classes correctly. Wouldn't be surprising—she seems to be a very smart girl.</p><p>"She's right, mama," Nicky adds, eager to back her up. "The books and movies are incorrect. T-Rexes didn't exist during the Jurassic yet, so the title is misleading."</p><p>How on earth is her seven-year-old so smart already?</p><p>"Uh, okay," she mumbles, not sure what to respond, because in all honesty, she doesn't really care.</p><p>"Can we go see the Stegosaurus now?"</p><p>"Honey, I'm sure Rio and Lilia would like to be left alone now."</p><p>"No, it's fine," Rio immediately responds. "I mean, we're here to visit the museum; you're here to visit the museum, so why not visit it all together? But I'd understand if you don't want us to interfere in your mother-son weekend. We wouldn't want to interrupt."</p><p>Immediately, Nicky looks up at her with puppy eyes, and oh, how could she refuse? It's not every day your son gets to visit a freaking museum with his favorite author, who happens to be a famous actress (though Agatha still has no idea what movie or show she played in).</p><p>"Well... if you're sure you don't mind, then okay," she smiles politely.</p><p>"Amazing! Come with me, chiquito, you have to see this one." Rio grabs Nicky's hand and drags him toward another dinosaur skeleton, while Agatha watches them go with her mouth half-opened.</p><p>She's still very confused about why Rio Vidal is being so nice to them and taking her time talking to Nicky. She's an adult, in New York for a book tour, Agatha is sure she has better things to do than spend the morning with complete strangers. And yet, there she is, chatting with Nicky like she's known him for weeks instead of just a day—and still, they talked less than five minutes. This day is really getting stranger and stranger.</p><p>Keeping an eye on her son and the pretty brunette, Agatha sits down on a bench while the two look at some other things. The bench is hard and rather uncomfortable, but she could care less. At least she's sitting down. She might not be forty yet, but her back surely is. She's had back pain for a while, even when she was in her mid-twenties, and while it's usually okay, walking a lot and sitting uncomfortably for a while makes it hurt. And fuck, they did walk a lot. Yesterday in Central Park, then to the bookstore, then back at the hotel; and now, the twenty-minute walk to the museum. Her feet are killing her, too. Her boots are not made for walking—but one, she hates sneakers, and two, she doesn't even owns a pair.</p><p>With a sigh, she leans back against the wall behind her, phone in hand, still keeping Rio in her peripheral vision. Lilia is not far away, reading a display plaque probably with information about the fossil. Nicky is well surrounded, so Agatha takes the opportunity to text her best friend.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:49 AM</strong><br/>You'll never guess what happened</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:49 AM</strong><br/>???</p><p>The teacher snaps a quick photo of Rio and Nicky, then sends it.</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:49 AM</strong><br/>20250309_001016.jpg</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:50 AM</strong><br/>Is that Rio Vidal??</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:50 AM</strong><br/>The one and only</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:50 AM</strong><br/>WTF</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:50 AM</strong><br/>You met her at the museum??</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:50 AM</strong><br/>Yes. She's there with Lilia</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:50 AM</strong><br/>And guess what?</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:50 AM</strong><br/>She asked if we could do the visit of the museum together. She's currently with Nicky looking at some dinosaur bones</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:51 AM</strong><br/>Wtf is going on</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:51 AM</strong><br/>And Lilia said Rio said she found me pretty?</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:51 AM</strong><br/>Omg</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:52 AM</strong><br/>It makes sense now</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:52 AM</strong><br/>She has a fucking crush on you</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:52 AM</strong><br/>She saw you at the bookstore and BOOM, love at first sight. And now she's trying to bond with your son. Maybe to learn more about you or she really cares about him</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:52 AM</strong><br/>But still, WTF. Rio is famous. And pretty. And interested</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:53 AM</strong><br/>Don't be absurd</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:53 AM</strong><br/>Why would SHE be interested in ME? I look like shit today. I looked like shit yesterday. I'm sure she's just being nice to her little fan, and they seem to have some things in common</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:53 AM</strong><br/>Denial is a river in Egypt</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:54 AM</strong><br/>How do you even know this joke? You're never gonna beat the bi allegations</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:54 AM</strong><br/>For the last time: I AM STRAIGHT</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:54 AM</strong><br/>Yeah, straight as a ruler</p><p align="right"><strong>Agatha 10:54 AM</strong><br/>And Rio is not interested in me. I met her yesterday. We just exchanged a few words, that's all. She's very hot, I'm not gonna deny it, but tomorrow she'll probably go back to L.A and do whatever an actress/author does and forget about me</p><p><strong>Wanda 10:55 AM</strong><br/>I guess. That sucks</p><p>"You okay?" A voice snaps her out of her thoughts.</p><p>Agatha quickly locks her phone and turns her head to the right. Rio is now sitting next to her on the bench, legs manspread. Agatha's eyes flick automatically toward where Nicky is, but Rio speaks before she can spiral.</p><p>"Don't worry, Lilia's with him. He's very smart for his age, you know?"</p><p>"Oh, I know. He's my little nerd."</p><p>"He's cute."</p><p>There's a short pause before the teacher takes a deep breath and asks, "Can I ask you something?"</p><p>Rio shrugs. "Sure."</p><p>"Why are you doing this? Talking to me, to him. You're... you're you. You're famous; why would you lose your time hanging out with a kid and his boring mom you've known for barely a day?"</p><p>Rio stays silent for a moment, thinking of an answer. She glances at the ground, then back at Agatha. "I can't really respond to this. I mean... I guess I feel lonely. Being a celebrity is not as amazing as people think it is. Don't get me wrong, I love my job, but it can be really hard sometimes. Besides Lilia, I only have one close friend who I don't get to see as much as I want because of our schedules, and it's not like I can trust many other people. But you're... you're nice. You're different. And this," she points at Nicky, "makes me feel normal, even for just a few moments."</p><p>"Oh... I'm sorry, I didn't—"</p><p>"Don't be, it's alright. I chose this life. I love my job, but sometimes I do wish I wasn't famous so I could have friends and go out without being recognized. When I saw you at the bookstore, I knew you were different. Unlike the other parents, you didn't seem to know me. Didn't seem to care. You treated me like a person, not a celebrity. So being able to talk to you, knowing you don't seem to know me, makes me feel normal. And now I'm talking too much and probably look crazy, I'm sorry."</p><p>"No, no, it's fine. I don't think you're crazy. I get what you mean. I'm just surprised that you're casually hanging out with us. We're strangers."</p><p>"Sure... strangers," Rio smiles softly, looking down at her feet. "But you're nice."</p><p>"You're nice too," she smiles. "Are you leaving tomorrow?"</p><p>"Yeah, have to go back to L.A to record the audiobook of my new book. Then I have some free time, then I have a new movie to shoot."</p><p>"Fuck, you work a lot."</p><p>"I like it. Playing characters is fun. One day I'm gonna play a mother, the next day a psycho killer obsessed with an FBI agent. I love the fact that every new character I play is very different from the last one. And writing children's books is a funny activity I do on the side. I'm a creative person, I need to do creative things or I go crazy."</p><p>"I don't know how you manage all this. I'm already overwhelmed with my job and Nicky."</p><p>Rio smiles. "He can't be that bad. He looks really sweet."</p><p>"He is. But he's also a seven-year-old boy. Sometimes, he gets loud and distracts me from working."</p><p>The author clears her throat. "And your work is...?"</p><p>"History teacher in high school."</p><p>"Ah, that's very... nice?"</p><p>Agatha chuckles. "I love history and sharing what I know, but the teenagers I teach are awful."</p><p>"So are all teenagers. By the way, I'll see you at the bookstore, right?"</p><p>Does she even have a choice? "Obviously."</p><p>"Amazing."</p><p>"Why, eager to see me?" Agatha smirks.</p><p>"What if I say yes? You're not too bad company."</p><p>"I could say the same about you. But just so you know, if anything happens to my son while he's under your supervision, I'll kill you."</p><p>"And risk going to jail and leave Nicky behind?"</p><p>The teacher smirks. "Who said I'd get caught?"</p><p>"Ouh, a real psychopath we have here. I like that."</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but there's a smile tugging at her lips. "Glad to know my homicidal tendencies are entertaining."</p><p>"I love crazy," Rio grins, leaning back against the bench.</p><p>Agatha glances toward Nicky, who's still happily talking to Lilia in front of the Stegosaurus. "Thanks, by the way. For being nice to him. I think that's gonna be the best day he's ever had."</p><p>"No problem. As I said, he's a really smart kid, and talking to him is actually enjoyable. He really does love dinosaurs. A real little nerd."</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, but before she can respond, Nicky comes running back toward them. "Mama, Rio! You have to come see this one! It's huge!"</p><p>Rio stands up at the same time Agatha does, her smile softening as she looks down at Nicky, whose grin reaches his eyes once again. "Guess that's our cue."</p><p>The woman follows Nicky to yet another skeleton, and Agatha watches them with a warm feeling in her chest. A famous actress is walking around a museum with her son like it's the most normal thing in the world. What the fuck is going on? And she's nice. Really nice. And pretty. Really pretty.</p><p>Shaking her head, she decides to brush it off and focus on the moment.</p><p align="center">+++</p><p>"That was so cool!" Nicky says when they exit the museum, rushing down the stairs with a green diplodocus plushie in his hands, the one his mother got him at the gift store.</p><p>Agatha still can't really process what happened. They spent over an hour visiting the museum—or, well, Rio and Nicky spent an hour visiting and reading every single sign; Agatha just trailed behind and looked at some things while her son was having the time of his life with his favorite author.</p><p>She still can't believe it. That was more than unexpected, but she's not complaining. Nicky had a lot of fun with Rio (Agatha's a bit hurt he didn't seem to care about her anymore in that moment, but can you blame him?), and she took many photos of them together as little memories. What are the chances that this happens again? Close to zero. They'll probably never see Rio again after today, so these memories are important, especially for her little boy.</p><p>Now, they're all following Nicky down the stairs. The sun is out, and the temperatures are higher than they were this morning. Agatha's purple sweater might be too much right now, especially if they walk under the warm sun, so she decides to take it off. Thankfully, she wore a white t-shirt underneath, just in case. Just a plain white shirt, the simplest.</p><p>She stops at the end of the stairs, sets her bag down on the ground, and pulls her sweater over her head. She can feel the change in temperature immediately as the cool air hits her uncovered stomach. Which is... not normal.</p><p><em>Fuck.</em> Her shirt is coming up with it. Great.</p><p>"Wait, let me help you." Rio's voice is slightly muffled through the purple fabric covering Agatha's face, but she still recognizes it (how would she not?). Then there are fingers on her ribs, soft and cold against her warm skin. Gently, they find the hem of her t-shirt and pull it back down so it doesn't go with the sweater.</p><p>Once she finally gets the sweater off, Agatha looks up. Her blue eyes meet Rio's hazel ones, and to her surprise, neither of them dares break eye contact. Rio is still close, her hands lingering on Agatha's sides for a second before she steps back and clears her throat, breaking the gaze. After a few seconds, she looks like she's about to say something, but Nicky's voice cuts in before she can.</p><p>"Mama, I'm hungry!"</p><p>Right. Of course. Agatha glances at her phone: it's already a bit past noon.</p><p>Before she can suggest finding somewhere to eat before going to the bookstore, Rio speaks. "I know a quiet spot nearby, if you're okay with joining us? No pressure, of course. I just thought... you know, since we're all here together and going to the bookstore later—"</p><p>"Yeah, sure," Agatha answers without thinking. She'd be crazy to refuse this. Like, padded-room crazy. Who on earth would refuse to eat with someone as exceptional as Rio Vidal? And not because she's a celebrity, but because she's so sweet and smart. She really does seem to get along with Nicky, too, which is a huge bonus. Thank God she's not one of those Hollywood bitches but a nice, simple, discreet woman.</p><p>"Oh. Okay." Rio smiles. "Great, that's... that's great. It's not far, just a few minutes walk away, and that's some of the best food I've ever had in New York. You'll like it."</p><p>"Alright, I trust you. Lead the way."</p>
