<p>
<strong>1 month until the 2025 Euros.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>“And do you think Spain are ready?”<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t bother hiding the grin that flew onto her face.<br/>
</p><p>“We just won a World Cup, what do you think?”<br/>
</p><p>Everyone in the press conference laughed.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And Rio Vidal Spain’s number ten, has done it again!” The commentator screamed. “That’s her second goal in three minutes! The Spanish Stargirl could very well get a hat-trick in this Spain vs England friendly here at Wembley Stadium this evening.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“But England won the last Euros.” One of the journalists commented.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded. “Very true. We won’t let them do it again.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Hold on, what do we have here?! Beautiful dribble from England’s Golden Girl down the left side, brilliant pass to Kale just outside the box. Oh! And she’s making a run for it – perfect cross by – GOALLLLLL!! Agatha Harkness puts it right in the top of the net!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“They are a tough team to beat,” another journalist added.<br/>
</p><p>“They are,” Rio agreed.<br/>
</p><p>“Especially with players like your teammate at Barcelona, Agatha Harkness. You two are fantastic when put together. You are friends, others often speculate more…but when pitted against each other…”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“There seems to be a bit of a…tussle? On the pitch as the two Barcelona teammates – oh, and Harkness has gone for a shove there. Vidal doesn’t seem to be holding back either. Looks like Wu-Gulliver has had to step in, drag her teammate away.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“…You two can get quite feisty.”<br/>
</p><p>“She wants to win,” Rio laughed. “I also want to win. Yes, we’re teammates when we play for our club, but this isn’t club football.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“I will say that wasn’t the cleanest of tackles from Harkness. All Vidal needs is one bad fall and she’s off the pitch for another eight months.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“And how’s your knee?” Some other journalist asked.<br/>
</p><p>“I can play. That’s all that matters.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“That’s it. Final whistle. Two all for this England vs Spain game with two goals from Rio Vidal and a goal and an assist from Harkness, last England goal by Kale.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“The Euros are really gearing up to be something special. The quality of the two favourites going into this tournament…I don’t think we’ve seen it before.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“So just to confirm,” a BBC news reporter began, drawing closer to Rio behind the panel. “You think Spain are going to win the Euros? Beat the English?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I’m just saying the other teams should be scared. We’re greedy. A World Cup is not enough.” She got up.<br/>
</p><p>“But Miss Vidal…what about Harkness? She is your biggest competitor.”<br/>
</p><p>“Gold comes from stars.”<br/>
</p><p>It was all Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>The stands were clearing out; the Spanish and English players dotted about the pitch mingling. This was customary after a friendly, as most of the teams knew each other through their clubs or the many years of history of playing for their countries.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio and Alice were talking to England’s captain, Natasha Romonoff, when dark brown locked with deep blue, borderline grey. Her white England kit was covered in grass stains, and her long, dark hair was in two Dutch braids.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio couldn’t help the smirk.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Never could.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Good game,” Agatha told her as their hands clasped.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You almost took my knee out,” Rio scolded.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You had the ball,” came the reply.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>They didn’t let go of each other’s hands.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh, I did?” Rio said sarcastically. “It’s almost as if that’s the entire point of football.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Grey eyes rolled. “Oh, really?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>That godforsaken British accent.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>A pale thumb began running over olive knuckles, and Rio’s body began to come alive.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“But I’m serious. You fuck up my knee, I kill you.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha’s lips curled. “How you gonna do that if you can’t walk?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Trust me, I’ll find a way.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You threatening me, Vidal?” That smirk was unwavering, grey eyes even dilated.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Thought it was obvious,” Agatha replied in that voice that made Rio sweat.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was Jen jumping on Alice’s back that pulled brown eyes off of grey.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Good game, Ali,” Jen said as Alice spun them.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Thank you, thank you.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Jen climbed off Alice’s back, and Agatha pulled Rio towards them by her red jersey.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Euros in a month,” Alice commented.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Prepare to lose,” Agatha said dramatically, earning her a laugh from her teammates.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Who was it that lost the WC?” Rio teased, earning groans from her opposition.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Give it a rest, would you?” Natasha huffed.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Never. If you won the WC, we’d never hear the end of it.” Alice turned to Jen, “Just like you don’t shut up about how we won the Champions League.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“As we shouldn’t,” Jen argued. “Arsenal on top,” she continued before Alice and Jen did their stupid little handshake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio and Agatha rolled their eyes.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Who’s got a presser first?” Natasha asked.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Me,” Rio replied. “I should go.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Don’t chat too much shit,” Jen warned.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“That’s a tall order,” Rio grinned as she walked away.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Wait,” Agatha called.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio stopped.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You’ve got a little something.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Grey eyes remained locked on dark brown as she wiped at Rio’s bottom lip. Agatha’s thumb slid easily into Rio’s mouth. She tasted dirt, grass and sweat.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe Rio heard a camera snapping, maybe Rio felt a cameraman coming up behind them. Certainly nothing mattered than the pools of stormy grey she was getting lost in.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“There,” Agatha concluded, her voice a silky breath. “Couldn’t have you talking shit with mud on your face.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio’s legs felt like jelly, and it had absolutely nothing to do with the fact she’d been running about a football pitch for 75 minutes.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I have people for that,” Rio answered.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha shrugged. “None of them as good-looking.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>And boy was she right.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“See you at the Euros.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Nah, I’m taking you out for dinner,” Rio replied.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh, yeah?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio said nothing, just walked towards the tunnels.<br/>
</em>

<strong>Three weeks until the 2025 Euros.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Was it right to be sitting across from your teammate/opposition right before a major tournament? Sharing a meal and conversing as if they wouldn’t be prepared to kill each other just to get their hands on that Euros trophy…probably not. But Rio Vidal and Agatha Harkness had never been ones for rules.<br/>
</p><p>“And I’ll make sure to send you flowers in the post when we annihilate you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio arched a brow, her silver eyebrow piercing shifting. “Chivalry is dead. You can’t even deliver them yourself?”<br/>
</p><p>“Ha!” Agatha said, pointing across the table. “So you know you’re going to lose.”<br/>
</p><p>“¿Qué?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fucking loved when Rio spoke in her mother tongue.<br/>
</p><p>“You said ‘can’t even deliver them yourself’ meaning you’re expecting to get flowers because you know we’re gonna win.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Not what I meant.”<br/>
</p><p>“Then what did you mean?” Agatha challenged.<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes narrowed. “How about we don’t talk about the Euros…or football for that matter,” Rio mumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fell back in her chair. “What would we talk about then?”<br/>
</p><p>And that look Rio let slip onto her face…what was that?<br/>
</p><p>They always talked football; it had been Rio’s conversation starter.<br/>
</p><p>When Agatha moved from Chelsea to Barcelona at nineteen, Rio was the first person who spoke to her. Agatha often wondered why. Maybe it was because she was the only other nineteen-year-old, maybe it was because Rio found Agatha pretty…<br/>
</p><p>No, it was definitely because she found Agatha pretty.<br/>
</p><p>They’d become thick as thieves after that. One conversation in Spanglish, four years of friendship and pushing the boundaries of more later, and now they were sitting opposite each other at a dinner table.<br/>
</p><p>“We talk about other things,” Rio whispered.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t seem confident about that fact.”<br/>
</p><p>“We do,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Go on then,” Agatha urged.<br/>
</p><p>“We talk about how picky of an eater you are.” Rio looked at the olives on her plate that Agatha had taken out of her martini. “About how we like the same music. About how we-”<br/>
</p><p>“<em>We<em>,” Agatha scoffed.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Problem?” Rio leaned forward, eyebrows lifting in amusement. “You hate that word, don’t you?”<br/>
</p><p>Grey eyes narrowed. “No. It’s just we’re stuck with each other. My name isn’t mentioned without yours following, and vice versa. The press already think-”<br/>
</p><p>“We’re in looveee,” Rio sing-songed. “And are we?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha choked on her spit, and Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you in love with me, Agatha?”<br/>
</p><p>This didn’t feel like dinner conversation. This felt like a twenty-shots deep in the bathroom of a nightclub conversation.<br/>
</p><p>“I preferred when we were talking about football.”<br/>
</p><p>“And I prefer when we talk about us.”<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes never left grey, and a sick feeling twisted Agatha’s stomach.<br/>
</p><p>The boundaries of friendship and the push. That was their relationship in a nutshell. They didn’t talk about the blur of lines or the kissing or the fucking. And now Rio wanted to talk about love?<br/>
</p><p>“Win the Euros.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrowed. “What-”<br/>
</p><p>“Win the Euros,” Agatha repeated. “Then you’ll get your answer.”<br/>
</p><p>“Done.”<br/>
</p><p>“Just like that?”<br/>
</p><p>“Just like that,” Rio echoed. “I was already planning on winning; this is just an added bonus.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “And if I win-”<br/>
</p><p>“Which you definitely won’t now,” Rio interrupted.<br/>
</p><p>“If <em>I<em> win,” Agatha said loudly. “We never talk about this again.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio jerked her head. “But we don’t talk about this…<em>us<em> anyway.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Deal?” Agatha asked, ignoring Rio’s statement.<br/>
</p><p>Rio almost looked disgusted. The glare she was shooting Agatha made even her want to sit on a step and think about what she’d done.<br/>
</p><p>“Deal.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Women’s Euros Head Coaches press conference:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>“So, Lilia,” the reporter started. “Eighth year as England’s head coach, how do you feel going into this tournament? Are your years of experience going to help the team?”<br/>
</p><p>Lilia smiled. “We feel great. I am very confident in this year's team. You mentioned experience, and yes, I think it’s beneficial. A lot of the girls I have worked with before, and the new drafts I know will fit right in.”<br/>
</p><p>The reporter nodded. “You are a favourite going into these Euros, do you think your girls are feeling the pressure?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Lilia replied simply.<br/>
</p><p>The reporter paused, waiting for her to elaborate. “…Would you care to expand on that?”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Lilia smiled.<br/>
</p><p>The reporter scribbled something down before she continued:<br/>
</p><p>“Spain beat you during the World Cup.”<br/>
</p><p>And this was the first time Lilia wanted to let her smile drop. Way to state the fucking obvious.<br/>
</p><p>“They did, yes.”<br/>
</p><p>Spain’s dumb ass head coach, Esther Lopez, sniggered.<br/>
</p><p>Lilia wanted to drop kick her.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you prepared to beat them this Euros?”<br/>
</p><p>It was always the same questions repeated. ‘Do you want to beat Spain?’ ‘Are you going to beat Spain?’ ‘Can England beat them considering they lost the World Cup?’<br/>
</p><p>Lilia often wondered if reporters and journalists shared the same brain cell. Why could no one come up with original questions?<br/>
</p><p>“We are prepared for anything,” Lilia replied.<br/>
</p><p>“And what about Harkness and Vidal?”<br/>
</p><p>Lilia had been waiting for this question.<br/>
</p><p>“Rumours had been sparking long before the World Cup, and now they are back again, even louder this time some may argue. Do you think it’s right that England and Spain’s star players may be in a secret relationship?”<br/>
</p><p>Lilia laughed that fake laugh she did instead of going over to reporters and smacking them with their microphones.<br/>
</p><p>“What my players choose to do in their personal lives is none of my business.”<br/>
</p><p>“But surely you have some thoughts on the matter,” the reporter prompted.<br/>
</p><p>“I do not.”<br/>
</p><p>The reporter frowned before she turned her attention to Esther.<br/>
</p><p>“Esther, what do you think?”<br/>
</p><p>“As long as it doesn’t affect Vidal’s performance, I don’t care.”<br/>
</p><p>“And what if it does?” The reporter pressed.<br/>
</p><p>“Then precautions will have to be put in place.”<br/>
</p><p>Lilia side-eyed her but said nothing.<br/>
</p><p>Precautions? As if Vidal and Harkness weren’t adults, professionals at that.<br/>
</p><p>This was going to be a long press conference.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Billy fluffed his hair once more before the camerawomen pointed at him.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…welcome to the lead up to the Women’s Euros 2025! I am your host for the BBC women’s football TikTok, Billy Maximoff!” The camera panned before it returned to Billy. “Today we are on Carnaby Street asking the British public what they are most excited to see this tournament.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ma’am…ma’am,” Billy called after a woman in a black ’10, Harkness’ shirt.<br/>
</p><p>The woman pulled out an AirPod, a startled look on her face when she noticed the camera and the teenager with a mic.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes?”<br/>
</p><p>“What are you most excited about for this upcoming Euros?”<br/>
</p><p>The woman blinked before she steeled herself. “To see England take home another trophy!”<br/>
</p><p>“So you’re saying two for two?” Billy questioned.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes. It’s coming home again!”<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you, ma’am. I love your braids by the way,” as the woman walked away.<br/>
</p><p>Billy chased after his second victim. “Sir! Sir!”<br/>
</p><p>The bald man in a suit stopped.<br/>
</p><p>“Will you be watching the women’s Euros?” Billy panted.<br/>
</p><p>“Course!”<br/>
</p><p>“Brilliant! What are you most excited about?”<br/>
</p><p>“To see the girls outshine the men’s team again. What an absolute mess they made of the last Euros.”<br/>
</p><p>“Very true. Thank you, sir!” Billy said as he ran to a group of teenage girls outside <em>Subdued.<br/>
</em></p><p>“Girls,” Billy started.<br/>
</p><p>The four girls blinked a number of times before they straightened up and started posing for the camera.<br/>
</p><p>“Will you be watching the women’s Euros?”<br/>
</p><p>“Duh,” the redhead replied. The other girls mumbled their agreements.<br/>
</p><p>“And…and what are you most excited about?” Because by this point, Billy was out of breath.<br/>
</p><p>“To see what happens between Vidal and Harkness,” the brunette grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Her friends agreed enthusiastically.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you mean?” Billy asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Well, it’s obvious that they’re dating,” the blonde told him. “And if they end up having to play against each other in <em>another<em> final like the World Cup…there’s going to be drama.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The girl with an afro brought her phone up to the camera. It played a TikTok of Vidal and Harkness during Barcelona training practices. Stolen glances, secret touches, hushed giggles.<br/>
</p><p>“They’re in love,” the ginger stated.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The Lionesses documentary.<br/>
</p><p>Why, why, why, Agatha’s management had signed her up for it, she didn’t know. She was more than happy to participate in anything the team required of her, dumb video trends for the social medias, the podcast, the endless commercials.<br/>
</p><p>The documentary was different.<br/>
</p><p>The documentary meant spilling her guts and letting the entire world dissect it.<br/>
</p><p>She sat on the most uncomfortable chair known to man, a black backdrop hiding the sports hall of St George’s Park. They’d put down a carpet, three cameras were in front of her, and there were bright lights in her face.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled at her black jersey, which suddenly felt too tight.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you ready to begin, Agatha?” The interviewer asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…” she glanced over at Jen, who was nodding her head encouragingly. Agatha cleared her throat. “Y…yeah.”<br/>
</p><p>“Brilliant.”<br/>
</p><p>The camerawoman counted down from three, and the recording began.<br/>
</p><p>The starting questions weren’t hard-hitting. ‘Recall how you felt when you won the 2022 Euros being one of the younger players on the team as you were only nineteen.’<br/>
</p><p>Ecstatic. Agatha felt Ecstatic.<br/>
</p><p>‘What kind of team does Lilia nurture?’<br/>
</p><p>One that uplifts.<br/>
</p><p>‘How did it feel to lose the World Cup to Spain?’<br/>
</p><p>Like complete and utter shit.<br/>
</p><p>“But England are never done,” Agatha said. “Yes, we lost, but that just means we have to come back ten times stronger.”<br/>
</p><p>And Agatha would be because she couldn’t lose to Rio, not when Rio wanted that question answered.<br/>
</p><p>So…Agatha may be in love with Rio Vidal. But that was no one’s business but her own.<br/>
</p><p>It had slapped her in the face. She hadn’t realised post fuck, post-match with adrenaline coursing through her veins. No, it had been when they were doing something dumb…<br/>
</p><p>Shooting water at each other from plastic straws.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had found some in the Barcelona training facilities, and because stumbling across plastic straws now was like stumbling across a pile of gold, they’d stashed them away in Rio’s locker in case someone tried to steal them…as if they weren’t the ones to steal them in the first place.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had started it; she’d sucked water from her water bottle into the straw and shot it at Agatha. And Agatha being Agatha, couldn’t let Rio get away unscathed. What started as a measly little spray of water ended up as Agatha tipping a whole jug over Rio’s head.<br/>
</p><p>The thing was…Rio hadn’t gotten mad. She’d just laughed with her hair drenched and her kit soaked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha realised Rio rarely got mad at her when everyone else did:<br/>
</p><p>Her coaches.<br/>
</p><p>Her managers.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother.<br/>
</p><p>Never Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you think moving to Barcelona has affected your performance when playing for the national team considering a lot of the girls play in the WSL?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “No. At the end of the day, we all play for different teams, just because I’m in Spain doesn’t make me any different.”<br/>
</p><p>“And there’s no animosity around your former Chelsea teammates?” The interviewer teased.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “No. I only have love for them and everyone else on the team, management, etc. Playing for my country is the biggest honour and I would never say or do anything to anyone to tarnish that.”<br/>
</p><p>The smile the interviewer had been wearing faded a little and Agatha knew she wasn’t going to like the question that followed.<br/>
</p><p>“A lot of people were surprised to see you on the team after it was announced your mother passed away a few weeks ago.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you have to say to those people who think you should be taking some time off?”<br/>
</p><p>“My mother wouldn’t have wanted me to,” Agatha replied. “She’s an England legend and nothing was more important to her than the game.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had the scars and bruises to prove it.<br/>
</p><p>“She would want me to go out and play to the best of my abilities, help England bring it home again. Like I said, the English are never done,” Agatha paused before she added. “And we’re not.”</p>

<strong>Two weeks until the 2025 Euros.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Nike commercial re-shoots for their ‘Scary Good’ campaign. Maybe if Rio didn’t have a European Championship to prepare for, she wouldn’t have minded, but she fucking did.<br/>
</p><p>‘Couldn’t this wait?’ Rio had asked her manager.<br/>
</p><p>‘You want re-shoots for a commercial set to come out for the Euros…to wait?’ Her manager laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>Now, she was in her Barcelona kit, dark shoulder-length hair tied in a ponytail, on a sound stage. She rolled the ball she’d been given onto her foot and started doing keep-ups as she waited for the next set of instructions.<br/>
</p><p>“And Agatha, if you want to slide in there.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked up to see her opponent also in her Barca kit, hair in those signature Dutch braids, nails already painted in red and white like she always did in preparation for international tournaments.<br/>
</p><p>“Vidal,” Agatha said as she stood beside her.<br/>
</p><p>They hadn’t spoken since their dinner, since Rio asked Agatha if she was in love with her.<br/>
</p><p>“Harkness,” Rio nodded curtly.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay,” the director clapped. “We’re just going to get some shots of you two messing around. We’re not sure if we’ll use them, but we might as well get something considering you’re both here.”<br/>
</p><p>The two girls glanced at each other before they stepped back.<br/>
</p><p>“Are we supposed to look like teammates or opponents when doing this?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s go both,” the director replied. “Teammates first.”<br/>
</p><p>The director yelled action, and Rio did a few keep-ups with her feet before balancing the ball on her right knee then passing to Agatha, who stopped the ball with her chest, let it roll down her body and then trapped it with her left foot.<br/>
</p><p>They did a series of tricks before they passed to each other, and the laughter that left Rio’s mouth came as it always did when she had a ball and Agatha. Sometimes Rio felt like this was all she needed. Not a World Cup, not the Euros, not her Ballon d'Or Féminin.<br/>
</p><p>Just a ball and Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!” When Agatha nutmegged her.<br/>
</p><p>“Pay attention, Vidal,” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>“Cut!”<br/>
</p><p>Oh, right, because this wasn’t a practice session at Barcelona.<br/>
</p><p>“Girls, remember you’re on camera, okay?” The director told them.<br/>
</p><p>“Sí,” Rio said through a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha giggled.<br/>
</p><p>The director ran a hand through her hair. “Okay, let’s get some of you as opponents.”<br/>
</p><p>And it was like a switch flipped.<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes hardened, and so did grey.<br/>
</p><p>“Action!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha went straight in for a tackle, and Rio pulled out her favourite trick, a Cruyff turn. She dodged her opponent with ease, but Agatha could always keep up. Rio sprinted down the sound stage, and Agatha closed her in, forcing her towards the wall. Rio stopped the ball mid-run, leaving Agatha behind as she broke away.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, and try to keep the ball between you,” the director called. “I can’t do anything with a memory card full of cat and mouse.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio sighed, slowing to a walk.<br/>
</p><p>Stupid.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha took the ball off her and grinned before she did a rainbow flick.<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. Always the fucking performer.<br/>
</p><p>The next couple of takes went roughly the same. One of them had possession, the other would dispossess them and vice versa. The claws had come out too. Neither of them hesitated to pull a shirt or push a limb.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank god they’re teammates,” Rio heard her manager mumble to Agatha’s in between their next take.<br/>
</p><p>“Right,” Agatha’s manager replied. “They’d probably kill each other.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>One week until the 2025 Euros.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Bern, Switzerland – Euros media day:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>How many times did Agatha have to stand and smile as the photographer took the same photo of her pointing at the camera before she lost her mind? She was thinking she had three more photos left in her before that happened.<br/>
</p><p>She was in the middle, Natasha and Jen on either side. Again, she was pointing at the camera whilst Jen and Natasha leaned into her, their arms crossed.<br/>
</p><p>She could hear Rio outside laughing and nattering away. Agatha could pick out her voice out of thousands…because they spent so much time together, no other reason.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright girls, and let's do a couple with your captain in the middle,” the photographer said.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha and Agatha swapped places.<br/>
</p><p>“Nat, when are we gonna be done with this?” Jen muttered.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha laughed. “Soon, but we’ve got individual interviews after this.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha groaned as Jen rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“None of that please, girls,” the photographer scolded. “Camera faces please.”<br/>
</p><p>A lifetime passed before they were finally done with photos.<br/>
</p><p>“My cheeks are going to fall off from smiling,” Jen said as they grabbed their water bottles and exited the room.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha laughed. “Wasn’t that bad.”<br/>
</p><p>“This is why you’re captain,” Agatha said, taking a sip. “You’re always so <em>positive<em>.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio, Alice and their captain, Gamora, were next in line in the queue of teams waiting for photos.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s up, Ali?” Jen greeted.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Alice smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Grey eyes locked with dark brown before they shifted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tried not to pull a face.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, G,” Natasha said to her Man City teammate.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha and Gamora hugged, and Rio <em>still<em> hadn’t looked at Agatha again.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>The fuck?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Hello?” Agatha said, and this time she did pull a face.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi,” Rio said dismissively.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck is your problem?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t acknowledge her.<br/>
</p><p>The other teams in the hallway were looking at them now.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, Spain you’re up,” the photographer said, popping his head out.<br/>
</p><p>Rio disappeared into the room without a word.<br/>
</p><p>“Er…see you guys around,” Alice said before she followed.<br/>
</p><p>“Good luck if I don’t see you,” Gamora told them.<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks, you too,” Natasha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“The fuck was that about?” Jen said as the England girls walked down the corridor.<br/>
</p><p>“Not a clue,” Agatha answered.<br/>
</p><p>And she didn’t; all she knew was that she was fucking pissed.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>More fucking cameras, another uncomfortable chair, a new set of blinding lights.<br/>
</p><p>More of the same questions.<br/>
</p><p>More time being wasted when Agatha could be on a pitch.<br/>
</p><p>She guessed that’s what she got for being a star player; everyone always wanted to know your thoughts, everyone always wanted your photo for something.<br/>
</p><p>To say she hated this part of the job would be an understatement.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, and to make matters worse, she was still pissed about the way Rio had acted half an hour ago. What the hell had prompted her to behave the way she had? This wasn’t their first rodeo; they’d competed against each other on the international stage before, but Rio had <em>never<em> done what she’d just done.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>She’d never ignored Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“Lilia is your head coach for another major tournament. How do you feel about that?” The interviewer asked.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha suppressed an eyeroll. She’d been asked this question so many fucking times.<br/>
</p><p>“Like I said, what she brings to the team is something no one else can. She’s the best. When you play for her, you only want to be the best.”<br/>
</p><p>The interviewer nodded. “England and Spain are the favourites going into this Euros. Do you think you’ll be ready to go up against your teammate Rio Vidal if it comes down to it?”<br/>
</p><p>What a dumb ass question.<br/>
</p><p>“Of course.”<br/>
</p><p>And she shouldn’t have said what she said next.<br/>
</p><p>“Vidal still isn’t playing to the best of her abilities, hasn’t for a long time. While her knee injury is unfortunate, I know at Barca we definitely suffered when she couldn’t play, it’s great for England.”<br/>
</p><p>Yeah…she definitely shouldn’t have said that.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck you, Vidal.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Because that’s what Rio got for ignoring her.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“And when did you start feeling pain?” Rio’s physio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Properly? Today. It’d been playing up over the past couple of days, but nothing as severe as this morning.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hm,” the physio said, her glasses falling to the tip of her nose as she pressed on Rio’s knee.<br/>
</p><p>This couldn’t be happening.<br/>
</p><p>It was Rio’s 23/24 season all over again. That fatal day, that fatal tackle. Eight months off the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>“She’ll still be able to play though, right?” Esther asked, tapping her foot impatiently.<br/>
</p><p>The physio pressed on Rio’s knee again. This time a pain shot up Rio’s leg, making it bounce.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, but she’ll have to tape it up, maybe play fewer minutes.”<br/>
</p><p>“No!” Rio jumped in. “I can’t let the team down like that.”<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t want to risk making your injury worse,” the physio replied. “Take the steps necessary to look after yourself. If that means playing less minutes Rio, you must.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio fell back on the exam table, folding her arms over her face. She couldn’t help the tears that pricked her eyes. She’d been waiting all year for these games, and now she couldn’t help the team in the way she wanted to.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fine,” Esther told her. “At least you can still play. We’ll work something out in the team meeting later.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, and her coach left.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Word had gotten out about Rio’s knee.<br/>
</p><p>People had started speculating ever since Agatha made that comment in her interview, and she couldn’t help but think that Agatha had jinxed her. Rio didn’t understand why Agatha had said it in the first place. Sure, they trash-talked <em>on the field<em>, never off it. Never to the press.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>News article, after news article, social media post, after social media post would be about her. Spain’s star girl potentially out of the tournament because of her knee. The doom scrolling had gotten so bad Alice had to take her phone away.<br/>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t seen Agatha since media day, and she thought that was probably for the best. There was no telling what Rio would do if brown eyes met grey.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“What’s this one for?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Women’s Euros TikTok,” Billy replied. “You ready?”<br/>
</p><p>Jen nodded. “Let’s go.”<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, counting down from three,” Billy said as he pointed the phone at her. “Three, two, one.” He pressed record. “When you think of the Euros, what player comes to mind?”<br/>
</p><p>“Jennifer Kale,” Jen replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Alice answered.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha smiled. “Agatha Harkness.”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio Vidal, easy,” Anastasia, France’s captain said.<br/>
</p><p>“I want to say Rio, but is she even playing now because of her knee?” Kate Bishop, one of England’s defenders questioned.<br/>
</p><p>“Cut! You can’t say that,” Billy scolded.<br/>
</p><p>“My bad,” Kate replied.<br/>
</p><p>“My captain Natasha Romonoff,” Ava Starr, England’s goalkeeper nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Gamora told the camera.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Agatha winked.<br/>
</p><p>Five more Rio Vidal’s were said before the woman herself stepped into the room to film her answer. Billy had to stop his jaw from hitting the floor. Yes, he was an England supporter through and through, but there was no denying the legend that was Rio Vidal.<br/>
</p><p>The press hadn’t been exaggerating. Rio’s knee injury looked <em>bad<em>; her knee taped up as she stepped in front of him.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Erm…I…hi,” Billy got out.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“I just want to say you are so cool and I can’t believe you’re here!” Billy rushed out.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Is your knee really that bad? Can you play? That would be such a shame if you couldn’t,” Billy rambled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s face twisted in frustration before she steeled herself. “My knee’s fine,” she nodded to the taping. “It’s just a safety precaution.”<br/>
</p><p>“You should tell the press that. People think it’s <em>really<em> bad.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed. “Noted. What am I doing?”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh…erm.”<br/>
</p><p>Billy went through the instructions, and Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“When you think of the Euros, what player comes to mind?”<br/>
</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Rio said when Billy pressed record.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>

<strong>Zurich, Switzerland – Day 1 of the 2025 Women’s Euros:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>First match of Group A: England vs France.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>“And we’re live,” the ITV producer announced.<br/>
</p><p>“Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us here in Zurich for the first match of the Women’s Euros 2025,” ITV’s Euros presenter Milly Hope said with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>“This is gearing up to be an interesting match as England and France go head-to-head in the first game of the tournament. I’m joined by Libby Matthews, former England player and Marie Allard, former France player. How do you feel these girls will be feeling right now? Marie, let’s start with you.”<br/>
</p><p>“I know the girls are hungry. Last Euros we made it to the semi-finals for the first time. We want more,” Marie replied.<br/>
</p><p>Milly nodded. “And Libby?”<br/>
</p><p>“We want it to stay home,” Libby grinned.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you think they have what it takes?”<br/>
</p><p>“Of course, especially with the first team Lilia has selected and the 4-3-3 formation that tends to work in our favour. Kale, Harkness and Romonoff up front is a team up that I would never want to be up against.”<br/>
</p><p>“Do you feel the same, Marie?”<br/>
</p><p>Marie laughed. “Yes, I would agree with Libby there. I definitely wouldn’t want to be up against those three, but I have to back my girls. I’m sure the English defence will have their hands full.”<br/>
</p><p>Milly turned to the camera. “You heard it here first, folks. You’re in for an interesting ninety minutes. Now off to the commentator box, see you all at half-time.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Nerves were normal. Nerves were good. Meant you were excited; meant you were ready.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha had won the toss up, England’s ball.<br/>
</p><p>The girls took a knee as they always did, always would to show their stance against discrimination and racism as the countdown rang out across the stadium.<br/>
</p><p>They were up by the count of four.<br/>
</p><p>“Three.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha jumped on her spot.<br/>
</p><p>“Two.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her neck.<br/>
</p><p>“One.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Here we go! The champions of Europe here for their first match of the Women’s Euros 2025. Lovely ball from goalkeeper Ava Starr there. This is her twenty-fifth cap.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha received the ball down the left-hand side and made quick work of dribbling towards the box.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“France appears to be asleep here. Everyone knows you can’t leave Harkness unmarked like that. Beautiful pass.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Jen received the ball at the edge of the box, crossed it to Natasha who was making a run for it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh...oh…unlucky for Romonoff who kicks it just wide. I thought we were going to get an early goal. She won’t be happy with that.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Natasha shook her head as she walked away from the goal.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha said as she ran past. “Next one.”<br/>
</p><p>The next twenty minutes of Agatha’s life were spent running up and down the pitch. Possession was almost fifty-fifty. England would get the ball, a French player would intercept it and so on. She wasn’t tired, nowhere near, but frustrated? An understatement. The French hadn’t let them get another shot on goal.<br/>
</p><p>That frustration, as it usually did, was coming out in her performance. From the messy tackles to the shirt pulling, Agatha had ended up on the referee's radar.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Ouch! Studs to the knee that looked mighty painful.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The French weren’t helping her out either. They seemed to want to injure every England player on the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck?!” Agatha screamed as Natasha rolled around on the floor holding her knee.<br/>
</p><p>Dubois ran away from the tackle with a grin.<br/>
</p><p>“Nat, you okay?”<br/>
</p><p>The redhead shook her head, and Agatha called for the medics.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“The England captain hasn’t gotten up yet. This doesn’t look too good for England.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Jen came up behind her, and Agatha handed her a water bottle from the bottles that were brought over.<br/>
</p><p>“You good?” Jen asked once she’d gulped down her water.<br/>
</p><p>“One of us needs to score, Jen.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen nodded. “We will.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And Romonoff is up again. I bet the girls are relieved. It wasn’t looking good for a moment there.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“England’s ball. Lovely dribble from Harkness, breezing easily past those French defenders and into the penalty box, lining up to shoot and oh, she’s down! Another messy tackle from Dubois. This could be an England penalty.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha saw fucking red.<br/>
</p><p>She ripped herself off the ground and shoved at Dubois, making her stumble.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck is your problem?!” She shoved her again, and Dubois fell.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs! Calm down!” Jen yelled as she swooped in to pull her away.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wasn’t having it.<br/>
</p><p>“You-”<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha! Calm the fuck down!” Jen repeated as she held her head, forcing her to look at her.<br/>
</p><p>The ref came over and, to Agatha’s delight, held up a yellow card for Dubois.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Serves her fucking right.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Two yellow cards. Wow.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Are you fucking with me?” Agatha screeched as the ref walked away. “How am I getting a yellow when she was the one who-”<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs! Calm down,” Natasha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>If one more person told her to calm down, Agatha was going to fucking lose it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>"VAR check for that potential England penalty.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>It was the longest sixty seconds of Agatha’s life.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“The referee making her way back onto the pitch…what’s the verdict? Oh! Penalty for England!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“And England’s Golden Girl is stepping up for the challenge. Can she do it? Score the first goal of the tournament and give England the lead?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The whistle blew.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sucked in a deep breath, cleared her mind of any doubts and ran zig-zagged towards the ball. She felt her left leg lift, felt it sweep across her body, felt her foot connect with the ball…<br/>
</p><p>Felt the stadium erupt when it shot passed the goalkeeper and into the back of the net.<br/>
</p><p>Adrenaline hit her all at once. She bolted to the edge of the pitch to greet the screams and chants of the fans. She felt weight hit her back when Jen jumped on her. Agatha laughed, her best friend pulling her into a hug.<br/>
</p><p>“You gotta do it!” Jen yelled over the noise.<br/>
</p><p>Happily.<br/>
</p><p>Jen took a step back and Agatha did her signature celebration, bowing before the crowd as they yelled her name, waved their flags, beat their drums.<br/>
</p><p>“Well done, Aggs!” Natasha screamed as the rest of the team joined them.<br/>
</p><p>Her teammates clapped her on the back and hugged her before they ran back onto the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>“Fucking finally,” Agatha muttered to herself as she went to reset.<br/>
</p><p>The rest of the second half flew by, and with only two minutes of extra time, Agatha was back in the changing rooms before she knew it.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And the second half of this England vs France match begins. It’s still 1-0 to England. If you’re now joining us and wondering who those two yellow cards are for, one is for French defender Manon Dubois and England’s number 10 Agatha Harkness.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha ran up the pitch. She didn’t know what the French had eaten during the break, but they had upped their game significantly. They’d only been playing for ten minutes, but England had barely touched the ball.<br/>
</p><p>She watched as France’s number two volleyed the ball into the box, watched France’s number nine nutmeg Bishop, watched France’s number nine slide the ball into the right-hand corner of the net.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Goal for France! What a shot from Martin!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The stadium erupted again, but it wasn’t the English. Agatha shook her head. How could they let this happen?<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“One all in the fifty-seventh minute. This game still has time. Anything is possible tonight here in Zurich.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Three more shots on the French goal, none of them landing. That frustration from earlier was back at full force.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t explain it, the shift, but it was like her team was giving up. Maybe it was fatigue, maybe it was that godforsaken French goal, but the game wasn’t over yet, and she was sick of the girls acting like it was.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on!” She yelled as the English pushed back.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“First substitutions from either team tonight. England’s number 10 is coming off for nineteen-year-old Morgan Stark. This is her third England cap.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Was Lilia fucking serious? Why the fuck was she pulling Agatha off the field when they needed another goal?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed, jogging to the edge of the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>“Good luck,” Agatha said as they hugged.<br/>
</p><p>“Thanks, Aggs,” Morgan replied and left.<br/>
</p><p>“You need your rest,” Lilia spoke as she took in the irritated expression on Agatha’s face.<br/>
</p><p>Lilia knew her too well.<br/>
</p><p>“Good job, Agatha,” her coach smiled before she returned to her pacing.<br/>
</p><p>The bench clapped her on the back and congratulated her, which Agatha accepted with a forced smile. She was fucking fuming as she yanked on her water bottle cap and chugged down water. It wasn’t the fact that she’d been subbed off that was getting to her; it was the fact that she couldn’t do more.<br/>
</p><p>England wasn’t winning, and in Agatha’s eyes, that meant she’d failed.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And it’s hit the crossbar! Another close call for England there.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha felt sick.<br/>
</p><p>They were the reigning Champions of Europe. They couldn’t <em>lose.<br/>
</em></p><p>
<em>“WHAT A GOAL! France takes the lead in the second minute of added time! Last year's Euros champions are behind!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Final whistle.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“That’s it! The French have beaten the English!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And just like that, England had lost.</p>

<p>A mic was shoved in her face, a reporter beside a camera, and all Agatha wanted to do was get off the fucking pitch and reset, recover, lock in, and go again.<br/>
</p><p>“Disappointing results today,” the reporter began.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah, no fucking shit.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, forcing a smile. “Yeah, I mean, this wasn’t our best performance. We have to acknowledge that.”<br/>
</p><p>“What do you think went wrong?”<br/>
</p><p>Could Agatha stab this reporter's eyes out?<br/>
</p><p>“There was a lot of outside noise before the game from the country and the press. Today, I think we let it get the best of us instead of focusing on the win.”<br/>
</p><p>“What do you want to do differently next match?”<br/>
</p><p>So many fucking things.<br/>
</p><p>“Fight harder. We’ll recover, we’ll train, we’ll be better.”<br/>
</p><p>The reporter smiled. “Your best friend and teammate at Barcelona is playing tomorrow.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>For fucksake.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Ever since that TikTok came out, ‘When you think of the Euros, what player do you think of?’ the mention of Rio left an even bitter taste in her mouth. The ‘Rio’s’ outweighed the ‘Agatha’s’ by a long shot.<br/>
</p><p>Why?<br/>
</p><p>Why was the Euros Rio? What made her so special that even Agatha couldn’t separate the two, that even Agatha had wanted to utter Rio’s name before she came back to herself.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you have anything you want to say to her?” The interviewer continued.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I hope you fucking lose.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Hope your knee’s okay,” Agatha said, flashing a faux smile.<br/>

<strong>Bern, Switzerland – Day 2 of the 2025 Women’s Euros:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>First match of Group B: Spain vs Portugal.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Hope your knee’s okay.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>It taunted Rio. Agatha’s voice, the smile she gave when she said it.<br/>
</p><p>On a loop.<br/>
</p><p>Her opposition was adamant about keeping the trash-talking off the field. Rio still didn’t fucking get it. She hadn’t said a word about Agatha to the press.<br/>
</p><p>Or maybe she did get it.<br/>
</p><p>Tactical warfare.<br/>
</p><p>Ever since Agatha’s first interview, it was all Rio would think about. She waited for the next ones to drop, anticipating her name on Agatha’s tongue. Before she went to sleep at night, she didn’t think about the game, about the win; she thought about the why.<br/>
</p><p>Why the fuck was Agatha doing this?<br/>
</p><p>She’d been off her game so much that her best friend had noticed. Rio had told Alice it was her knee.<br/>
</p><p>Rio needed to get it together.<br/>
</p><p>Kick off. Portugal’s ball.<br/>
</p><p>Rio watched as they kicked it to their goalkeeper, jogging at a comfortable pace to mark Portugal’s number six. Immediately, Rio noticed that Portugal’s pass game was weak. They kept making the most obvious plays, and because of this…<br/>
</p><p>Rio stuck her foot out, intercepting the ball that was supposed to be going to Portugal’s number six. The crowd roared as soon as she touched the ball. Rio made quick work of dribbling up the centre of the pitch. She wouldn’t question the fact that no one had attempted to tackle her, that Portugal was letting her get away so easily.<br/>
</p><p>The goal was up ahead, and she finally heard the harsh thuds of someone coming up behind her.<br/>
</p><p>Too fucking late.<br/>
</p><p>Rio struck the ball; it hit the crossbar before dropping into the net.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“There was absolutely no saving that! Spain’s first goal of the tournament! Who else would do it other than the Spanish Stargirl?! Look at that grin, look at that passion! Knee injury or not, Rio Vidal will be on the pitch.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The media had been waiting for a reaction. For Rio to make a dig at Agatha or prey on England’s downfall. But Rio had been waiting for this. The centre stage where a goal roared volumes, screamed and shouted and drowned out any snide remark Agatha could ever make.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t done, wanted another.<br/>
</p><p>Ten minutes later, she had the chance to get just that.<br/>
</p><p>Alice had been fouled, and it was a free kick to Spain.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was miles away from the goal, verging on the halfway line. She should pass, get the ball closer to the penalty box.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t make a pass.<br/>
</p><p>She let her right foot swing, putting every ounce of strength into the kick and sent the ball hurdling through the air, over the tops of Portuguese and Spanish heads, past the goalie and into the top of the net.<br/>
</p><p>The roar from the crowd was ear-shattering.<br/>
</p><p>She grinned as the adrenaline shot through her, making her legs move, making her sprint as if a lion was chasing her. Rio reached the crowd…and she shouldn’t have…<br/>
</p><p>She bowed in celebration.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s signature.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck you, Harkness.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Fuck her.<br/>
</p><p>“Ri!” Alice screamed as she jumped on her. “That was fucking incredible!”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“The one and only! I’m speechless,” the commentator gushed. “There are few players who can do what Vidal has just done. I don’t think anyone’s doubting her ability now!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Wasn’t good enough. Rio wanted another.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Only a minute added of extra time for the first half of the game.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“There’s the Spanish link-up play we’re so used to seeing. The short, quick passes inside the penalty box. Wu-Gulliver, Vidal, Wu-Gulliver again, Gamora, VIDAL!!! WHO ELSE? LA REINA!!!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Gamora yanked Alice and Rio into a hug.<br/>
</p><p>“Well done, girls!” Gamora told them.<br/>
</p><p>“Well done,” Alice and Rio said in return.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“That’s a hat-trick for Vidal. What a way to start a tournament!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“You’re insane!” Alice exclaimed as the rest of their team congratulated them with hugs and kisses.<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>But she wasn’t done.<br/>
</p><p>She wanted another.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And that’s it. Spain, seven, Portugal, nil. With four goals from none other than the Spanish Stargirl, Rio Vidal!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>There was no better feeling than this, scoring four goals in your country’s colours. Rio was so unbelievably proud of her team, so unbelievably proud to be Spanish.<br/>
</p><p>“You haven’t stopped grinning,” the interviewer told her with a smile. “Even when you got taken off sixty minutes in after scoring your fourth goal, you were grinning on the bench.”<br/>
</p><p>“No, I haven’t,” Rio grinned. “We played well. That’s something to grin about.”<br/>
</p><p>“Even with a knee injury, you’ve just scored four goals, what do you have to say to the people who doubted you?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed. “Nothing. My performance today speaks for itself.”<br/>
</p><p>And yes, she’d let Agatha’s words get to her for every second leading up to it, but not any fucking more.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you think you could’ve scored more goals this evening?”<br/>
</p><p>Abso-fucking-lutely.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Who knows.”<br/>
</p><p>“How’s the knee?” The interviewer asked, gaze dropping to it taped up when it hadn’t been on the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>Hurting like a mother fucking bitch.<br/>
</p><p>“I just scored four goals, what do you think?”<br/>
</p><p>The interviewer giggled before she turned serious. “England had a shocking start to the tournament yesterday, losing 2-1 to France. Do you have anything you want to say to your Barca teammate, Agatha Harkness?”<br/>
</p><p>Oh, so many things.<br/>
</p><p>“I wish you luck for the rest of the tournament. I know you can do it, baby,” Rio winked into the camera.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you, Rio,” the interviewer said, holding out her hand.<br/>
</p><p>Rio took it, shaking firmly. “Thank you.”<br/>

<strong>Zurich, Switzerland – Day 5 of the 2025 Women’s Euros:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Second match of Group A: England vs Netherlands.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Abby loved football. She especially loved England’s number ten, her Golden Girl, one of the best footballers in the world.<br/>
</p><p>England hadn’t won their opening match, and everyone had lost faith in them. The boys at school teased her for liking women’s football when they couldn’t even win their first match, her dad had said he’d stop watching from now on, and the press had written England off.<br/>
</p><p>Abby hadn’t. Abby knew.<br/>
</p><p>The English were never done.<br/>
</p><p>And they weren’t.<br/>
</p><p>She was alone in her living room as the game began. Right off the bat, there was something different about the way England was playing. There was a fight to their attack and passion in their passes.<br/>
</p><p>This was it.<br/>
</p><p>This was her England.<br/>
</p><p>Harkness had the ball, and when the camera zoomed in, Abby noticed her hair was different; it wasn’t in its signature Dutch braids. Instead, Harkness’s long, dark hair was in a ponytail, two small plaits on either side running into it.<br/>
</p><p>Where had Abby seen that before?<br/>
</p><p>Vidal.<br/>
</p><p>That was Vidal’s signature hairstyle.<br/>
</p><p>Abby was also a Barcelona fan, and she <em>hated<em> that her two girls seemed to be fighting. It was the snide remarks from Harkness, the insincerity from Vidal when she wished Harkness good luck. They never did that. When Vidal won her Ballon d'Or, Harkness was seen crying her eyes out, clapping and cheering even though she’d lost. Vidal had done the same the year prior.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Abby had had to resort to looking through her ‘Agathario’ folder on TikTok during hard times. She scrolled through the endless videos of them messing around during Barca training sessions, the videos of them captured off the pitch, and her absolute favs, Rio comforting Agatha after England lost the World Cup.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was in the England dugout sobbing, and Rio, even though she’d just become a world champion, was crouching beneath her, arms wrapped around Agatha as she cried.<br/>
</p><p>She should’ve been celebrating.<br/>
</p><p>She shouldn’t have cared.<br/>
</p><p>But she did.<br/>
</p><p>And now the girls were fighting.<br/>
</p><p>Abby leaned forward as Agatha shot towards the penalty box, her fingers crossed in her lap, heart beating wildly. Agatha chipped the ball into the box where Romonoff stopped it with her chest letting it bounce once, twice, before it rolled down her body. Natasha hit it.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck!”<br/>
</p><p>The goalkeeper stopped it but couldn’t catch the rebound. The ball sprang back into the box, where Agatha swooped in.<br/>
</p><p>Abby screamed when the goal went in, jumping up and down like a madwoman.<br/>
</p><p>“Abigal!” Her mother yelled from the kitchen.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry!” Abby apologised.<br/>
</p><p>1-0	to England.<br/>
</p><p>2-0 to England.<br/>
</p><p>Three.<br/>
</p><p>Four.<br/>
</p><p>Abby could’ve cried. She fucking knew her girls wouldn’t let her down, even when the entire country doubted them.<br/>
</p><p>The final whistle blew, and Abby celebrated with her team on the screen. The girls hugged each other, grins on their faces.<br/>
</p><p>There was a close-up of Harkness hugging Kale. Two goals from her this game.<br/>
</p><p>That was Abby’s Golden Girl, her number ten.<br/>
</p><p>Best in the fucking world.<br/>

</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha mother fucking Harkness was back.<br/>
</p><p>England were back.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha knew after they lost to France that there would be a shift. The energy in the changing room after the match, the disappointment, the fury, the need to be better, to do more. Lilia had given them the pep talk of their lives.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“We’re England,” she said. “We play to win; we play to beat all odds. Before we proved ourselves in the last Euros, the country and the world had no faith in us, and I’m going to be honest, girls, they won’t again after that performance. But I know us. We’re resilient, we’re fighters.” She paused before she added, “We. Are. England.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And they were.<br/>
</p><p>They’d gone ten times harder in training, had more frequent team meetings, built up stronger bonds within the camp.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was thriving.<br/>
</p><p>She loved being the underdog; she loved having a point to prove. Especially to Rio.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I wish you luck for the rest of the tournament. I know you can do it, baby.<em> Rio had taunted.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>Agatha wanted to rip that eyebrow piercing out of her face and tell her to do one.<br/>
</p><p>She’d held her tongue, hadn’t said another word about Rio in her interviews, ignored the fact that Rio had mimicked her celebration.<br/>
</p><p>Rio Vidal was irrelevant.<br/>
</p><p>The only thing that would ever matter to Agatha was that trophy, to be named Champions of Europe once again.<br/>
</p><p>On to the quarterfinals.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Bern, Switzerland – Day 16 of the 2025 Women’s Euros:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Quarterfinal game one: Spain vs Sokovia.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Rio was fucking pissed.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t in the starting eleven.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah, okay, so her knee had been acting up. She couldn’t give it her all during some practices in case she did irreversible damage, but that didn’t mean her head coach didn’t fucking play her, especially for the quarters.<br/>
</p><p>Her team would be fine without her, but Rio wanted to help! Wanted to be one of the ones to ensure they solidified their place in the semifinals.<br/>
</p><p>This might be one of the worst days of her life, right up there with that dinner with Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Another reason she wanted to play. She needed that answer, needed to know if Agatha was in love with her. Rio was sure of it; there was no way in hell Agatha wasn’t as infatuated with her as Rio was her. But she needed the confirmation. The proof. And the only way Agatha’s stubborn ass would give it to her was if she won.<br/>
</p><p>She huffed, arms folded in a bib in the Spain dugout as the game went on. She bit on her red and yellow painted nails as Wanda Maximoff, captain of Sokovia and teammate at Barcelona, intercepted a pass from Alice.<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed again.<br/>
</p><p>She wanted on the pitch. Could Esther not see she’d put in the work? Gone to physio, rested well. She could play!<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“I’m not risking it. I’ll put you on in the second half,” Esther said.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>This was going to be the longest forty-five minutes of Rio’s life.<br/>
</p><p>A Spain goal in the thirty-seventh minute.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck yeah!” Rio yelled, leaping into the air.<br/>
</p><p>Esther shot her a look. <em>Sit down and stay off your knee,<em> it had said. Rio sat down with a groan.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Sokovia goal in the third minute of added time.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio wanted on the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The nails. The FUCKING nails.<br/>
</p><p>England were sitting in their camp watching the game. Rio wasn’t playing. The camera had been on her sitting biting her nails in the dugout, had zoomed in on them.<br/>
</p><p>On Rio’s index finger was a yellow ‘A.’<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped, and the whole team looked at her.<br/>
</p><p>There was no fucking way Rio had gotten Agatha’s initial. That meant she was playing with a bit of Agatha with her at all times.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fucking psycho.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Why the hell would Rio do that? Why the hell would Rio <em>want<em> to do that?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>It was Agatha’s turn to bite her nails.<br/>
</p><p>The game had been intense…maybe? Agatha hadn’t been paying attention, her mind spiralling as she thought of Rio and her fuck ass nails.<br/>
</p><p>By the time Agatha knew it, it was halftime. Had been halftime, and now the game was starting up again.<br/>
</p><p>One all.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Huh?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>When had Sokovia scored? They couldn’t score! Spain had to win!<br/>
</p><p>Rio still wasn’t on the pitch as the game commenced, and Agatha started praying.<br/>
</p><p>Yes, that’s right. Agatha fucking Harkness with all her religious trauma, started praying for her girlfriend to be put on the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>PAUSE-<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Sorry, not girlfriend. Complex homoerotic friendship, situationship type thingy.<br/>
</p><p>Seventy-fifth minute, and it was still one all. Seventy-fifth minute, and the first substitution from either team was being made.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“The moment we’ve all been waiting for! The Spanish Stargirl is coming onto the pitch, listen to that roar from the stadium,” the commentator boomed from the television.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha fought to hide her smile.<br/>
</p><p>It was about bloody time.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was performing as well as she usually did despite her knee. Agatha hoped it wasn’t as bad as the press was making it out to be. Yeah, she’d said some shit in her interview, but she hadn’t meant it. Not a word.<br/>
</p><p>Rio always played like Rio, and that was one of the best football players in the world.<br/>
</p><p>The team gasped when Rio tripped, rolling to the ground. Agatha sat up, her lip between her teeth.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck,” Jen muttered. “Knee landed hard too.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her, and her best friend promptly shut up.<br/>
</p><p>Fucking Wanda. Always fucking Wanda with her clumsy fucking left foot. How the hell she’d been signed by Barcelona, Agatha asked herself every day.<br/>
</p><p>Wanda was saying something to Rio, Wanda was putting a hand on Rio’s knee.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Don’t. Fucking. Touch. Her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Wanda was offering a hand; Wanda was helping Rio up.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Get. Off. Her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Wanda hugged Rio. Rio was jogging away.<br/>
</p><p>“Looks like she’s alright,” Jen offered.<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” came the curt reply.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, how easily fear can turn to anger.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Final whistle.<br/>
</p><p>2-1 to Spain.<br/>
</p><p>“Feels like the World Cup all over again,” Natasha commented as the room cleared out.<br/>
</p><p>Spain was on screen, celebrating and shaking hands with the Sokovians.<br/>
</p><p>“Yup,” Jen replied. “We’re up next.”<br/>
</p><p>“We’ll be fine,” Natasha said matter-of-factly. “We got this.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen nodded. “Aggs, you coming?”<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, I-”<br/>
</p><p>There was no fucking way.<br/>
</p><p>A kiss on the cheek. Harmless, some might say. A show of affection for a friend and teammate, some might say.<br/>
</p><p>That was venom to Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Why had Wanda kissed Rio, and why <em>the fuck<em> had she left her stupid pink lip gloss on her face?<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio was laughing, hadn’t wiped it off.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>The fuck?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha watched, waited.<br/>
</p><p>What she was looking for never came. Rio spent the rest of her time on the pitch with Wanda’s lips imprinted on her skin.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah…not on Agatha’s fucking watch.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was going to kill her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio Vidal had been in love with Agatha Harkness for three years…three years and seven months if you wanted to get technical. It was a quiet thing that had turned deafening the more time passed.<br/>
</p><p>Yes, the first time she’d laid eyes on her, she knew Agatha would be the most beautiful woman she’d ever see in her lifetime, but it was more than that. It was Agatha’s competitiveness, her willingness to keep pushing, keep fighting even when the odds weren’t in her favour. It was how Agatha never failed to make her laugh, never failed to challenge her, never…failed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha Harkness had walked, not even walked, barged into Rio’s life and flipped it on its head. Rio was addicted to her.<br/>
</p><p>Always would be.<br/>
</p><p>The day that really solidified Rio’s love for her was the day Agatha won her Ballon D’or:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“I’m so fucking proud of you,” Rio said through tears back in Agatha’s hotel room.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha smiled, her Ballon D’or pressed against her chest.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Ballon D’or winner at 20, youngest ever. You’re insane, you know that?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“How do you think I got so far in life?” Agatha teased. “Thank you, Rio, truly.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>And that sincerity, as if maybe no one had ever told her that before.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“It’s a shame your mum couldn't be here to witness it.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>That smile faded a little. “It’s fine. She’s busy.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“But you just won a Ballon D’or, Aggs! I’d drop everything if I were her.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha nodded, that smile fading completely.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio furrowed her eyebrows. “What is it, mi amor?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>She shouldn’t have, the pet name. They were only fucking, they didn’t do the affectionate, relationship-type stuff.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“It’s nothing,” Agatha replied, dropping her head and placing her trophy on the TV stand next to her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You know you can talk to me, right? Yes, you fuck me into oblivion,” Rio teased. “But I’m still your friend.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Friend. <em>Rio hated using that word to describe them. It didn’t fit, wasn’t right.<br/>
</em></p><p>
<em>Agatha let out a short laugh before she looked up, eyes rimmed with tears.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio didn’t hesitate to close the space between them; hands going to wrap around Agatha and draw her into a hug.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I’m fine,” Agatha mumbled into her shoulder.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You’re not, and that’s okay,” Rio told her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I…erm,” Agatha cleared her throat. “It’s not good enough.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio’s eyebrows pinched, and she drew back to look at her. “What do you mean?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“My mother, she said it’s not good enough. She said I should’ve won it sooner.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio arched a brow. “What, when you were in Little League?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha laughed. “We don’t call it that in England.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You’re missing my point.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha pulled her bottom lip into her mouth.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You’ve just made history, baby. I’m sorry, but your mother needs her head checked – wait-”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha laughed again, that proper laugh that made Rio smile. “No, I agree, but the world would lose its shit if England’s most legendary player was put in a mental institution.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha stepped out of Rio’s hold, and Rio wished she hadn’t.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Look, I’m sure it doesn’t mean as much coming from me, but like I said, I’m so fucking proud of you. No one else in the game is doing it like you, okay?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“And I’ve got you.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Through all of it,” Rio elaborated. “The ups, the downs. The good and the bad, I’ve got you.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>That look Agatha was giving her, Rio had never seen it before.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Thank you.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Don’t thank me. It’s an honour,” Rio said teasingly, earning her a laugh from her love.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I’ve got you too,” Agatha added when their laughter died down. “You and me?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio nodded. “You and me.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And it had been.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Andrea knew everything that went on in the Spanish football camp. She knew when the girls left and returned, knew where they were supposed to be at all times; hell, she even knew what they ate for breakfast. That was her job as assistant coach. To do all the things that Esther couldn’t handle on her own.<br/>
</p><p>She shouldn’t have been surprised when she saw a head full of dark, wavy hair sneaking into the Spanish camp.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fucking Harkness. England’s number ten.<br/>
</p><p>Andrea had been expecting her to show up at some point during the tournament. Like she said, she knew her players, and she knew at some point or another, Rio would need a booty call.<br/>
</p><p>Esther had told her to report Agatha’s sighting immediately if she were to see her and have her removed from the premises. She didn’t want Harkness getting into Rio’s head, distracting her. Their Stargirl already had a knee injury to deal with.<br/>
</p><p>Tonight, Andrea was feeling generous. They’d just won their quarterfinals. If Rio needed someone to help ride out her high, who was Andrea to stop her?<br/>
</p><p>She shook her head, smiling to herself as Agatha slipped into one of the lifts taking her up to Rio’s room.<br/>
</p><p>Harkness? Nope, Andrea hadn’t seen her.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pounded on Rio’s door and waited…and waited.<br/>
</p><p>What felt like an eternity later, Rio was pulling her door open. Her hair was mussed; one eye open as if she’d been asleep. She had on a black shirt, Agatha’s, and black Calvin Klein boxers.<br/>
</p><p>“Agatha? What the fuck?” Rio said, her voice thick with sleep.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha barged into the room, a lamp on Rio’s bedside table being the only source of light.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you doing here? It’s,” Rio checked the alarm clock next to the lamp. “Three in the morning.”<br/>
</p><p>Yeah, so maybe Agatha had snuck out of the England camp and travelled an hour to get to the Spanish one. Sue her.<br/>
</p><p>“Why’d you let her kiss you?” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“What?” Rio said, her voice croaky from disuse.<br/>
</p><p>“Do not make me repeat myself.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rubbed her head and yawned.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh! Am I boring you?” Agatha asked sarcastically.<br/>
</p><p>“No, you’re just fucking yelling, and I just woke up.” Rio limped over to her bed.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Was the knee that bad?<br/>
</p><p>Agatha almost asked her about it until she remembered why she’d crossed half of Switzerland.<br/>
</p><p>“Answer me,” Agatha demanded.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sat down. “What the fuck are we even talking about?” She replied lazily.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was going to swing.<br/>
</p><p>“Thought your knee was the problem, not your head. You aren’t suffering from memory loss, you know damn well what I’m talking about.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss the slight upturn of Rio’s lips.<br/>
</p><p>“Ohhh! Wanda?”<br/>
</p><p>Yeah, no. Agatha was definitely going to swing.<br/>
</p><p>“She kissed me on the cheek, big fucking deal. She always does after a match.”<br/>
</p><p>“She-”<br/>
</p><p>Because this was news to Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“She does what?” Agatha spat.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s smirk only grew. “It’s harmless, customary even. She’s our friend.”<br/>
</p><p>Well, not after today she wasn’t.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t let her do it again.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio arched a brow in amusement. “Why? Is it because you love me, Agatha? You don’t want people touching what’s yours?” Rio pouted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glared at her. Rio was playing right in her fucking face.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha went over to her, placing a hand on either side of Rio’s thighs as her legs hung off the bed.<br/>
</p><p>“You have an ‘A’ painted on your nail. As far as I’m concerned, I’m yours, not the other way around.” Agatha leaned in so she was a breath away. “So, because you consider me yours, I don’t know why the fuck you would leave another woman’s lips on your skin.”<br/>
</p><p>“I did?” Rio asked in mock surprise. “Silly me,” Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“What about you, huh? Don’t think I missed the way you copied my hair.”<br/>
</p><p>About that…complete and utter accident. Agatha wanted to switch it up, and the first hairstyle that came to mind was Rio’s because Rio always came to mind first.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Wait, fuck. You take that back!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Apologies, Rio did not come to mind first; Agatha just liked the hairstyle.<br/>
</p><p>“And don’t think I missed the way you iced me out on media day,” Agatha shot back.<br/>
</p><p>It was Rio’s turn to narrow her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>“Did I hurt your feelings, baby?”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Yes, you fucking did!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “As if you could ever hurt me.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio grinned. “You keep telling yourself that,” she said as she patted Agatha on the cheek.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand to halt the action, and the tension in the room skyrocketed.<br/>
</p><p>Grey eyes never left brown.<br/>
</p><p>“If I did,” Rio said breathlessly, her chest rising and falling rapidly. “Just say so. It’s easier to just say how you feel, Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>Yeah, no. They weren’t doing this.<br/>
</p><p>“Shut the fuck up,” Agatha got out before she yanked Rio’s arm and crashed their lips together.<br/>
</p><p>There was nothing gentle about this kiss; it was lethal. Agatha wanted to drown it out, all those warm and gooey feelings she may or may not have about Rio. Wanted this kiss to speak volumes to replace words.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>You're mine,<em> it said.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>
<em>I may be yours.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>No one else can have you but me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha pushed Rio back, and her body hit the bed with a harsh thud. Their tongues moved against each other’s harshly, teeth clashing, saliva swapping.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha broke away to pull off Rio’s shirt, and Rio’s fingers hooked into Agatha’s sweatpants and underwear, moving them down.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha freed her legs from her clothes, climbing over Rio’s face, her cunt hovering over her lips.<br/>
</p><p>“You know what to do,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Do I?” Rio challenged. “Think my head really is fucked, I’m suffering from memory loss. Tell me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and got off the bed.<br/>
</p><p>“I say jump, you say how high,” Agatha muttered. “Turn,” she ordered.<br/>
</p><p>Rio grinned, swinging her legs onto the bed before letting her head hang slightly off it.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha repositioned herself, her thighs going on either side of Rio’s face.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve got one job,” Agatha told her as she rested her hands on Rio’s stomach. “Make me come.”<br/>
</p><p>“My one mission in life,” Rio taunted.<br/>
</p><p>“I would fucking hope s-”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha got cut off when Rio’s tongue ran easily through wet folds.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>Fuck!<em>” Agatha groaned, which earned her a slap from Rio.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Right, because it was three in the morning and every Spanish player was probably asleep.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s tongue continued to move at an irritatingly slow pace as if she was trying to savour Agatha’s taste.<br/>
</p><p>Why?<br/>
</p><p>There was supposed to be nothing savouring about this fuck. Agatha was marking her territory. That was it.<br/>
</p><p>“If you don’t speed up,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>She felt Rio grin against her cunt.<br/>
</p><p>And no, Rio didn’t speed up. In fact, she slowed down, dragging a firm tongue through Agatha’s wetness. Agatha jolted when it grazed her clit.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck me.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>When her knees buckled.<br/>
</p><p>“You taste so good,” Rio got out.<br/>
</p><p>“Tell me – <em>hm<em> – tell me something I-” Agatha groaned again when Rio hit her clit once more. “Tell me something I don’t already know.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Wetness…more of it.<br/>
</p><p>She felt it sliding down her inner thigh, heard the spitting sound Rio made.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Holy mother of god.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio dragged her tongue through her own spit and Agatha’s slick and Agatha gripped onto Rio’s stomach like her life depended on it. The tip of Rio’s tongue started circling Agatha’s clit before Rio grazed her teeth over it. She could feel her orgasm building, felt the squeeze of Rio’s hands on her thighs as she drew her closer.<br/>
</p><p>Rio started sucking on Agatha’s clit, and she thought she might shatter.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-”<br/>
</p><p>“Say it,” came the muffled reply.<br/>
</p><p>“You first,” Agatha panted.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m yours, baby, but you knew that.”<br/>
</p><p>She circled Agatha’s clit again, and try as she might, Agatha couldn’t help the moan.<br/>
</p><p>“Now your turn.”<br/>
</p><p>“Get fucked,” Agatha said breathlessly.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s tongue stopped moving.<br/>
</p><p>“Say it or get out,” Rio said from underneath Agatha’s cunt.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Fine by me,” Rio said, shifting as if she were going to get up.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha reached between her legs and pushed Rio’s head back down.<br/>
</p><p>“Fine! I’m fucking yours, make me come!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio chuckled before getting back to work.<br/>
</p><p>This time, she pressed her nose inside Agatha as well.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>When she realised how full she now was.<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled on her thighs, encouraging Agatha to ride her face, and she took it in stride.<br/>
</p><p>The orgasm hit her out of nowhere. All of a sudden, Agatha was moaning and throwing her head back.<br/>
</p><p>Rio slapped her again, and Agatha bit her lip to shut herself up as her thighs trembled around Rio’s head.<br/>
</p><p>As she came down from her orgasm, Rio continued to lap her up to help her ride it out.<br/>
</p><p>When she had, Agatha’s heart was thudding wildly against her ribcage, her long hair sticking to her neck with sweat.<br/>
</p><p>“See,” Rio said as she licked her lips. “Wasn’t so hard-”<br/>
</p><p>She yelped when Agatha climbed on top of her and yanked her further onto the bed. She pulled Rio’s boxers down, didn’t think before she pushed three fingers inside Rio’s core.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s back arched just like Agatha knew it would.<br/>
</p><p>“Wanda’s not to kiss you again,” Agatha told her as her fingers started pumping. “You left her lipstick on your face, why?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes started rolling, and Agatha threaded her hand through Rio’s hair, forcing her head forward.<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes snapped to her, pupils blown wide.<br/>
</p><p>Rio let a lazy smirk grace her face. “To torment you. And hey, look, it worked.”<br/>
</p><p>She screamed when Agatha pressed her thumb against Rio’s clit.<br/>
</p><p>“Turtleneck,” was all Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>“What?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio shut up when Agatha sunk her teeth into her neck before she started biting and sucking on Rio’s pulse point. Her fingers still pumping.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t…don’t you dare,” Rio gasped.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ignored her, continuing with her task of pushing Rio over the edge.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s hand found a home in Agatha’s hair, pressing her firmer against her neck.<br/>
</p><p>She wanted this.<br/>
</p><p>The mark.<br/>
</p><p>The evidence that she was Agatha’s.<br/>
</p><p>In mere moments, Rio was panting frantically, and Agatha felt a rush of wetness leak from her core. She smiled against Rio’s neck as her body pushed into Agatha’s.<br/>
</p><p>“So easy,” Agatha taunted.<br/>
</p><p>Rio only nodded, words lost on her.<br/>
</p><p>She rode out Rio’s wave with lazy pumps until Rio’s body fell back onto the bed and her vice-like grip on Agatha’s hair relaxed.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled away, extracting her fingers carefully. She waved them in front of Rio’s face.<br/>
</p><p>“Be a good girl and clean me up.”<br/>
</p><p>No hesitation.<br/>
</p><p>Rio grabbed Agatha’s wrist and sucked her fingers into her mouth. She swirled her tongue around every one, making sure to get every last drop of her own come.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha felt that wetness between her legs again from the eye contact.<br/>
</p><p>From brown eyes never leaving grey.<br/>
</p><p>She needed to get the fuck out of there.<br/>
</p><p>She freed her fingers, leaving Rio’s cheeks flushed, drool hanging out of her mouth as she stared at Agatha, eyes hungry and desperate for more.<br/>
</p><p>They could always go again…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No. I’ve got training in five hours.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Right.<br/>
</p><p>“See you in hell,” Agatha said as she got off the bed.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t wanna mark your territory some more?” Rio questioned as Agatha put on her clothes.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve made my point.”<br/>
</p><p>“You could always make it again…and again…and oh, look…again.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed when Agatha walked to the door. “See you at the final then.”<br/>
</p><p>“If you make it there,” Agatha replied as she left.<br/>
</p><p>And boy did she hope Rio did.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Zurich, Switzerland – Day 20 of the 2025 Women’s Euros:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Quarterfinal game four: England vs Sweden.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Rio was tucked away in one of the highest rows of the stadium. She shouldn’t have been there; she had a semi-final to prepare for.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t stay away.<br/>
</p><p>Had to see Agatha win.<br/>
</p><p>She wore her black ‘<em>Harkness 10<em>’ jersey, black jeans and a black cap, nails in her mouth as she bit them, waiting for the game to begin.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The whistle blew, and the stadium roared to life as the Swedish players started passing the ball.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha came onto one of the large screens, and Rio couldn’t help but smile when she saw Agatha’s hair. Again, she’d forgone her signature Dutch braids and was wearing her hair like Rio did.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Loser.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>After they’d fucked four days ago, Rio couldn’t stop thinking about her. Yes, Rio always thought about Agatha, but more so. The way she’d left her camp an hour away to see her, the jealousy, the way she barged into Rio’s room as if she owned the place.<br/>
</p><p>She hadn’t realised how much she’d missed Agatha until she had her lips on hers again, her scent swirling around her, her skin pressed against hers.<br/>
</p><p>Rio was so insanely in love she thought she might have to check herself into a mental institution.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha ran towards Sweden’s number twenty-three, who had the ball. She grinned. That tackle she was expecting happened before her eyes. Agatha slid to the floor as the Swede tumbled. Agatha shrugged as she got up, her mouth turned down in a ‘whoops.’<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head playfully.<br/>
</p><p>Sweden throw in.<br/>
</p><p>Rio could watch Agatha play for hours. She was so entertaining, so skilled and almost always the performer. She watched at the edge of her seat as the minutes of the first half of the match dwindled down.<br/>
</p><p>Thirty-eighth minute.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck!”<br/>
</p><p>Sweden goal.<br/>
</p><p>The Swedes around her screamed and shouted, and the English dropped their heads.<br/>
</p><p>It was fine, England still had time.<br/>
</p><p>Four minutes into the second half, and Sweden had another goal. Rio bit her lip as the realisation dawned on her.<br/>
</p><p>England might not make it to the semi-finals.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Being two goals down was nothing. They could still win, actually; there was no other option. England was winning this match; Agatha was going to make sure of it.<br/>
</p><p>She was sweating and out of breath, her white England jersey clinging uncomfortably to her skin. Her current situation wasn’t helping her discomfort either. It was a Sweden corner and most of the twenty-two players on the pitch had been squeezed into the penalty area.<br/>
</p><p>Swedish arms pushed her as she tried to maintain her mark on her player. One shove was so forceful Agatha stumbled. She didn’t hesitate to turn, didn’t hesitate to shove with just as much force.<br/>
</p><p>The referee blew her whistle to halt play.<br/>
</p><p>She waggled her finger. “None of that.”<br/>
</p><p>“She pushed me first!” Agatha shot back.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs, shut up! We can’t give away a free kick,” Jen scolded.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and did so.<br/>
</p><p>The referee stepped away, and the game continued.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha watched as Sweden’s number eighteen held up a hand, watched her run, watched her kick the ball.<br/>
</p><p>The bodies in the box started shifting soon after as the ball came over the tops of heads. Agatha turned just in time to see Sweden’s number four’s head make contact with the ball. It shot towards the goal and…<br/>
</p><p>Ava leapt, ripping the ball from the air before she landed on Sweden’s number two.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, Ava!” Agatha yelled, shoving the Swedes out of the way to hug her goalie.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s fucking go,” Ava urged, patting Agatha on the back. “We gotta game to win.”<br/>
</p><p>“Damn right,” Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“No waiting around for the English. Their goal kick taken immediately.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha bolted down the pitch as Ava sent the ball flying.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha received it, trapping it with her right foot before dribbling. She looked up to see Agatha calling for the ball. Natasha kicked it. The second Agatha touched it, Sweden’s number four tackled her, sending the ball offside.<br/>
</p><p>“I got it, go up,” Yelena told her as she collected another ball for the throw in.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, and as she moved up the pitch, her eyes snagged on how many minutes they had left.<br/>
</p><p>Two.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Lena!” Agatha yelled as she sprinted forward.<br/>
</p><p>Yelena threw the perfect ball; it tapped against Agatha’s inner foot, and she didn’t hesitate to make a break for it.<br/>
</p><p>Maybe her opponent was behind her, maybe all of Sweden was. Agatha didn’t care as she headed for the goal.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs!” Jen called.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha slid the ball to her best friend and continued her dash into the penalty box.<br/>
</p><p>Jen had been clipped, but she’d stayed on her feet, letting the trip propel her forward.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha reached her destination to the left-hand corner of the goal, and Jen chipped the ball. She watched it soar through the air.<br/>
</p><p>She jumped, her head making contact.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“But of course! The Golden Girl has only gone and done it!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha almost smacked into the Swedish goalkeeper, the momentum forcing her forward.<br/>
</p><p>She hadn’t been sure if the goal had gone in, but by the sounds of the stadium, it had.<br/>
</p><p>There was no time to celebrate; only five more minutes of extra time had been added.<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s fucking go!” Agatha screamed at her team as she ran to collect the ball.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Fantastic pass from Harkness, received by Romonoff. Kale seems to be calling for it. Oh…Oh! Goal from Romonoff! It’s two all! The English do not give up!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Come on!” Natasha urged. “We want another and we’re fucking getting it,” she yelled as the team ran back up the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Let’s look at that goal again. Excellent work from Romonoff. The way she shifts the ball, finds the gap between all those Swedish players and just absolutely smashes it into the back of the net and- Oh...Oh, what’s- YES!!!” The commentator screamed into her mic, leaping from her seat in the media box.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Goal for England with a minute left of extra time by none other than our Golden Girl!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Now she could celebrate.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck yeah! Come on!” Agatha shouted as she sprinted towards the crowd.<br/>
</p><p>Her teammates ran from all areas of the pitch, even the subs in the dugout joined her, jumping and crowding around her so much so that Agatha fell. She landed on the grass with a thud, the impact and her laughter knocking the wind out of her. She couldn’t breathe as they piled on top of her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t care.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t sure how long she’d suffocated for before her team let up, and Jen’s hand was reaching towards her to pull her off the ground.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“England’s saviour. England’s number ten scoring what could be England’s winning goal.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Do it with me!” Agatha yelled over the noise.<br/>
</p><p>Jen laughed. “Gladly.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen fell in line beside her, and they glanced at each other before balancing on one foot, left leg crossing over it as they stooped. They raised their pinkies and mimed drinking tea with a cup and saucer.<br/>
</p><p>Jen’s signature celebration.<br/>
</p><p>“Ayyy,” Jen said, pulling Agatha into a hug. “So bloody proud of you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Wouldn’t have done it without you, you made the assist,” Agatha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re the dream team, baby! On to the semis,” Jen said.<br/>
</p><p>“We haven’t won yet.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen shot her a look that said, ‘Be serious,’ as they walked onto the pitch. Agatha grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Sweden had the ball; they passed it around frantically, desperate to squeeze in a last-minute goal and then…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“That’s it! England are in the semi-finals!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“What a game! Down two-nil for over eighty minutes just to come back and win it all! It doesn’t get much better than that!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“I fucking told you!” Jen exclaimed, jumping on Agatha. “Never ever fucking done!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed as <em>Sweet Caroline<em> started blasting from somewhere in the stadium.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The pitch was flooded with England. Their players, their subs, their staff, Lilia.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m so fucking proud of you!” Her head coach said, yanking her into a hug.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha breathed.<br/>
</p><p>Lilia released her and moved on to Jen.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha took it all in. The packed stands, her team with grins on their faces, the adrenaline that was coursing through her veins.<br/>
</p><p>They’d done it.<br/>
</p><p>She choked as tears threatened to spill.<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes landed on one of the large screens in the stadium and…no, it couldn’t be.<br/>
</p><p>Rio fucking Vidal, clapping and cheering with tears streaming down her face.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had come to watch the game?<br/>
</p><p>That’s what made the tears start to flow.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had made it to the semi-finals, and Rio had been right there with her.</p>

<p>“You must be on top of the world right now?” The interviewer started.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were still puffy, and on this extremely rare occasion, she found herself with nothing to say.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah.”<br/>
</p><p>The interviewer laughed. “How does it feel making it to the semifinals when everyone doubted England?”<br/>
</p><p>“I…great.”<br/>
</p><p>The interviewer paused, wanting an elaboration.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Think!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“We just wanted to prove to everyone, but mainly ourselves, that we could do this. The resilience and fight that this team has is truly something special. I’m so proud.”<br/>
</p><p>“The English are never done?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “The English are never done,” she echoed.<br/>
</p><p>“One last question, Agatha, because I know you’ll want to be celebrating.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio Vidal was seen in the stands this evening. How does it feel to know that even when she has a semifinal to prepare for, she chose to come out here and watch?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed.<br/>
</p><p>How did it feel?<br/>
</p><p>It felt like she was so in love her heart was too big to fit inside her body.<br/>
</p><p>“It just shows the type of team our club fosters. We support each other even when we’re competing against one another.”<br/>
</p><p>The interviewer offered a half smile, disappointed, probably, in Agatha’s answer.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you, Agatha.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Celebrations were short-lived. The girls reached the end of singing and dancing to <em>Family Tree by Ramz<em> in the locker rooms before deciding to call it a night. They were knackered and had a semifinal to prepare for.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>After Agatha showered and changed, she hung back in the empty room to collect her thoughts while her teammates went out to the stands to eat with their families and friends. She’d join them in a minute. She had a family, Jen’s, but sometimes the realisation that in some ways she was alone hit her like a ton of bricks.<br/>
</p><p>She technically always had been; it wasn’t like her mother was there for her, and all her other relatives were dead or estranged. But the idea of going into the stadium knowing that nobody was there for <em>her<em> and her alone always ruined the happiest of moments.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Hey, stranger.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked up to see that stupid grin she’d grown to adore.<br/>
</p><p>Rio walked in, her Harkness shirt on and hair down. She’d tucked her hair behind her right ear so that her eyebrow piercing was on show.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fucking loved that eyebrow piercing.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha replied when Rio sat on the bench next to her. “Nice shirt.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio pulled at it. “This old thing?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m so fucking proud of you, Aggs. You played so well today,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>And Agatha had been told this all night, and yet hearing it from Rio meant more to her than anything ever would.<br/>
</p><p>“There was a pretty girl in the stands, I was trying to impress her,” Agatha said, which earned her a laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, yeah? What was her name?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tilted her head to 'think.' “Roberta? I’m sure that was it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed again. “Well, she’s one lucky girl.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No, I am.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Mhm.”<br/>
</p><p>Grey eyes locked onto brown, and the silence in the room was deafening. Rio’s eyes flicked slowly between Agatha’s, and a warm feeling started stirring in Agatha’s stomach.<br/>
</p><p>The sudden urge to kiss Rio came out of nowhere.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Don’t you dare.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “I should go.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No, don’t! Please don’t.<br/>

</p><p>“Got a semifinal to prepare for and all that,” Rio continued as she got up.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows. “Where are you supposed to be right now?”<br/>
</p><p>“On a coach to Geneva,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“You- you missed travelling up with your team to watch me play?” And she hated how softly she’d asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “The things we do for pretty girls, hey?”<br/>
</p><p>A stupid schoolgirl giggle left Agatha’s mouth.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s smile was unwavering as she turned and left.<br/>
</p><p>“The things we do,” Agatha mumbled.<br/>

</p><p>
<strong>Geneva, Switzerland – Day 22 of the 2025 Women’s Euros:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Semifinal game one: Spain vs Germany.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>A semifinal, no biggie. Rio had played a semifinal before, never with a fucked up knee, but what difference did it make, right?<br/>
</p><p>She was back in the starting eleven, thank fuck, the only downside was that Esther was pulling her off at halftime. Because of her knee, because Rio had gone to watch Agatha play.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>No distractions, I told you,” Esther said. “We already have your knee to worry about, and then I notice you aren’t on the coach to Geneva.”<br/>
</em></p><p>
<em>“Esther-”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her head coach cut her off. “Then I see you at the England game when you should’ve been resting. Rio, you are one of the best footballers in the world, one of the best footballers on this team. I need you to have your head on straight.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio could only nod.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Don’t make me have to ban you from leaving camp.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio nodded again.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Go train,” Esther instructed.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Her coach was sending her a message: 'You've got forty-five minutes. Prove to me why you’re the best. Prove to me that seeing your girl was worth it.'<br/>
</p><p>But to Rio, Agatha would always be worth it.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Twenty-fifth minute. Spain, unsurprisingly, was dominating possession. Agatha couldn’t sit still; Rio was in the starting eleven again, which meant Agatha could be watching up to ninety minutes of football with her heart in her ass.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What if Rio falls?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>What if her injury gets worse?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>What if Spain doesn’t make it to the final?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She had to stop thinking like that. Agatha knew Rio, and she unfortunately knew Spain. There was no way in hell they weren’t getting to that final.<br/>
</p><p>It was just that Germany was playing so aggressively, and in turn, so was Rio. On a normal day, this would’ve been thrilling. Agatha loved how passionate Rio was about the game, going so far as to encourage the aggression when they played for Barcelona.<br/>
</p><p>This was different.<br/>
</p><p>Rio had a fucked up knee. Rio could do irreversible damage to said fucked up knee.<br/>
</p><p>Spain’s number ten also had her hands full; being the best meant a target on your back. Two Germans were marking Rio at all times. She couldn’t take a step without a German following suit.<br/>
</p><p>“Ref!” Agatha yelled when Germany’s number five pushed Rio with the ball and almost sent her flying.<br/>
</p><p>The ball was cleared offside, and Rio hadn’t hesitated to push Germany’s number five.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“There is a lot of tension in the stadium tonight. That final underneath both teams' noses is so clear in the girls’ performances.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha wished she could’ve been there, but ever since she left the England camp to go to the Spanish one, Lilia and their staff had been watching her like a hawk.<br/>
</p><p>“Germany are putting up a good fight, I will say,” Natasha commented.<br/>
</p><p>Jen nodded. “I bet Spain was expecting this to go smoother.”<br/>
</p><p>“Mhm,” Kate agreed. “Look, even the couple are fighting.”<br/>
</p><p>Germany’s number two, Ida Becker and Spain’s number twelve, Lola Lopez, were tacking each other. Shirts were being pulled, bodies were being shoved.<br/>
</p><p>“I’ve always wondered what it’s like to compete against someone you love,” Kate continued. “Like, what do you prioritise? I’m sure it’s the win, but if you win, your love loses. You’re happy yet heartbroken at the same time.”<br/>
</p><p>All the eyes in the room turned to Jen and Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s not that bad,” Jen replied. “Alice won the World Cup; it’s only right it’s my turn to win.”<br/>
</p><p>The girls laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“What about you, Aggs?”<br/>
</p><p>And all of a sudden, it was the World Cup again:<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>August 23rd, 2023. Women’s World Cup Final - Sydney, Australia.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<em>She couldn’t keep it together. Agatha was trying not to cry on the pitch; she just had to get through these last few moments, and then she could break down in the locker room.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>So what they’d lost the World Cup? So what they’d worked so hard to get to the final, and the trophy was just out of reach? So what Agatha couldn’t for the life of her get a shot passed Spain’s goalkeeper?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>It was fine. Everything was…<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>She needed to be by herself.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha could feel the cameras on her as she sat down in the England dugout. She zipped up her blue and pink England puffer jacket and pulled her hood over her eyes to hide from the world.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>They always had next time, she reminded herself.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>She could do it for all the little girls who were watching her at home next time.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>The Spanish celebrations seemed to be never-ending; it was as if the music had only gotten louder the more time went on. That their screaming and shouting only got more deafening. It was like adding salt to the wound, except the wound was life-threatening.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha wanted to fucking die.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Hi, baby.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>And to make matters fucking worse, here came Rio fucking Vidal.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha looked up to see Rio in her red jersey, she and it were covered in grass and mud stains, probably from all the knee sliding she’d been doing. Her gold World Cup medal slung around her neck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha couldn’t even deny it; it looked good on her, but didn’t everything?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Hey. Well done again. I’m…I’m proud of you.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>And she genuinely was.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Thank you.” Rio stooped in front of her; her brown eyes fixed on her as if nothing else mattered.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Stop it,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Stop what?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha turned away, those tears threatening to spill.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Go and celebrate. You don’t need to be here.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio didn’t move.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio. I want to be left alone.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Again, Rio didn’t move and those stupid fucking tears…<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I’m right here, baby. Let it out.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>The dam broke.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha choked; a burning sensation shot up her nose as the tears pressed underneath her eyes before pouring out of them.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio didn’t hesitate to wrap her arms around her, encouraging Agatha to bury her head in the crook of her neck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You played so well, I know how badly you wanted to win. But you’ll beat us next time, I promise.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha snorted, the tears continuing to fall.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio rubbed soothingly along Agatha’s neck to let her know that this was okay, that she was. As long as Rio was there, Agatha was free to be as vulnerable as she was willing to allow herself to be.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio squeezed tighter.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>She wasn’t sure how much time had passed before her tears slowed. Rio sat next to her and wrapped her right arm over Agatha’s shoulder, drawing her close.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I’ve got you, remember?” Rio told her, wiping at a tear.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio had kept her promise from almost two years ago. She wasn’t expecting her to; people always said shit they didn’t mean, but Agatha was starting to get the feeling that that wasn’t Rio.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You and me?” Agatha asked, her voice raw from crying.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“You and me,” Rio winked, planting a kiss on her temple.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Aggs?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked. “What-”<br/>
</p><p>“Oh!” Lilia exclaimed. “That did not look good.”<br/>
</p><p>A slow-motion replay of Rio and Germany’s number seven jumping for the ball was on screen. Rio had been hit in the face.<br/>
</p><p>“What the fuck?!” Agatha yelled, leaping out of her seat.<br/>
</p><p>"Shit,” Jen muttered.<br/>
</p><p>Blood. Pouring out of Rio’s nose like a waterfall.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was going to murder Germany’s number seven.<br/>
</p><p>“Uh, oh. Watch out, Weber, an Agatha’s behind you, girl,” Yelena teased.<br/>
</p><p>The entire England team and staff burst out laughing.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Maybe she was in pain, Rio couldn’t tell because of the adrenaline. It was only when warm, silky liquid started sliding down her philtrum and onto her lip that she realised some damage had been done.<br/>
</p><p>The metallic taste of blood seeped into her mouth and didn’t stop there, trickling onto her chin and down her jersey.<br/>
</p><p>Red on red.<br/>
</p><p>Spanish blood on Spanish colours.<br/>
</p><p>The referee blew the whistle to halt play.<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio waved her off when she came over. She already knew what she was going to say. “I’m fine, let’s keep playing.”<br/>
</p><p>“But your nose-”<br/>
</p><p>“I said I’m fine,” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>They didn’t have time, more specifically, Rio didn’t. There was no telling when Esther might take her off the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you s-”<br/>
</p><p>“Fine.”<br/>
</p><p>The referee nodded, walked away, blew the whistle.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Looks like the game is continuing even though Vidal took a hit. Couldn’t quite tell what was being said between Spain’s number ten and the ref, but it seemed like she wanted to keep playing. Made of steel that one. A knee injury or a hit to the face isn’t going to stop her.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Thirty-eighth minute.<br/>
</p><p>Nothing was fucking clicking. Rio couldn’t get the ball into the back of the net. She’d gotten close. A header just wide, a shot that the German goalkeeper somehow managed to save. It was driving her insane.<br/>
</p><p>This hadn’t happened to Spain in a while, not having at least one goal before halftime. And as the seconds ticked away, that was looking more and more likely.<br/>
</p><p>Then what?<br/>
</p><p>Then Rio would be off the pitch without helping her team achieve anything.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>No, that simple wasn’t an option.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Good ball from Wu-Gulliver, on to Vidal, who is just speeding away. Weber’s trying to keep up, but is there any keeping up with Vidal?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio looked to see Gamora signalling for the ball inside the box. She made the pass.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“The only person who I can think of who can is Harkness. She’s currently not on the pitch,” the commentator laughed. “But who knows, we might see these two together in the final. It’s all still to play for.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Back to Vidal, back to- Oh! So close and yet so far. Beautiful back heel from Vidal, but Gamora just couldn’t quite get the ball in.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Fucksake,” Rio muttered, her hands on her head.<br/>
</p><p>They high-fived, Gamora locking their hands together.<br/>
</p><p>“We go again,” she said.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“You sure you don’t wanna get that checked out?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio wiped at her nose, feeling crusted dried blood.<br/>
</p><p>“Nah, it’s almost halftime.”<br/>
</p><p>“Alright.”<br/>
</p><p>They jogged up the pitch for Germany’s goal kick.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And it’s halftime. The score is still nil-nil.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Rio sat in the locker room with her head in her hands. She’d been given a new jersey, and her nose had been checked out. Nothing broken, just bruised.<br/>
</p><p>“You okay?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio turned to see Alice.<br/>
</p><p>“We can’t lose.” It was all Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“We won’t, Ri.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio buried her face back into her hands.<br/>
</p><p>Esther had given the team talk, had developed their strategy, had told Rio she was being subbed off.<br/>
</p><p>She’d tried to reason with her, and Esther was hearing none of it.<br/>
</p><p>Who gave a fuck if Rio’s knee was fucked? Rio certainly didn’t. She wasn’t experiencing any pain, she wasn’t limping, she could fucking play!<br/>
</p><p>This wasn’t about the knee.<br/>
</p><p>This was about Rio going to watch Agatha play. She wouldn’t change what she’d done, but fuck, if her coach could stop being petty for five seconds and let her help Spain get to the final.<br/>
</p><p>Her head coach entered the locker room.<br/>
</p><p>“Vamos,” Esther said.<br/>
</p><p>Alice clapped Rio on the shoulder as the girls began to leave.<br/>
</p><p>Rio huffed before getting up to join them.<br/>
</p><p>Esther held a hand out to stop her. “Don’t fuck with Spain’s future because you’re too busy pining over a girl.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio glared at her.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re on, Vidal. Don’t make me regret this.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips lifted. “When have I ever?”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The one hundred-and-eighteenth minute.<br/>
</p><p>The likelihood that this game would go to penalties was feeling more and more likely.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Still nil-nil for this Germany vs Spain semifinal. So many shots on goal, none of them landing. Huge credit to the goalkeepers who have been nothing but outstanding this entire tournament.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio smelt of grass and sweat. Thank god she’d decided to braid her ponytail instead of leaving it out like usual. There was no worse feeling in the world than your hair sticking to sweaty skin.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Weber – oh! She won’t be happy with that, given the ball right to Wu-Gulliver.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Alice slid the ball passed three German players to Gamora.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Into Vidal, clever.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio sprinted after the ball as it rolled into the box. She could hear the harsh thuds of a German behind her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Gets a cross a way – SCORES!!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The stadium erupted.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“One of the world’s best players and she just keeps on proving it! A moment of real quality from the Spanish Stargirl! Who was doubting her? It certainly wasn’t me.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>All Rio could think to do was run, run to her team in the dugouts who were already bolting towards her.<br/>
</p><p>America Chavez got to her first, picking her up and twirling her.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio, that was insane!”<br/>
</p><p>America put her down, and her team swarmed her. They shook and hugged and clapped her on any limb they could reach as a huddle formed around her.<br/>
</p><p>“We could get to that final,” someone said.<br/>
</p><p>“There’s only a minute left to play,” another said.<br/>
</p><p>“The Spanish fucking Stargirl!” That was Alice.<br/>
</p><p>Her team fell away, and Alice grabbed her, squeezing Rio so tightly she couldn’t breathe.<br/>
</p><p>“You absolute freak! How’d you squeeze the ball in from where you were?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio only shrugged because she genuinely didn’t know.<br/>
</p><p>Alice kissed her on the forehead. “I love you, did you know that?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed, pulling back. “I did actually, and I love you too.”<br/>
</p><p>“There she is!” Gamora said, yanking Rio into another life-threatening hug. “I owe you whatever you want if we make it to that final.”<br/>
</p><p>They walked back onto the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>“Imma hold you to that.”<br/>
</p><p>“As you should.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio grinned.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>The final whistle blew.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Spain has made history! This will be their first Euros final ever!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio couldn’t process any of it. Instead, she dropped to the ground, her head in her hands.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What the fuck?!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Ri! Ri, get up! We’re going to the final!” Alice screamed.<br/>
</p><p>Rio felt hands on her, felt her best friend lifting her off the floor.<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t just fucking stand there! Come on!” Alice laughed as she ran to join the others on the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>Red. A whole fucking sea of it.<br/>
</p><p>Rio held her hands behind her head, <em>tried<em> at least to take it all in.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Where to start?<br/>
</p><p>They were through to the finals, her knee fucking killed, she was one step closer to lifting that trophy, one step closer to…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>The answer.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>To finding out if Agatha loved her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s legs began to move as she sprinted to join her team.<br/>
</p><p>Now that was something to fucking celebrate.</p>

<p>The last thing Rio wanted to do was an interview. She was on cloud fucking nine. There were teammates to hug, songs to dance to, family to greet. She was wasting valuable seconds talking to a camera.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio,” the interviewer smiled. “What a game.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, a smile mirroring the interviewer's.<br/>
</p><p>The game.<br/>
</p><p>The history Spain had made.<br/>
</p><p>The very real chance Rio had at getting her answer.<br/>
</p><p>That smile turned into a grin.<br/>
</p><p>“This team has made history. Tell us what it’s like to play amongst them.”<br/>
</p><p>“Inspiring,” Rio began. “This generation of players is something special, and all I can say is how privileged I am that I get to play with them.”<br/>
</p><p>The interviewer put a hand to her heart, her expression sincere. “That’s beautiful. Now, tonight’s celebrations can’t last long because you’ve got a final to prepare for.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded again.<br/>
</p><p>“You’ll be playing against either England or Italy. Which one would you rather play against?” The interviewer asked, her smile turning mischievous.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>England without a doubt.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“They’re both great teams. Whoever we’re up against will be a tough game.”<br/>
</p><p>The interviewer narrowed her eyes, smelling the bullshit from a mile away.<br/>
</p><p>“I agree,” she said instead of calling Rio out. “Will you be watching the England vs Italy semifinal?”<br/>
</p><p>“Of course. I think all of Spain will,” Rio quipped.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, they will. Go celebrate, Rio. Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you.”<br/>

<strong>Zurich, Switzerland – Day 24 of the 2025 Women’s Euros:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Semifinal game two: England vs Italy.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Abby couldn’t believe it. She was in Switzerland, about to watch her team play in their second Euros semifinal in a row.<br/>
</p><p>Her mum’s work had offered them tickets, and Abby begged her mother to let her miss school so they could go. After Abby’s persistent hounding (her mum’s words) her mother caved, and there Abby was amongst the other England supporters in the sold-out stadium.<br/>
</p><p>She pinched herself when the English and Italian players emerged from the tunnels, pinched herself again when the national anthem rang out as she sang along with her favourites on the pitch. What really did it for Abby, however, was when Agatha Harkness appeared on the big screen. Abby was breathing the same air as England’s number ten, their golden girl.<br/>
</p><p>Abby wasn’t sure how she hadn’t passed out.<br/>
</p><p>Her mother had gotten brilliant seats too, she was only five rows away from the pitch, five rows away from being able to touch the sacred grass that might be the grass England made it to <em>another<em> Euros final on.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The Italian anthem ended, and the captains met the referee for the toss-up.<br/>
</p><p>Abby checked her phone for the time, grinning when her lockscreen shone back at her. It was a picture of Rio Vidal from the Spain vs Germany semifinal. She was standing with her hands on her hips, blood coming out her nose. It brought Abby great joy to know that she had the same lockscreen as Agatha. Photos of her leaving the England camp before tonight’s game had caught it as she waved at fans. Of course, Twitter had picked up on it immediately, and the images spread like wildfire.<br/>
</p><p>22:01.<br/>
</p><p>Kick off was going to be late.<br/>
</p><p>She bit her nails, legs bouncing as the girls got into position.<br/>
</p><p>England’s ball.<br/>
</p><p>This was it. England had ninety minutes between them and a second European Championship final, ninety minutes between them and making history, ninety minutes to change their lives.<br/>
</p><p>Abby sucked in a deep breath.<br/>
</p><p>No biggie.<br/>
</p><p>The whistle blew.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Every Spanish player was glued to their seats back at the Spain camp. There was one outcome most people wanted by the end of this semifinal…<br/>
</p><p>That Italy won.<br/>
</p><p>Understandably, any sane person would rather <em>not<em> play against the reigning champions.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>So, <em>insane<em> was what the rest of the team called Alice and Rio.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>They wanted an England win.<br/>
</p><p>They wanted to go head-to-head with their girls.<br/>
</p><p>Alice grabbed Rio when:<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Bishop finds Belova. Kale in the box, Romonoff in the box, Harkness in the box. And Harkness-”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio dropped her shoulders, Alice throwing her head back.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Saved by the Italian goalkeeper! The first big chance for England.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Mierda.” <em>Shit.<br/>
</em></p><p>“It’s fine,” Alice said, squeezing Rio’s arm. “They’ve already had an attempt, and we’re seven minutes in. They’ll create more.”<br/>
</p><p>“They will,” Rio replied, squeezing Alice back.<br/>
</p><p>“I actually hope they don’t,” America chimed in. “I don’t want to play against England.”<br/>
</p><p>Gamora smirked. “You scared, little one?”<br/>
</p><p>America pulled a face. “Okay, <em>one<em>, just because I’m eighteen doesn’t mean I’m little and two, I’m not scared…I’ve just never played against England before, and they’re good.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Aw, baby’s first international tournament has her playing against some tough teams, whoever would have thought?” Rio teased.<br/>
</p><p>America flipped her off, making the entire team and staff laugh.<br/>
</p><p>“Nah, she’s just worried about going up against Harkness,” Gamora smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“As I should!” America shot back. “She’s one of the best forwards in the <em>world<em>.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>"That she is,” Rio agreed.<br/>
</p><p>“But you’re also a pretty good defender, otherwise you wouldn’t be here,” Alice reminded her.<br/>
</p><p>“No, I know,” America said, slumping in her chair. “I’m getting in my head, playing against England will be fine.”<br/>
</p><p>“You might not have to play against them at all,” Esther grinned.<br/>
</p><p>Rio spun to see the screen.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>No.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Italy’s number eleven had scored. Italy’s number eleven had…<br/>
</p><p>Rio put her face in her hands.<br/>
</p><p>“For fucksake,” Alice muttered.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“England will not be happy with that. It was almost too easy. The Italians have grown more confident with their passing, that, plus England’s inability to get rid of the ball in the box. Too easy.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Come on, Aggs,” she whispered.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>If one more Italian player dived on the floor, Agatha was going to fucking lose it.<br/>
</p><p>The time wasting and the absolute tomfoolery of the Italian players had been nonstop ever since they’d scored that fuck ass goal in the last half.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, yeah, she was fucking fuming about that. How the hell had that even happened?<br/>
</p><p>Didn’t matter.<br/>
</p><p>England were getting another goal, and another after that, and then they were winning in game time. Fuck penalties, they were not going to fucking penalties.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“If you’re joining us now, the score is 1-0 to Italy, scored by Italy’s number eleven, Alessia Costa, in the fourteenth minute of the first half. England have yet to equalise.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha received the ball, looked up to make a pass.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Fantastic ball to Kale, back to Harkness who’s making a break for it.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was going to punch someone.<br/>
</p><p>She felt a drag that she would only feel if someone was pulling on her shirt as she dribbled. Agatha ignored it. Few people could match her in pace; she’d shake the Italian soon enough.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t.<br/>
</p><p>The Italian was relentless.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha yelped, her body flying backwards as the player manhandling her shirt yanked her. She hit the grass with a thud, getting the wind knocked out of her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“I- I’m not even sure what happened there.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha sat up, her hands out in a, ‘what in the actual fuck?’<br/>
</p><p>And the ref…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“It seems like the game is continuing? Italy are making their way back up the pitch.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Are we fucking serious?!” Agatha yelled.<br/>
</p><p>That was a yellow <em>at least.<br/>
</em></p><p>Not according to the referee. When Agatha got up, Ava was diving, denying the Italians another goal.<br/>
</p><p>All Agatha could do was blink. How the bloody hell had that just happened? Did the Italians gain a twelfth player? Evi-fucking-dently. Half the shit their opponents were getting away with, they shouldn’t have.<br/>
</p><p>This was fine (not fine). Agatha would just have to work harder (violence. She was choosing fucking violence).<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Eightieth minute.<br/>
</p><p>If Agatha wasn’t in her black away kit, she was positive she’d look like she’d been dragged through a pigsty. The number of times an Italian had tripped her up; she’d slid for a tackle or been pushed to the floor had to have broken some sort of personal record. Was she even playing football at this point? This felt more like floorball – wait – diveball. Yeah, that felt more adequate.<br/>
</p><p>Italy’s number five was coming towards her. Agatha met her halfway, sticking her foot out in a tackle. She made contact, snuffed the ball out from under the Italian, was about to run off with it when…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Referee’s blown the whistle. Italy’s number five is down!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“You have got to be fucking with me! I didn’t even fucking touch her!” Agatha grit out.<br/>
</p><p>She turned to Italy’s number five rolling around on the floor with her foot in her hands as if Agatha's boots had even made contact.<br/>
</p><p>No thoughts.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha lifted the Italian, placing her on her feet.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, would you look at that, you can stand!” Agatha exclaimed sarcastically.<br/>
</p><p>Italy’s number five pulled a face, and Agatha swore to god if the entire country wasn’t watching her right now, she would’ve swung.<br/>
</p><p>Eighty-fifth minute.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was at her breaking point.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Not a clean tackle from Costa. Harkness luckily catches herself; she would’ve been eating grass otherwise.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>As the ball rolled offside, Agatha snapped.<br/>
</p><p>She spun on Italy’s number eleven, shoving her.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs!”<br/>
</p><p>Maybe Jen was yelling, all Agatha could hear was the ringing in her ears.<br/>
</p><p>She shoved Costa again. “You’ve been tripping me up all night!”<br/>
</p><p>Costa shoved back.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s not my fault you can’t stay on your feet.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Teammates from both sides are getting involved now.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Jen materialised in front of her, pushing Agatha back.<br/>
</p><p>“Fucking stop it!” Jen snapped.<br/>
</p><p>“Stop what?! She keeps tripping me up!”<br/>
</p><p>An arm grabbed her, dragging Agatha away from her public enemy number one.<br/>
</p><p>“Leave it!” Natasha ordered. “Just breathe.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to breathe; she needed to strangle Costa.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t need to-”<br/>
</p><p>“Breathe right the fuck now before the ref tries to give you a yellow,” Natasha barked.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, yes…because Agatha already had one. If she got another, she’d miss the final.<br/>
</p><p>There was no way in fucking hell Agatha was missing that final.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded, sucking in a deep breath.<br/>
</p><p>“Good,” Natasha encouraged.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“The referee is walking over to the England players now. Is this another telling off, or is Harkness getting a card?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“And Harkness is shaking her head here,” the commentator laughed. “Is she refusing a yellow card, I wonder?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“No,” Agatha said flat out. “If you wanna take me off the pitch, you should’ve taken her off twenty minutes ago.”<br/>
</p><p>The referee bit her lip, knowing without a doubt she’d been caught out.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, let’s play.”<br/>
</p><p>“Let’s,” Natasha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Eighty-ninth minute.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Italian corner. This is do or die for England.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Costa. That’s clever. Rossi… Starr! Starr again! Magnificent double save from the England goalkeeper. I really thought Italy had it then. Somehow, England have survived not going two down.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The girls ran back up the field, Ava pushing Italian players out of her box as they went.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Starr wants to get on with it.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh, and eight minutes of injury time has been added.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Ninety-third minute.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Belova sends it forward, blocked by Rossi. The Italian players have been nailing it tonight, keeping their play organised, passes accurate. I bet the English were not expecting this from the underdogs.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Bishop, Belova sends it in, terrific ball!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Jen jumped too far, missing the header. The ball landed in the keeper's hands.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Goalkeeper hasn’t been able to keep a hold of that – HARKNESSSSSSS!!!!!!! THE ONE, THE ONLY, ENGLAND'S GOLDEN GIRL!!!!!!!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>No time to celebrate. Agatha was in the goal grabbing the ball and out again.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Listen to that roar! I don’t think the cameras are doing it justice; my eardrums feel like they’re going to shatter! England’s number ten does it again!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Every day I have to remind myself that she is amongst the younger players in the squad. Twenty-three,” the commentator shook her head. “Twenty-three,” she repeated.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Ninety-sixth minute.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Kale…still going – cross comes in – England appealing for a penalty!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Ref!” The English girls yelled in unison, their hands up, eyes darting to Yelena who was on the ground.<br/>
</p><p>What was with their opponents and the fucking shirt pulling?!<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And the referee gives it!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha took it back, every thought she had about murdering their ref forgotten. She could kiss the referee on the forehead, nay, give her her unborn child.<br/>
</p><p>The Italians swarmed the ref immediately, vocalising their disagreement through shouts.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha fought to hide her smirk.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“A foul on Belova. Italy can’t believe it.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Without question, Agatha stood on the penalty spot. She wouldn’t be moving, not when she’d already seen Italian players try to kick up the grass to make the surface uneven. Agatha would guard this spot with her life if that's what it came down to.<br/>
</p><p>“You good?” Jen asked, joining her.<br/>
</p><p>More than once, an Italian had tried to nudge Agatha off the spot. Jen was providing backup.<br/>
</p><p>“Peachy,” Agatha winked.<br/>
</p><p>Because she genuinely was. It was the ninety-something minute, and this free kick was the only thing stopping them from getting to that final.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Is Harkness going to take it?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Natasha came up to them, ball in hand.<br/>
</p><p>“You got this?”<br/>
</p><p>“I got it,” Natasha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“The floor is yours,” Agatha said dramatically, which earned her laughter in response.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Romonoff, the woman who could be responsible for getting England to another Euros final.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The whistle blew.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“With the run-up.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Saved by the Italian goalkeeper!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha charged forward.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“But Romonoff gets the rebound!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>They’d done it.<br/>
</p><p>England…had fucking done it!<br/>
</p><p>Jen grabbed Agatha’s hand as they shot off to join Natasha in the corner celebrating.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“What were we worried about? This English team, their fight, their love for the game always so evident! A goal down for the majority of this match was never going to stop them!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha and Jen yanked Natasha into a bear hug.<br/>
</p><p>"I fucking love you!” Agatha exclaimed.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“The Italians cannot believe this has happened to them. One wrong shirt pull may have lost them this semifinal.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Full-time.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“They were never going to make that easy for us,” the commentator grinned. “Always the hard way with this England squad.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“That’s my girl,” Rio smiled to herself as she watched the England girls celebrating on screen.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha looked so happy, her smile bright and wide like it always was when she won, when Rio made her laugh, when she was just around Rio in general.<br/>
</p><p>“Looks like you’re going to be up against Rio’s girlfriend after all, America,” Claudia, one of Spain’s midfielders, called from across the room.<br/>
</p><p>The girls laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“She’s not my girlfriend,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Yet,” Alice nudged her.<br/>
</p><p>This final was going to answer everything.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Abby couldn’t fucking believe it.<br/>
</p><p>After watching half the game with her heart in her ass, the girls had done it, made it to yet another Euros final. She still had tears in her eyes as she danced to <em>Sweet Caroline<em>. The girls were below her on the field, jumping and swinging their arms up and down.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Abby cried harder.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you need a tissue?” Her mum asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Please,” Abby replied as she wiped at her tears.<br/>
</p><p>And then Abby’s heart stopped.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha Harkness and Jennifer Kale were looking directly at her, pointing at <em>her<em>. Yeah, Abby was going to faint. No – die. Abby was going to die.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Jen was saying something, and Agatha smiled and nodded. They ran up to the stands hand in hand.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>What is she doing?<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha tugged off her shirt and handed it to one of the security men.<br/>
</p><p>“Give it to the girl over there,” Agatha said.<br/>
</p><p>The security guard pointed at another girl in front of Abby.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “No, the one in the Harkness shirt.”<br/>
</p><p>Abby pointed to herself.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes, you,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Yeah…Abby was going to die.<br/>
</p><p>The security guard reached across the stands to hand Abby Agatha’s jersey. She couldn’t believe it. There was no way in fucking hell that Agatha fucking Harkness had just given Abby her shirt.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you!” Abby called through sobs.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re welcome!” Agatha grinned, turning away.<br/>
</p><p>Abby didn’t know why she’d said this; it was just that she’d spoken to her favourite player of all time and needed to say more than two words to her.<br/>
</p><p>“I love your lock screen by the way!”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha turned back. “Me too,” she winked.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>England were headed to their second Euros final in a row.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha threw her head back, that smile she’d been wearing since they’d won firmly in place. She took it all in. Her teammates dotted about the pitch, the remaining fans still dancing in the stands, her head coach making her third lot of rounds.<br/>
</p><p>Nothing on earth could ruin this moment.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>If you lose to Spain, you have to tell Rio you love her.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha snapped her head forward at the thought.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck!<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha Harkness might actually have to tell Rio Vidal she loved her.</p>

<strong>England vs Italy semifinal – post-match interviews:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Billy stood ready as he waited for each of the girls to walk past:<br/>
</p><p>“The English are never done!” Harkness shouted when she and Kale approached, arms slung around each other.<br/>
</p><p>“Come on,” Jen added, shaking her fist before they left.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t have any words,” Bishop answered, taking the time to stop. “Like honest to god I have no words. I just…I can’t believe it,” she continued, running her hand down her sweaty face.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m over the moon,” Ava told the camera. “I’m excited, I’m everything all at once. To get to another final?” She shrugged. “You can’t put that into words.”<br/>
</p><p>“Billyyyy!” Yelena exclaimed when she saw him.<br/>
</p><p>Now Billy didn’t have favourites, but Yelena was definitely his favourite.<br/>
</p><p>He smiled. “How are you feeling?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m fucking buzzing!”<br/>
</p><p>Billy scowled at her.<br/>
</p><p>“Sorry, BBC. Sorry, Ofcom,” Yelena apologised half-heartedly. “Can you blame me? We’re in another final, baby!”<br/>
</p><p>“Three major tournament finals in a row,” Natasha said, shaking her head as if she couldn’t quite believe it. “Six semifinals in a row.” She paused. “I guess this is just what we do now.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to tell Rio she loved her, and yet the first thing she did when she had a moment alone was call her.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey, loser.”<br/>
</p><p>That voice. That Spanish accent.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha tried not to smile; she really did.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha smiled.<br/>
</p><p>She was too high on the win, on Rio adding to the high just by simply answering the phone to not indulge in it.<br/>
</p><p>“So…it’s you and me then?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.<br/>
</p><p>“And the rest of Spain and England at the final,” Rio added.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed, disappointment washing over her for a brief moment before she shook it off. “Y-yeah. Looks like it.”<br/>
</p><p>There was silence on the other end.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha waited…<br/>
</p><p>And waited…<br/>
</p><p>“Hello-?”<br/>
</p><p>“What’s wrong with you?” Rio asked at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>“Huh?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’re all quiet and stuttery as if you’re unsure. I don’t think you’ve ever been unsure…ever.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I’m fucking up my rep then?”<br/>
</p><p>“What’s up, baby?” Rio replied, seeing straight through Agatha’s deflection.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Baby.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio never hesitated to call her that, even when Agatha only repaid the favour during sex or to get what she wanted. The most casual term of endearment, and yet Agatha melted every time she heard it from Rio’s mouth. The most casual term of endearment, and yet Agatha was scared to use it herself.<br/>
</p><p>“Nothing. My head's just all over the place. I don’t know what to process first,” Agatha answered.<br/>
</p><p>“Break it up.”<br/>
</p><p>“Huh?”<br/>
</p><p>“Tell me all the things you’re thinking about. When you’ve said them out loud, they’ll be easier to categorise,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t know-”<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha could picture how Rio said that, arms crossed, face twisted in that expression she made when she was fed up.<br/>
</p><p>It made Agatha smile. “Fine.” She tilted her head to think. “I’m excited about the win, I’m dreading final interviews, itching for that final, I don’t wanna lose, I want to know why you iced me out on media day.”<br/>
</p><p>The reply came just as fast. “Proud of you for winning, final interviews will be over before you know it, me too, me neither.”<br/>
</p><p>“And the last bit,” Agatha prompted. “Why’d you ignore me, Rio?”<br/>
</p><p>Because she’d thought about it every day since it happened. Because she was finally ready to get out of her own way and ask. Because Rio Vidal had hurt her fucking feelings for no goddamn reason and Agatha needed to know why.<br/>
</p><p>“I…” Rio started, clearing her throat. “I shouldn’t have, so I’m apologising first. And why? You hurt me, Aggs.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha furrowed her eyebrows.<br/>
</p><p>“I asked you if you loved me and your response was that I had to win the Euros just to find out. I have to win the biggest tournament in Europe just so you can admit that you love me.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.<br/>
</p><p>“And I know that’s what we do. We’re athletes, we compete and fight for everything we want. It’s just…I just-”<br/>
</p><p>“Go on,” Agatha urged.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sighed. “I just didn’t think I’d have to compete for your love.”<br/>
</p><p>That’s not…that wasn’t what Agatha had meant by this.<br/>
</p><p>It had always been about time, about Agatha needing it to sort her fucking shit out.<br/>
</p><p>“Rio-”<br/>
</p><p>“Hold on,” Rio interrupted.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha heard Alice on the other end.<br/>
</p><p>“I gotta go,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>“I…okay.”<br/>
</p><p>The line went dead.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>

</em></strong>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Like Agatha, Rio wasn’t a huge fan of interviews. Well, not these types of interviews anyway. She could deal with the post-match press conferences/pitch side shit. It was always the lead-up talks to international tournaments and finals that made her squirm.<br/>
</p><p>Nine times out of ten you had to get <em>deep.<br/>
</em></p><p>This is what came with being a footballer nowadays. The sharing your personal stories, the marketing schemes, the social media posts, which Rio didn’t mind for the most part. The women’s game had grown to a size she never would’ve dreamed of as a kid. She just didn’t like the fact that she couldn’t just be a footballer.<br/>
</p><p>She had to be a model, a brand ambassador, marketable.<br/>
</p><p>Her eyes flicked across the small room, taking in the grey backdrop, cameras, and lights before they landed on the interviewer, Olivia. She smiled, Rio smiled back.<br/>
</p><p>At least it was someone she knew. Olivia had been interviewing Rio for years, and they’d become friends.<br/>
</p><p>“Hi, Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>“Hi,” Rio replied.<br/>
</p><p>“You ready?”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Perfect.”<br/>
</p><p>The camerawoman pressed record, and Rio shifted in her seat to get comfortable.<br/>
</p><p>“Huge achievement for Spain,” Olivia started. “What would you tell the little girl who dreamt of all this?”<br/>
</p><p>“I would tell her not to think so small, that the world is her oyster and she’s going to be playing in one of the most talented generations of Spanish football.”<br/>
</p><p>“And she’s going to be one of the best, if not <em>the<em> best player in the world,” Olivia added.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio shook her head playfully. “Definitely not, but I’m grateful to be recognised in the way that I am.”<br/>
</p><p>“What drives you to be the best, Rio?”<br/>
</p><p>“My madre, the stories she told me about playing in the streets of Puerto Rico with her friends. Football was never big there; it was only when she moved to Spain that she was in the height of it all. Unfortunately, it was too late for her to join a team by then.”<br/>
</p><p>“But not too late for you?” Olivia smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s mirrored hers. “No. She always thought I was pretending to like football because she did, but when I was serious about joining a team, she knew I meant it.” Rio paused, finding the right words. “She is who drives me. I know she’s watching me from her seat in the sky.”<br/>
</p><p>The 23/24 season had been the worst year of Rio’s life. First, it was the knee, and the next it was her mother’s passing.<br/>
</p><p>She almost quit.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t play, her inspiration was dead, and she didn’t have a constant source of income.<br/>
</p><p>It was her father who kept encouraging her with words whilst in recovery.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha who wouldn’t let her throw in the towel with actions.<br/>
</p><p>She’d forced Rio to go to physio, to do as much training as she were allowed to, to continue to eat, sleep and breathe as a footballer even though she wasn’t one.<br/>
</p><p>When Rio really thought about it, she wouldn’t be at this Euros final without her. In other words, Agatha is who drives her too.<br/>
</p><p>“She’d be so proud of you,” Olivia nodded.<br/>
</p><p>Rio smiled. “Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>“Now,” Olivia began, switching subjects. “There has been a lot of talk about your injury.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio forced herself not to roll her eyes. She was never going to escape the topic of her goddamn knee.<br/>
</p><p>“What does this mean for you as a player after the Euros?” Olivia continued.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not retiring if that’s what you’re asking,” Rio replied, which made Olivia laugh. “After the Euros I’ll take the appropriate steps to recover, but I’m not done with football. I’m twenty-three, I still have a decade in me at least.”<br/>
</p><p>Olivia laughed again. “Damn straight.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Billy was doing yet another round of street interviews. He wasn’t complaining, Billy loved his job, but he was only <em>one<em> teenage gay having to chase down the British public in bloody Zurich.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Excuse me, excuse me,” Billy called as he ran after a couple holding hands. One was in a Spanish jersey, the other in a Lionesses.<br/>
</p><p>The couple turned around. “Yes?” The shorter one answered.<br/>
</p><p>“Who do you think will win the Euros?” Billy asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Spain.”<br/>
</p><p>“England,” the couple replied at the same time.<br/>
</p><p>They glanced at each other, then laughed.<br/>
</p><p>“So you two are rivals?” Billy said, waving the mic between them.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” the taller one replied. “I’m English, she’s Spanish. The arguing in our household is non-stop when international tournaments are on.”<br/>
</p><p>The shortest of the pair smiled. “But we wouldn’t have it any other way.”<br/>
</p><p>“We like to joke that we’re Harkness and Vidal. Spanish and English yet madly in love,” the taller one added.<br/>
</p><p>And Billy wasn’t supposed to be asking about Harkness and Vidal, but Billy was nosey.<br/>
</p><p>“You think Harkness and Vidal are in love?”<br/>
</p><p>The couple raised an eyebrow simultaneously.<br/>
</p><p>“Have you been living under a rock?” The shorter one replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Harkness has been in love with Vidal since she joined Barca four years ago,” her girlfriend chimed in. “Vidal fell for her afterwards.”<br/>
</p><p>The shorter of the two jerked her head back. “Erm…no. Vidal fell first.”<br/>
</p><p>“What? No.”<br/>
</p><p>Billy could feel an argument brewing.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay, thank you, ladies!”<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you,” they replied before going back to their dispute.<br/>
</p><p>Billy’s eyes snagged onto a girl with her mother. Luckily for him they were stationary, so he wouldn’t have to flag them down.<br/>
</p><p>“Excuse me, ma’am. I’m with the BBC and I would love if I could interview your daughter for our TikTok.”<br/>
</p><p>The redhead in her Harkness shirt looked at her mum and nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“Okay then,” her mother smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Brilliant.” Billy cleared his throat. “Do you think England has what it takes to win the Euros?”<br/>
</p><p>“Of course,” the girl replied. “The English are never done.”<br/>
</p><p>“A Harkness quote,” Billy winked. “I’m guessing she’s your favourite player?” he nodded to her shirt.<br/>
</p><p>“Yes,” the girl replied. “But so is Rio.” She brought up her phone and showed the camera her lock screen with Spain’s number ten and her bloody nose.<br/>
</p><p>“So you must love the fact that your two favs have made the final?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m ecstatic,” the girl answered. “It’s going to be nice to see them on the pitch together…but England must win,” she added.<br/>
</p><p>Billy laughed. “Thank you.”<br/>
</p><p>The girl and her mother smiled.<br/>
</p><p>Billy and his cameraman walked over to a group of boys sitting on a bench. Every one of them was wearing a different player's jersey.<br/>
</p><p>Billy knew exactly what question he was going to ask.<br/>
</p><p>“Who do you think deserves player of the tournament?” He asked when he’d gone through the instructions.<br/>
</p><p>“Kale, easy,” the first boy replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Vidal,” two of the boys answered next.<br/>
</p><p>The one with the beard elaborated. “She’s been playing the entire tournament with a fucked knee – I mean…can you bleep that out?”<br/>
</p><p>“We’re gonna have to, yes,” Billy huffed.<br/>
</p><p>“My bad, G. Anyways, Vidal <em>has<em> to get it. The Euros is hers. She was crowned player of the year after being out all of last season because of her injury, which made her almost quit football altogether, and on top of that, she was dealing with her mum’s death. She’s scored the most goals-”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Nah, nah,” his friend with his white Harkness jersey interrupted. “Harkness deserves it. She saved England not once but twice. Nobody else can say that. Her marj died recently too. England <em>legend<em> might I add, and she’s still performing the way she is? She’s special.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>“Why ain’t neither of you saying Romonoff?” another one of their friends jumped in.<br/>
</p><p>Billy realised he probably shouldn’t have asked this question.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>More filming for the Lionesses documentary.<br/>
</p><p>“What’s this segment called again?” Jen asked.<br/>
</p><p>“The evolution of women’s football in England,” Natasha replied.<br/>
</p><p>“Ah,” Jen acknowledged.<br/>
</p><p>“Alright, Agatha. You’re up first,” the interviewer told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Ooo, goodie!” Agatha replied sarcastically, which made everyone laugh.<br/>
</p><p>She sat on that same uncomfortable chair.<br/>
</p><p>“We’re just diving straight in,” the interviewer said.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded.<br/>
</p><p>She was instructed to watch a video; questions were to follow. It showed the start of women’s football in England during the Second World War, how popular it became, how it got banned for fifty years afterwards due to it ‘Threatening the men’s game’ and ‘Women were forgetting their values.’ Opinionated men would voice over the videos stating: ‘Nobody watches women’s football,’ ‘It’s being shoved down our throats,’ ‘Little girls shouldn’t want to grow up to be footballers, they should want to grow up to be wives.’<br/>
</p><p>After the video finished, Agatha felt a mix of emotions. She didn’t know whether she wanted to cry, scream or punch someone.<br/>
</p><p>“How does that make you feel?” The interviewer began.<br/>
</p><p>“It makes me so proud to be sitting here,” Agatha started. “The women who paved the way for the women’s game to be as big as it is now for me and my teammates is something I’ll never be able to repay.”<br/>
</p><p>“The game continues to grow every year, and if it weren’t for those who kept pushing when we didn’t get the interviews, the sold-out stadiums, the sponsorships,” Agatha shrugged. “I wouldn’t be here.”<br/>
</p><p>“It must mean even more to you considering who your mother is.”<br/>
</p><p>Ah, yes. England legend and one of the lead drivers of women’s football in Britain. Agatha truly appreciated what her mother did for the game; she just wished people knew how much of an evil fucking cunt she was.<br/>
</p><p>She nodded not wanting to say anything.<br/>
</p><p>“And what do you have to say about the men who had some rather strong opinions?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Their opinions are irrelevant. ‘Nobody watches women’s football’ and yet our semifinal was the most watched thing on the BBC this year, mind you, the final hasn’t even happened yet.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m proud of my job, of my team, and I’m grateful that little girls know that there is a place for them in football.”<br/>
</p><p>“How important is it to you that you get to be that role model?”<br/>
</p><p>“One of them,” Agatha corrected. “And extremely. It’s one of the things I love most about being a footballer. I get to contribute to the ever-growing pool of talented players that young women and girls have.”<br/>
</p><p>“I know a lot of my teammates, club and country didn’t have many growing up, had to play on boys teams because there were no girls teams near them, were bullied at school for ‘playing boys sports.’”</p><p>”That narrative has changed.” Agatha paused before she added, “Everyone’s watching women’s football.”<br/>

</p><p>Women’s football. It wasn’t going anywhere.<br/>
</p><p>Billy fluffed his hair and cleared his throat. His cameraman started recording, panning to the stadium behind him before the camera landed on him.<br/>

<strong>Basel, Switzerland – Day 28 of the 2025 Women’s Euros:<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>An hour and a half until the England vs Spain final.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>Rio stared at it.<br/>
</p><p>The empty stands that were soon to be filled, the Spanish and English players in their pregame tracksuits, the various TV show presenters dotted about the pitch with their camera crews for their lead-up segments.<br/>
</p><p>It felt out of body. Finals would always feel out of body.<br/>
</p><p>She turned in her spot in the centre circle and visualised the roar of the crowd when Spain scored, the way she’d strike the ball into the net, the way she would run laps around her opponents.<br/>
</p><p>Pre-match rituals and all that shit.<br/>
</p><p>She huffed, adjusting her noise-cancelling headphones before stuffing her hands in her grey Adidas tracksuit and walking towards the goal ahead. Alice nodded when she passed. The entire team knew to leave Rio alone during the walkout. She needed this time to get in the zone, to drown out the outside noise, to forget about the pressure…<br/>
</p><p>About Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>She couldn’t let the woman she loved get in her head and fuck up her focus.<br/>
</p><p>Football was more important than feelings.<br/>
</p><p>She realised the other day, after her phone call with Agatha, that she probably wasn’t getting that answer whether Spain won or not. It had taken Agatha almost a month to ask Rio why she’d iced her out; she would need more than that to work up the courage to admit she loved her.<br/>
</p><p>Like Rio said though, the answer no longer mattered; only the win did.<br/>
</p><p>She rested her forehead on the cool metal post of the goal, breathed in and shut her eyes letting her mind go blank before an image of her scoring a goal flashed inside her head.<br/>
</p><p>Some may say her pre-match rituals were odd, but they weren’t one of the best footballers in the world, were they?<br/>
</p><p>A sudden urge to look down the field overcame her. Rio didn’t question it, just turned her head.<br/>
</p><p>She shouldn’t have.<br/>
</p><p>Her brows pinched when she saw Agatha in her black and magenta Nike tracksuit doing the same as her, forehead and hands pressed against the goal post imagining a goal going in.<br/>
</p><p>Rio sucked in another deep breath.<br/>
</p><p>Her feelings were trying to win out over football again.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<strong>Half an hour until the England vs Spain final.<br/>
</strong>
</p><p>“Play to win.” It was the first thing Rio said when she saw her.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had texted Rio to meet in one of the conference rooms before the game started.<br/>
</p><p>“I know you know this, but I’m reminding you.” Rio waved her hand between them. “<em>We<em> will be fine after this game regardless of the outcome, okay?”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>And somehow Agatha knew she didn’t mean it.<br/>
</p><p>“I-”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not finished,” Rio cut in. “You’re playing for your country just like I’m playing for mine. The deal we’ve made is at the back of our minds during this.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t think she could put it at the back of her mind. She was the one who introduced it, she was the one who made Rio believe she wasn’t worthy of her love, she was the one who had fucked everything up.<br/>
</p><p>“My turn?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m sorry. I never should’ve-”<br/>
</p><p>“No,” Rio cut in. “What’d I say? This is bigger than us; our feelings come second.”<br/>
</p><p>Actually, Rio had revealed that her feelings were at the forefront by not wanting to acknowledge them. She’d ripped a page from the Agatha Harkness avoidant playbook.<br/>
</p><p>“Play to win,” Rio said sternly.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Play to win.”<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes didn’t leave grey for a moment until Rio cleared her throat.<br/>
</p><p>“Good luck,” Rio told her.<br/>
</p><p>“Good luck,” Agatha echoed.<br/>
</p><p>She moved to leave, and Agatha couldn’t help herself. She leaned in and kissed Rio on the cheek making her freeze as if she’d just been turned to stone.<br/>
</p><p>The look she was giving Agatha, the confusion, the desperation, the betrayal.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Wait, fuck! I didn’t mean-<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio left without a word.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Milly Hope, ITV’s women’s football presenter, fixed her clothing as her producer counted down from five.<br/>
</p><p>“And we’re live.”<br/>
</p><p>Milly smiled. “Good evening, everyone. I’m here live from Basel at the England vs Spain European Championship final. She gestured to the women in the seats beside her. “I’m joined by Libby Matthews, former England player once again, with the addition of former Spanish player Vicky Pina.”<br/>
</p><p>The two women smiled.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you for joining us this evening, ladies.”<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you for having us,” the pair replied in unison.<br/>
</p><p>“How do you think your teams will be feeling going into this final tonight? Libby, you first.”<br/>
</p><p>Libby nodded. “I know the girls will be feeling the pressure. They are the reigning champions, they lost to Spain at the World Cup final, and they’ve had to prove themselves <em>again<em> this Euros because of the way this tournament started by losing to France.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Milly leaned in, urging Libby on.<br/>
</p><p>“But I believe they’ll be able to tune it out and focus on the win. They’ve won before; they know they are capable of doing it again. They just need to keep playing with the resilience they’ve been displaying this entire tournament.”<br/>
</p><p>“They had to get here the hard way, didn’t they?” Milly quipped.<br/>
</p><p>“This is England,” Libby laughed. “We can never make it easy.”<br/>
</p><p>“And Vicky?” Milly said, shifting her attention to her. “How do you think the Spanish girls will be feeling right now?”<br/>
</p><p>“I think they’ll also be feeling the pressure. The last time they were at a major tournament final, like Libby said, they won, and they won against the English. This is the first time they’ve made it to a Euros final. They already have a World Cup; they’ll be expected to get a European Championship.”<br/>
</p><p>Milly nodded.<br/>
</p><p>“I, too, hope the girls tune it out. They know how good they are, they have what it takes to win, and I know they can do it,” Vicky concluded.<br/>
</p><p>Milly turned to the camera. “Well, you’ve heard it from Spain and England’s finest.”<br/>
</p><p>The studio cracked up laughing.<br/>
</p><p>Milly smiled. “We’ll see you all back here at halftime. It’s off to Jill in the commentator box. Bye for now.”<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Abby didn’t think she had it in her to sing the national anthem. She felt like she was going to throw up every time she opened her mouth. The nerves she felt were unlike any other and she wasn’t even on the fucking pitch.<br/>
</p><p>She had good seats again, fourth row up from the field with a great view of the big screens. The camera was panning across Harkness when Abby looked, and she grinned. She’d done her hair like Vidal again.<br/>
</p><p>The Spanish national anthem began, and the camera moved on to the Spanish girls. Of course, it spent a decent amount of time on Vidal. Her knee, unfortunately, was taped up. Her nails however…Abby grinned again. Her nails still had an ‘A’ on her index finger.<br/>
</p><p>The Spanish anthem wrapped up, and the Spanish and English players clapped hands.<br/>
</p><p>It was like the whole stadium fell into silence when Harkness and Vidal touched. Grey eyes locked with brown, hands clasped as if maybe neither of them wanted to let go before Vidal moved on to Kale.<br/>
</p><p>Abby sighed.<br/>
</p><p>Barcelona teammates turned rivals.<br/>
</p><p>Once they were finished, the two captains met the referee for the toss-up.<br/>
</p><p>England’s ball.<br/>
</p><p>Abby checked her phone for the time.<br/>
</p><p>17:58.<br/>
</p><p>Two minutes till kick off.<br/>
</p><p>Two minutes until that question everyone needed answering could be answered.<br/>
</p><p>Who was winning this?<br/>
</p><p>Was it England?<br/>
</p><p>Or was it Spain?<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Focus.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Because the only thing that mattered was that ball and putting it into the back of the net as many times as possible.<br/>
</p><p>As long as Rio Vidal was on that pitch, England were not winning this final.<br/>
</p><p>The whistle blew.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And so it begins. The European Championship final. The Defending Champions versus the World Champions.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Belova to Starr.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio watched whilst she ran as England’s goalkeeper kicked the ball down the pitch. Kale jumped for the header, put too much power on it, the ball bounced offside.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Spain throw in.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio signalled for the ball and Alice threw it. She tapped it with her foot, sending it back to Alice, who kicked it over the heads of three England players.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And it’s right back to England. Harkness with the ball, through to Bishop.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio huffed as the English players passed between their defence. She moved back up the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Back to Starr. Lovely ball and oh!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Natasha was running straight into the penalty box, effortlessly dribbling past Spanish players.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Harkness is calling for it, Romonoff sees the open space and – so unlucky! Saved by the Spanish goalkeeper.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio threw her head back.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Thank fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>An early England goal would’ve put a spanner in the works.<br/>
</p><p>Eighth minute.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Gamora, looking for a pass.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio called for it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Vidal.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio pushed the ball forward, eyes darting around the multiple options. Every Spanish player never without an English.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Perez down the left-hand side.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio slid the ball to Claudia.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Back to Vidal – extremely clever!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio let the ball nutmeg her before she ran around England’s number five and onto the ball rolling ahead.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t think, should’ve.<br/>
</p><p>She swung her right foot sending the ball hurdling through the air.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Oh…Oh. So unfortunate for Vidal there. If that had gone in, that would’ve been an amazing run.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. So close. If only Starr had been a millisecond slower.<br/>
</p><p>“Good try, Ri!” Alice called from somewhere.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t want a good <em>try<em>; she wanted a good goal.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Not fucking good enough.<br/>
</p><p>She ran back up the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>Thirtieth minute.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Spain seems to have found their footing. Possession is 67 to 33. At the beginning of the match, we were not seeing stats like this. Have England fallen asleep, or is this just the real Spain coming out to play?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Wu-Gulliver to Vidal. Oh! It’s beautiful!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>JRK Chop, Bishop slid to the floor, Rio leaving her in her wake.<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked up to make a pass.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And I think we’ve all been waiting for this interaction.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>Grey eyes hardened…maybe? Rio didn’t look at them for long. She pressed forward, Agatha cautiously inching backwards, her eyes never not tracking Rio’s movements.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Oh, baby. So silly.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio slipped the ball in between Agatha’s legs to Gamora behind her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Simple enough.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Gamora chipped the ball into the box where Alice jumped, head-skimming the ball.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Saved by Starr! She is on fire tonight!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Fuck!”<br/>
</p><p>Rio knew Ava was good, but had she always been <em>this<em> good? The quiet fury that had been stirring within Rio since about the fifth minute of the match was starting to get real loud.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Thirty-ninth minute.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“A triple save?!?! Oh wow! These goalkeepers tonight! England so close yet so far.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio felt sick. Three direct shots on the Spanish target?!<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Goal kick.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Carolina passed to America. Rio signalled for it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Vidal – and she’s down. Ouch! Not a clean tackle whatsoever.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Pain shot down Rio’s leg from the impact.<br/>
</p><p>“Fuck!” She grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“That won’t be good for the knee.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“You okay?” Agatha asked, panicked.<br/>
</p><p>Rio glared at her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Don’t respond.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Because if she did, she’d scream.<br/>
</p><p>“Do you need the medics?” Alice asked as she came over.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “No, I’m fine.”<br/>
</p><p>“Ri-”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m fine!” Rio snapped.<br/>
</p><p>They had a game to win.<br/>
</p><p>Forty-fourth minute.<br/>
</p><p>Doing anything hurt. Standing, walking, running.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“I think that fall might be affecting Vidal slightly. A simple run, and yet she couldn’t reach the ball before it went offside.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>She had to get it together. So what she was in immense pain? Spain needed that fucking trophy. Rio was going to push until something snapped, and if it did, keep pushing through that too.<br/>
</p><p>England throw in.<br/>
</p><p>One minute of added time.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Belova to – Vidal! Just takes it off Kale. I take it back. The Stargirl is just fine.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The stadium erupted as Rio shot down the pitch. Her body screamed at her to stop, the pain nauseating.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Will she make the pass – sends it…so, so unlucky. Starr will not let the Spanish into her net.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Fuck!” Rio groaned. “Fuck, fuck, fuck!”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And that’s it. The first half of this England vs Spain European Championship final ends nil-nil.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Not. Fucking. Good. Enough.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t with it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>The deal we’ve made is at the back of our minds during this.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Wasn’t, definitely wasn’t.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had quite literally thought of nothing else. Why else had she done the messiest tackle known to man on the one person she wasn’t supposed to tackle? And the look on Rio’s face when she’d done so? She almost looked as pissed as the evening they were at dinner, and Agatha introduced this stupid fucking deal.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Win the Euros.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Why the <em>fuck<em> couldn’t she just say ‘Yeah, I love you. Now shut the fuck up and order something.’ So simple. So, so fucking simple.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>“And the second half begins.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Forty-seventh minute.<br/>
</p><p>America had received the ball from the Spanish goalkeeper.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha could run, add pressure, see if the teen would crumble at the mere sight of her.<br/>
</p><p>She didn’t make it in time.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“What a ball down the middle! Right past one, four, five English players. How has she- GOALLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio Vidal! The woman that you are! What a strike! Right over the tops of heads and smashed into that top corner. The Spanish Stargirl is unlike any other.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Red.<br/>
</p><p>The stadium had come alive with it. It was as if the English supporters had vanished; Agatha couldn’t make out a single speck of white.<br/>
</p><p>But what was odd was that…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I’m not sure this is a bad thing.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Because that meant Rio was one step closer to getting her answer.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>She looks happy.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And she did. Rio was wearing that big, stupid smile as Agatha gazed at her on the big screen.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>She deserves this.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Fiftieth minute.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Unlucky for England once again. Harkness kicking the ball just wide.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was running back up the pitch when she heard it.<br/>
</p><p>That scream that made her heart stop.<br/>
</p><p>She whipped her head around, didn’t hesitate to bolt down the field.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Vidal is down! I’m not sure what happened there. We will have to wait for the replay.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was going to throw up.<br/>
</p><p>Guttural sobs.<br/>
</p><p>Rio lying on the ground clutching her knee.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby?” Agatha said when she’d reached her.<br/>
</p><p>Gamora and Alice, who had been by Rio’s side, stepped away.<br/>
</p><p>“I’m right here, okay?” Agatha told her, hand coming up to rub Rio’s neck as she curled into a foetal position.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything, her tears stopping her from doing so. Or maybe she was just done with it.<br/>
</p><p>With Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>It didn’t matter. Agatha wasn’t going anywhere.<br/>
</p><p>The medics came.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“It looks like something might’ve shifted. We see Vidal running. She puts down one wrong foot, and that’s it. She’s down.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha only stepped back because they needed to do their job.<br/>
</p><p>She watched, nails in her mouth as she bit them, waiting, <em>hoping,<em> that the damage wasn’t fatal. That Rio could still play.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>
<em>“And Spain’s number twenty-three Monica Rambeau is warming up. I think a lot of us will be heartbroken when I say that the 2025 Euros is over for Rio Vidal.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Rio hadn’t stopped crying, and on top of that, she’d squeal anytime one of the medics pressed on her knee.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha came over again, holding Rio’s hand as the professionals worked. She couldn’t watch, had to hold Rio, had to remind her that she was there, always would be.<br/>
</p><p>“I can’t…I can’t play,” Rio squeaked.<br/>
</p><p>Oh, would you look at that. Agatha had lost the European Championship.<br/>
</p><p>“What do you mean, baby?” Agatha asked as the medics helped Rio to her feet.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Can’t,” she winced when her bad leg made contact with the ground.<br/>
</p><p>“Do we need a stretcher?” One of the medics asked.<br/>
</p><p>“No. No, it’s fine. I’ll just need help.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha swooped in to do so, and she saw a fraction of that smile she loved so dearly.<br/>
</p><p>“You can’t help me, sweetheart. You still have a game to play,” Rio said.<br/>
</p><p>Quite honestly fuck the game.<br/>
</p><p>“Right,” Agatha sighed, head dropping.<br/>
</p><p>The medics started helping Rio off the pitch.<br/>
</p><p>“And Aggs,” Rio called, stopping.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah?”<br/>
</p><p>“You’ve been different tonight; I don’t like it. Play to win.”<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Only because you’re telling me to.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Play to win,” she echoed.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>The commentator sighed. “First substitutions for tonight. Spain’s number ten coming off for Spain’s number twenty-three. The Spanish Stargirl is coming off the pitch.”</em>

<p>A blur, all of it.<br/>
</p><p>From Rio being subbed off until now, Agatha had been running up and down the pitch like prey running from its predator.<br/>
</p><p>It was Rio, her words.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Play to win.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Because she hadn’t been.<br/>
</p><p>Rio wanted her answer fair and square. It wasn’t right of Agatha to not be at the top of her game, wasn’t right of her to back down, to not fight.<br/>
</p><p>That was all they did.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Eighty-third minute and England are yet to get a goal. Maybe this is it.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Bishop allowed to turn.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Kate kicked the ball, Yelena received it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Space now here for Belova. Now Harkness. Thatsagoodlookingball it’s KALEEEEE!!!!!!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Yes!” Jen yelled as Agatha ran to jump on her. “Fuck yes!”<br/>
</p><p>“You fucking did that shit!” Agatha exclaimed, Jen catching her mid-air.<br/>
</p><p>“<em>We<em>,” Jen corrected.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>The England girls surrounded them then.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Brilliant assist from Harkness, Kale putting the ball in.” The commentator grinned. “She’s gone and done it. Breathed life into the Lionesses.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Ninety-third minute.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Only three more minutes left of injury time. It is still one all.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha was soaked, and it wasn’t from sweat.<br/>
</p><p>Rain.<br/>
</p><p>The annoying kind that doesn’t seem like it’s doing anything until you realise your clothes have absorbed enough water to fill a paddling pool.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha actually…didn’t mind.<br/>
</p><p>Rain felt like playing on English soil.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“If the Lionesses were to win this, this would make them the first English team to win a major tournament on foreign soil. What a huge achievement that would be.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Bishop, back to Starr, back to Bishop.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha called for it, and Kate sent it flying down the left-hand side. Agatha watched the ball as it did so, running backwards as it came tumbling back down to earth.<br/>
</p><p>She jumped.<br/>
</p><p>So did Alice.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t know who got there first; all she knew was that she was definitely going to have a bruise on her head.<br/>
</p><p>The ball went flying again.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“I’m not sure either of them meant that, but lovely ball to Romonoff with that joint header,” the commentator chuckled. “I’m surprised neither of them slipped.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Full-time.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And we’re going to extra time.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>“What an intense game this has been, and it isn’t over yet. It is all still to play for. The 2025 European Champions are yet to be crowned.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Billy watched the entire thirty minutes of extra time with his eyes covered by his number eleven Kale jersey. He was sure he was going to need a medical evaluation after this. He felt a heart attack coming on from the strain he’d been putting on it.<br/>
</p><p>There were so many near misses, so many almosts, but never <em>ever<em> a goal. It was as if all twenty-two players on the pitch wanted to keep the entire world in fight or flight mode for as long as humanly possible.<br/>
</em></em></p><p>This final was going to penalties.<br/>

</p><p>
<em>“Penalties in the rain. I wouldn’t wish that upon my worst enemy.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The English and Spanish girls lined up, arms around each other, as Yelena stepped up to take the first penalty.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“This isn’t good for our nerves. I think I speak for all of us when I say this has been a rough 120 minutes.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The whistle blew.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Belova.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The crowd collectively groaned.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And it was a brilliant save from the Spanish goalkeeper Tina Baro. World class.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Yelena dropped her head, shaking it.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“She goes the right way, Baro. Gets her hand up, bats it away. That wasn’t what Belova would’ve wanted.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Jen ran to meet her, pulling her into a hug as they made their way back to the girls.<br/>
</p><p>“You did good, okay?” Jen told her.<br/>
</p><p>Yelena only grunted.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“The Spanish captain up next. Can she give Spain the lead?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The whistle sounded.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And Gamora she…scores. Straight down the middle that was.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Gamora returned to the Spanish girls with a grin.<br/>
</p><p>“England!” Three claps. “England!” Three claps. “England!” Three claps.<br/>
</p><p>The English chanted when Jen stepped up to take the next penalty.<br/>
</p><p>Whistle.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Kale…squeezes it in. One-one. Low and hard into the corner. It would’ve been hard for Baro to stop that.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“Come on!” Jen yelled, punching a fist in the air.<br/>
</p><p>The English crowd roared.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Perez.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Ava sucked in a breath, waited for the whistle to blow, sucked in another.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And it’s…saved by Ava Starr! Another huge moment for the Arsenal goalkeeper.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Wu-Gulliver needs to put this in. England currently has the advantage due to Romonoff’s goal, both England’s number nine and Spain’s number four missing their shots.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Alice stepped up to the penalty mark.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“Wu-Gulliver hasn’t missed her last ten penalties. Will she be continuing her streak?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The referee blew her whistle.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“No, she won’t. Saved by Starr. Incredible, simply incredible.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Alice ran her hands through her hair, tears pricking her eyes as Gamora ran to comfort her.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“And look who it is, to win it for England. Who else but Agatha Harkness?”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha held the ball underneath her armpit, walked casually to the penalty box as if this goal couldn’t potentially give England the win, make them European Champions…again.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“This has got to go in.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha rolled the ball before she placed it on the penalty spot.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>I’m getting that ball in<em>, Agatha told herself.<br/>
</em></em>
</p><p>
<em>“To make History for England once again, here we go.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>And it was like everyone in the stadium was holding their breath.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“It’s Harkness.”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath, ran.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“HAMMERS IT HOME! THE LIONESSES GO BACK TO BACK!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>The stadium exploded, the screams and shouts deafening.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shot off towards her team.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>“OVERCOMING EVERY HURDLE, CREATING THEIR OWN DESTINY. MORE HISTORY MADE. THIS IS THEIR LEGACY. THIS IS PROPER ENGLISH!”<br/>
</em>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Words? Agatha didn’t have any.<br/>
</p><p>You can’t describe this, the feeling of winning a European Championship. It is an experience only a handful of people will get to have. She was fortunate enough to have experienced it twice.<br/>
</p><p>She just felt…she just felt.<br/>
</p><p>Everything, all of it. The adrenaline left over from the game, the overwhelming joy that all their hard work, all their efforts had paid off, love. The love she had for her teammates. She couldn’t pass any of them without hugging them or dotting their faces with kisses.<br/>
</p><p>This team, their staff, Lilia.<br/>
</p><p>Nothing would be possible without them.<br/>
</p><p>Her cheeks hurt from the grinning. She didn’t care. Her face could literally fall off, and Agatha wouldn’t give a flying fuck.<br/>
</p><p>That grin only widened when the crowd started playing Sweet Caroline for the fourth time. They’d played the song every minute since they’d won.<br/>
</p><p>“Aggs!” Jen called from her pitch-side interview. “Come!” She beckoned.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha did because not even a godforsaken interview could ruin her mood.<br/>
</p><p>She slung her arm around her best friend when she approached, that teenager she couldn’t remember the name of held a mic out to her.<br/>
</p><p>“How does it feel, Agatha? Crowned European Champions once again.”<br/>
</p><p>“Bloody Brilliant!” Which earned her a cackle from Jen and a scowl from the teen.<br/>
</p><p>“Apologies for my French,” Agatha said half-heartedly. “It does though. This team is so incredible. We fight, sweat and bleed football. I will never work with such a talented group of players.”<br/>
</p><p>Jen squeezed her shoulder with a smile.<br/>
</p><p>“Jen just said the same thing,” Billy noted.<br/>
</p><p>“Because it’s the truth.”<br/>
</p><p>Billy nodded, a smile taking over his own face. “How long and how hard will you be celebrating tonight, girls?”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Jen glanced at each other, their expressions mirrors. And as if they shared the same brain cell…<br/>
</p><p>“Hey!”<br/>
</p><p>They bolted from the interview, cackling as they went.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>Words? Rio didn’t have any.<br/>
</p><p>All she knew was that she felt empty. She’d lost it all.<br/>
</p><p>The Euros, the answer, her mother fucking knee.<br/>
</p><p>She’d hobbled around the pitch shaking as many English hands as she could before she gave up. The pain was sickening, and she had to sit down unless she wanted to black out. From then on, people came to her.<br/>
</p><p>A few tears had slipped, escaping before she had the chance to save them.<br/>
</p><p>Crying on national television wasn’t revolutionary; she just never did it. Rio would rather avoid being picked apart by the media.<br/>
</p><p>She guessed it didn’t matter now.<br/>
</p><p>Emptiness.<br/>
</p><p>It was all she felt. Maybe her emotions being dissected by the entire world might make her feel something.<br/>
</p><p>“Hey.”<br/>
</p><p>And to make matters fucking worse.<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t look up as Agatha sat beside her on the wet grass.<br/>
</p><p>She wasn’t mad at her, nor upset. Rio was just…<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Empty.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>“How’s your knee?” Agatha asked.<br/>
</p><p>“Hurts.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded, didn’t hesitate to place her hand on it. She rubbed soothingly before getting out:<br/>
</p><p>“I’m really proud of you. The player you are…the person. You deserve everything you’ve ever achieved, Rio.”<br/>
</p><p>It was like Agatha’s touch had healing powers. All of a sudden, that pain felt a little lighter. All of a sudden, Rio felt weak and vulnerable. Those tears she’d been fighting forcing the floodgates open.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped to her at the sound of her first sob.<br/>
</p><p>“Baby?”<br/>
</p><p>“Fine,” Rio said, her voice cracking.<br/>
</p><p>“You’re not, and that’s okay,” Agatha comforted.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stared at her through her blurry vision. Those words from all those years ago said back to their owner.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shuffled up next to her, her arms circling Rio. Their bodies shook with Rio’s sobs.<br/>
</p><p>“I wanted it so badly, Agatha,” Rio croaked.<br/>
</p><p>“I know,” Agatha replied, running her hand along Rio’s back. “You’ll beat us next time, I promise.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio choked as an unexpected laugh left her mouth. Her words being used against her again.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pulled back, pressing her head against Rio’s temple, her face covered by her hands. She didn’t say anything else, just let Rio have this.<br/>
</p><p>Time to recover, to put on a brave face, to sit in every feeling that had crashed into her simultaneously.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha pressed kisses to her temple as her tears continued to flow, the hand on her back coming up to clasp Rio’s neck, squeezing gently.<br/>
</p><p>The stadium was still very much alive, that stupid song the English loved to play on its twentieth replay, the England players running past them screaming and shouting, the murmur of TV presenters around the pitch for their post-match segments.<br/>
</p><p>But in the middle of the chaos was them.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha and Rio.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha had positioned herself in such a way that a camera couldn’t catch Rio’s face. She was shielding her from the world, protecting her from it.<br/>
</p><p>The sobs came faster and harder.<br/>
</p><p>She loved Agatha so much, but Agatha would never say it in return.<br/>
</p><p>“I…I gotta go,” Rio sniffled.<br/>
</p><p>“You don’t have to, baby-”<br/>
</p><p>“Don’t!” Rio snapped. “Don’t call me that.”<br/>
</p><p>She got up, swaying when her bad leg touched solid ground.<br/>
</p><p>“Not until you can admit what I mean to you to yourself first.”<br/>
</p><p>And that was that. Rio limped away.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“The moment we’ve all been waiting for…watching England lift that trophy,” Milly Hope's voice sounded over the live recording of the girls waiting for the trophy lift.<br/>
</p><p>The Lionesses were in a huddle just off from the podium where the Euros trophy sat. A line-up of people ranging from the UEFA president to the Prince of England, ready to shake hands with.<br/>
</p><p>The young player of the tournament award was given to America Chavez.<br/>
</p><p>The England girls clapped and cheered as she walked through the tunnel they’d created. America tried her best to smile, but you could tell she’d been crying, could tell this award meant nothing to her.<br/>
</p><p>“Such a talented young player,” Vicky Pina commented. “I know this will hurt, but clubs will definitely have their eyes on her now, especially because her Real Madrid contract ends this season.”<br/>
</p><p>America shook hands with the necessary people, took her trophy, gave the camera a half-hearted smile, then disappeared to join the rest of her team.<br/>
</p><p>“And absolutely no one will be surprised by this,” Milly said.<br/>
</p><p>“No one. She truly deserves it.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio stepped up to collect the player of the tournament trophy.<br/>
</p><p>“Absolutely heartbreaking to see Vidal break down on the pitch earlier,” Libby continued. "I know she would’ve wanted the win.”<br/>
</p><p>Vicky nodded. “I know Rio, played with her on our national team and I can quite honestly say I have never played with such a driven player.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio limped down the English tunnel, the girls encouraging her on.<br/>
</p><p>“At least she got player of the tournament,” Milly tried to sound cheerful.<br/>
</p><p>“It won’t matter to her. Individual wins have never meant much to Vidal.”<br/>
</p><p>“But it was lovely to see her Barcelona teammate, Agatha Harkness, be there for her after the match. Those girls really are as thick as thieves.” Milly smiled. “As we see once again.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha helped Rio towards the podium, arm around her shoulders to help her walk.<br/>
</p><p>“They really have a special bond,” Libby smiled, staring at them.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shook hands and took the stupid photo before Agatha returned, helping her back to the Spanish team.<br/>
</p><p>No words were exchanged.<br/>
</p><p>“The Spanish girls are ready to collect their silver medals.”<br/>
</p><p>Nobody she be forced to do this, walk past the team that beat you whilst they clapped and tell you well done. Spain were second place, and second place meant you’d lost. Who the fuck wanted to be reminded they’d lost?<br/>
</p><p>“The moment we’ve all been waiting for,” Milly beamed. “Well, maybe except Vicky.”<br/>
</p><p>The studio laughed.<br/>
</p><p>Lilia led her team out, smiles on their faces as they approached the podium.<br/>
</p><p>“Oh, to be an England player right now. Back-to-back European Champions. Doesn’t get much better than that,” Milly continued.<br/>
</p><p>“Doesn’t,” Libby echoed.<br/>
</p><p>“Are you sad you’re not out there tonight unlike last Euros, Lib?” Milly jeered.<br/>
</p><p>Libby laughed. “No, no. My time on the pitch is long behind me. I’m just so thrilled for the girls.”<br/>
</p><p>“And here’s England captain Natasha Romonoff with the trophy.”<br/>
</p><p>Natasha was grinning from ear to ear as she sauntered towards the podium, silver and glass Euros trophy in hand. The girls cackled when Natasha made a show of it, their gold medals bouncing up and down as they did so.<br/>
</p><p>“It’s so great to see that again,” Libby commented about the England flags that had been added to the ‘European Champions’ banner above the girls' heads.<br/>
</p><p>Natasha met a grinning Agatha at the front and centre of the huddle, and together they lifted the European Championship trophy. Gold and silver confetti shot out of canons, and their team jumped and screamed behind them.<br/>
</p><p>“The Queens of Europe once again. It’s England,” Milly nodded. “European Champions.”<br/>
</p><p>Another set of confetti shot into the air when the Lionesses' staff came to join the team on the platform. You could barely make out the girls on camera as the confetti continued to fall thick and heavy. All you could hear were their cries of joy, their shrieks of happiness, their stances of pride.<br/>
</p><p>England. European Champions once again.<br/>
</p><p>***<br/>
</p><p>“Where you going?!” Jen yelled, her England scarf wrapped stupidly around her head, fuck ass sunglasses on, a bottle of champagne in hand. “Coach leaves in ten!”<br/>
</p><p>“I’ll make it,” Agatha replied as she headed for the tunnel.<br/>
</p><p>She had her brand new ‘Champions 25’ jersey on and her gold medal around her neck as she headed for the pitch. Agatha had no idea how long they’d spent celebrating in the changing room after the trophy lift, but it was enough to know that this was probably futile.<br/>
</p><p>She ran out into the empty stadium, eyes searching the more she advanced.<br/>
</p><p>
<em>Fuck.<br/>
</em>
</p><p>When she realised she was most definitely too late.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha huffed, turning back around when…<br/>
</p><p>Brown eyes locked with grey.<br/>
</p><p>Neither of them spoke, just gazed at each other.<br/>
</p><p>“Didn’t think you’d still be here,” Agatha said at last.<br/>
</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I still have my post-match superstitions.” She nodded to her knee. “Not even a fucked up knee is going to stop me from carrying them out.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha smiled. “A fucked up knee won’t stop you from doing anything.”<br/>
</p><p>“Except winning the Euros,” Rio grumbled.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha frowned slightly. “You still have that World Cup,” she noted lightly.<br/>
</p><p>“Yeah, because that’s relevant today,” Rio muttered.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip.<br/>
</p><p>“What are you even doing out here, Agatha?” Rio asked.<br/>
</p><p>“I-”<br/>
</p><p>“Are you that drunk you can’t find the exit?”<br/>
</p><p>“I’m not drunk,” Agatha told her.<br/>
</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “You aren’t? Why? I know how hard you English like to celebrate.”<br/>
</p><p>“Because I needed to be sober just in case I saw you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Break my heart another day, okay?” She said, turning. “I’m not in the mood for-”<br/>
</p><p>“I love you!” Agatha blurted.<br/>
</p><p>Rio stopped dead in her tracks.<br/>
</p><p>“I love you, Rio Vidal, have loved you for a concerning amount of time now.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha walked in front of Rio, whose mouth was agape.<br/>
</p><p>“And I’m sorry I couldn’t just tell you, and I’m sorry I made this stupid fucking Euros deal,” Agatha threw her hands up. “Because yeah, I just became a European Champion again, but that shit felt so fucking meaningless because shit was fucked with you.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s eyes began to glisten with tears.<br/>
</p><p>“I get in my own way <em>so<em> much. It limits me, stops me from seeking out the good.” Agatha kicked at the ground before looking up again. “I don’t know, blame my abusive mother.”<br/>
</em></em></p><p>Rio laughed, smacking her hand over her mouth as if she hadn’t meant to.<br/>
</p><p>It only made Agatha smile. “But I’m done with that now. I’m done with stopping myself from having every great thing life has to offer. And the greatest thing this life has ever given me is you,” she nodded, punctuating her sentence.<br/>
</p><p>Rio bit her lip as her tears fell.<br/>
</p><p>“Erm…” Agatha began when the moment passed. “Can you like…say some shit? Because being vulnerable for too long makes me break out in hives.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio laughed again, surging forward and crashing their lips together.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha hummed, revelling in Rio’s touch, her taste, her scent. Rio consumed her in every sense of the word, and Agatha wouldn’t have it any other way.<br/>
</p><p>“I love you,” Rio said when they broke apart.<br/>
</p><p>“I know, baby. I’ll actually make it worth your while now,” Agatha teased.<br/>
</p><p>“It always was,” Rio replied. “Even when I didn’t want it to. Loving you is my greatest accomplishment.”<br/>
</p><p>“You have a Ballon d’Or, baby? You were also crowned player of the year; might I add your World Cup trophy. If I were you, I would never-”<br/>
</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio laughed. Her expression softened when she continued, “I should’ve just told you that I loved you, so I’m sorry too. I didn’t make it easy for us either.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Easy’s boring anyways.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio nodded, Agatha wiping her tears.<br/>
</p><p>“Thank you…for choosing me to love,” Rio added. “I know it’s something you only reserve for a few people.”<br/>
</p><p>“I’d love you in every lifetime,” Agatha said simply. “Thank you for choosing me too.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s lips tugged into a small smile before Agatha pulled her into another kiss. And that feeling, Agatha would never get sick of it. It was warm, and tingly and-<br/>
</p><p>Love.<br/>
</p><p>It was fucking love.<br/>
</p><p>Rio slid her tongue into her mouth as Agatha’s fingers threaded through her hair.<br/>
</p><p>Agatha was quite happy to die like this until she realised…<br/>
</p><p>She pulled away, earning her a whine from Rio.<br/>
</p><p>“Shush, you,” Agatha said, nudging her. She lifted her gold medal off her neck and placed it around Rio’s.<br/>
</p><p>Now, she could die like this. Everything was perfect.<br/>
</p><p>Rio looked down at the medal, then back at Agatha.<br/>
</p><p>"Gold comes from stars after all,” she winked. “I think my favourite girls should stick together.”<br/>
</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Great, I’m up there with your fucking Euros medal.”<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laughed, resting her forehead on Rio’s. They settled into a comfortable silence, her arms coming up to hang around Rio’s neck.<br/>
</p><p>“You and me?” Agatha breathed.<br/>
</p><p>“You and me,” Rio echoed.</p>
