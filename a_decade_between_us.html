<p>It’s been ten years since Agatha signed the papers on the life she and Rio were building, convincing herself it was the only way to let Rio chase the career she deserved.</p>
<p>Now they’re in the same room for the first time since the divorce, at a fiftieth birthday party, and Agatha is fighting a war between what she wants, what she’s terrified to admit, and what she still believes everybody else needs.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha arrived exactly on time.</p><p>Of course she did. She didn’t show up late to anything, even birthday parties in dimly lit bars that smelled faintly of stale beer, old wood and bad choices.</p><p>Alice’s place looked good. It always did. The bar sat low and neat along the left wall, bottles lined up like stained glass. Warm light pooled over the polished timber tables. Someone had gone to the trouble of hanging fairy lights along the exposed beams, a soft halo around the space. </p><p>Jennifer Kale’s fiftieth birthday.</p><p>Agatha had celebrated her own fiftieth birthday in bed with a vibrator, a bottle of malbec, and her wedding video, though she hadn’t told anyone about the last part. Her friends had campaigned for months for her to have at least a dinner, but she hadn’t been able to find the fucks to give by the time the date rolled around.</p><p>She tugged at her silk blouse, straightening it and trying not to think about the fact that she had picked the most formal thing in her wardrobe for a casual birthday party. Tried not to think about the dress that was still hanging over a chair at home. The one she hadn’t worn because it showed too much cleavage, and because the last time she’d worn it had been their final anniversary dinner. Ten years later she still hadn’t been able to throw it out.</p><p>She did one slow sweep of the room. Alice behind the bar cackling at someone’s joke. Lilia perched on a barstool, already halfway through a cocktail and talking animatedly at Wanda and her sons. A cluster of familiar faces near the back.</p><p>No sign of Rio.</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest unclenched, and she hated herself for it.</p><p>She moved toward the bar, smiling when Alice spotted her.</p><p>“Look who decided to grace us with her terrifying presence,” Alice called.</p><p>“You keep serving that nice expensive gin and I might even relax,” Agatha said, leaning forward to press a kiss to Alice’s cheek.</p><p>Alice pulled back to take her in. “You look good.”</p><p>Agatha gave her automatic answer. “I always look good.”</p><p>“Sure. Because you bathe in the blood of innocents. Drink?”</p><p>“Gin and tonic. Lots of lime, please. I am trying to pretend I am a calm, well adjusted woman in my fifties.”</p><p>Alice snorted at that. “I have never seen you calm a day in your life.”</p><p>She set the drink down. Agatha curled her fingers around it, grateful she had something to do with her hands.</p><p>“She’s not coming, you know,” Alice added, almost casually.</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened by a fraction. “Who?”</p><p>Alice raised one eyebrow.</p><p>“We talked,” she said. “I told her you were coming. She said she wouldn't be able to be in town. So you can unclench your jaw a little.”</p><p>Agatha forced a breath out through her nose. “My jaw is fine.”</p><p>“Sure. Your eye did that twitch thing, but you are definitely fine.”</p><p>“Alice.”</p><p>“I’m just saying. You don’t need to be on edge all night.”</p><p>“I am <em>not</em> on edge. I’m here to celebrate Jen and, if I happen to do that by pretending the last ten years were a mature and dignified exercise in growth, so be it.”</p><p>Alice’s mouth curved. “You tell yourself whatever you need, honey.” She tipped her head. “Wanda’s over there. She was asking if you had arrived yet. Go say hi.”</p><p>Agatha took her drink and let the crowd swallow her.</p><p>She spotted Wanda at a long table near the middle of the room, red hair pulled back, eyes bright, and a glass of red wine in one hand. Billy and Tommy sat on either side of her, taller and broader than when she’d last seen them, their childhood written across Agatha’s memory in scraped knees, school concerts and birthdays.</p><p>Tommy saw her first.</p><p>“Aunty Agatha,” he said, already getting to his feet.</p><p>She barely had time to set the glass down before he wrapped her in a hug that lifted her off the ground. She let out a surprised laugh, half choked against his shoulder.</p><p>“When did you get so tall,” she said into his shirt.</p><p>“Couple months ago,” he said. “Puberty. It’s a whole thing, apparently.”</p><p>Billy stepped in next, less dramatic but just as affectionate. He smelled like expensive cologne and the ghost of the little boy who used to climb onto her lap during movie nights.</p><p>“You both look too grown up,” Agatha said, pulling back to look them over. “I am filing a complaint.”</p><p>“With who,” Billy asked. “Time?”</p><p>She made a face and nodded. “Oh absolutely. Stop growing up so fast.”</p><p>Wanda stood, smiling, and Agatha felt something soft settle in her chest. Familiar ground, that’s what she needed.</p><p>“You look incredible,” Wanda said, kissing her cheek. “I hate you.”</p><p>“Please,” Agatha said. “You have not aged since the boys were six. Whatever you are doing, bottle it and I’ll buy it. Heavily discounted, of course.”</p><p>“Chasing them and threatening to take their phones apparently keeps me young,” Wanda said. “Sit. What's been happening this week? How is the terrifying world of whatever law you practice?”</p><p>“Corporate. You know it’s corporate. And it’s still ruthless, and full of men who still call me ‘dear’ in meetings, which is adorable given that I could end their careers with a single email.” Agatha sat, smoothing her shirt again. “We are in the middle of a huge case that is eating my life, but it’s my name on the door, and I can’t risk a single thing going wrong. I might sleep if I ever get to retire.”</p><p>“Well, this is what you wanted,” Wanda said. “Are you happy?”</p><p>The question hit Agatha squarely in the chest, her heart knocking against her ribs. She took a sip of her drink to buy time. </p><p>“I like winning,” she said finally. “And I’m good at what I do.”</p><p>“That is <em>not</em> what I asked.”</p><p>“I know.” She kept her eyes on the condensation on her glass. “I’m fine. That’s close enough.”</p><p>Wanda studied her for a second. Agatha could feel it, the stare that had seen her through a decade of breakdowns and bad dates, and the first night alone in an empty townhouse.</p><p>“You still thinking about–” Wanda started.</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha said. Her voice was softer than she expected. “It’s Jen’s birthday. It’s been ten years. We’re not dissecting my divorce tonight.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her glass slightly in surrender. “Fine. How <em>is</em> your love life, then.”</p><p><em>Fucking nonexistent</em> was the honest answer.</p><p>“Still having occasional dates,” Agatha said instead. “No one has tried to murder me, so that’s a step up from my twenties. Nothing has stuck yet, obviously.”</p><p>“Because no one is Rio,” Wanda said.</p><p>It wasn’t cruel, it was just true. Which somehow hurt more.</p><p>Agatha looked at her.</p><p>“I made my choice,” she said. “I can’t keep using her as the yardstick for the women unlucky enough to enter my orbit.”</p><p>“You left her, Agatha. You were the one that filed for divorce,” Wanda said quietly. </p><p>Agatha’s throat felt tight. She took another sip and forced herself to swallow.</p><p>“We’ve done this time and time again over the last ten years, Wanda. I did what I thought was right,” she said. “For her. For her career. For… both of us.”</p><p>“And how is that working out for you,” Wanda asked, gently.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer that question.</p><p>The music shifted to something jazzy and low, curling around the hum of conversation. Alice turned the lights down a fraction. People clapped near the bar where Jen was glittering in a sequined dress, loudly laughing and hugging everyone in reach.</p><p>Agatha let herself watch the scene, let the noise wash over her. Parties had always been easier when she had Rio at her side, one hand at the small of her back, thumb making slow circles when she got too tense. Rio was good with people. She made everything feel less busy, less risky.</p><p>Agatha set her jaw. This was why she was glad she didn’t have to navigate tonight with that particular issue in the room. They’d managed ten years of careful avoidance. Shared friends, sure, but separate events, separate dinners, separate lives. She had managed not to see Rio for a decade.</p><p>She could manage the echo of her ghost for the night.</p><p>Wanda was saying something about her latest translation project when Agatha felt the air in the room shift.</p><p>It was subtle, a ripple across the air. Voices dipped and then rose again. Someone laughed loudly. Agatha felt the hair on the back of her neck stand up.</p><p>The bar entrance opened behind her. The cold air from the street slipped in first, then confident footsteps. </p><p>Wanda’s gaze flicked over Agatha’s shoulder and she went abruptly quiet.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to turn. Every muscle in her back tightened, like if she stayed perfectly still, reality would rearrange itself and whoever had just walked in would be a stranger, a delivery driver, anyone else.</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda warned softly.</p><p>Her voice had changed. There was the tone that Agatha was all too familiar with. The gentle, caring tone that had talked her through tears, through panic, through lonely nights.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers clenched around her glass, the condensation slicked under her grip.</p><p>“Don’t,” she whispered.</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda repeated. “Look at me.”</p><p>She did, and Wanda’s eyes were full of apology.</p><p>Then they drifted past her, over her shoulder, and Agatha knew.</p><p>Her heart stuttered, then for a second, sound receded. The music, the laughter, the clink of glasses, all of it dropped away into a dull hum.</p><p>She turned.</p><p>Rio stood near the doorway, a few steps inside, in a particular pool of light that always seemed to find her without effort.</p><p>Shoulder length dark hair, a little messier than it used to be, waves pushed back like she’d run her fingers through it on the way in. Muscular, lean, lines of strength under the open collar of her forest green shirt. Black trousers and jacket slung carelessly over one forearm. The same sharp jawline, the same quick mouth. Older, and more settled, more herself.</p><p>Agatha felt the impact of Rio like a physical hit.</p><p>She looked better. Of course she did. A decade of a life in London, the career and the work she had always deserved. It had settled on her like the final strokes of a painting. There was a little more definition around her eyes, and a line at the corner of her mouth that said she had laughed hard and frowned harder. She looked good.</p><p>She also looked stunned.</p><p>Her gaze had already found Agatha. Of course it had, it always did. There was a brief second where they just stared at each other across the room.</p><p>Ten years collapsed in on them. Late nights in their cramped kitchen. Packing and unpacking suitcases for holidays around the world. The taste of coffee on Rio’s mouth in the morning, the taste of a good red on her lips in the evenings. A signature on divorce papers that had made Agatha’s hand shake.</p><p>All of it, at once.</p><p>Rio’s fingers flexed against the jacket on her arm. Her shoulders straightened, just a fraction, the old instinct to square up before walking into a difficult room.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t move. Her feet were welded to the floor. </p><p>Wanda’s hand found her forearm, a light, anchoring pressure that Agatha barely felt.</p><p>Rio blinked first. A small, controlled movement. She dragged her gaze away, let it sweep the room, searching for somewhere else to land. Someone else to look at. She smiled at Alice in a way that didn’t reach her eyes. Alice’s answering expression was tight.</p><p>Agatha forced air into her lungs, the breath felt like swallowing glass.</p><p>“Thought Alice said she wasn’t coming,” she said. Her voice was much flatter than she had meant it to be.</p><p>Wanda squeezed her arm. “Maybe she decided she couldn’t miss Jen’s fiftieth.”</p><p>“Of course she couldn’t,” Agatha murmured. She looked back at her drink. The lime slice floated, bobbing against the edge of the ice. “Rio always did know to show up when it counted.”</p><p>“How long has it been?” Wanda asked quietly.</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She could still feel the weight of Rio’s gaze, felt it whisper across her skin.</p><p>All the composure she had built up on the walk over, in the mirror, in the weeks since the invitation, felt thin and fragile. Like one wrong word, one wrong move might shatter it.</p><p>She took a slow sip of gin and told herself that she was fifty years old, a <em>named </em>partner in a law firm that she managed, a woman who could stand up in court and dismantle entire arguments with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>She could survive one night in a room with her ex wife.</p><p>She just had to remember how to breathe around the fact that Rio was still the most incredible thing she had ever seen.</p><hr/><p>Agatha didn’t bolt for the door.</p><p>She told herself that counted as a win.</p><p>It would’ve been easy. Grab her bag, mumble something about an early meeting weekend in the morning, vanish before anyone could stop her. She could’ve been home in twenty minutes max, sweating, humiliated and alone with a glass of wine big enough to legally count as a bath. </p><p>Instead, she stayed seated. Adjusted the fall of her top, and reached for an olive like she wasn’t seconds away from having a full cardiac event.</p><p>“Do you want to leave,” Wanda asked quietly.</p><p>Agatha shook her head once. “No.”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p><em>“Absolutely</em> not,” Agatha said. “But I’m not giving anyone the satisfaction.”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth twitched.</p><p>“Do you want me to run interference,” she asked. “Form a human shield. Tell her you died tragically in an accident, maybe a bookshelf fell on you?”</p><p>Agatha huffed something half laugh, half sob. “She wouldn’t believe you. I’m too stubborn to die.”</p><p>“That’s true,” Wanda said. “You’re a cockroach. In a very expensive blouse.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said. “It was <em>very </em>expensive.”</p><p>They both knew she was stalling. That was fine, she could stall.</p><p>Across the room, Rio was already being swallowed by a crowd of hugs and greetings. Jen flung her arms around her with a shriek that turned every head. Rio bent to kiss her cheek, smiling her easy, natural smile that always made people drift toward her without thinking.</p><p>Agatha watched the way Rio’s hand settled automatically at the small of Jen’s back, steadying the other woman when her heel caught on nothing.</p><p>That used to be Agatha’s hand to feel. </p><p>Billy and Tommy had clocked Rio now. They shared matching looks, and peeled away from the table.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped, and she sighed.</p><p>“Let them,” Wanda murmured. “They adore her.”</p><p>Agatha knew that. Rio had helped raise them too. Wanda’s boyfriend had bolted the second he heard the word pregnant, and for the first three years of the twins’ lives, Wanda, Rio and Agatha had all lived under the same roof, tag-teaming night feeds and scraped knees their own little makeshift family. </p><p>Knowing all of that didn’t make watching them any easier.</p><p>The boys reached Rio just as she came out of another hug. Tommy launched himself at her like a human missile. Rio staggered, laughed, and pulled him in, pressing her face to his shoulder like she’d been waiting years for that moment.</p><p>Billy stepped in next, quieter, but his smile was wide, soft, and entirely unguarded.</p><p>For a second, the three of them were back in her living room, tucked in blanket forts with bad cartoons on pizza nights. Rio’s hand in Tommy’s hair. Billy saying something that made her throw her head back and laugh from her chest.</p><p>Agatha felt like someone had driven a fist straight through her ribs.</p><p>Rio had been there for the fevers, school plays and late-night homework crises. She’d watched Rio teach them to throw a baseball in the park, watched Wanda fall apart in her kitchen while Rio fed the boys ice cream and Agatha poured wine.</p><p>And then Rio had missed years of their lives. A whole decade.</p><p><em>You did tha</em>t, she reminded herself. <em>You filed. You signed the papers.</em> <em>You shut her out. You chose.</em></p><p>It didn’t make her ache smaller.</p><p>“Hey,” Wanda said quietly. “Hey.”</p><p>Agatha realized her hand was shaking. She set her glass down before she shattered it.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said.</p><p>“You look like you’re watching your own funeral.”</p><p>“In a sense,” Agatha said. “A little bit.”</p><p>Wanda brushed her thumb against Agatha’s knuckles. The same gesture they had done for each other more times than she could count.</p><p>“Bathroom escape?” Wanda offered. “You can hide there till cake.”</p><p>Agatha almost said yes.</p><p>“I can’t,” she said instead. “If I’m hiding in the bathroom when she comes over, you’ll tell her, and she’ll know I ran.”</p><p>“True,” Wanda said. “You’ve always been deeply committed to the illusion that nothing fazes you.”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>As the room slowly came back into focus, the music shifted to something low and brass-heavy as the laughter from a make-shift dancefloor filtered across the room.</p><p>Agatha lifted her chin. She could still feel the ghost of Rio’s gaze on her skin.</p><p>Fine. If they were playing avoidance, she could play that.</p><p>For a while, it worked.</p><p>People drifted in and out of the group at their table. Jen’s art friends, and old acquaintances. A couple of women who’d known her and Rio back when they used to host dinner parties with mismatched chairs and food that took hours longer than expected.</p><p>Agatha did what she did best, pleasant deflection. Curated anecdotes, and sharp quips. She laughed when it was socially required. She asked about other people’s kids, careers, vacations. She even told a story about a cross-examination that had the whole table laughing.</p><p>She didn’t think about how Rio used to kiss her jaw after a story like that and call her terrifying and gorgeous in the same breath.</p><p>Rio stuck to the opposite side of the room. Agatha could feel her, she would always feel her. She didn’t look directly, she refused to do that. She caught tiny glimpses, reflected in glassware, in the bar mirror, in the way eyes drifted past her shoulder.</p><p>A flashed jawline. The tilt of Rio’s mouth when she laughed. The way she pushed her hair back with two fingers, like she had always done.</p><p>It was absurd, how her body responded, like she’d been carved with a map of this woman and ten years hadn’t erased a damn thing.</p><p>Someone popped champagne that sprayed across a nearby table. Shrieked laughter followed. Alice shouted threats from behind the bar before Jen launched into a tipsy toast about survival, friendship, and turning fifty without being arrested.</p><p>Agatha raised her glass with everyone else. She didn’t look across the room. Not even once. She was absurdly proud of that.</p><p>“Old habits die hard,” Wanda muttered when the noise dipped again.</p><p>“What habit?”</p><p>“Your battlefield awareness,” Wanda said. “You’re refusing to look at her, but you’ve flinched every time she’s come within ten feet.”</p><p>“I don’t flinch,” Agatha said.</p><p>Wanda arched a brow. “You also don’t lie well, honey, but we can pretend.”</p><p>Agatha was gearing up with a retort when Jen swept in, drink sloshing against the slide of her glass.</p><p>“Is this table reserved for the people who remember VHS tapes?” Jen asked. </p><p>“You’re the birthday girl,” Wanda said. “You can sit wherever you want.”</p><p>Jen flopped down across from Agatha, glitter flaring under the lights.</p><p>“I feel like I should make a speech at every table,” she said. “Personally bless each of you. Remind you how you traumatized me.”</p><p>“Please don’t,” Agatha said. “I’ve suppressed enough.”</p><p>Jen laughed, then tilted her head.</p><p>“You good?” she asked, voice dropping.</p><p>Agatha knew what she meant, everyone knew what she meant.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said. “Happy birthday, hon. You look like a disco ball.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Jen said, completely sincere. She squeezed Agatha’s wrist once, hard, like she was grounding her.</p><p>Before Agatha could reply, Billy reappeared, flushed and excited.</p><p>“Rio’s here,” he announced, as if this was breaking news.</p><p>“Obviously she’s here, darling,” Wanda said. “We’re all seeing the same room.”</p><p>Billy ignored her and looked straight at Agatha.</p><p>“She said London’s cold and full of boring people.”</p><p>“Sounds accurate,” Agatha said, aiming for casual and landing somewhere between brittle and homicidal.</p><p>“She asked about you,” Tommy said, plopping down with a plate of sliders. “We told her you still yell at drivers.”</p><p>“I don’t yell,” Agatha said. “I make constructive observations.”</p><p>“From your car,” Tommy said. “At strangers.”</p><p>“They can still benefit.”</p><p>Wanda snorted wine out her nose.</p><p>“What exactly did she ask,” Jen said. “Give me dialogue, boys. I crave accuracy.”</p><p>Billy frowned, concentrating. “She said: ‘Have you spoken to your aunty Agatha yet,’ and when we said yes, she did that thing with her face.”</p><p>“What thing,” Wanda asked.</p><p>“You know,” Billy said. “The like-someone-punched-me thing.”</p><p>Tommy nodded. “She looked like she might throw up.”</p><p>Agatha glared at Wanda and Jen when they both looked at her.</p><p>“I refuse to listen to the whimsical tales of children,” she said.</p><p>“We’re eighteen,” Billy protested.</p><p>“You’re idiots,” Agatha said. “It’s a developmental stage. You’ll grow out of it in your thirties.”</p><p>Tommy grinned. “Rio said the same thing.”</p><p>Agatha froze for a second. Something hot twisted under her ribs.</p><p>Of course Rio did.</p><p>Before she could decide whether to laugh or swallow her entire drink, a shadow fell over the table.</p><p>“Is there space here for one more over here?” Rio asked.</p><p>Her voice hit Agatha like a match to gasoline.</p><p>Agatha looked up.</p><p>Rio stood there, close enough that Agatha could see the faint scar near her eyebrow, the hint of her collarbone under undone buttons. Her eyes flicked over the table, then stopped on Agatha.</p><p>“Or is this the cool-kids section,” Rio added, mouth tilting.</p><p>“Birthday exemption for you, dork,” Jen said. “Sit.”</p><p>She tapped the empty chair beside Agatha.</p><p>Of course that was the empty chair. Of course.</p><p>Agatha considered flipping the table, then she considered climbing through a window and fleeing into the night, never to be seen again.</p><p>Instead, she didn’t move. She sat perfectly still, hands steady around her glass, even though her pulse was battering against her throat.</p><p>Rio hesitated, just slightly, then pulled out the chair and sat.</p><p>Her thigh brushed Agatha’s. Barely contact, barely anything. </p><p>Agatha’s nerves lit up like someone had plugged her straight into an outlet.</p><p>“Boo,” Rio said softly, leaning in, just for her.</p><p>Agatha turned her head. It was too close, too familiar. She could see every tiny shift in Rio’s face, the laugh lines, the exhaustion, the history. She smelled like bergamot, she smelled like a home Agatha had been trying to forget for a long time.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said.</p><p>The word felt foreign.</p><p>They didn’t look away from each other. They couldn’t look away.</p><p>Then Jen clapped her hands. “Perfect timing. We were just talking earlier about the champagne incident where Rio almost blinded Lilia.”</p><p>“I didn’t almost blind anyone,” Rio said, dragging her gaze away. “The railing was unstable.”</p><p>“It was cement,” Lilia shouted.</p><p>“And it was unstable,” Rio insisted.</p><p>Laughter rolled around the table. Stories began to overlap. Someone eventually brought up the karaoke disaster that saw Islands in the Stream butchered by a very drunk Wanda and Rio, each fighting over Kenny’s part before sobbing their way through the key change. Tommy reenacted Rio showing up to a school parent’s or ‘special friends’ night when he was seven with briefing notes sticking out of her pocket for his teacher.</p><p>For everyone else, it was easy.</p><p>For Agatha, it felt like standing on the edge of a building, pretending the fall didn’t look tempting.</p><p>She did her part, she laughed along, and then corrected Tommy when he exaggerated something.</p><p>“That’s not what happened,” she said. “I never threatened to sue the entire restaurant.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched, a ghost of amusement.</p><p>“How did it happen then,” Wanda asked.</p><p>“I told the manager that if he kept double-booking tables, I’d take my business elsewhere. I got really annoyed when they seemed to know how to take the reservation, but not how to keep the reservation,” Agatha said. “Then he cried. Not my fault.”</p><p>“You made a grown man cry,” Tommy said, delighted.</p><p>“He was twenty-three. And he was flirting with my wife—”</p><p>The word slipped. Silence dropped hard on the table.</p><p>Agatha stared at her glass, heartbeat loud in her ears.</p><p>Beside her, Rio inhaled sharply, devastatingly.</p><p>“Now ex-wife,” Agatha said, forcing the correction. “Obviously.”</p><p>Jen saved her with an overly loud story and the table snapped back into motion, noise filling the space again.</p><p>A few minutes later, Rio shifted a little closer, her voice dropping so only Agatha could hear.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. She stared into her glass, mostly ice left. “Yes, Rio.”</p><p>A small pause. Rio exhaled once through her nose, quietly.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said. “It’s loud.”</p><p>Rio nodded like she didn’t believe a word. Another beat passed.</p><p>“You know,” she murmured, “I didn’t mean to surprise you tonight.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked sharply to her. “No?”</p><p>“No.” Rio’s fingers tapped against the table, a nervous tic she’d never managed to unlearn. “I had to be here for work last minute, and my flight was booked earlier in the week. I just… decided that if I was in the city, I may as well make my way here.”</p><p>Agatha kept her face neutral. “How very impulsive of you.”</p><p>Rio huffed a quiet laugh. “You used to call it ‘chaotic.’”</p><p>“I stand by it.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth tipped at the corner. “I haven’t seen you in ten years.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her throat feeling raw. “I know.”</p><p>“I suppose—” Another soft breath from Rio. “Maybe I thought that if I didn’t come, I might not get another chance to see you again.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse kicked hard. She kept her hands still. “I don’t know what that means, Rio.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look away. Her voice stayed low and steady. “It means ten years is a really long time to spend walking into rooms like this one, wondering if I’ll see you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered, but she didn’t let it show. She couldn't let it show. </p><p>Rio went on, gentler. “I’m not trying to pick a fight,” she said. “Not tonight.”</p><p>“I don’t want to fight either,” Agatha managed.</p><p>“Good,” Rio said. “That’s… good.”</p><p>Someone laughed loudly near the bar. The room blurred at the edges. The frame of the world shrank back down to the inch of space between their chairs.</p><p>Rio’s gaze dipped to Agatha’s mouth for half a second, barely a flicker, but enough to send heat straight through her. </p><p>Agatha inhaled. She drew air in, all the way to her toes.</p><p>Then she set her shoulders, let the breath go slowly, and looked back toward the rest of the table like she hadn’t just been yanked ten years into her past.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. Her hand rested on the table, fingers tapping a slow, distracted rhythm. Every few beats, they brushed the back of Agatha’s hand.</p><p>Barely contact. Less than a touch. It didn’t matter.</p><p>Agatha’s whole body reacted like she’d been waiting ten years for exactly that nothing.</p><p>And she let it happen.</p>

<p><span>Minutes later, Jen was accusing Rio of abandoning Boston for a city with worse weather and arguably worse pay, and Rio shrugged, mouth crooking in the familiar, uneven way that always used to precede trouble.</span></p><p><span>“What can I say,” she replied. “No one in London yells at me nearly enough. Really makes you miss home.”</span></p><p><span>Her eyes flicked to Agatha as she said it.</span></p><p><span>The stupid grin landed first. The stupid look, second.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt something in her chest lurch, sharp and unwelcome. The world narrowed around the curve of Rio’s mouth, the tiny scar at the corner she knew the history of, the way the light caught on her teeth.</span></p><p><span>For a second, the bar blurred. The noise dropped away. She could hear her heartbeat in her ears.</span></p><p><span>Her drink was in her hand. The condensation still on her fingers.</span></p><p><span>Then there was the memory of coffee. Iced, sticky, and running down her thigh.</span></p><hr/><p><em><span>The café was too loud and too busy. That was Agatha’s first thought.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Her second was that the tables were far too close together to constitute safe occupational practice.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Her third was that the iced coffee currently soaking into the expensive wool of her charcoal slacks was an active hate crime. Quite possibly a war crime.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Oh my god. Shit. I am so sorry.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>The voice was low, rough at the edges, and far too close.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Cold seeped through the wool and hit her skin. Agatha inhaled sharply.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She looked down first. Brown spreading over gray. Ice cubes skittering across the floor.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Then she looked up. The woman in front of her held an empty cup, straw bent. Her other hand hovered uselessly.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Shoulder-length dark hair shoved back and a crooked button-up stretched over broad shoulders. Forearms dusted with fine hair, ink peeking out from a cuff. Bright brown eyes, mortified and too warm.</span></em></p><p><em><span>And the audacity to be annoyingly attractive.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Are you alright?” she asked.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“No,” Agatha said, crisp. “I am not.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>The woman flinched. “Right. Fair. Yep. I am so, so sorry. I was trying to sit down without spilling and somehow I did the exact opposite of that.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“You threw your coffee at me,” Agatha said. </span></em></p><p><em><span>A couple at the next table tried not to laugh. The barista glanced over, decided this was above their pay grade, and disappeared behind the machine.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The woman set down her empty cup and seized the napkin dispenser, pulling out far too many in a flurry of white.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Here,” she said, already kneeling. “Let me just—”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“If you touch my leg, I will sue you,” Agatha said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The woman froze, wide-eyed.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha regretted the words immediately. The coffee was just very cold.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Stand up,” she said, exasperated. “You look like you’re about to propose.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>The woman let out a strangled half-laugh and rose. “Trust me, I would plan that better. You’d deserve more.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>She offered the napkins instead. Agatha dabbed sharply at the ruined wool. Dry cleaning, if she was lucky. Replacement, more realistically.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The woman watched, stricken.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“I really am sorry,” she said again. “I was juggling my laptop and the coffee and then my phone buzzed and then someone called my name and my entire nervous system malfunctioned.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Clearly,” Agatha said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The fabric clung to her unpleasantly. Of course the one morning she had a high-stakes client meeting, the universe decided to test her.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The woman raked a hand through her hair, worsening the chaos.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Okay,” she said decisively. “Let me pay for the dry cleaning.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha studied her. Even in her fluster, her confidence sat steady. She met Agatha’s gaze head-on. Didn’t look away, didn’t shrink under the gaze. Most people shrank from Agatha’s icy glare.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“What,” Agatha said flatly.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Your pants,” the woman said, gesturing helplessly. “They look expensive, which is my fault, so I’ll pay to get them fixed. Or replaced.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“They’re slacks.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>The woman’s mouth quirked. “Fine. Your slacks.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“They are bespoke.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Then I’ll pay for the bespoke slacks,” she said, earnestly, a small smile slipping through. “I’m the idiot who threw coffee at you at eight thirty in the morning. Please let me fix </span><span>one</span><span> thing today.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>There was something in the way she said it, it was too bright, too quick. Almost a joke.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Do you often offer financial restitution to your victims?” Agatha asked coolly.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“No,” the woman said, “but you’re very pretty and I’m desperate to keep talking to you.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>It was out before she realized. Her eyes widened, and she winced.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Wow,” she said. “That was… not supposed to be said out loud.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Heat crawled up Agatha’s neck.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“You’re not helping your case.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“I’m aware,” she groaned. “Please. Let me pay. I’ll feel better.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>She held out a hand.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“I’m Rio,” she said. “I swear I’m usually more coordinated than this.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Unsubstantiated,” Agatha said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio’s grin tugged crooked. “Fair. And your name? So I can correctly identify the beautiful woman I have wronged today?”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha hesitated. Rio had called her pretty. Accidentally. Twice.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Agatha,” she said. “Harkness.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio repeated it quietly, tasting the shape of it. “Agatha.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>The way she said it made something low in Agatha’s stomach twist. No one ever made her name sound like that.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Fine,” Agatha said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“I’ll arrange the payment promptly. Very promptly. Almost suspiciously promptly,” Rio said, smiling brightly.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha eyed her.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“You are very persistent,” she said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“I’ve been told it’s endearing,” Rio replied.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Have you, by whom?” Agatha asked.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio’s grin widened. “People with excellent taste. Would you agree?”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha blinked. “I would agree that you are persistent.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“I’m a delight,” Rio said. “Now please let me get you a coffee. Otherwise this will haunt me for weeks.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“That sounds like a you problem,” Agatha said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Please,” Rio said again, and this time the word wasn’t a joke. This time, it was a little vulnerable.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha sighed and nodded.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Thank you,” Rio said. “Again. I’m really sorry.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“You have forty-eight hours,” Agatha said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“To pay the bill?” Rio asked.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“To prove you are not a complete disaster,” Agatha said. “After that, I am filing a formal complaint.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio grinned like she’d won something. “Understood.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>She didn’t move away. She calmly dropped the empty iced coffee cup into the bin and stepped aside so Agatha could order.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Double espresso,” Agatha said. </span></em></p><p><em><span>The barista nodded.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio waited until Agatha stepped back, then leaned in just enough to place her own order. </span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha blinked. “You already had a coffee.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio shrugged, leaning one elbow against the counter. “Yeah, well. I threw it at you. Seems only fair I get a refill too.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>The barista snorted. Agatha did not.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio added, “Americano for me. Light on the ice.” She shot Agatha a sideways look. “Learned my lesson.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha closed her eyes for a tight second. “I have a client meeting in forty minutes.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Oh no,” Rio deadpanned. “Appearing in public with evidence of wrongdoing. A tragedy.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha shot her a look that could freeze the Atlantic.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio held up both palms. “Okay. Okay. Sorry. Look—”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Her gaze raked down Agatha’s slacks again, thoughtful.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Do you want my pants?”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha stared. “I’m sorry?”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“We can swap,” Rio said. “They’re clean. Dry. We’re close enough in size.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“They’re hideous.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio grinned. “So that’s a no.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“That is a never.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Yeah,” Rio murmured, gaze still on her. “That’s a shame, I’d love to get in your pants.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Their coffees arrived. Rio paid quickly and held the door open.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“There’s a boutique two blocks down,” she said. “Worst case, emergency trousers. Best case, you forgive me and let me take you to dinner.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha scoffed and stepped outside. Rio matched her pace effortlessly.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Three steps later, Agatha snapped, “Why are you still here?”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Because,” Rio said lightly, “if you decide you </span><span>do</span><span> want to get into my pants, I’d hate to be out of arm’s reach.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha stopped dead.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio stopped too.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“That was atrocious,” Agatha said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio shrugged. “You almost laughed.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“I did not.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“You almost did.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha resumed walking. “I have a meeting.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Then let’s get you some pants, gorgeous.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“I am </span><span>not</span><span> gorgeous.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Yes, you are,” Rio said without hesitation.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha’s breath tripped, infuriatingly.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She walked faster. Rio kept pace.</span></em></p><hr/><p><em><span>Ten minutes later, Agatha was in a cramped boutique changing room that smelled faintly of lavender sachets and her own despair.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio’s navy utility pants hung obscenely from her hips.</span></em></p><p><em><span>They were… an abomination.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Low-slung. Too loose. Too many pockets. Designed by someone who hated tailored cuts and also possibly hated her specifically.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Outside the curtain, fabric rustled, Agatha’s impeccable slacks now wrapped around Rio’s infuriatingly perfect body.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“How do mine fit?” Rio called.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha yanked the curtain open.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio looked up and froze.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha’s slacks hugged her hips indecently well, belt cinched, shirt half-tucked. Rio looked sinfully good.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha hated it.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio’s mouth curved. “Well. This is… a look.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“For who,” Agatha demanded. “A dock worker?”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“No,” Rio said, eyes dragging down Agatha’s borrowed pants and back up. “You look—”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“If you say ‘practical,’ I’ll kill you.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio laughed, low. “I was going to say hot, actually.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha slammed the curtain closed so hard the hooks rattled.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Never speak to me again. Fuck you,” she said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Okay,” Rio said. A beat. “You look </span><span>very</span><span> hot.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Jail,” Agatha snapped. “Straight to jail. For ten thousand years.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio was quiet for half a second. Then she whispered, softly in a way that slipped past all of Agatha’s defenses, “You’d look beautiful in anything, Agatha.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha went still.</span></em></p><p><em><span>A moment later, she stepped out, chin lifted in disdainful refusal, expression flat as polished steel.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“These pants are horrific, insulting even,” she declared. “But I have a meeting. So they’ll have to do.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“You can keep them,” Rio said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Absolutely not.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio leaned in, voice low. “If you want to wear my clothes, you only have to ask.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha glared. “I have your pants. That is already too much of you.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio grinned. “For now.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha cursed every decision that had brought her to this moment.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Forty minutes later, Agatha endured the most humiliating meeting of her entire legal career, Rio’s pants swishing at her hips like she was an underpaid stagehand.</span></em></p><p><em><span>They swished when she walked. They gaped when she sat. They had </span><span>side adjusters</span><span>, which she had knotted viciously.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Her senior partner kept glancing at them, baffled, while she delivered her briefing with the icy precision of a woman suppressing a violent crime.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She and Rio had parted briskly after swapping numbers for “dry cleaning and other administrative matters.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha had not texted.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She had absolutely, definitely not thought about her.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Except every time pocket number seven brushed her thigh.</span></em></p><hr/><p><em><span>The text came three hours later, between meetings.</span></em></p><p><em><u><span>Hi. This is Rio. Coffee assassin from this morning. Please confirm I have the right number or I will be haunted by guilt, administrative inaccuracy and the awful fantasy of what could have been.</span></u></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha stared at it.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She should have replied with the name of her dry cleaner, or her bank account details and a quote. It would have been efficient and practical.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Instead she typed:</span></em></p><p><em><u><span>You have the right number.

Are you free for dinner this week or are you fully booked with your big client meetings?</span></u></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha’s mouth twitched.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She typed back:</span></em></p><p><em><u><span>I’m not sure we’re at the dinner stage.

Allow me to rephrase. May I please take you to dinner to apologize properly and attempt to demonstrate basic table coordination and manners?</span></u></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha stared at the screen, her chest felt too tight.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She should have said no. She had a merger devouring her schedule. She wasn’t in the space to be dating terribly charming and uncoordinated brunettes. It didn’t fit her timeline.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She typed:</span></em></p><p><em><u><span>When?</span></u></em></p><p><em><span>And hit send.</span></em></p><hr/><p><em><span>Their first date had been at a small place two streets away from the café, and a few blocks from Agatha’s apartment. Inside, the lighting was soft, and the furniture mismatched.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio had arrived ten minutes early and hovered outside, rocking on her heels, hands shoved in the pockets of her black trousers. She looked sharp in a deep burgundy satin button-up. </span></em></p><p><em><span>When she saw Agatha approaching, she straightened up, that same bright, crooked grin appearing like a reflex.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha was elegance distilled into a silhouette. The deep navy silk of her shift dress fell over her like water, catching light with every step. Clean lines were simple and devastating. Rio’s eyes flicked over her once, stunned in a way she didn’t bother hiding.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Hi,” Rio said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Hello,” Agatha replied.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Nice to see you without coffee on your pants,” Rio said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “It is nice to exist without smelling like a barista’s bedroom.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio laughed, a warm, unguarded sound that made half the tension in Agatha’s shoulders drain away.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Inside, over dinner, the confidence held, but the cracks started showing.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio talked with her hands. She knocked her knife against her glass three times. She lost her train of thought halfway through a story about a family trip to Oslo and had to circle back, cheeks flushing dark.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She also listened like she was being paid to. Every time Agatha spoke, Rio’s eyes fixed on her, steady and bright, tracking every word. When Agatha slipped and mentioned how long she sometimes stayed at the office, Rio’s mouth tightened in a way that had nothing to do with judgment and everything to do with concern.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“You should sleep more,” Rio said simply.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“I function perfectly well with the sleep I’m getting,” Agatha said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“You function,” Rio agreed. “That’s not the same thing. You need to sleep more.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>No one else had ever cared for Agatha like that. </span></em></p><p><em><span>“Why does it matter to you?” Agatha asked, more blunt than she meant to be.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio’s fingers traced the condensation on her water glass. She didn’t look away.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Because I like you, very much,” she said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha’s fork paused halfway to her mouth.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“You don’t know me,” she said.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio smiled, small and real. “I know enough to want to.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha blushed.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Later, walking her to a taxi, Rio had shoved her hands back in her pockets like she was having to physically restrain herself from reaching for Agatha.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Can I see you again?” she asked.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha’s instinct rushed to her throat. No. She’d be too busy. It’d be too complicated. It’d be too much.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Yes, please,” she heard herself say instead.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio’s grin came, slow and radiant, crooked at the corner. “Yeah?”</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Yes,” Agatha repeated, annoyed to hear the softness in it.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Good,” Rio said quietly. “I would really like that.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>She hadn’t kissed her that night. Just stood there on the sidewalk, close enough that Agatha could smell the faint spice of her cologne, and waited until Agatha was safely in the taxi before turning away.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha had watched her in the rear window until the car turned the corner.</span></em></p><p><em><span>She’d kissed her four days later. </span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio had texted at 6:12 a.m.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Can I buy you a morning coffee? I’ll keep my hands to myself, promise.</span></em></p><p><em><span>It had been accompanied by an absurd number of emojis, none of which Agatha could decipher the intent of.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Agatha had typed back </span><span>Fine</span><span>, with the exact amount of punctuation required to hide the fact that she had been thinking about Rio’s stupid crooked smile for days. No emojis.</span></em></p><p><em><span>The café was half-empty at 7 a.m., soft morning light leaking in through the windows. Rio was waiting by the counter, hair tousled, shirt wrinkled like she’d slept in it, that grin aimed directly at Agatha the second she walked in.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Something in Agatha snapped cleanly.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio opened her mouth to speak. Agatha didn’t let her get that far. She stepped in, grabbed Rio’s collar, and kissed her like she’d spent days trying not to imagine doing exactly that.</span></em></p><p><em><span>Rio made a quiet, startled sound against her mouth, one Agatha felt all the way down her spine, before kissing her back, hard. She wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist and pulled her in, pressing Agatha’s body to hers. </span></em></p><p><em><span>When Agatha finally pulled away, breath uneven, Rio had lipstick smudged across her mouth and a beautifully ruined, dazed expression.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“Morning,” Rio whispered.</span></em></p><p><em><span>“You,” Agatha said, “are insufferable.”</span></em></p><p><em><span>And she kissed her again.</span></em></p><hr/><p><span>Back at the table, the memory snapped like a rubber band.</span></p><p><span>She found herself looking at Rio beside her. Taking in the sound of her laugh, the line of her forearms, the placement of her hands. </span></p><p><span>She had the same crooked grin. The same steady, stubborn gentleness that had stood on a pavement with hands in pockets and asked if she could see her again.</span></p><p><span>Next to her, Rio was laughing at something Tommy had said, shoulders loose, head tipped back. When she glanced over, as if checking that Agatha was still there, still within reach, her mouth curved in that same uneven way.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest ached.</span></p><p><span>She wrapped her fingers more tightly around her glass, grounding herself in the slick of condensation, the weight of the gin, the hum of the bar.</span></p><p><span>She was not twenty-nine and standing soaked in coffee in a café.</span></p><p><span>She was fifty, sitting in a bar at a party, beside the woman she had divorced a decade earlier.</span></p><p><span>She took a slow breath in, let it out through her nose, and forced herself to look away.</span></p><p><span>Agatha could feel Wanda staring at her from across the table. She didn’t need to look to know exactly what expression Wanda was wearing, her raised brows, the barely suppressed oh honey that meant she’d clocked every micro-movement, every breath, every inch of displacement between Agatha and Rio.</span></p><p><span>Agatha refused to look at her.</span></p><p><span>Wanda tried to catch her eye again. Agatha sipped her drink instead. Wanda glared at her. Agatha sipped and looked away harder.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t say anything. She didn’t look at Agatha outright, but she was acutely present. Her thigh wasn’t touching Agatha’s anymore, but the absence felt louder than the contact had. She sat relaxed, one arm slung casually over the back of her chair, attention turned to Jen’s rambling speech about turning fifty and how she still couldn’t figure out her phone brightness.</span></p><p><span>Lilia arrived like a small hurricane. She was tipsy, glowing, and wearing enough perfume to fumigate a high-rise. </span></p><p><span>“My girls,” Lilia sighed dramatically, sliding her arms around both their shoulders at once. Her bracelets clinked as she tugged them in, warm with her chaos. “Look at my girls, sitting together and getting along like grown-ups.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha choked on her gin.</span></p><p><span>Rio gave a startled laugh. “We’re not fighting, Lils.”</span></p><p><span>“Exactly,” Lilia said, nodding. “My grown-up girls.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha forced a smile. “We are delightful. Please release me, Lilia.”</span></p><p><span>Lilia tightened her arm around her. “Never, my little darling.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda tried to help by mouthing something at Agatha from across the table. Agatha ignored her again. Wanda mouthed it harder. Agatha refused to engage harder.</span></p><p><span>Rio watched the exchange with a small, unreadable smile.</span></p><p><span>The conversation flowed around them. Somewhere, someone spilled a drink. Jen declared the twins her emotional support children and forced a photo with them. Billy threw his head back with laughter as she peppered his face with kisses.</span></p><p><span>Lilia released them eventually, satisfied with her contribution to group cohesion, and staggered off to demand something ill-advised of the DJ.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled. She hadn’t realized she’d been holding her breath. She kept her eyes carefully trained anywhere but the woman directly beside her.</span></p><p><span>Rio eventually leaned in slightly. Not close enough to touch. Just close enough to speak under the noise.</span></p><p><span>“You alright?” she murmured.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s pulse stuttered. She didn’t look at her. “I’m perfectly fine.”</span></p><p><span>“I don’t think you are, I think you’re just saying that.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m saying it because I’m fine.”</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed a soft laugh into her drink. “Sure, baby, whatever you say.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha ignored the endearment. </span></p><p><span>Rio shifted beside her, sliding her fingers lightly against Agatha’s knee. It wasn’t really a touch. It wasn’t really anything. It could have been an accident.</span></p><p><span>The lights near the bar flickered once, then Lilia shrieked, loud enough for several patrons to flinch.</span></p><p><span>“Slideshow time,” she announced triumphantly. “Everyone shut up, I found the photos.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha tensed. Rio lifted her glass. Wanda muttered something resigned under her breath.</span></p><p><span>The projector sputtered to life against the far wall.</span></p><p><span>First came the chaos.</span></p><p><span>Jen at age twenty-two, triumphantly holding a stolen traffic cone above her head. Jen at a Halloween party dressed as a vampire with plastic fangs she refused to take out. Jen and Lilia in matching glitter dresses mid-karaoke, mascara smudged, both of them definitely drunk. Jen carrying a toddler Billy under one arm like a football. Jen and Wanda on a beach in the early 2000s, Wanda sunburned, both scowling at the camera. </span></p><p><span>The table roared with laughter and Jen preened under the attention.</span></p><p><span>Agatha let herself relax. Safe territory, this type of nostalgia she could handle.</span></p><p><span>The next click hit her like a truck.</span></p><p><span>It was their wedding photo. The room quieted mid-laugh.</span></p><p><span>Agatha and Rio were mid-dance. Jen and Alice slightly to the left of frame, wrapped in an embrace. </span></p><p><span>In the center of the picture, Agatha’s head was thrown back in a laugh, mouth open in unguarded joy. Rio was looking at her like there was no one else in the world. Hand at her waist, fingers curved in a familiar, protective grip.</span></p><p><span>Someone inhaled sharply.</span></p><p><span>Jen pressed a hand to her chest. </span></p><p><span>“Oh wow. Oh my god. Look at you two,” she said, voice softening into something fond. “That day was perfect.”</span></p><p><span>Before anyone could redirect, Lilia chimed in, misty-eyed and dramatic.</span><span><br/>
</span><span>“My girls. I could cry. I </span><em><span>am</span></em><span> crying.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at the tablecloth. Her pulse throbbed behind her eyes. Her fingers tightened, knuckles turning white under the strain.</span></p><p><span>Jen, emboldened by the room and the wine, leaned forward. “How long would it have been now, if you two were still married?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha went still. Rio didn’t.</span></p><p><span>She looked at the photo, then at Agatha, then quietly back at the photo again.</span></p><p><span>“Eighteen years this year,” she said.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath caught. Her chest squeezed so tightly it hurt again, a sharp pressure constant under her ribs.</span></p><p><span>She pushed her chair back.</span></p><p><span>“I need air.”</span></p><p><span>Her voice held. Barely.</span></p><p><span>She stood without looking at anyone and walked toward the hallway with too-even steps that fooled absolutely no one.</span></p><p><span>Silence pooled behind her.</span></p><p><span>Wanda half rose from her chair. But Rio beat her to it, her chair scraping softly as she rose to follow.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t see either of them.</span></p><p><span>She pushed past a couple dancing too close, slid between two bar tables, and aimed for the back hallway like she’d trained her whole life for this escape route.</span></p><p><span>The air in the bar felt too thick. Every breath scraped, and her chest locked tight around her ribs.</span></p><p><span>By the time she reached the little door propped open at the back, Agatha was already shaking.</span></p><p><span>She stepped into the alley and braced both palms against the brick wall. Cold air hit her face. She sucked in lungful after lungful, trying to pull oxygen back into her body.</span></p><p><span>Her breathing was loud in the quiet space. Harsh and uncontrolled. Each inhale felt too big, too sharp, like she was drowning and breathing at the same time.</span></p><p><span>Her shoulders hunched, and a soft sound broke out of her, not quite a sob, not yet.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t hear the door over her own breathing.</span></p><p><span>But she felt it.</span></p><p><span>The familiar, inevitable presence at her back. </span></p><p><span>She squeezed her eyes shut.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice was quiet. Barely a whisper, and Agatha flinched.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t turn. She pressed her forehead against the brick, breath shuddering out of her in uneven bursts.</span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry,” she said, the words tumbling out too fast. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped forward, slowly, like she was approaching a wounded animal.</span></p><p><span>“Hey,” Rio murmured, and Agatha felt the soft touch of her fingers card through the ends of her hair. “Don’t. Don’t do that.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head, fingers flexing against the wall. “I didn’t mean to. I just… I couldn’t… I’m sorry.”</span></p><p><span>She wiped at her cheeks with the heel of her hand, frustrated when the tears only smeared.</span></p><p><span>Rio reached for her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha jerked back like the touch would break her in half. “Don’t. Please.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand hovered in the air for a second, then fell to her side.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” she said softly. “Sweetheart, please look at me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head again, harder this time. She sucked in another shaky breath, then another. “I can’t.”</span></p><p><span>Rio sounded like she was breaking. “Why.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath stuttered. She pushed a trembling hand through her hair.</span></p><p><span>“I don’t… I don’t know. I don’t know. I just—” She swallowed, choking on air and tears and ten years of everything. “I don’t know how to be around you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio exhaled, sharp through her nose. “I don’t know how to be around you either.”</span></p><p><span>That undid something inside her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned, slowly, tears slipping down her face in uneven tracks. Rio was standing no more than two steps away, hands half-raised, like she was terrified to make the wrong move.</span></p><p><span>Her own eyes shone in the dim light. A couple of tears had already escaped, tracing along her cheekbones.</span></p><p><span>“Then why did you follow me?” Agatha asked, voice cracking clean in the middle.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth pressed into a thin line. “You know why.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked away. Her throat closed back over.</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped forward. One step, closing half the distance.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” she whispered, voice tight. “Why did you do it?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze.</span></p><p><span>The question ripped open the rest of the wound.</span></p><p><span>Her lips parted. Nothing came out.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice grew more raw. “Tell me. Please. Just tell me why.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard as her chin trembled.</span></p><p><span>“I couldn’t stand the idea you’d resent me,” she said, barely louder than the cold air between them. “I couldn’t bear it. I thought… I thought if I held you back, I’d lose you anyway. I thought letting you go was better than you waking up every day angry that you stayed.”</span></p><p><span>Rio took another tiny step, her breath shaking. “I could never have resented you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, wet and broken. “You don’t know that. How was I supposed to know that.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice cracked. “Because I loved you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, but the tears spilled anyway, tracing the curves of her cheekbones.</span></p><p><span>“I know that, Rio. And I loved you so much it terrified me,” she whispered. “I loved you more than I’ve ever loved anything, anyone.”</span></p><p><span>Rio made a soft, wounded sound and stepped closer without thinking.</span></p><p><span>Agatha hit the wall with her back. Her hands came up, instinctive, pushing weakly at Rio’s shoulders.</span></p><p><span>“Don’t,” Agatha said. “I can’t… Rio, please. Don’t touch me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio froze. Her hands hovered inches from Agatha’s arms. “I’m not trying to hurt you.”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Agatha whispered. “That’s what scares me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s breath hitched. Her eyes flicked over Agatha’s face, devastated.</span></p><p><span>She lifted one trembling hand.</span></p><p><span>Agatha couldn’t stop her this time.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s fingers touched her cheek with the barest of pressure, and Agatha’s inhale cracked.</span></p><p><span>Their foreheads nearly touched. Close enough to feel each other’s breath. Close enough that one more whisper would have been a kiss.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice was a whisper against her mouth. “Please don’t run from me again.”</span></p><p><span>Before Agatha could answer, the door banged open.</span></p><p><span>Billy stood frozen in the doorway, wide-eyed, horrified, holding a glass of something he definitely should not have been drinking. </span></p><p><span>“Oh,” he said. “Um. Sorry.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped back fast, wiping at her face. Agatha quickly covered her mouth with her hand, trying to hide how devastated she must have looked.</span></p><p><span>Billy winced. “It’s… cake time. Jen says… five minutes. Or she’ll burn her name into your skin with a candle.”</span></p><p><span>He backed up inside like he’d seen a ghost. He kind of had seen a ghost.</span></p><p><span>The door swung shut.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stared at the ground.</span></p><p><span>Rio stared at Agatha.</span></p><p><span>Neither moved.</span></p><p><span>After a long, aching moment, Agatha whispered, “I’m sorry.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice came out low and hoarse, mostly resigned. “Don’t be.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha couldn’t answer.</span></p><hr/><p><span>Back inside, the noise hit Agatha first.</span></p><p><span>Warm, bright, far too loud. A blur of voices and clinking glasses and someone shouting for another round. She stepped back inside with Rio a few steps behind her, the two of them separated by just enough space to be intentional. Agatha kept her eyes forward. Her hands were still shaking.</span></p><p><span>She moved through the hallway, past a couple arguing over a coat, past a table of twenty-somethings taking selfies, past Wanda waiting with a look on her face that made Agatha want to walk directly into traffic.</span></p><p><span>She didn’t stop.</span></p><p><span>She veered right instead, straight into the bathroom, pushing the door open hard and shoving herself inside.</span></p><p><span>The moment she was alone, she locked the door.</span></p><p><span>Then she sagged back against it, chest heaving.</span></p><p><span>Her reflection in the mirror looked wrecked. Eyes red, mascara smudged. Lipstick faintly uneven from the way she’d been pressing her mouth into her shaking hand outside.</span></p><p><span>“Perfect,” she muttered. “Just fucking perfect.”</span></p><p><span>She turned on the tap and splashed cold water onto her wrists, then her throat, grounding herself with the shock of it. She dragged a paper towel under the faucet and dabbed gently at her eyes, trying not to smear things further.</span></p><p><span>Her hands kept shaking.</span></p><p><span>She braced her palms on the sink and stared at herself.</span></p><p><span>“Get it together,” she whispered. “You’re fifty fucking years old. You argue with people for fun. You can survive your ex-wife.”</span></p><p><span>A lie, obviously. </span></p><p><span>A soft knock startled her.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice.</span></p><p><span>Muffled through the door, but unmistakable.</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes. Her entire body reacted to Rio. It would always react to Rio. There was too much love, too much pain. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha… please.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha inhaled slowly. “I need a minute.”</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t push, didn’t plead. Just stood on the other side of the door, breathing quietly.</span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Rio said, barely audible. “I’ll be out here.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard. She gave herself thirty more seconds. Maybe forty. Cleaned her smudged eyeliner, restored her mouth to something approximating symmetry, and pressed cold fingers to her cheeks until the blotchiness faded.</span></p><p><span>Then she unlocked the door.</span></p><p><span>Rio straightened instinctively, eyes flicking over her face with that soft, searching concern that made Agatha’s stomach drop straight through her shoes.</span></p><p><span>“You good?” Rio asked quietly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded once, too fast. “Cake,” she said. “Jen will take out a hit.”</span></p><p><span>The corner of Rio’s mouth tugged upward, but her eyes stayed sad. “Can’t have that.”</span></p><p><span>They walked back toward the bar together, side by side but not touching, a taut silence strung between.</span></p><p><span>And when they stepped into the main room, Billy spotted them first.</span></p><p><span>“Cake time!” he shouted, loud enough to save them both.</span></p><p><span>His expression flickered with guilt, mortification, and a degree of panic unique to teenagers who had accidentally interrupted their honorary aunts in what was definitely a </span><em><span>“Moment”</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>He mouthed:</span><em><span> I’m so sorry.</span></em></p><p><span>Agatha gave him a single, tiny nod and a small smile. </span></p><p><span>The twins flanked her like bodyguards, too wide-eyed, too careful. Tommy pushed a napkin at her. Billy hovered an inch behind her shoulder as if he could physically block the world from looking at her too closely.</span></p><p><span>Agatha and Rio stood with a table-length between them.</span></p><p><span>Wanda slid into place at Agatha’s left, leaning in just enough to whisper, “You alright?”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha said. “Next question.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda hummed knowingly. “Want a drink.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes.” </span></p><p><span>Wanda pressed her own wine glass into Agatha’s hand without comment.</span></p><p><span>The crowd thickened and voices rose. Jen demanded silence, which only made everyone louder.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt Rio’s presence like a second heartbeat. Even with two dozen bodies between them, it was unbearable. Too much and never enough. Agatha kept her gaze fixed firmly on the cake. Rio kept her gaze fixed firmly on Agatha.</span></p><p><span>Jen clapped her hands together. “Everyone ready?”</span></p><p><span>Someone shouted something about that many candles being a fire hazard. Lilia screamed.</span></p><p><span>Alice lit the candles and the room glowed warm.</span></p><p><span>As the first off-key notes of “Happy Birthday” broke out, Agatha risked one glance.</span></p><p><span>Rio was already looking at her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked away too fast. Her throat tightened, her pulse kicked. Wanda rested a hand on her elbow, steadying her, grounding her.</span></p><p><span>When the song ended, Jen blew out the candles with a dramatic flourish that nearly sprayed wax across the table. The room erupted into applause.</span></p><p><span>Agatha clapped with everyone else.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t. Rio was still watching her. Agatha felt it like a hand closing around her ribs.</span></p><p><span>People began lining up for cake. Someone shoved plates into the twins’ hands. Wanda was pulled into a hug by a very imbibed Lilia. Alice disappeared behind the bar to fetch extra forks.</span></p><p><span>Agatha took the smallest step backward, toward the shadows near the wall, needing space, needing more air.</span></p><p><span>Rio mirrored her.</span></p><p><span>They ended up standing two feet apart behind the crowd. Invisible to everyone else.</span></p><p><span>Agatha spoke first, voice barely audible. “We should… we should rejoin the party.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s reply was low. “We are at the party.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath caught. “You know what I mean.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes flicked down her face, lingering at her mouth before lifting again. “I meant what I said.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed, throat tight. “Rio—”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t,” Rio said quietly. </span></p><p><span>Agatha shut her eyes.</span></p><p><span>Someone bumped into her shoulder and muttered an apology. Laughter rose somewhere near the jukebox. Jen began yelling about giving speeches.</span></p><p><span>Life continued and the party rolled on.</span></p><p><span>But the air between them stayed taut and fragile.</span></p><p><span>Agatha opened her eyes and met Rio’s.</span></p><p><span>Then Wanda appeared at Agatha’s elbow, thrusting a plate of cake into her hands with enough force to jolt her spine.</span></p><p><span>“Eat sugar,” Wanda said. “It’ll stop you from passing out.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinked at her. “I’m not going to pass out.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re two more emotions away from collapse,” Wanda said. “Eat the cake.”</span></p><p><span>Rio choked out a laugh.</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked at her, Rio looked back. The next fault line cracked open.</span></p><p><span>Jen spotted her quickly.</span></p><p><span>Of course she did. Jen had always had sniper-level accuracy when it came to Agatha’s moments of emotional instability. She beamed, waved a fork like a wand, and shouted across the room.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha Harkness, my terrifying queen, come here and say something meaningful before I pass out into my own cake.”</span></p><p><span>The room laughed. Agatha wanted to lie down on the floor.</span></p><p><span>“Absolutely not,” Agatha called back, but she was already being nudged forward by Wanda and physically herded by the twins like they were moving a skittish racehorse toward the starting line.</span></p><p><span>Rio stayed exactly where she was, watching.</span></p><p><span>Jen clapped loudly when Agatha reached her. “Speech,” she declared, planting her hands on Agatha’s shoulders. “My favorite dragon lady is going to give a speech.”</span></p><p><span>“I could ruin your life with a single sentence,” Agatha murmured.</span></p><p><span>Jen grinned. “I know, how exciting. That’s why I asked you.”</span></p><p><span>Alice snorted into her wine.</span></p><p><span>Someone shoved a half-empty champagne flute into Agatha’s hand. It wasn’t hers, but it didn’t matter. The room settled, expectant.</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled, straightened, and lifted her chin.</span></p><p><span>Then she found Rio across the crowd. She didn’t mean to look for her, except she absolutely did, she always meant to look for her. Rio’s eyes met hers instantly. </span></p><p><span>Agatha looked away before she drowned in it, and raised her glass.</span></p><p><span>“Well,” she started dryly, “if I must.”</span></p><p><span>Laughter rippled.</span></p><p><span>“Jennifer Kale,” Agatha continued, pausing long enough for Jen to bow dramatically, “is the only person I know who could turn a fiftieth birthday into a cross between a bacchanal, a séance, and a public health hazard.”</span></p><p><span>More laughter, Lilia whooped as Jen curtsied.</span></p><p><span>“But,” Agatha said, the word softening as she continued, “she is also one of the most fiercely loyal, infuriatingly supportive and relentlessly kind people I have ever had the privilege of knowing.”</span></p><p><span>Jen made a dramatic gasp and clutched her chest.</span></p><p><span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Please don’t make this sentimental. You’ll ruin my reputation.”</span></p><p><span>The crowd laughed again. She let it quiet slightly, then continued, her voice slipping into something gentler.</span></p><p><span>“You have been in my life longer than some small countries have existed. You’ve talked me through professional disasters, personal catastrophes, and at least three questionable hairstyles. You’ve fed me, yelled at me, made me laugh when I didn’t want to, and dragged me back into the world every time I tried to retreat from it.”</span></p><p><span>She glanced, deliberately, toward Rio.</span></p><p><span>For one heartbeat, they were the only two people in the room.</span></p><p><span>Then Agatha looked back to Jen, perfectly controlled.</span></p><p><span>“And you’ve created this family,” Agatha said. “This ridiculous, wonderful network of misfits who somehow all ended up loving each other. You’ve kept us together. Even when some of us made that nearly impossible.”</span></p><p><span>She felt more than saw Rio flicker. A tight line in her jaw as it clenched.</span></p><p><span>Agatha continued, lighter again. “So here’s to you, Jenny Kale. A menace, a marvel, and a woman who refuses to age appropriately.”</span></p><p><span>The room erupted. Jen lunged forward and crushed Agatha in a hug that nearly toppled them both.</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed against her shoulder, muffled and unwilling to enjoy how grounding it felt.</span></p><p><span>“You sap,” Jen whispered in her ear. “You big soft marshmallow.”</span></p><p><span>“Fuck off and die,” Agatha muttered affectionately.</span></p><p><span>Jen released her, wiping at her eyes dramatically.</span></p><p><span>“Alright,” Jen announced to the crowd. “Someone get this woman another drink!”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stepped back, smoothing her blouse, catching her breath.</span></p><p><span>When she looked up, Rio was still watching her.</span></p><p><span>Always watching her.</span></p><p><span>Wanda slid an arm through Agatha’s just long enough to whisper, “That was beautiful.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed. “I need a very strong drink.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda nodded. “Yeah. You really, really do.”</span></p><p><span>And the party moved on.</span></p><p><span>But she could feel Rio’s gaze like a warm hand pressed between her shoulder blades, steady and unrelenting.</span></p>

<p>There were boxes everywhere.</p><p>They were stacked along the hallway of the narrow townhouse, a cardboard obstacle course labeled in Wanda’s messy handwriting. KITCHEN. BOOKS. BABY STUFF. MORE BABY STUFF. MORE FUCKING BABY STUFF. </p><p>“Okay, I’m a whale,” Wanda announced from the stairwell. “A beached whale. Leave me here to die.”</p><p>“You are not dying in my stairwell,” Agatha said. “It will stain my refurbished floorboards. Keep moving, Wilbur.”</p><p>Wanda groaned and leaned against the banister. Her tank top clung to her in patches. She was pink and damp and furious. </p><p>“I hate both of you,” she muttered. “If I drop dead, I want it on record that it is your fault for buying a place with so many stairs.”</p><p>“It was this or the apartment with the bathroom in the kitchen,” Rio reminded her, juggling a box on her hip that was absolutely too heavy for the way she was carrying it. “Personally, I think we chose well. And you are fucking welcome that we bought a whole fucking house to help raise your spawn in.”</p><p>“You chose wrong,” Wanda said. “I want a ramp. And a forklift. And for my spine to be someone else’s problem.”</p><p>“You can have my spine,” Rio said. “I’m not using it, apparently. Letting you walk all over me.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look that could have frozen water.</p><p>“Put that down properly before you slip a disc, love,” she said. “If you injure yourself I am not doing your share of the unpacking.”</p><p>“You’re very heartless, my darling,” Rio said, her grin giving her teasing away.</p><p>Agatha leaned around Wanda to tweak the strap of her sports bra back into place. “Come on, mama. Five more steps and you get to lie down and yell at us while we do all the work.”</p><p>Wanda winced then, causing both Agatha and Rio to stand quickly to attention, eyes fixed on their heavily pregnant friend. </p><p>“These are not contractions,” Wanda said, breathing a little harder. “I am not in labor. I am in discomfort and I am very annoyed.”</p><p>“Uh huh,” Rio said. “Honey, translate that from denial to English.”</p><p>“It means she might be in labor and will not admit it until a baby physically falls out of her,” Agatha said crisply. “Wanda, if your water breaks on my stairs I will sue the fucking pants off you.”</p><p>“You two are monsters,” Wanda muttered. “I'm going to tell my children the stories of your cruelty.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said. “They should be prepared.”</p><p>She stepped behind Wanda, placing one hand between her shoulder blades. Not pushing, just a steady and supportive pressure, warm through the cotton.</p><p>“You’re doing fine,” she added, quieter. “Breathe. You are nearly at the top.”</p><p>Rio caught the shift and her mouth softened.In the middle of the chaos, she reached across and brushed her fingers along Agatha’s wrist, then went back to grumbling about the box.</p><p>They finally reached the landing. Wanda shuffled into what was now officially her room, where the bed had already been set up, sheets crisp and tucked tight. She collapsed on top of it with a dramatic groan, looking at the two small bassinets arranged against the wall. </p><p>“I live here now,” she announced into the pillow. “Move the rest of my life around me. I am <em>not</em> getting up again. Probably until these two are in kindergarten.”</p><p>“Tragic,” Agatha said. “We have to update the birth plan.”</p><p>“No <em>fucking </em>hospital, I am not in labor,” Wanda mumbled, then lifted her head. “Actually, hospital, but not yet. My app says I still have time.”</p><p>“Your app is lying,” Rio said. She set the box down at the foot of the bed and straightened slowly, one hand pressed to the small of her own back. “Your app is clearly designed by an idiot.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head and moved around the bed to open the curtains wider. Afternoon light poured in, catching on Wanda’s sweat.</p><p>They had painted the walls a soft, pale green the week before. Rio had gotten more paint on herself than on the plaster. Agatha had hurled threats and abuse from the doorway, refusing to do the work and refusing to pay someone for it. </p><p>Wanda sat in the middle of the room eating crackers.</p><p>“Do you want water?” Agatha asked now. “Food?”</p><p>“Yes,” Wanda sighed. “And an epidural from now, to be safe.”</p><p>“Water and fruit it is,” Agatha said. “You can have the drugs later, but you need to be nice.”</p><p>“No promises,” Wanda muttered, rolling onto her side.</p><p>Rio sat down at the end of the bed and picked up one of Wanda’s bare feet without asking. She started to knead gently at the arch with her thumbs, pressing into swollen tissue with a gentle kind of care that made Agatha’s chest feel oddly tight.</p><p>Wanda let out a strangled noise. “I do not deserve you, Rio Vidal. Agatha certainly doesn’t deserve you.”</p><p>Agatha snorted and left them to it, heading for the kitchen.</p><p>The kitchen was still mostly a disaster. Open cupboards, half-unpacked boxes, a tea towel draped over the oven handle. There was a bowl of oranges on the counter that Rio had insisted on buying because they made the room “look like a magazine.”</p><p>Agatha reached for the knife block.</p><p>She was good with sharp things in the right context. Cutting fruit, she could do. Cooking it? Maybe not. </p><p>She peeled an orange with precision, fingers sticky, bits of rind piling up in ragged strips. The second orange fought her. The knife slipped, skidding off the pith. She hissed under her breath and adjusted her grip.</p><p>“Do not maim those hands, baby,” Rio called from the bedroom. “You can give her whole fruit. Wanda knows how to chew.”</p><p>“I am perfectly capable of cutting a fucking orange, darling,” Agatha called back.</p><p>The knife immediately slipped again, nicking her thumb. She swore softly and stuck it in her mouth.</p><p>Rio appeared in the doorway a few seconds later, Wanda abandoned for the moment.</p><p>She leaned against the frame, arms folded, looking aggravatingly entertained.</p><p>“Blood?” she asked.</p><p>“It is superficial,” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio padded over and held out her hand. “Show me.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then extended her hand, palm up. Rio took it, thumb curling automatically around her wrist, and inspected the cut with exaggerated seriousness.</p><p>“Hmm,” she said. “Yes. Very grave. You're going to live, but only if I kiss it better.”</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio bent and kissed the pad of her thumb anyway, slow and absurdly gentle.</p><p>Heat flickered low in Agatha’s stomach. She tried to ignore it.</p><p>“You are insufferable,” she muttered.</p><p>“You love me, you have such a big crush on me that you married me,” Rio sang, grinning.</p><p>“Unfortunately,” Agatha hummed.</p><p>Rio stole the knife and one of the oranges. “Go supervise Wanda,” she said. “I will handle this dangerous work.”</p><p>She started slicing with careless confidence. Agatha hovered for a second, watching the sure movement of her hands, the easy strength in her forearms, ink disappearing and reappearing under rolled sleeves.</p><p>Sometimes Agatha could see it so clearly it scared her. An entire life laid out. Grocery lists on the fridge. Little shoes by the door. Rio’s laughter echoing off these walls for decades.</p><p>She picked up the plate of mostly acceptable fruit pieces and headed back down the hall.</p><p>Wanda had shifted onto her back, eyes closed. Rio’s absence had left one of her feet abandoned in the air. Agatha nudged it gently back onto the mattress with her elbow.</p><p>“I brought sustenance,” she announced. “And more water.”</p><p>“Marry me,” Wanda muttered without opening her eyes. “No offense, Rio.”</p><p>“Deeply offended,” Rio said, reappearing at Agatha’s shoulder with the rest of the orange. “I did all the work, <em>and </em>she already married me.”</p><p>“You’re both idiots,” Agatha scoffed as she handed Wanda a glass and set the fruit on the bedside table. Rio resumed her place at the end of the bed, fingers finding Wanda’s arch again, pressing with slow, careful rhythm.</p><p>For a few minutes, the room was quiet. Just Wanda’s breathing, the faint city noise outside the window, the sound of Rio methodically working tired muscles.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the wall beside the window and let herself watch them.</p><p>Wanda, messy and furious and somehow still beautiful under the exhaustion. Rio, ridiculous and kind, and entirely hers, head bent, hair falling into her eyes as she concentrated on easing someone else’s pain.</p><p>This was what they had talked about in their first apartment, back when the idea of a townhouse and a baby and a spare room had felt like a fantasy. A patchwork family. Their own strange version of security. Before Wanda’s boyfriend had turned tail and bolted when she’d told him she was pregnant. She’d appeared on their doorstep hours later, mascara running and eyes panicked. Then their plan had changed. </p><p>“Thank you,” Wanda said eventually, voice muffled. “For letting me invade your house. And your life. And your couch. And your pantry.”</p><p>Rio snorted. “We've been invaded by far worse things than you.”</p><p>Wanda pulled a face at that. “Gross”</p><p>“Speak for yourself,” Agatha said. “I’d let Rio invade me anytime she wanted.”</p><p>“Oh, I do so like some invasion,” Rio said. “It’s my favorite type of occupation. I’d invade you all night lo–.”</p><p>Wanda cracked one eye open and interrupted. “You two are disgustingly in love, fuck you,” she said.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to retort, then closed it again.</p><p>Rio looked up, caught her eye, smiling her stupid, crooked smile.</p><hr/><p>It was two forty-three that morning, the three of them sprawled on various surfaces in the new living room, when Agatha heard it. </p><p>A soft, wet sound. Followed by Wanda whispering a very serious, very grave, very quiet,<br/>
“Oh no.”</p><p>Agatha sat upright instantly. Rio did not. Rio jolted awake so quickly she fell off the couch, flailing at the throw blanket tangled around her legs.</p><p>“What happened? Are you dying? Am I dying?” Rio demanded.</p><p>Agatha flicked on the lamp.</p><p>Wanda sat on their couch, both hands spread over her stomach, staring at the dark stain beneath her.</p><p>“My water broke,” she said. “On your couch. I’m so sorry. I’ll buy you a new one. Well, no I won’t. Agatha buys very expensive things. I’ll name the babies after the couch.”</p><p>Rio made a strangled sound of alarm. Agatha was already on her feet.</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha said. “Forget the couch, Wanda, where is your hospital bag?”</p><p>“By the door,” Wanda said. “Unless I moved it. Did I move it. Oh god. Is this a contraction? I can feel my bones opening. Am I supposed to feel my bones opening?”</p><p>Rio spun in a panicked circle. “Do we need towels? Boiling water? Scissors? Wait no, that’s movies. I don’t know what’s real. Baby, what do we do? Tell me what to do. Give me a job.”</p><p>Agatha pointed at her. “Shoes on. Jacket on. Keys. Now.”</p><p>Rio nodded and bolted from the room.</p><p>Agatha crouched in front of Wanda, gripping her hands. “Look at me. You’re fine, honey. You’re early but not too early. Just do your breathing, with me.”</p><p>Surprisingly, Wanda actually did it without argument. She inhaled and exhaled with Agatha, brows drawn tight, sweat already collecting at her hairline.</p><p>Rio returned with the keys, one shoe on, one shoe in her hand.</p><p>“I can’t find the other one,” she said. “Should I go barefoot. I’ll go barefoot. I don’t care. I can run faster barefoot.”</p><p>“Hand, sweetheart, and you’re not running anywhere,” Agatha said. “We need you carrying the bag, and the shoe is in your hand, sweetheart. You do some breathing too, please.”</p><p>Rio grabbed the bag and nearly dislocated a shoulder with how hard she hauled it up. “Why is it so heavy? What did you pack? Are we also fleeing the country tonight?”</p><p>“Four outfits,” Wanda gritted out. “You think I’m letting anyone photograph me in a hospital gown.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said.</p><p>When the next contraction hit, Wanda gripped Agatha’s forearms and swore in what sounded like three languages. Agatha held steady, face calm, voice low and even.</p><p>“Wanda, just keep breathing. Look at me, and keep breathing through it.”</p><p>Rio watched on with wide eyes. They got Wanda into the back seat. Rio sat with her, one hand gripping the headrest, the other letting Wanda squeeze her fingers into pulp.</p><p>The drive was sixteen minutes. Rio cried for seven of them. Wanda screamed once, loudly, at a red light. Agatha didn’t need to break the speed limit, but she considered it.</p><p>At the hospital, everything blurred.</p><p>Nurses. Forms. Bright lights. Wanda clutching her wrist so tightly that Agatha thought the bones might fuse. Rio trying to be brave until someone mentioned dilation and she visibly turned green.</p><p>Hours passed in uneven increments. Shouting, laughing, crying. Wanda threatening to have Agatha sue the entire maternity ward if they didn’t get her an epidural immediately. Rio pacing, babbling nervously at a midwife who kindly ignored her. Agatha being the anchor, the calm voice, the steady hand Wanda reached for every time the pain crested. By hour two, they had thoroughly confused the entire ward as to who was whose parent or prospective parent.</p><p>When the babies finally arrived, the world went very quiet.</p><p>Two tiny boys. Red faced, and furious at existence, lungs full of righteous indignation.</p><p>Rio cried harder than all of them put together.</p><p>Wanda sob-sighed in relief, head falling back. Agatha held Billy first, mostly because the nurse simply placed him in her arms and Agatha didn’t have the capacity to protest. His body was impossibly small, impossibly warm, his breath soft against her chest.</p><p>Something inside her cracked open.</p><p>Rio looked at her, eyes wet, lower lip trembling in a way Agatha had only seen twice in her life: once when she had been told her aunt had died, and once when Agatha said I love you for the first time.</p><p>“You look perfect,” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, eyes fixed on the tiny human tucked against her.</p><p>“This is terrifying,” she said softly.</p><p>Rio leaned in and kissed her forehead.</p><p>“I know,” she murmured. “But we said we’d do this, Wanda is relying on us.”</p><hr/><p>The townhouse woke up slowly, sunlight creeping through the high brownstone windows. Somewhere deeper in the hall, one twin began squealing, and the other immediately copied him. Then a thud. Then Rio’s voice, low and amused.</p><p>“Okay, okay, one at a time. Gentle hands, remember? Gentle–oof–Tommy, that is the opposite of f– gentle–”</p><p>Agatha groaned into her pillow and rolled onto her back. Her body ached in the strange, pleasant way it always did after a night spent beside her wife, even if the boys had inevitably climbed into their bed at some point during the early morning after terrorising their mother. Sure enough, a small sock was still wedged under her thigh. She flicked it to the floor and stretched.</p><p>Rio’s laugh drifted down the hallway again, high and bright and entirely unbothered by the chaos. That sound had been the soundtrack of Agatha’s mornings for three years. Since Wanda moved in with them, just after they had been married, since the twins were born.</p><p>She pushed herself up, grabbed her robe, and padded barefoot toward the kitchen.</p><p>The smell of pancakes hit her first. Rio’s perfect pancakes, fluffy and golden and smelling faintly of vanilla. Rio was at the stove, apron on, hip popped, spatula in hand, hair sticking out in five different directions. Underneath her apron, she wore an old gray shirt with holes in the sleeves and a pair of boxer shorts, hanging low on her hips. Objectively unfair, given how distractingly good she looked doing absolutely nothing.</p><p>Two small boys were climbing her like she was a bouldering wall. Tommy clung to her leg, Billy sat on the other, arms curled around her calf like a tree trunk.</p><p>“Ag!” Tommy squealed when he spotted her. “Ag, hungry!”</p><p>“You’re always hungry,” Agatha said, amused. She leaned down, kissed the top of his wild hair, then ruffled Billy’s curls as he giggled into Rio’s knee.</p><p>Rio glanced over her shoulder, grinning at Agatha. </p><p>“Morning, beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha attempted nonchalance and failed. “You look like you’ve been attacked.”</p><p>“I have been attacked,” Rio said solemnly. “By your nephews.”</p><p>Billy shoved his face into her leg and squealed again. Rio didn’t even flinch, just reached down with one arm to steady him.</p><p>Agatha crossed to the counter and inspected their coffee machine. She ground the beans with precision, tamped them perfectly, and locked the portafilter into place. </p><p>“They’re your nephews before noon, sweetheart.”</p><p>The machine hissed approvingly.</p><p>“Look at you,” Rio said from the stove, flipping a pancake one-handed while Billy clung to her like a koala. “Domestic goddess.”</p><p>“Don’t patronize me,” Agatha said. “I can operate a coffee machine.”</p><p>Wanda shuffled into the kitchen right then, red hair a chaotic halo, wearing an oversized T-shirt that read <em>don’t fucking test me before coffee</em>. She stopped and sniffed the air dramatically.</p><p>“Good morning wives, what died in here?”</p><p>“My patience,” Agatha said. “Apparently.”</p><p>Wanda blinked at her. “You’re… making coffee?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said sharply, as the machine released a perfect, golden shot. “Against all odds.”</p><p>Rio leaned over Wanda’s shoulder, still balancing Billy on her hip. “I’m fairly convinced that she’s been pretending she can’t cook so I’ll do everything for the last five years.”</p><p>Agatha glared at her. “I am capable.”</p><p>“You made ‘toast soup’ once,” Rio said. “You boiled bread.”</p><p>“That was one time,” Agatha hissed.</p><p>Billy patted Rio’s thigh. “Funny,” he pronounced.</p><p>The kitchen settled into its usual morning chaos.</p><p>Wanda was attempting to corral her sons into chairs, whilst Tommy evaded her, determined to scale the counter. Rio flipped another pancake with one hand while steadying Billy with the other, and Agatha sat at the table assembling fruit on the twins’ plates with the precision of someone negotiating a treaty.</p><p>After he was deposited in a chair, Tommy immediately tried to launch a blueberry to the floor.</p><p>Agatha caught his wrist mid-air. “You little gremlin.”</p><p>“Not a gremlin,” he insisted. “I’m Tommy.”</p><p>When she looked up, she caught Rio watching her, in the soft way that Rio often watched her, the way Rio always watched how Agatha gently flicked Tommy’s nose, or how she'd pull Billy into her chest and bury her nose in his hair. The way she smiled more easily around the boys than she ever did around anyone else.</p><p>Rio’s expression held a warm, stunned affection. </p><p>Wanda noticed it, too. She flicked her eyes between them, sipped her coffee, and muttered, “Disgusting. Both of you. Keep it away from my children.”</p><p>Rio winked at her. “They’re one third my children, really, and I can’t help it, <em>look </em>at her.”</p><p>Wanda threw a dishtowel at her. “You’re lucky your pancakes don’t suck.”</p><p>Billy gasped. “Mama, no bad words!”</p><p>Rio pressed a hand to her chest. “You heard our tiny dictator. Show some respect.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “She has no respect to show.”</p><p>Wanda reeled back, scandalized. “Wow. Traitors. The both of you. I thought we were a united front.”</p><p>Agatha took a dainty sip of her coffee, unbothered. “We are,” she said. “Against you.”</p><hr/><p>The stairs to Wanda’s new place were narrow, crooked, and absolutely not designed for five-year-olds or for the amount of furniture Wanda insisted she could “carry herself.” Which meant Rio carried it. And Agatha supervised Rio carrying it. </p><p>“Careful with that!” Wanda yelped as Rio maneuvered a dresser through the too-tight doorway.</p><p>“I <em>am</em> being careful,” Rio said, bracing a shoulder against the frame. “You said this thing was ‘light.’ You lied.”</p><p>“It <em>is</em> light,” Wanda insisted, one hip cocked, hair pulled into a lopsided bun. “For someone with actual muscles.”</p><p>Rio shot her a betrayed look. “I have excellent muscles. How dare you. No wonder we’re divorcing you.”</p><p>Agatha snorted behind them, a stack of throw pillows in her hands. “Wanda. Please don’t antagonize the only person strong enough to carry your boxes. Rio, sweetheart, we’re not divorcing anyone.”</p><p>Wanda stuck out her tongue. Rio shoved the dresser the final few inches into the bedroom with a grunt.</p><p>Downstairs, the boys were “helping,” which meant racing plastic trucks across the empty living room and occasionally shouting instructions at each adult as if they were foremen on a construction site.</p><p>Billy barreled into Agatha’s legs the moment she reappeared.</p><p>“Agatha! Look! My room!” He pointed proudly at the tiny corner bedroom Wanda had painted a soft sea-blue.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, smoothing his curls. “It is a room. Well observed.”</p><p>Tommy ran past them with a superhero cape stuck in the back of his shirt and no intention of slowing down. “Aunty Rio! Come see!”</p><p>Rio sighed, dropped her tool bag, and let herself be dragged away by an overexcited five year old.</p><p>Agatha watched them go, warmth pooling in her chest.</p><p>Wanda came up beside her, holding a roll of tape. “We’ll be fine,” Wanda said softly, answering the thing Agatha hadn’t even voiced yet.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha said. And she did. Wanda was ready for this. The boys were ready for this. They’d be fine.</p><p>It was Agatha who maybe, quite possibly, wasn’t ready.</p><p>The boys had been about to turn five when Wanda came to them one evening, hands twisting in the hem of her shirt, eyes bright. She told them she’d saved enough for a two-bedroom apartment around the corner, close enough that Agatha and Rio could see the boys whenever they wanted, far enough that she and her sons could start building something that was just theirs. </p><p>Agatha and Rio had protested immediately, insisting that the townhouse was Wanda’s home as much as theirs, that the boys and Wanda had always belonged here. But Wanda had only smiled, soft and certain, and said, “It’s time. They need to know what our life looks like when it’s just us.” </p><p>By late afternoon, everything was inside. Shelves half-built, boxes in arbitrary piles, curtains still in bags. Wanda leaned against the doorframe of her new kitchen, head tipped back, exhausted and glowing with pride.</p><p>“I did it,” she said. “We did it.”</p><p>“You did it,” Rio corrected as she handed Wanda a bottle of water. “We merely intervened to prevent catastrophe when necessary.”</p><p>Wanda smiled at her. Then her eyes softened, landing on Agatha.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said, quietly. “For… everything.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once, tears creeping into her eyes, unable to trust her voice.</p><p>The boys flung themselves at both of them for hugs, sticky, loud, full-bodied goodbyes. Tommy’s arms around Agatha’s neck, Billy clinging to Rio’s shirt like a koala. Wanda nearly cried watching it happen.</p><p>“Okay, go,” she said, wiping her eyes. “If you stay any longer, <em>I</em> won’t let you leave.”</p><p>Rio laughed as she set Billy down gently. “Text us if you need anything. Honestly. Anything.”</p><p>Wanda hugged her one last time, then Agatha, holding on a beat too long.</p><p>When they finally stepped outside, the street was quiet. Late-day light pooled gold over the brownstones. A soft breeze moved the leaves.</p><p>It should have felt peaceful.</p><p>But the townhouse around the corner suddenly felt very far away, and very empty.</p><p>Rio exhaled, heavy in a way Agatha wasn’t used to hearing from her.</p><p>“It’s going to be too quiet without them,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha looked at her. </p><p>Rio wasn’t sad, not exactly. Just a little undone. Just a little unanchored by the sudden absence of small feet pattering across their floors. Wanda and the boys had been their chaos, their noise, their constant company for five years.</p><p>Agatha reached out like second nature, without needing to think about it. She threaded their fingers together.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, barely, but Agatha felt it in the shift of her hand, the way her thumb paused before brushing lightly over Agatha’s knuckles.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was soft. “We’ll still see them every day.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said. “It’s just–” She inhaled, looking down the street toward Wanda’s new windows. “They made the house feel full.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand. “It’s still full, baby.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her in the slow, warm way she always did when she was caught off guard by affection she didn’t expect.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio murmured. “It is.”</p><hr/><p>A series of tiny glimpses, a rapid-fire echo of everything they were. </p><p>Rio dragging Agatha through the house, mouths fused together in passion.</p><p>Agatha patching Rio’s split knuckle with delicate, trembling hands.</p><p>Rio asleep on the couch, Agatha curled under her arm, face pressed to her heartbeat.</p><p>Rio rocking a newborn Billy to sleep in her arms, hips swaying to the beat of the radio. </p><p>Agatha sitting on the loungeroom floor, Rio behind her braiding her hair with soft, sure fingers.</p><p>Rio pulling Agatha into her lap during a thunderstorm.</p><p>Agatha whispering something against Rio’s throat that made Rio smile like she might burst.</p><p>A decade of quiet devotion. A decade of ease. A decade of choosing each other without question. Always choosing each other.</p><hr/><p>It was late afternoon, the golden sun slant cutting across the living room and turning the hardwood floor into warm liquid. Agatha stood at the dining table sorting through briefs, the quiet hum of home settling easily around her: the sound of traffic outside, the kettle clicking as it cooled, Rio somewhere down the hall humming under her breath.</p><p>A normal evening, a safe evening at home.</p><p>Until Rio walked in.</p><p>Not loudly, or dramatically. Just… wrong. Her breathing was too shallow. Her steps were too soft. Shoulders tight in a way Agatha didn’t recognize.</p><p>Agatha looked up immediately. “Baby, what’s going on?”</p><p>Rio stopped a few feet away. Hands stuffed into her pockets. Eyes avoiding hers.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said, just her name, voice thin around the edges. “I–there’s something I need to tell you.”</p><p>A cold, instinctive current ran down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>She set her papers down. “Okay, so tell me.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, bracing herself. “I got an offer.”</p><p>Silence. Agatha waited for the rest, nodding slowly.</p><p>Rio swallowed. “A job offer. In London. A… a big one. Research director in a climate policy think tank. It’s sort of… everything I’ve ever worked for.”</p><p><em>Everything</em>.</p><p>The word echoed, dull and heavy.</p><p>Agatha kept her face neutral. “Okay, when did they approach you?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, that hesitation was the fracture. A small, nearly invisible crack, but Agatha felt the tremor of it all the way through her ribs.</p><p>“I, uh–” Rio looked down. “I applied, actually. A while ago. A few months ago.”</p><p>The world did not fall apart, it simply… flattened into a dull gray.</p><p>An old and familiar numbness swept through Agatha, smooth and absolute, like something in her chest executed a controlled shutdown.</p><p>“You applied months ago,” Agatha repeated, flatly, her own voice sounding unfamiliar.</p><p>Rio winced. “Sweetheart, I should have told you. I know I should have. I just– I didn’t want to disappoint you. I didn’t think anything would happen. And then when they reached out, I panicked. I didn’t know how to say it without making it sound like I was choosing–”</p><p>“Rio, are you taking it?” Agatha cut in with a surgical calmness.</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped up, startled by the tone. “I… I don’t know yet. No. We have a life here. I haven’t even responded. I wanted to talk to you first.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, mechanically, body on autopilot.  </p><p>This was the moment she’d always feared, Rio being offered the life she deserved. The one Agatha was certain she would eventually resent her for not having.</p><p>The thought bloomed like poison.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said quietly.</p><p>Rio took a step toward her, hand outstretched. “Honey, wait, can we just–”</p><p>Agatha stepped back. Not far, just enough to put distance between them.</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Agatha forced a breath. “Thank you for telling me,” she said, polite enough. “I appreciate your honesty.”</p><p>Rio’s face crumpled like tissue paper. “Agatha, please don't shut down. Don’t go somewhere I can’t reach you.”</p><p>But Agatha was already gone. Inside, at least.</p><p>The switch had flipped. The armor was sealed.</p><p>And Rio, in her devastating sincerity, noticed. Her voice broke. “Talk to me, baby. Please.”</p><p>“I’m thinking,” Agatha said.</p><p>Lie. She wasn’t thinking.</p><p>Rio’s voice was a threadbare whisper. “I don’t want to lose you.”</p><p>Something inside Agatha twisted sharply, then folded in on itself. She kept her expression still, steady and unbearably calm.</p><p>Rio tried again. “We can try distance,” she said desperately. “London isn’t Antarctica.”</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha heard herself say. “That sounds good.”</p><p>Rio blinked. Hope flickered across her face so naked and bright that it made Agatha’s stomach drop.</p><p>“You’d really consider that?” Rio asked, stunned.</p><p>Agatha nodded. Her head moved through the lie easily, far too easily. </p><p>Because the truth was she would consider anything if it meant Rio didn’t look at her like that. If it meant delaying the moment Rio realised she should choose the life she deserved.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said. “Of course.”</p><p>Rio exhaled shakily. She stepped forward, hands gentle on Agatha’s waist, searching her face like she wanted to commit every freckle, every piece to memory.</p><p>“God,” Rio murmured, voice breaking on the word. “You’re… I don’t even know what I did to deserve you.”</p><p>The numbness inside Agatha pulsed hard when Rio kissed her.</p><p>Not their usual kiss. Not hungry or teasing or confident.</p><p>A soft, careful kiss. Slow enough that Agatha felt her own heartbeat stutter against it.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>Rio cupped her cheek, thumb grazing the skin just under her eye, and pressed another kiss to her mouth, even softer than the first.</p><p>Agatha kissed her back, automatically, and just as gently.</p><p>She wondered if Rio could taste the panic she was swallowing.</p><p>When Rio finally pulled back, she rested their foreheads together for a breath.</p><p>“We’ll figure it out,” Rio whispered. “You and me. We always do.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and said nothing.</p><hr/><p>Wanda showed up a few days later unannounced.</p><p>Agatha had just gotten home from work, jacket still over her arm, hair pinned back but escaping at the edges. The living room was dim except for one lamp. She had not turned on the overhead. The big light was only ever to be touched in extreme emergencies.</p><p>Wanda opened the door and let herself in, without waiting for a greeting.</p><p>“Agatha, what the fuck are you doing?” she said. No preamble. No warm-up. Absolutely no foreplay. “You’re shutting down.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled slowly. “Hello to you too, dear. So long between visits?”</p><p>Wanda crossed her arms and stared at her with a level, razor-sharp calm. “Cut the bullshit. She told me about the job.”</p><p>Agatha froze, just slightly. Of course Wanda saw it.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said softly. “Talk to me.”</p><p>“There is nothing to talk about,” Agatha replied. “It is a good opportunity for her. It’s an incredible opportunity for her.”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth tightened. “And what does that have to do with you acting all withdrawn and like a ghost in your own home?”</p><p>Agatha walked past her. Put her jacket on the back of the couch. Poured herself a healthy glass of wine she wouldn’t drink. Wanda followed.</p><p>“Agatha, you love her,” Wanda said quietly.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. The wine trembled in her glass. “Loving someone is not the same as being good for them.”</p><p>“Oh for fuck sake,” Wanda snapped. “This again.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t rise to it.</p><p>Wanda stepped closer, voice gentler. “Agatha. Look at me.”</p><p>Agatha did <em>not</em> look at her.</p><p>Wanda tried another angle. “What did she say when she told you?”</p><p>“That she didn’t want to lose me,” Agatha said. Her voice was even. “That she loves me. That she wants to try.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes softened. “And you said yes?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And now?”</p><p>Agatha set the water down. She stared at her hands. Fixated on the gold of her wedding band and simple, emerald engagement ring. “She deserves someone who doesn’t hold her back.”</p><p>Wanda blinked. “Agatha. You don’t hold her back. She would choose you. She would choose this life. She has always chosen you.”</p><p>“That is the problem,” Agatha whispered. “She shouldn’t.”</p><p>Wanda stared at her like she had slapped her. “You <em>cannot</em> be fucking serious.”</p><p>Agatha kept going. “She applied months ago. She didn’t tell me. She hesitated because of me. My presence is already shaping her decisions. What happens when she starts turning things down. Missing opportunities. Regretting staying. Waking up one morning and realizing I was the one holding her back.”</p><p>“You are not holding her back,” Wanda said. “You’re her <em>home</em>.”</p><p>“Some people drown in homes,” Agatha said.</p><p>Wanda’s breath caught.</p><p>Agatha kept talking, her voice detached. “She is brilliant. She’s kind. Staggeringly capable. She will thrive in London. She can make real change. And I will <em>not</em> be the reason she looks back in ten years and wonders what she could have been.”</p><p>Wanda felt her throat close. “Agatha... don’t shut her out. Don’t make a choice for her, or for you, don’t do something that you can’t undo.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>Wanda reached for her wrist, gentle but firm. “If you want her, fight for her.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked up, finally. They were tired and empty, distanced.</p><p>“She deserves someone better, she has always deserved someone better” Agatha said quietly. “I’m not worth the trouble.”</p><p>Wanda’s breath went unsteady. “What if you look back in ten years and regret it?”</p><p>Agatha stepped back. </p><p>“There’s nothing else to do, Wanda,” she said. “She’ll be happier without me, in the long run. I’m giving her the freedom she deserves.”</p><p>“That is <em>not</em> freedom,” Wanda whispered. “That is you once again martyring yourself for no reason other than furthering your own misery.”</p><p>Agatha’s face didn’t move.</p><p>Wanda closed her eyes for a long moment. When she opened them, she looked at her best friend of twenty years and saw someone slipping underwater.</p><p>“Please,” Wanda said. “You will regret it.”</p><p>In Agatha’s silence, the decision was already made.</p><hr/><p>The switch flipped quietly. Not in anger, or in fear.</p><p>In something colder and deeper, buried so far inside her it lived beneath her ribs, in the old, hidden insecurity she’d never outrun.</p><p>A clean, terrible numbness.</p><p>The next morning, she sat at her desk at the firm, eyes unfocused on a contract she could have drafted in her sleep. The city hummed beyond the glass. She no longer felt part of it.</p><p>By ten, she had her assistant pull the contact information for a family law attorney.</p><p>No one questioned why.</p><p>She met the lawyer that afternoon in a small conference room with beige walls and a box of tissues strategically positioned at the table’s center. The lawyer looked kind, which made everything much worse.</p><p>She went through the steps clinically, as if she were drafting someone else’s case. The date of marriage, “irreconcilable differences” as grounds, no-fault divorce petition.</p><p>She asked to keep the house and offered full buyout of Rio’s share. She declined requests for mediation or counseling. She signed the preliminary documents with a hand that trembled.</p><p>The lawyer paused. “Are you sure you want to proceed?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. </p><p>Two days later, she received the finalized filing draft on her desk.</p><p>Her signature went at the bottom.</p><p>Her hand shook so violently she had to steady her wrist with her other hand to make the line of her name legible.</p><p>Her phone buzzed at that exact moment.</p><p>A text from Rio lit up the screen.</p><p><em>Can I grab you on your lunch break? I miss you. We can meet at our cafe?</em></p><p>Agatha stared at the message until the words blurred.</p><p>Then she turned the phone face down.</p><p>She didn’t reply. Her phone glowed again.</p><p>Rio: <em>Baby, everything ok? Want me to pick you up after work?</em></p><p>Agatha sat perfectly still.</p><p>That night, Rio got home a little later than usual.</p><p>Agatha heard the key in the lock at 6:42 p.m. She knew the exact time because she had been staring at the clock on the wall for the thirteen minutes since she’d got home, listening to the second hand mark out every choice she was about to make.</p><p>The townhouse was too tidy. The cushions were aligned. The coffee table was bare except for the neat stack of paperwork in the center and the coaster under her glass of water. The lamp in the corner cast a warm circle of light that made everything look gentler than it was.</p><p>She sat on the couch, perfectly straight, hands folded in her lap. If she didn’t move, if she stayed very still, she could pretend she was preparing for court. That this was just another argument with a clear outcome and a clean exit.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>“Hey, sweet,” Rio called, voice bright and a little tired. “Boys made it home alive. Billy beat me at basketball again. I think you are rubbing off on him. He <em>heckles</em> me now.”</p><p>Her bag hit the usual spot by the door. Keys in the tray. Jacket over the chair. The familiar rhythm of the life they had built over a decade.</p><p>Agatha’s heart pounded.</p><p>Rio walked into the living room, loosening the top button of her shirt with one hand. She stopped dead when she saw Agatha on the couch.</p><p>Something in her face shifted. The easy smile faded, replaced by wary curiosity.</p><p>“Hi,” she said quietly.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, but she couldn’t speak. </p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to the coffee table.</p><p>The stack of documents sat there, precisely aligned. There was a pen placed on top. Rio stared at it for a second too long.</p><p>Her eyes flicked back up. “What’s this?”</p><p>Agatha felt her spine lock. “Sit down, Rio.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move. “Agatha.”</p><p>“Sit, love,” Agatha repeated. “Please.”</p><p>The <em>please</em> came out wrong, raw around the edges. Rio heard it, her shoulders rose and fell as she took a slow breath, then she walked over and sat at the far end of the couch, leaving a polite, unfamiliar space between them.</p><p>Up close, Agatha could see the faint creases at the corners of her eyes from long days. The way her collar was slightly crooked. The tiny smudge of ink on her thumb.</p><p>Home, she thought. And then, viciously, she boxed the word up and shoved it somewhere deep.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Rio asked. Her voice was careful now. “You’ve been quiet for a couple of weeks. Did something happen at work?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head once. “This isn’t about work.”</p><p>“Then what?” Rio asked. Her eyes flicked to the papers again. “Because I’m getting a little freaked out by the murder-energy and the paperwork.”</p><p>Agatha reached for the stack. </p><p>“I’ve been speaking to a lawyer,” she said.</p><p>Rio’s face went still.</p><p>Agatha kept her gaze on the papers. It was easier than looking at the woman she loved. “I think it is time we stop pretending. I think we should try to finalize a divorce before you leave.”</p><p>Silence shattered through the room.</p><p>For a moment, Rio genuinely looked like she had not understood the sentence, brows pulling together in confusion. Her brain seemed to reject it. Then her cheeks went a frightening sort of colorless, all the warmth draining at once.</p><p>“Pretending,” she repeated slowly. “Pretending what?”</p><p>Agatha forced herself to meet her eyes. It felt like peeling off her skin.</p><p>“Pretending this still works, or it will work,” she said. Her tone was clinical, perfect. “You have a new job in London. A whole career. It doesn’t make sense to drag this out or complicate matters. We should make a clean break before you move.”</p><p>Rio blinked. Once. Twice. Her hands flexed on her knees like she couldn’t quite figure out where to put them.</p><p>“What do you mean pretending this still works, Agatha?” she asked. </p><p>Agatha swallowed. The numbness rose.</p><p>“It’s the logical choice,” she said. </p><p>Rio laughed. It was a small, disbelieving sound that held no humor at all. “Logical,” she echoed. “You’re talking about logic. You said we could make it work. That we’d try the distance. We just talked about this a few weeks ago.”</p><p>“And I reevaluated,” Agatha said. “It's not feasible. We would be clinging to something that's already ending. Finalizing everything now will be easier for both of us.”</p><p>The words tasted like poison. She pushed through them anyway.</p><p>Rio stared at her like she was trying to see past the mask. “Stop, love,” she said quietly. “Don’t talk to me like I am a client. What is this really? What’s going on?”</p><p>“I told you,” Agatha said. “I spoke to a lawyer. The paperwork is ready. My offer is to buy out your share of the house. We can divide the rest of the assets fairly. Split the accounts. There’s no need to fight over any of it.”</p><p>“No need to fight,” Rio repeated. “You’ve got divorce papers in front of me, but no need to fight.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers curled into fists. “Don’t do this,” she said. Her voice wavered on the last word. “Agatha, please. What did I do? Tell me what I did. What do I need to do to fix it?”</p><p>“You did nothing, and there’s nothing you can do,” Agatha said. She was proud of how evenly it came out. “That’s the point.”</p><p>Rio flinched like she’d been slapped. “Don’t say that. Do <em>not</em> act like this just happened naturally. You know that’s not true. You don’t get to decide it is over.”</p><p>Agatha kept her eyes on the coffee table. On the date printed in the top corner of the form. On the neat black ink of her own name where it should never have been.</p><p>“Rio, I am trying to make this as simple as possible,” she said. “You leave for London, very soon, I might add, with nothing tying you here. No unfinished business.”</p><p>“I don’t want that,” Rio said. Her voice was rising now, panic scraping at the edges. “Baby, I’m not choosing a job over you. I would never do that.”</p><p>“You already did,” Agatha said.</p><p>The lie slid out smooth and devastating.</p><p>Rio stared at her. “What are you even talking about?”</p><p>“You applied without telling me,” Agatha said. “You got the offer and hesitated, not because you didn’t want it, but because of me. You’ve already been twisting yourself in knots around my existence. This way, you won’t have to.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, hard. “You can’t be fucking serious. I didn’t tell you because I wanted to consider it, think about it before I scared you. I hesitated because I <em>didn’t </em>want to hurt you. Agatha, you are my whole world. I want to be where you are. Please.”</p><p>“Regardless,” Agatha said. “This is happening.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. “You’re lying,” she said. There was no venom in it, just raw, stunned hurt. “I know you’re lying. Look at me. Look at me and say you don’t love me. Tell me that this is what you want, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped to her own hands.</p><p>They weren’t folded anymore. Her nails were digging crescents into her palms. Tear tracks shone faintly along the sides of her fingers where she hadn’t even felt them fall.</p><p>She closed her fists.</p><p>“Love isn’t the issue,” she managed. “Compatibility is. I want this, Rio.”</p><p>Rio let out a sound that was almost a laugh and almost a sob. “You are ending our marriage over something as insignificant as this? Agatha, we can work through this.”</p><p>Her chair scraped quietly as she pushed herself forward. She moved down the couch, closing the distance Agatha had built like a barricade, until she was directly in front of her.</p><p>Then she slid off the cushion and onto her knees on the rug.</p><p>“Baby,” she said, and this time her voice truly broke.</p><p>Agatha’s whole body wanted to reach for her. To grab her face in both hands and say I’m sorry, I’m wrong, stay, go, I’ll follow you, of course we will try, we should always try. </p><p>She didn’t move.</p><p>Rio’s hands hovered just above her knees, fingers trembling like she was afraid to touch her and more afraid not to.</p><p>“Please,” Rio whispered. Tears were spilling freely, tracking down her cheeks, catching on her jaw. “Please don’t do this to us. We can figure it out, we always do. We can try and see how it feels. I’ll fly back every month, every weekend if I have to, I don’t care. We’ll find a way.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the top of Rio’s head.</p><p>She could see the familiar part in her hair, the faint silver beginning near her temple, the place where Agatha’s fingers always landed first when she was tired and wanted comfort without asking.</p><p>Her own vision blurred.</p><p>She pressed her tongue hard against the roof of her mouth to stop anything from shaking loose.</p><p>“Rio,” she said. It came out flat, like a stranger using her wife’s name.</p><p>Rio lifted her head. Her eyes were red and wet and blazing with desperate hope.</p><p>“What am I going to do, please,” she asked. The words tumbled out, unplanned, ruined. “What am I supposed to do without you?”</p><p>Agatha couldn't answer.</p><p>Because if she spoke, even once, she would take it all back.</p><p>She would say stay, I love you, don’t go, I am terrified, and I don’t know how to live without you either.</p><p>So she looked at the wall behind Rio instead and let the silence stack up between them like bricks.</p><p>It was the worst thing she had ever done.</p><p>The cruelty wasn’t in any insult or raised voice, it was in the absence. In the withdrawal of every soft thing she had ever given Rio. In the deliberate, careful withholding of comfort, because she had convinced herself that ripping the bandage off would heal cleaner.</p><p>After a long, shaking moment, Rio’s shoulders slumped.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered. “Okay, sweetheart. I understand.”</p><p>She pushed herself up from her knees, unsteady. Her hands brushed her thighs, wiping away tears in a motion that was nearly angry.</p><p>She stared down at the paperwork on the table for a second, then at Agatha.</p><p>“You want the house,” she said. Her voice had gone quiet and hoarse. “Fine. Take it. Take anything you want. It is just walls. They’re just things.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat burned.</p><p>Rio’s mouth twisted. “I’ll sign whatever you want, Agatha. I’ll give you whatever you want. You know that. You have always known that.”</p><p>She walked to the door on legs that weren’t entirely solid. At the console table, she grabbed her keys with fingers that fumbled twice before closing.</p><p>“I’m going to go to Alice’s,” she said. </p><p>Agatha didn’t tell her not to. She didn’t say let me drive you. She didn’t say stay and we’ll talk when we’re calmer, we’ll figure it out.</p><p>She sat very still and watched the love of her life put her jacket on with shaking hands.</p><p>Rio paused with her fingers on the doorknob.</p><p>Without turning around, she said softly, “For what it is worth, I have never once regretted choosing you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes slammed shut.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>Then it closed, gently, and the townhouse fell silent.</p><p>She reached for her left hand.</p><p>Her rings dug into her finger, a familiar, comforting weight.</p><p>Agatha slid them off.</p><p>Her skin felt naked without her engagement ring and wedding band.</p><p>She set them on top of the papers, stared for a long, furious moment, then picked them back up and closed her fist around them until the metal bit into her palm.</p><p>Eventually, she stood, turned off the lamp, and went upstairs to a bed that suddenly felt too big, too cold, too quiet.</p><p>She lay on her side, eyes open, staring at the space where Rio should have been.</p><p>She had wanted to save Rio from resentment, from regret, from the weight of a life she thought she didn’t deserve.</p><p>Instead, she had given her the one thing she had sworn never to cause another person.</p><p>Abandonment.</p><p>Agatha didn’t cry. She stared into the dark and listened to the echo of Rio’s voice in the hallway.</p><p><em>What am I supposed to do without you.</em></p><p>She didn’t have an answer.</p><p>She just knew she would wake up in this house the next morning and continue to pretend, for everyone else’s sake, that this had been the logical choice.</p><hr/><p>Six months later, Agatha was colder.</p><p>Not visibly, and not in ways anyone would comment on. Her suits were still immaculate, her posture perfect, her voice controlled. She showed up, she delivered, she excelled.</p><p>But she didn’t laugh, not really.</p><p>The loss of Rio had settled in her bones like winter, like ice threaded through marrow. A quiet, permanent ache, a constant stillness that felt like frostbite.</p><p>And the world went on.</p><p>Emails. Court filings. Meetings that blurred into one another. Wanda checking on her too often. Jen dropping off food she claimed Alice “accidentally” made too much of. The twins hovering with an anxious, adolescent protectiveness that made Agatha both want to hug them and flee the continent.</p><p>Agatha stayed busy. She was fine.</p><hr/><p>Across the ocean, Rio stood in a tiny rented flat with peeling wallpaper. Half-unpacked boxes stacked in corners. A small kitchen she loathed. A narrow bed she never quite slept through the night in.</p><p>Her work badge hung on a hook by the door. She’d smiled in the photo, forced and tired. It hurt to look at.</p><p>The work was good, it was the kind of work she’d always dreamed of doing.</p><p>But some evenings she would sit on the edge of her bed, hair scraped messily back, forehead pressed to her palms, breathing like she was holding herself together by the thinnest thread.</p><p>Every once in a while, her thumb brushed the empty place on her ring finger.</p><p>On her last day in Boston, before her flight, she had walked to the townhouse. Stood at the foot of the porch steps for a full minute, unable to go further.</p><p>Then she’d taken out a small unmarked envelope and slipped it into the mailbox slot. </p><p>Inside sat her wedding ring.</p><p>She didn’t include a note. Words felt useless.</p><p>She flew out that afternoon.</p><p>Agatha knew what it was without needing to open it.</p><p>She had taken it upstairs. Walked into her study. Opened the bottom drawer of her desk, the one she never used, and placed the envelope at the very back next to the box where her own rings sat.</p><p>She closed the drawer.</p><hr/><p>The announcement came in late spring, a year after their divorce had finalized.</p><p><em>Harkness, Greene &amp; Meyer LLP.</em></p><p>A new plaque on the door. A bouquet from the board. Champagne in the conference room. Everyone congratulated her.</p><p>Agatha smiled exactly the right amount. Accepted the handshake from the senior partners. Gave the expected speech. Went back to her office and drafted two motions in silence.</p><p>Precision had always been her armor. But now it was also her companion.</p><p>She had stopped being updated about Rio somewhere around month four. Wanda had tried with gentle mentions, small check-ins, murmured updates about London, but Agatha had looked at her with such bare, frigid finality that Wanda never brought it up again.</p><p>She didn’t cry.</p>

<p><span>So the next fault line cracked open.</span></p><p><span>It started small.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tried to blend back into the edges of the party, the way she always did when she had met her social and emotional quota for the night. She handed Wanda back her untouched plate of cake, ignored the searching look she got in return, and slipped sideways toward a darker strip of wall near the end of the bar.</span></p><p><span>Music swelled as the DJ changed the track to something faster. People started to dance again. Jen had abandoned all semblance of composure and was now feeding Alice cake with her fingers.</span></p><p><span>It was chaos.</span></p><p><span>Agatha flattened herself against the wall and tried to pretend she was part of the architecture.</span></p><p><span>It might have worked if Rio had not followed.</span></p><p><span>Again, she felt her before she saw her. A proximity shift. The air nudging around her. She tried to pretend she didn’t, took a sip of the wine she didn’t want and focused on a framed print on the wall that she remembered Alice losing her mind over when she’d won it at auction.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice found the space between her vertebrae.</span></p><p><span>Agatha closed her eyes for half a second, then opened them again. “You really do make an excellent shadow, my love.”</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed out a humorless breath. “And you really do work fast in those heels.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha turned her head.</span></p><p><span>Rio stood a step away, hands in her pockets, shoulders set. Her expression was controlled in the way Agatha recognised from old fights. The way she used to look right before she said something she had been holding back for days.</span></p><p><span>“This is nothing,” Agatha said lightly. “I’ve seen you chase down a bus in boots. Barefoot, even.”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t do that,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>“Do what.”</span></p><p><span>“Make jokes to dodge this.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “I’m not dodging anything. I’m here, at Jen’s party, doing my best impression of composed ambivalence.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re not doing it well, and you’re shaking,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fingers tightened around the stem of her glass. “I’m cold.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s seventy degrees in here,” Rio said. “You’re not cold.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. “God, I forgot how annoying you are when you act all high and mighty, and think you know me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes flashed in frustration. “I don’t think I know you. I do know you.”</span></p><p><span>They stared at each other, the noise of the party a dull roar around them.</span></p><p><span>Agatha broke first. She pushed away from the wall. “I should find Wanda. Or Jen. Or literally anyone else.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped into her path.</span></p><p><span>“Move,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio replied.</span></p><p><span>“<em>Rio</em>.”</span></p><p><span>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</span></p><p><span>Their eyes locked. It was a stalemate.</span></p><p><span>“You can’t keep running from me every time you think it’s going to hurt,” Rio said quietly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed once, hollow. “You think this is about you.”</span></p><p><span>“I know it is about us,” Rio said. “You’ve been storming away from me all night like you’re running from fire.”</span></p><p><span>“You followed me,” Agatha said. </span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Rio said. “I followed you. Because I am done losing you. I’m sick of it. I’m not willing to do it anymore.”</span></p><p><span>Something in Agatha snapped at that. It twisted hot in her chest.</span></p><p><span>“You didn’t lose me silently,” she said. </span></p><p><span>Rio flinched. “You filed for divorce. Not me.”</span></p><p><span>“I remember,” Agatha said. “But thank you for the reminder, hon.”</span></p><p><span>“You decided unilaterally that our marriage was over,” Rio said, voice rising for the first time. “You decided it was done and then you wouldn’t even discuss it with me. That was it. You signed the papers and you shut every door in my face. You just threw me away, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s throat closed. “Don’t overdramatize it, I didn’t throw you away.”</span></p><p><span>“The hell you didn’t,” Rio shot back. “I begged you. I tried to talk to you for days, weeks, afterwards, and then you fucking blocked me.”</span></p><p><span>A couple brushed past them, laughing and oblivious. The lights felt too bright, too hot on Agatha’s skin.</span></p><p><span>Agatha set her glass down on a nearby ledge. Her hand was trembling. She balled it into a fist.</span></p><p><span>“I thought I was protecting you,” she said. “From being tethered to someone who would hold you back.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stared at her like she had grown a second head. “You weren’t protecting </span><em><span>me</span></em><span>. You were protecting yourself.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s laugh came out sharp. “Of course I was trying to protect myself. Have you met you? Have you seen what you are capable of? I watched you get offered the life you always wanted, one you </span><em><span>applied for,</span></em><span> Rio, </span><span>and I knew if I asked you to stay, you would either hate me, resent me or both. I couldn’t handle either of those things.”</span></p><p><span>“You didn’t ask me,” Rio said. Her voice was louder now, cutting through the noise. “That’s the point, Agatha. You. Did. Not. Ask. You didn’t give me the chance to talk to you about it. You didn’t even say, ‘I want you to stay.’ You just decided for me.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh please, I wasn’t going to beg you, it's beneath me,” Agatha snapped. “I couldn’t stand there and watch you pick London over me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stepped closer. “You didn’t even give me the chance to pick you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stepped back. Her back hit the wall. “You chose London the moment you applied for the job.”</span></p><p><span>Rio followed, hands still deep in her pockets like she was physically restraining herself.</span></p><p><span>“They asked me to apply, I never thought I’d get it. I never thought I’d go without talking to you first. I had only just been told when I came to speak to you. You think I wanted that job more than I wanted you? They practically drafted me, Agatha. My boss, he pushed me so hard. I didn’t seek it out to escape you,” Rio said, tears bright at the corners of her eyes now. “You think I’d want any of those things more than I wanted to be waking up next to you?”</span></p><p><span>“I think you deserved your life,” Agatha said. “I think you deserved everything you worked for, and I was never going to be the reason you didn’t take it.”</span></p><p><span>“You were my life,” Rio said. It came out raw. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest hurt. It ached and pulled. She put a hand there like she could press it back into place.</span></p><p><span>“I was dying without you,” she said quietly. “After you left, and I–, after I blocked you. I was dying and I didn’t know how to stop what I’d started. I didn’t know how to call you and say I made a mistake without feeling like I was asking you to give everything up all over again.”</span></p><p><span>Rio finally took her hands out of her pocket and reached for Agatha’s wrist.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tried to pull back, but Rio caught her anyway, fingers closing gently but firmly around her pulse.</span></p><p><span>“Look at me,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>“I am looking at you,” Agatha replied, eyes fixed somewhere around Rio’s collarbone.</span></p><p><span>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</span></p><p><span>There was something in the way Rio said her name that had always undone her. It still did. Her eyes snapped up.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s gaze was fierce and unflinching.</span></p><p><span>“You didn’t just end our marriage,” Rio said. “You ended my life without asking. You completely changed the course of everything I knew. You cut me out and you threw me away, and then you ignored every call, every message, every knock. Do you have any idea what that did to me?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath hitched. “I know what it did to me.”</span></p><p><span>“Do you,” Rio pressed. “Because from where I was standing, it looked a lot like you just moved on. More work, filled schedule, dates, according to Alice. A whole new life.”</span></p><p>Agatha yanked her wrist out of Rio’s grip. “No one ever stuck. No one stayed. No one was you. Is that what you want to hear? Is that the reassurance you need? That I didn’t move on. That I’m pathetic. That I missed you?”</p><p>“It’s not pathetic,” Rio said, voice cracking. “It’s the only thing keeping me sane right now.”</p><p><span>Agatha stared at her.</span></p><p><span>Tears blurred her vision, hot and humiliating. She blinked them away angrily. “I did what I thought was right for you. You don’t get to stand here ten years later and punish me for it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed once, broken. “I am not punishing you, sweetheart. I am standing here trying to understand why the woman who supposedly loved me more than anything in the world would rather divorce me than have one hard conversation.”</span></p><p><span>“It was not </span><em><span>one</span></em><span> conversation,” Agatha said. “It was a </span><em><span>thousand</span></em><span>. It was every single time you talked about your work, and I could see how much it meant, how if you had that opportunity you would already be gone. I</span><span>t was every time you looked at me like you were afraid I would ask you to choose one day, and you didn’t want to say no to my face.”</span></p><p><span>“I would never have said no,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>“You do </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> know that,” Agatha insisted.</span></p><p><span>“Yes, I <em>do</em>,” Rio said. She stepped closer again. They were almost chest to chest now. “Because I am telling you right now. I would never have said no to you. I would have stayed. I would have found a way to make it work. I would have picked you. I will always pick you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shook her head, tears spilling over. “I couldn’t ask you to do that.”</span></p><p><span>“You never have to ask,” Rio said. “You just have to tell me you want me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha made a wounded sound.</span></p><p><span>Her hands came up, curled into the front of Rio’s shirt before she realised she had moved. She clutched the fabric, dragging her a fraction closer.</span></p><p><span>“I have always wanted you,” she said. “Are you happy now? I have wanted you every day for ten years, and every day for the ten years before that. I have gone to bed wanting you. I have woken up wanting you. I have walked into empty rooms expecting to see you and I have felt stupid every single time. I want you so badly it hurts me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s breath stuttered.</span></p><p><span>Her hands lifted, hovering near Agatha’s hips, then settling there when it became clear Agatha was not going to let go.</span></p><p><span>“I never stopped loving you,” Agatha said. The words tore out of her, quiet and catastrophic. “Not for one fucking day.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s face crumpled.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, my darling.”</span></p><p><span>Her hands slid up from Agatha’s hips to her waist, then higher to her shoulders, then finally to her face. Her palms framed Agatha’s cheeks, thumbs sweeping away tears.</span></p><p><span>“Then why,” Rio whispered, “why did you do that?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s answer got lost somewhere between her lungs and her mouth. She swallowed, but nothing came out. Only a small, shaky exhale.</span></p><p><span>They were so close that Agatha could feel the shape of every breath Rio took. Her forehead tilted forward, Rio’s did too. They met halfway, f</span><span>oreheads touching, noses brushing.</span></p><p><span>The fight didn't vanish, but it shifted. Turned into something else, something that hummed under their skin, hot and filled with grief.</span></p><p><span>“I am <em>so</em> angry with you,” Rio whispered. Her thumbs stroked Agatha’s cheekbones like she was trying to memorize the shape of her. </span></p><p><span>“I know,” Agatha whispered back. “I’m angry with me too.”</span></p><p><span>“I should walk away,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>“You should,” Agatha agreed.</span></p><p><span>Neither of them moved. </span><span>Rio’s gaze dropped to her mouth.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breath caught.</span></p><p><span>“Rio,” she said softly, and the way she said it was not a warning at all. It was a plea. It was a beg.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in, just enough that their lips hovered a breath apart. The air between them went thin.</span></p><p><span>“Tell me no,” Rio whispered.</span></p><p><span>Agatha couldn’t do that, not anymore.</span></p><p><span>Her hands slid up, fingers curling into the back of Rio’s neck, holding her there.</span></p><p><span>That was the only answer Rio needed.</span></p><p><span>The first kiss in a decade was not soft.</span></p><p><span>Their mouths crashed together frantically, all teeth and breath and ten years of swallowed words. Rio pressed Agatha forward, back hitting the wall again with a muted thud. Agatha gasped into her mouth and then pulled her closer, one hand fisting in the front of Rio’s shirt like she wanted to rip it open, the other still anchored at her neck.</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her like she had something to prove. Like she was reclaiming territory that had never stopped being hers. Her hands slid down Agatha’s sides, settling at her hips, dragging her in until there was not an inch of space between them.</span></p><p><span>Agatha made a noise she didn’t recognise, and Rio swallowed it like it was oxygen.</span></p><p><span>There was nothing careful left. No distance or caution, just heat and the scrape of teeth, and the way Rio’s mouth had always fit over hers like they had been designed for it. Made for each other.</span></p><p><span>When they finally tore apart, it was only because a burst of laughter exploded nearby, too close, dragging the rest of the world back into focus.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s chest was heaving. Rio’s eyes were blown wide, lips flushed, hair mussed where Agatha’s fingers had dragged through it.</span></p><p><span>“We absolutely cannot do this here,” Agatha managed, voice thin.</span></p><p><span>“Then let’s not,” Rio said. Her voice was wrecked. “Let’s go home.”</span></p><p><span>“Where are you staying?” Agatha asked automatically.</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio said. “Home.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze.</span></p><p><span>The townhouse flickered in her mind so clearly it hurt. The narrow stairs. The crooked bookshelf. The bedroom they had painted together, laughing, streaked in blue because Rio had kissed her mid-roll and knocked the paint tray over.</span></p><p><span>“Do you still live there?” Rio asked. She already knew the answer. It was in the way she asked.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed. “Of course, I could never sell our home.”</span></p><p><span>For a second, everything went very quiet between them. The noise of the bar faded to a low hum.</span></p><p><span>Rio lifted a hand, brushed a piece of hair away from Agatha’s face with a tenderness that split something open.</span></p><p><span>“Call a car, or pull up the metro schedule,” she said softly. “Or I will. But I am not leaving here without you. I don't want to be anywhere without you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha had a brief, absurd flash of herself at twenty nine, insisting they never leave a party together early because it was rude.</span></p><p><span>“Jen will kill us,” she said weakly.</span></p><p><span>“Jen will survive,” Rio said. “She has cake. And Alice, Wanda and Lils. She’ll cope.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffed out a laugh that sounded too close to a sob. “We still need to talk.”</span></p><p><span>“We will, we’ll talk,” Rio said.</span></p><p><span>Agatha looked at her. </span><span>Then she fumbled her phone out of her bag with shaking hands.</span></p><p><span>“Fine,” she said. “We are </span><em><span>not</span></em><span> taking public transport.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled, small and ruined and radiant.</span></p><p><span>“Good,” she said. “You are far too precious for the subway, my love.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted despite herself, already tapping for an Uber.</span></p><p><span>By the time they stepped out the side door together a few minutes later, the car was three minutes away. The night air felt colder than it had before. Cleaner.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand brushed hers.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t pull away.</span></p><hr/><p><span>It felt like the car ride barely existed.</span></p><p><span>They slid into the backseat in silence, close enough that Agatha could feel the heat from Rio’s thigh, far enough that she could pretend she wasn’t affected by it. The driver asked something about music, Rio answered for the both of them. </span></p><p><span>Streetlights drifted over them in soft gold, then shadow. Agatha stared out the window, looking at the flashes of light as they shifted past. Her hands stayed clenched in her lap.</span></p><p><span>Rio shifted once, and her knee brushed Agatha’s. </span></p><p><span>Traffic had thinned with the hour, and ten minutes later the car rolled to a stop in front of her townhouse.</span></p><p><em><span>Their</span></em><span> home.</span></p><p><span>Agatha unbuckled, muttered a thank you, and stepped out before she could humiliate herself by reaching across the seat for Rio, like muscle memory demanded. The cool air hit her skin and didn’t help.</span></p><p><span>Rio followed seconds later. Always watching, too much like the woman Agatha used to wake up beside every morning.</span></p><p><span>On the porch, Agatha fumbled the key, just once, just enough that Rio noticed. She hated that Rio noticed.</span></p><p><span>The door swung open, and Rio stepped inside, then stopped dead.</span></p><p><span>Her eyes moved first to the bookshelf in the entryway. </span></p><p><span>The books she’d left behind. The cheap #1 Dad mug she’d pretended to love because Agatha bought it. Lilia’s sketch of them she'd given as a wedding gift, too-soft, too-happy. A framed picture from one of their trips that Agatha never replaced. The painting Rio bought with her first real pay check.</span></p><p><span>Every piece of a life frozen in place.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s breath caught. “You...kept everything.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stayed upright by force of will alone, hands in her pockets. “Yep.”</span></p><p><span>Rio turned slowly, voice soft but cracking underneath. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha let out a weak, humorless breath. “What would I have said, Rio? ‘By the way, here’s the museum dedicated to our failed marriage, now open for tours?’”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked, startled, a wounded laugh catching in her throat. “Agatha…”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pressed on, because stopping would’ve undone her. “I wasn’t going to erase you, Rio.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth parted, but no sound came out.</span></p><p><span>Agatha kept going. “You were the most important person in my life. That doesn’t just disappear because we were divorced. I couldn’t pretend you didn’t exist. It would’ve been like pretending I didn’t exist.”</span></p><p><span>Rio inhaled, sharp and shaky, like the words hit a place she didn’t have defenses for.</span></p><p><span>The room felt too small. All of it was too familiar.</span></p><p><span>Rio took a step toward her, and Agatha couldn’t move.</span></p><p><span>She raised a hand slowly, giving Agatha every chance to pull away.</span></p><p><span>Agatha couldn’t do that either.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s fingertips brushed the line of her jaw and Agatha’s breath stuttered hard enough that she had to close her eyes.</span></p><p><span>“Look at me,” Rio murmured.</span></p><p><span>She did.</span></p><p><span>It was a mistake, or fate, or both.</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in, slow, aching, waiting for permission, and Agatha gave it to her without moving; she gave in to her without thinking, without breathing.</span></p><p><span>Their mouths met in the softest possible contact. Just a touch, the whisper of a memory waking up.</span></p><p><span>Agatha inhaled sharply against Rio’s lips.</span></p><p><span>That was all it took.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand slid to the back of her neck and pulled her in. Agatha went willingly, almost violently.</span></p><p><span>The kiss deepened fast. Too fast. Rio kissed her like she was starving. Agatha kissed back like she was furious. Her fingers curled into Rio’s shirt, tugging her closer, needing her closer.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s breath broke against her mouth. “Fuck… love…”</span></p><p><span>Agatha made a sound she didn’t recognise. Low, desperate, and years overdue. She kissed her harder. Rio pressed her back against the couch with her body, hands braced on either side of her, not trapping her, just holding her exactly where she was meant to be.</span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped when Rio’s lips found the corner of her mouth, then her jaw, then the warm place just under her ear that had always undone her.</span></p><p><span>“Rio,” she said, voice shaking.</span></p><p><span>Rio froze, just for a second. As if that one word nearly brought her to her knees.</span></p><p><span>Then she kissed Agatha again. Deeper, slowly. Like she was relearning something sacred, someone sacred.</span></p><p><span>Agatha twisted her fingers into Rio’s hair, pulling her closer, wanting the weight of her, the heat of her, all of her. </span></p><p><span>They broke apart reluctantly, only when breathing became dire.</span></p><p><span>Rio rested her forehead to Agatha’s, air stuttering between them.</span></p><p><span>“I have thought about you every day,” Rio whispered against her mouth.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed hard, her voice barely there. “Don’t… You have not.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s true.”</span></p><p><span>“Rio…”</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed the corner of her mouth again. “Let me take you upstairs, please, let me take you to bed.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s pulse jumped so sharply she almost laughed at the absurdity of it.</span></p><p><span>“Upstairs,” she repeated, like she needed to hear the word to believe it.</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded once. “If you want.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t trust her voice. So she kissed her again, hard and decisive, fingers gripping Rio’s jaw.</span></p><p><span>Rio exhaled shakily into the kiss. They moved together, stumbling, breathless, hands on each other like they had forgotten how to exist without touching. Agatha barely registered the path through the living room, just the warmth of Rio’s hand sliding down her spine, guiding her, grounding her.</span></p><p><span>At the foot of the stairs, Rio paused long enough to look at her.</span></p><p><span>“Are you sure?” she asked softly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha reached for her shirt, curled her fingers into the fabric, and tugged.</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” she said. “Please.”</span></p><p><span>They barely made it to the bedroom. Agatha’s back hit the wall at the top of the stairs because Rio kissed her before she could even step inside. Hard and urgent, nothing careful left in her. Years of silence and distance collapsing in one devastating pull of Rio’s mouth.</span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped into the kiss, her hands flying up to Rio’s shoulders, then her jaw, then her hair, like she couldn’t decide what part of her she needed most.</span></p><p><span>Rio chose for her.</span></p><p><span>She grabbed Agatha’s hips and dragged her closer, pinning her to the wall with her body, her thigh sliding between Agatha’s. Agatha’s breath shattered. Her fingers dug into Rio’s shoulders hard enough that Rio let out a sound, low in the back of her throat, and ruined, like she hadn’t taken a real breath in a decade.</span></p><p><span>“Baby,” Agatha whispered, already breathless.</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed her again, deeper, stealing the rest of the air from her lungs. “I know,” she murmured against her mouth, voice broken. “I know.”</span></p><p><span>She kissed Agatha like she was water, like she’d never felt the relief of quenched thirst. Like the last ten years had been a punishment she was finally allowed to wake up from.</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t stand a chance.</span></p><p><span>Rio shifted, pressing her thigh higher between Agatha’s legs, and Agatha’s head tipped back against the wall with a soft thud and an involuntary moan that made Rio swear under her breath.</span></p><p><span>“Fuck… I missed that,” Rio said, kissing the corner of her jaw, her throat, the line beneath her ear. “Missed you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s knees wobbled. “Fuck, Rio—”</span></p><p><span>“Inside,” Rio whispered. “Now.”</span></p><p><span>She pulled Agatha into the bedroom by the hips, like she was afraid to break contact even for a second. The door clicked shut behind them, and the outside world was forgotten.</span></p><p><span>The room was dim, warm with the soft glow of a lamp. It looked the same as it always had, far too familiar, and Rio took one long breath with the feeling she was walking back through a memory.</span></p><p><span>Agatha opened her mouth to say something, anything, but Rio’s hands were already on her waist, under her blouse, sliding upward with slow, deliberate certainty that made Agatha’s entire body shudder.</span></p><p><span>“Love…” she breathed again, stumbling back until the backs of her knees hit the bed.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sank onto the bed without thinking. Rio followed immediately, one knee braced on the mattress, her hand sliding up Agatha’s ribs, charting the territory she’d memorized, lost, and was desperate to relearn.</span></p><p><span>Agatha arched into the touch, helpless. Rio’s mouth dragged down her throat, open and hungry, her breath hot against Agatha’s skin. “You don’t know how many times I wanted you, how much I need you,” she murmured. “How many nights I imagined this.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hands fisted in her shirt, tugging her closer, voice breaking. “My love, please—”</span></p><p><span>That did something to Rio, she pulled back just enough to look at Agatha. Her pupils blown, black covering the deep copper, her hair falling into her face, her breath unsteady.</span></p><p><span>“I missed you,” she said quietly, like she was saying it to herself more than to Agatha. “I missed you so much, it felt like I couldn’t breathe.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed. “Please, Rio. I need you now.”</span></p><p><span>Something in Rio snapped, or softened, maybe both. Her hands slid under Agatha’s blouse and over the skin of her waist, her stomach, her ribs, worshipful and greedy at once.</span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped when Rio’s thumb swept under the line of her bra.</span></p><p><span>Rio froze. “Tell me if you want me to stop, sweetheart, if it gets too much.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t hesitate, and she </span><em><span>definitely </span></em><span>wouldn’t stop it. She cradled Rio’s jaw in both hands and pulled her down into another kiss that answered everything.</span></p><p><span>Rio made a soft sound, and her hand slid higher, finally touching Agatha the way she used to, the way Agatha had dreamed of over a thousand sleepless nights.</span></p><p><span>Agatha arched under her, mouth opening to Rio on a gasp, the kiss deep and consuming, both of them pouring months of ache into it. Her hands were firm, possessive, sliding down Agatha’s back and gripping her hips to pull her closer.</span></p><p><span>Agatha moaned into her, melting, feeling the hard planes of Rio’s body everywhere their skin brushed. </span></p><p><span>Rio breathed, low and ragged. Her fingers worked at the buttons of Agatha’s slacks, each pop quickening the frantic beat of Agatha’s heart. When Rio’s hand slipped inside and brushed lace, Agatha gasped, clutching at her shoulders.</span></p><p><span>“This doesn't feel real, I can't believe you're here,” Agatha whispered, her voice a tremor. </span></p><p><span>“I'm real, and I'm here, my darling,” Rio growled. She dragged the slacks down Agatha’s legs in one decisive pull as Agatha trembled beneath her.</span></p><p><span>Rio pushed her further onto the bed, pinning her hips down with one steady hand. “Look at you,” she murmured, leaning close enough that her breath warmed Agatha’s throat. “So pretty for me.” She angled Agatha’s chin up, forcing her eyes to meet hers. “Please tell me you’re mine.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m yours,” Agatha breathed.</span></p><p><span>“Perfect. You’re perfect.” Rio kissed her neck, her collarbone, slow trails of heat mapping familiar terrain. “I missed you. Missed the way you fall apart for me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha whimpered. “Please, baby.”</span></p><p><span>Rio slid her hand between Agatha’s legs and slowly sank two fingers into her ex wife, giving her the time to adjust to the stretch as she choked on a moan. </span></p><p><span>“Like this?” Rio murmured, her thumb gently, barely circling Agatha’s clit.</span></p><p><span>“Yes, more—please—”</span></p><p><span>Rio complied, thrusting more deeply into her wife, her thumb pressing harder. Agatha’s hips met every movement, breath breaking into desperate little sounds.</span></p><p><span>“You’re so beautiful,” Rio whispered into Agatha’s neck, voice thick. “So hot around me. Wish I had our strap… wish I could fuck you until you’re shaking, until you can’t speak.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s nails dug into her back, her voice cracking. “My—I’m close—”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s rhythm sharpened, her voice a low command. “Come for me. Please, Agatha. Let me feel you come for me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shattered, crying out as her orgasm surged through her in fierce, rolling waves. Rio held her through the tremors, murmuring softly into her hair until she slumped against her, breathless.</span></p><p><span>After, they collapsed together, limbs tangled. Rio kissed Agatha’s forehead, her eyelids, her mouth, slow, tender.</span></p><p><span>“I missed you,” Rio whispered, voice cracking.</span></p><p>Agatha laughed breathlessly. “You’re so fucking sentimental.”</p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to give her a crooked, toothy grin, thumb brushing Agatha’s cheek. “Please,” she said. “Like this whole evening hasn’t been one long exercise in nostalgic sentimentality.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, b<span>ut she curled into Rio’s chest, letting herself sink into the familiar warmth.</span></p><p><span>Rio tightened her arms around her. “I’m not going anywhere, love.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha exhaled, her body softening completely for the first time in years. “Good,” she whispered into Rio’s neck. “Stay.”</span></p><p><span>They drifted like that, breaths syncing, and long after the room fell still, Rio held her close, whispering against her hair, “I love you.”</span></p><hr/><p><span>They didn’t leave the townhouse for all of Saturday.</span></p><p><span>Not because they were hiding, or because they had planned it that way. Just because every time one of them drifted more than five feet away, the other would reach out absently, like muscle memory, and pull them back in again.</span></p><p><span>They slept for a few hours at a time, tangled in blankets that had slid halfway off the bed. They showered twice, maybe three times, only because the steam felt good, the tile was cold and Rio kept laughing whenever Agatha tried to rub soap on every inch of her body. They cooked once, eggs that came out overdone because Agatha had been distracted by the way Rio had leaned back against the counter and had dropped to her knees, abandoning the stove. Mostly they drank tea and lived on toast and tender touches.</span></p><p><span>By Sunday morning, they were moving like both an old married couple, but also like two people who had just met, rediscovering each other in small, quiet ways. Agatha kept brushing her fingers along Rio’s spine as she passed behind her. Rio kept reaching out and twisting the ends of Agatha’s hair around her fingers, like she couldn’t quite believe she was allowed to touch her again.</span></p><p><span>It was a soft, gentle bubble. </span></p><p><span>Which is exactly when Wanda Maximoff launched herself into it like a wrecking ball.</span></p><p><span>There was a pounding at the front door, lending the energy of a landlord or upset witch.</span></p><p><span>Agatha froze mid sip of her tea and Rio looked up from her slice of toast as they stared at each other over the kitchen island.</span></p><p><span>The pounding intensified.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha Harkness, I swear to God, if you are dead inside this townhouse I am going to be so angry at you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio winced. “She sounds mad.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s her normal now,” Agatha whispered.</span></p><p><span>Before either could move, the front door unlocked. Wanda’s voice followed immediately.</span></p><p><span>“Coming in. I am covering my eyes. I am so sorry if you are fucking. I am so very sorry if you are fucking. You have exactly five seconds to put your bits away. I mean it. I am covering my eyes.”</span></p><p><span>Her footsteps moved through the entryway, hand plastered over her eyes. Wanda walked directly into the doorframe, swore under her breath, adjusted her hand, and continued her recitation.</span></p><p><span>“Still covering my eyes. Sorry if you are fucking. I do not want to see anything traumatizing. I cannot handle another </span><em><span>accidental observation of you fucking</span></em><span> incident, Agatha. Please do not let one of you be tied up on the couch again.”</span></p><p><span>She finally turned into the kitchen.</span></p><p><span>Agatha lifted her mug in cheers. </span></p><p><span>Both of them were in old t-shirts and underwear, hair tangled. </span></p><p><span>Wanda paused. Lowered her hand. Squinted.</span></p><p><span>“... Oh. Well. Look at that. I’m almost disappointed."</span></p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks warm as she began to open her mouth. Wanda’s eyes narrowed, and she raised one finger like a schoolteacher about to scold two eight-year-olds.</p><p><span>“Absolutely not. I do not want to know.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha's blush intensified. “Wanda, we can explain.”</span></p><p><span>“No. You cannot. I forbid it. I want zero information. Zero context. Zero detail.” Wanda waved the hand aggressively. “You two have been unreachable for over thirty six hours. I thought either an intruder killed you or that you had died of vitamin D deficiency. Scurvy, even. Maybe you did each other in, finally.”</span></p><p><span>Rio snorted. “We were a bit preoccupied.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda lifted her voice. “Again, I do not want to fucking know. Not a single detail. Not even a metaphor. Absolutely the fuck not.”</span></p><p><span>She reached over and began opening windows with unnecessary force.</span></p><p><span>“Air. You need it. You need water. You need sunlight. You need to go outside.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha and Rio traded a look that was walked the line between amusement and embarrassment.</span></p><p><span>Wanda clapped her hands sharply. “Get dressed. Both of you. We are going to Sunday brunch. Lilia has been texting me about mimosas for days. Jen and Al are already there and Alice is threatening to order for all of us. Move.”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked. “Brunch? Now?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes. Immediately. Before either of you decides to fall back into bed and disappear for another thirty six hours. I will not allow it. I will drag you by your hair if necessary.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised a brow. “You would not.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda grabbed a kitchen towel and whipped it at Agatha’s thigh. “Try me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio laughed, helpless to the scene playing out in front of her, and Agatha felt her chest loosen.</span></p><p><span>“Fine,” Agatha said. “Give us ten minutes.”</span></p><p><span>Wanda pointed at them in warning. “I will be outside. I will be scrolling on my phone. And I repeat, in case the universe did not hear me the first seven times, if you start fucking in the next ten minutes, I swear to God I will hex you both bald.”</span></p><p><span>She marched out and there was silence. Then Agatha looked at Rio. And Rio looked at Agatha.</span></p><p><span>Rio grinned. “She’s right.”</span></p><p><span>“About the bald hex?”</span></p><p><span>“About brunch. We need food, water and air.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha softened. “We should go.”</span></p><p><span>Rio touched her hand, grazing knuckle across fingers. “We should.”</span></p><p><span>They dressed, Agatha lending Rio some jeans and an old t-shirt that had definitely been Rio’s to begin with. They brushed their hair and teeth. They found jackets and shoes and stepped out into the pale afternoon light together.</span></p><p><span>Wanda was waiting with her arms crossed.</span></p><p><span>She saw them exit and nodded.</span></p><p><span>“Good. Now come on. Alice has already started ordering.”</span></p><p><span>And she herded them down the street like a tiny, furious shepherd, muttering under her breath about lesbians and irresponsible intimacy.</span></p><p><span>So Agatha bumped Rio’s shoulder, and Rio bumped back.</span></p><p><span>Neither of them stopped smiling.</span></p><p><span>Later, when Wanda, Jen and Alice had finally peeled off and the street was quiet again, Rio laced their fingers together.</span></p><p><span>“Can I come home with you?” she asked, simply.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s throat tightened. She nodded once. “Okay, I’d like that, yeah.”</span></p>
