    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Pop icon and lead singer of Sisters of the Craft, Agatha Harkness is the epitome of too cool for you, especially when it comes to Lady Death, rockstar and one half of the rock duo The Court, who just loves to antagonize Agatha unprovoked.
      <br/>
      Lady Death who is also her wife.

      A story in three parts, followed by a series of epilogues because why not

     <span>
      Morning comes too soon.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She isn't getting any younger.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groans, sitting up in bed. There's a bottle of painkillers and a glass of water by her bedside table. Her phone lays on the floor, where it dropped after she failed to turn off the alarm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This tour is killing her. But at least she is back home for the last part. She has missed her bed, sleeping next to her wife and waking up to the sounds of her family starting their days, always ahead of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She can just make out the sound of laughter coming from downstairs, the kids must be up already, eating breakfast and talking about their plans for the break.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She will join them as soon as she gets rid of her headache. They understand the life of a pop star is hard, but they know she would give it all up for them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Motherhood has changed her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha had promised herself, when they adopted Billy, that she would make sure her kids would have every opportunity available to them, and most importantly they would always have her support.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her time, lately has been harder to achieve.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But she is working on it. Family is worth putting in the time and the work. The one thing she learned from her mother, or despite her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She gets out of bed and jumps in the shower, deciding to erase any and all thoughts of Evanora Harkness before she goes to join her family.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy and Nicky are finishing cleaning after breakfast when she walks in. Nicky comes barreling into her as soon as he notices her and she picks him up. At five years old he's beginning to be too big for this, so Agatha treasures every chance she gets.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky begins to talk excitedly about the morning, from helping with breakfast to how excited he is for going to the music festival today. That's when Agatha notices Billy hasn't come say good morning yet, he keeps his back to her, almost purposefully.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Awfully suspicious.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Billy,” she calls and he hums in acknowledgement but doesn't move. Agatha stifles a laugh and puts Nicky down. What did he do now, and also where is her wife? She's the usual suspect. “Teen,” she calls him, like every other time he's being specially teenager-y, which she finds greatly amusing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy turns, slowly, an excuse already at the tips of his lips. He stops when she laughs at the sight of his face and motions for him to come closer so she can inspect him.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      His usual heavy eyeliner look has been replaced by face paint in black and white, making him look like a lost member of Kiss. Agatha pats his cheek and chuckles. He's grown to be too much like his mama, terrible influence that she is.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We need to get this fixed up. Where's your mama?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy deflates, “Oh thank God. I used this paint I got from the store yesterday with Eddie, he told me to just ask you guys but you got home so late and mama-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Slow down, kiddo. Go wash your face and we can brainstorm ideas for the next face paint, okay?” If this is gonna be a thing, a thing she blames her wife for entirely, she's gonna make sure he looks good at least, and also that he's using stuff that won't ruin his face. He has big dreams of following her footsteps.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      He nods, and leaves the room typing rapidly on his phone. Agatha watches him go and sits down on the table next to Nicky, who's been guarding her breakfast plate for her. He eyes the strawberries on her pancakes with a little too much attention.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “This is cute,” she comments, popping a strawberry into her mouth. The fruit had been arranged with the shape of a heart, “Did you help make this, bud?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky nods, and Agatha picks a second strawberry with her fork and passes it to him making plane noises.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      He giggles, taking the strawberry with his hands, “Mommy, I'm too old for this. I'm a big boy now”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nooo,” she stretches her words dramatically, and he laughs, covering her face with sticky strawberry hands. “You're my baby,”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky rolls his eyes, and Agatha will have a conversation with her wife about it. Speaking of which.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Where's your mama?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      While he thinks over what should be a pretty straightforward answer, she cleans his sticky hands with a napkin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nick”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes, mommy?” He says, his big brown eyes stare at her with mischief. Just like his mama.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Honey, I'm home,” her wife's voice comes from further in the house, like she was waiting in the shadows for the perfect moment to make her entrance. And in the second she looks away, trying to figure out where's she's coming from, Nicky has run out of the room.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha turns her interrogation to her wife just as she enters the kitchen, not giving her the chance to speak, “Explain”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Buenos días, hermosa,” Rio ignores her question and takes Nicky's vacated seat. She grabs Agatha's discarded fork and cuts her pancakes for her, then feeds it to her, “How did you sleep?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio,” Agatha swallows her pancakes. They're so good, but now is not the time to focus on her wife's culinary talents. She's got questions, and little answers, something is off, “What's going on?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her wife senses her discomfort, Agatha has never been one for surprises. Rio puts the fork down. “I would've told you yesterday, but you came home late and fell asleep halfway through the movie you insisted you wanted to watch with the kids”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I did want to,” she offers lamely, and Rio's eyes soften. Agatha would think is sweet if she wasn't still in the dark about whatever the hell is going on, “Now explain”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughs, interlacing their fingers together over the table. Suspicious.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, the band got called to cover a show tonight”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groans, beginning to see where this is going. “I'm playing tonight”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nods, “Yeah, the festival…me too?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Why does she frame it like a question, when it's obviously not, Agatha will never know. But fuck, today is not going up to plan.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She can't wait till her band hears about it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her band, Sister of the Craft, is closing their tour playing on back to back nights at music festival. It had been a last minute addition, a toss up between playing home or in New York, and Agatha sided with the festival just to be closer to her family. She could do back to back shows if she got to sleep in her bed every night.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had spoken to Rio about it, and then Billy and Nicky, and had gotten everyone tickets and VIP passes. Billy had been over the moon about it, he was going over a goth phase, for the past two years which Rio had pointed out made it not a phase, but some of his favorite bands were going to be playing at the festival too, so she had gotten tickets for his boyfriend, Eddie, too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Everything had been ready for today for months. And now this.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio's band.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She loved her wife, she really did.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But she hated her band.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It was funny, really. It hadn't started out that way.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Their bands were different. Sisters of the Craft had been a household name since the 90s, a band Agatha had founded with her nemesis, Jen, Lillia, who didn't like her most days, and Alice for the talent. They each were the best in their craft and had come together joined by their mutual desire to break it in the industry, and occasionally to one up each other, although that was usually her and Jen. They had decided who they were twenty years ago, and had stuck to that, unafraid to try new sounds but keeping their essence the same.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio's band on the other hand was…where her wife went with all experimental ideas. A place to try new sounds and experiment, like she hadn't been able to work as a songwriter and producer for other artists, for Agatha. The sound she had come up with was…interesting. Loud, dark, and just a hint of whimsy. Agatha could recognize Rio's talent and still be surprised by her success. It helped that Rio had created her whole artistic persona just to antagonize her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had also poached Alice right from under her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They had made a deal, when Rio decided to go on her little adventure and become a singer herself. Agatha was very private about her life, despite her very long career she barely spoke publicly about her family. Their marriage had been a secret for several years until she slipped up in an interview, which Rio found hilarious. So they had agreed they'd keep their professional lives separate from each other.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio had accepted gladly, too easily. Agatha had learned why three days later when Rio introduced her to Lady Death, and Agatha almost had a stroke.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Later, she would admit to herself the face make up was hot. Hot in a way only Rio could pull off.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She didn't tell Rio, nor did she have to. If the looks her wife always gave her when Lady Death came up in conversation were any indication.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      No one knew Rio was the lead singer of The Court, it was an industry secret only few were privy to, and they were both happy with that. It had never been an issue. They didn't move around the same circles professionally, and they had only even been mentioned to one another publicly on a couple occasions.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio loved to antagonize her as Lady Death, and Agatha, as the lead singer of Sisters of the Craft, avoided questions about it with all the grace of someone who knows she's better than the freak in full face makeup.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A freak she loves, but people don't need to know that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And now this.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For the first time both of them are playing in the same festival, on the same day.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her stress over the whole secrecy surrounding her morning dissipates. She's excited at the prospect of going head to head with her wife and coming out on top.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Yes, this isn't a competition, it doesn't have to be. What are they gonna compete about? Who can get more people to sing along? Who will be the talk of social media later that night? They will figure something out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She knows her wife.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looks up at Rio, her expression morphing from dread to a predatory smile. “You think you're ready for the big leagues, Vidal?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And her wife knows her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio's smug smile rivals her own. She picks up a strawberry from Agatha's forgotten pancakes and feeds it to her. “Baby, I've been bringing the big leagues to their knees every other day for years now, I think I've got this”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, every other day is it now?” She asks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Could be tonight,” Rio comments casually.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha leans closer, her hands quickly find their way to cup Rio's face. Her wife's smirk is too annoying, even now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm gonna enjoy wiping your stupid face paint off your face”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio's smirk remains undeterred, she uses Agatha's hold on her face to bring them closer together, nose to nose. “You promise?” She asks, and kisses her before Agatha has the chance to answer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha can admit she's a competitive person. She likes winning. The satisfaction of knowing she's the best, even if it's at something dumb, she wants it. Craves it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She's made it this far in her career out of spite, to prove everyone who doubted her she could do it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That kind of fire never stops burning. She hopes it stays that way forever. But her kids, her wife have softened her edges. She's found a place to put her sword down, and she likes it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She's not against some friendly fire, though. She likes Rio pushing her buttons even though she will never admit it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She enjoys no one knowing Lady Death is all hers, knowing she alone can see what's beneath the makeup.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This is what power feels like, she thinks. And she loves it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “OH MY GOD,” Billy's high pitched yell breaks them apart. Agatha pushes Rio off of her, slapping her hands as her wife laughs like this was somehow all part of her plan.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I hate you,” she mutters, before turning the two boys, “You too, conspiring with your mama-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “With whom you were being super gross with not five seconds ago,” Billy points out, “And she’s better than you at bribery”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And proud of it,” Rio admits easily. She takes advantage of Agatha’s shock to give her a quick kiss and stands up, herding the boys outside. “C'mon kiddos, gotta get you ready to show your support to the better band. Billy, you're already ready. Nicky, how do you feel about mama painting your face?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They're gone before Agatha can hear his response, but she can guess how that will go.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She trusts Rio though, she'll play Agatha's games, but she'll take care of her too, somewhere in the midst of it. When Agatha has gone too deep into win or die mode.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha!” Rio's voice carries through the house, and Agatha begins to follow it blindly. “Can you do my makeup? Your skills at drawing lifelike skulls are unparalleled, babe”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rolls her eyes, but follows her voice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She has to make her wife look hot for when she loses.
     </span>

      “You sure you don't wanna take a nap? Is gonna be a long night tonight”

      “Nick, my big boy, tell mommy what your mama’s planning”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      To his credit Nicky does think about it. But not five seconds later he wiggles out of her reach from where they are lounging on the couch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      He had gotten bored of Rio and Billy's face paint extravaganza soon after he got a pair of jolly Roger skulls painted on his cheeks and Agatha had picked him up and taken him away with the promise of watching his favorite movie and having a snack if he was a good boy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      No ulterior motives.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And no snacks with this attitude.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mommy,” he stretches the title dramatically, “You can't ask me that”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Oh so there is something being planned. “Why not?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky looks over his shoulder before moving back closer to her, he grabs her face with both his hands like he is about to tell her the most important thing in the universe, “Because, it's a secret, mommy”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Right. Yeah, no, that's brand new information. Rio is planning something. A secret something.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright, alright,” she says and pokes his nose. “Go take a bath you little traitor”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky giggles, scrunching up his nose, and she kisses his cheek before he runs off. Always running that one.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wash your hair too, there's chocolate syrup on it” she calls after him, following at a much slower pace. “Do you need help?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Noooo” Nicky runs past her in the hallway, and she turns around, following after him again. She preps the bath while he shows him her new toys they got for bath time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A pirate ship, a skull and a flower. He's already brainstorming a story for the characters, and she sits on the bathroom floor and listens carefully. She missed moments like this the past month. Sure, it was only four weeks, and she came home for three days half way through, but kids grow so fast. What did she miss? What was she not here to see?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mommy,” Nicky pokes her nose, bringing her away from her thoughts. “I'm ready for my bath now”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      He's holding the toys in his arms like it's his pirate haul, and she watches him throw them in the bath with a splash. He makes waves with his arms and the toys begin to bobble. Agatha smiles, he could stay like this all day if she doesn't stop him.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright, mister, this is a bath, remember?” He groans dramatically and nods. Agatha steps outside, “I'll be right outside okay, just call if you need help”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky doesn't answer, already too engrossed in his game.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She stands in the hallway, and listens to him play, the voices he makes for each toy, the little bits of storytelling he tells himself before splashing water. A storm, he calls it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      At times like this Agatha considers ditching the band and just staying home with Rio and the kids.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She would miss Lilia the most. Because Alice already ditched the band. The only thing she'd miss about Jen would be insulting her. They work like a well oiled machine, a creaky, at war with itself machine.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha will never admit she loves them. It didn't start out that way, but they're her sisters now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio sitting down next to her on the hallways floor is how she realizes she's sitting down on the hallway floor. Rio speaks before her pride can be too hurt about it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tired, mi amor?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not even a little bit,” but when Rio moves so they're  shoulder to shoulder, Agatha leans closer, her head on Rio's shoulder.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You sure you don't wanna take a nap? Is gonna be a long night tonight”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She is not necessarily saying it in any way that relates to the competition Agatha has decided their having in her head. But it does present an opportunity. She chuckles, “It will be, yes, and I will enjoy every second watching you lose”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Shit talker”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You like it”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shakes her head, and kisses her forehead, “I do. Is gonna make it much sweeter when I beat you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha doesn't answer. She could, she's got a list in her mind of why she's gonna win. But she enjoys the comfort of her wife's presence. She always feels more grounded around Rio and the kids. Like she doesn't have to be rock star Agatha Harkness, equally loved and hated, just like she likes it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With Rio she can just be.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her wife shifts to look at her fully. “You sure you're all good, babe? I can give you a massage if you want. I don't have to go for a couple more hours-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm good,” she assures her, “I'll take you up on the offer tonight when-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio kisses her, groaning against her lips. “You are the worst”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Old habits die hard. She laughs against Rio's lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sure she can be a little intense, maybe. Not the worst for sure though. To prove her point she kisses Rio a second time, sweetly, like they're not about to go head to head in a competition of their own making. Of her own making.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mommy! My skulls!” Nicky yells from the bathroom, and Rio is the first to get up. She offers Agatha her hand, “I'll take it. I'm the expert in face paint after all”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha doesn't point out she's better than Rio at it. Sure Rio is Lady Death, she wears the mask, but Agatha is often the one that puts it there, usually.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She takes her hand, before she steps into the bathroom and squeezes once, “Missed you,” she says, and shrugs like her confession is no big deal.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio leaves for the festival first. She plays before Agatha, and they were called to fill in at the last minute so there's a lot of work to get done, especially if she wants to have one of those dramatic entrances she likes. Billy tags along, the two of them whispering amongst each other in a way that's very little subtle and a lot suspicious.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They both stop talking when she approaches.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rude.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Drive safe,” she says, eyeing them intently for any slip ups.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy nods and climbs in the car, immediately picking his phone knowing his mothers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio looks over her shoulder and laughs. “Now that we're alone, we should make out.” Billy groans, and she laughs.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Stop antagonizing him”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why? You want it all for yourself ?” Rio's grinning, confident and assured. And dumb. Agatha wants to smack her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What are you planning, baby?” She asks instead, switching tactics. Her hands find Rio's waist and pull her closer, mindful of Billy in the car behind them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Lots of things,” Rio offers easily, “I'm thinking of a pyrotechnics show, and hear me out, when they go off it's shaped like my face. Alternatively they go off during your show and it reads ‘Lady Death rocks.’ What do you think?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha drops her hands from her waist and steps away, annoyed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio steps forward without missing a beat, “Hey, I love you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Love you too,” she mutters. Rio grabs her chin, making her look up, and waits. Agatha rolls her eyes, “I love you” And immediately pushes her hand away. “Now go or you'll be late, I'd hate to beat you because of your own incompetence”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio salutes and gets in the car. Agatha watches them leave, before going back inside the house.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Everything is ready for Sisters of the Craft show, she just has to show up in the venue for sound check in a while. Nicky is taking a nap, so she's left alone with nothing to do but wait. She's used to the restlessness, she's been doing this all her life. The hours that lead to the show feel the longest, especially now with Rio gone.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She turns the TV on and prepares herself a cup of tea to pass the time. Sharon, her manager, is gonna pick her up in a couple hours, once everything in the venue is prepared for her and her bandmates.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sits on the couch with her tea and prepares for the hours until it's show time to pass at a snail's pace. That is until Rio, or rather Lady Death shows up on screen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her wife always has too much fun in interviews. Agatha has never been to them live, with them not interacting professionally, but she can sense Rio's chaotic energy through the screen every time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She finds it insanely attractive.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Cup of tea forgotten, she turns her attention to the TV. Rio is in the artists lounge, her and Alice already in character,  being interviewed by a young journalist who seems to also be a fan if her excited high pitched voice is any indication.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, Lady Death and Knight of Wands, this is one of very few big shows you've done. Are you excited to play on the same stage as any other artists in particular?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio looks straight at the camera and smirks, “I'm excited for the chance to play against Sister of the Craft?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice snorts, shaking her head at her bandmate's antics.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Against?” The journalist asks, looking at Rio with the biggest heart eyes. Agatha hates her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We've covered some of their work before,” Alice explains, always the mediator. “But we've never had the chance to share the stage”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, well now seems like a great chance to get that off your checklists,” the journalist smiles, trying to get back to being professional and not under the spell of Rio’s charm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Only if we get Agatha Harkness to join us onstage and sing with us,” Rio comments, her smile macabre under her painted face. “But I don't think that'll happen”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha has been challenged before. By Rio on more than one occasion, but she won't take the bait this time. She's a pro, so she takes the high road and changes channels, already thinking of ways to get back at her wife.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That ends up being a great way to pass time. Plotting Rio's downfall. Sharon is picking her and Nicky up just as she's done texting the wardrobe manager for a change of outfit for the show. Sure Jen won't be happy, but Jen's happiness has never been high on Agata's list.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha and her band go over the soundcheck like the pros that they are. Lilia leaves first, to make the backstage rounds like she always does, she checks everything is where it should be and makes sure they're ready, she's the band's mom much to everyone including herself, chagrin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It leaves Agatha alone with Jen, who hasn't said a word since Agatha arrived five minutes late, because Nicky had been a traitor and decided to go backstage with Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So, Alice and her little freak crew are playing tonight, I'm sure you've heard” she emphasizes freak, looking pointedly at her, like Agatha would think she'd refer to anyone but her wife with that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I did, yeah”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen is, sadly, one of the few people who knows Rio is the lead singer of The Court. Like Agatha she shares a strong dislike for the band in a way that's hard to explain. She doesn't hate Rio, but they're not friends. Whenever Agatha has her bandmates over, Jen and Rio will bicker about anything from their work to the veracity of calling vegan foods by the name of the food they copy, and they will switch and share skincare tips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There's something about watching Rio and Alice on stage together, a mix of betrayal and awe at that what they've achieved together. The difference between her and Jen is that she thinks Rio looks hot on stage, the face paint, the dark dramatic clothes. She thinks it's because Rio is herself on stage, she covers her face in black and white and gray, but Agatha still knows it's her, and with Agatha watching, Rio is always putting on a show for her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The world is the stage for their own elaborate flirting ritual.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha stop looking like your thinking of fucking your wife right now”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rolls her eyes at her. This is how they communicate. This is what their…friendship…looks like.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, I'll go see where my freak is at,” she turns to leave, ignoring Jen's exasperated sigh and passes her mic to an assistant, who doesn't look either one of them in the eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      To him this is just another moment to prove her and Jen are two huge divas who drove Alice to leave the band, two big personalities fighting for the spotlight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is this how you two flirt?” Jen asks at her back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha doesn't stop walking, “Yes,” she drops over shoulder.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Later on, she's just done with hair and makeup for her own interviews when Alice finds her. She's out of her dark make up, looking more like her version of Sisters of the Craft.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, Agatha. What are you and,” she pauses, thinking over her words as they walk between all the people working the event, “What are you two playing at?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, its nothing, just a friendly competition, you know how she is”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I know how you are, too” Alice mutters, “She derailed our interview to get your attention”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I saw. Does that bother you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice shrugs, “Nah, we got our fans. And if anything it will get us more attention which means more fans”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And more press?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah” Alice seems more reluctant about that point in particular.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'll talk to her. Keep her on a short leash”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice chuckles, “Sure, Agatha”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Alice leaves, Agatha checks her socials trying to gauge Rio's damage that everyone seems to be reacting to. It takes her seconds to find the chaos her wife has created. She shakes her head laughing at the gifs and screenshots already circulating the internet.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lady Death proclaiming she wouldn't mind being the other woman in Agatha's marriage makes her chuckle, that's a conversation they've had before. She doesn't even need to see the full interview to know Rio said that with a straight face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “She's taken over the interview,”
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Alice jokes in a short clip, and Rio turns to the camera and declares
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       , “This is now my open microphone to air out all my controversial opinions”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha finds the screenshots all over the internet, but the one people seemed to have latched onto is that Lady Death thinks Sisters of the Craft should change their name to Mother, Maiden, Crone, and no, she will not tell which is which.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Looking at the different versions of people's rankings of the members of the band in said categories, she thinks Rio must forget Billy is old enough to be on social media now, and therefore, witness to the people theorizing over his mothers feud that's really just them being dramatic and flirting.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sharon comes to get her for the interview, and regretfully Agatha gives her phone to her manager. Best to avoid mistakes of the past, and goes to join her bandmates.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The journalist, thankfully not the same one from Rio's interview, seems professional enough, introducing herself and then the band. The first couple questions are acceptable. She asks about the tour, how they feel playing a festival after so long, but then she turns to Agatha with a nervous smile and she knows what's coming.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm sure you've seen The Court's interview by now,” the woman opens.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looks at her bandmates, leaving the answer to them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia shakes her head with a laugh, and Jen groans.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We have, yes,” she says when no one else will.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It's really set the stage for tonight's show. I think everyone will be watching. You guys are closing-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We are the bigger act,” Jen cuts the journalist off. She smiles then, fake sweetness like it's second nature. “We hope they can stay to watch, maybe they'll learn something”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The journalist nods, picking up on Jen’s sharp edge around the topic. She turns to Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha, Lady Death had a lot to say about you. Any responses”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckles, sitting back like this is amusing to her. And it is. Just not for the reasons they think. “Not really. Maybe if I had known The Court was playing I would've given my publicist the day off, but it was a last minute addition, right? I only found out this morning”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia gives her a look that says she's done with Agatha and Rio’s shit, but in a nice way…probably.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And what does your wife think of all the attention you're getting from Lady Death?” The journalist asks, and it's clear her own interview has derailed into her and Rio’s games. Agatha can't say she cares.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However the question is a conflicting one. She's never been asked about her wife and Lady Death, who are the same person, so she has to arrange those thoughts in her mind before she can answer without outing herself. Again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh she's enjoying it, for sure”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She looks at Jen surprised, her bandmate looks annoyed. It makes Agatha laugh, and thankfully the interview ends with no bloodshed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It's three interviews later that they're released. Thankfully the last two journalists don't ask about Lady Death's comment, but she thinks it has something to do with whatever Jen told her own manager in between breaks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio finds her as soon as she's stepping out of the room they've been using to change. She's still in her Lady Death get up, but Agatha can still read her expression.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What's going on?” she asks, she wants to touch Rio's face but she will ruin the make up, so she settles for putting her hands around her biceps instead.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Feeling me up already, huh?” Rio jokes, and Agatha wants to slap her but doesn't. Her wife is pouting. “Your fans are being mean to me online”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Aren't you supposed to be with the kids?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agathaaaa”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay, fine, but first I would like to remind you, I told you not to go on social media after being terrible.” Rio rolls her eyes, and this time she does smack her arm, “Now tell me what's happened”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “They said I'm a four”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nods, pouting dramatically like she's hoping it will make Agatha kiss her troubles away right here right now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      At home maybe it would work. But out here, backstage before a show, she's Agatha Harkness, leader of Sisters of the Craft, a known diva with a half terrible reputation to uphold.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What did they say about me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agathaaaa”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She doesn't budge, simply waiting.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Everyone knows your a ten,” Rio says matter of factly, and then adds, “I will fight anyone who says otherwise”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Good. Now go, you have a show to prepare for. I want you at your best when I beat you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio groans, “No kiss?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It will ruin my makeup”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Which is truth, and her wife knows it. Rio huffs a laugh, and steps away, she stops Agatha before she can leave, offering her a flower from her pocket.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “For you, mi amor”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha takes the flower, it's one the prop flowers Rio keeps in her pocket during shows to throw at the crowds at random times. Agatha is not sure why or how this became her signature move, but puts the flower in her pocket and sends her wife away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Put on a good show, I'll be watching”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio winks at her and leaves.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She finds Nicky with Jen and Lilia, he's got the whole table covered with his pencil and crayons and has somehow gotten both women to paint with him. As soon as he sees her he starts talking rapidly about everything he's seen, and Agatha sits down next to him and goes to grab a coloring page when Jen pasees her phone to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You two are the worst,” she says simply.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There's an image open, a picture of her and Rio backstage, from when they were talking just minutes ago. It's innocent enough, they're just standing with Agatha's hands on Rio's arm, she could either be pushing her away or closer, no one can tell. The caption reads,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       ‘be more like Lady Death and shoot your shot’.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sends the screenshot to Rio, and puts her phone down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well we'll have to give a show that will make everyone forget about Lady Death and The Court”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Finally you make some sense,” Jen nods, her expression intense, like she's about to-
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If you are gonna try to make us put our hands in the middle and say something dumb at the count of three I'm out,” Lilia says looking between them. She always acts like she's above the drama Jen and Agatha bring, but they know she loves them. Agatha to a degree
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky drops his pen and puts his hand in the center of the table, completely missing Lilia's point. Agatha would ignore just about everyone else's attempts at getting her into team spirit activities, but Nicky looks at her with his big brown eyes, and she puts her hand over his.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen and Lilia share a look, akin to a battle of wills.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm doing it for the kid, and only for the kid,” Lilia says, putting her hand down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Teamwork!” Nicky proclaims, no counting, no consensus on their chant.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Teamwork” Sisters of the Craft proclaim, with less excitement than him.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Be it for Alice, or for Rio, The Court is about to get a reckoning.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Since your-” Jen stops herself looking at Nicky, “wife made this public, why not up the stage on your little wager?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha thinks about it for about a second, “Yeah. What you got, Kale?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We let the people decide who got the better show. Lower buys drinks”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So I'm paying either way”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Exactly,” Jen smirks at her and turns to Lilia, “What do you say? See any good fortune in our future?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Lilia looks between her bandmates, looking tired already. She threatens with retiring half the time they're together. “Why not, make it interesting. We're playing either way, and your wife is a nuisance”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rude,” Agatha mutters covering Nicky's ears
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen types out the message and hits post before showing it to them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      @sistersofthecraft: @TheCourt since you insist on speaking about us, why not make a little wager. Let the people decide who has the better act, loser buys the drinks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha knows Rio, like herself, has been locked out of the bands social media accounts. Alice's response comes exactly three minutes later. Agatha imagines the three minutes long debate between the two. Rio for sure said yes immediately, Alice wanting to make a pros and cons list, before reaching the inevitable conclusion that they had no other choice but to accept.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      @TheCourt it's on.

      The Court is meant to take the stage two sets before Agatha, so she should be backstage keeping busy with mics and instruments checks, but they have Lilia for that. She finds Nicky with Sharon, her ever reliable yet irritating manager, who informs her Billy is already backstage.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Taking Nicky and the bag Sharon hands her, she heads off to find Billy so they can watch the show together. She finds Eddie already there, but no sign of Billy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Where did that boy go?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The show is gonna start any minute now. The stupid fog machines are already running, filling the stage in that eerie, thick haze.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Eddie, where's my son?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Eddie jumps when he hears her, and then looks at either side of him, like Billy will magically appear. “Uh…he should be here soon, Mrs. Harkness”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha narrows her eyes at the boy studying him for a moment, trying to gauge if there's something he's not telling. Eddie fidgets under her gaze, looking back awkwardly, like he might flee if he wasn't enjoying the festival.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “He better hurry or he'll miss the show,” she tells him, her tone laced with impatience.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Eddie nods, and Agatha shifts her focus away. She knows how loud Rio’s shows can get, she’s been to more than she can count, so she had Sharon pick up some noise-canceling headphones for Nicky. He spent most of the day with Sharon, decorating them with stickers. Now, as Agatha puts them on him, she spots a Sisters of the Craft logo on one side and Rio's painted face on the other.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The opening sounds of The Court’s show rumble through the air. Agatha gives Nicky a thumbs-up to check if he’s ready. He returns the gesture with a wide grin, bouncing with excitement as the stage lights flood the crowd in a green glow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy is gonna miss the show if he doesn't show up soon, and Rio will be all sad and mopey when she finds out, since the kids never go to her shows.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She'll allow him to miss the start. The Court's shows only start one of two ways. First dark fog creeps up from under the stage and then a single spotlight lands either on the piano, for Alice's melancholic solo, or on the drums where Rio will somehow make every beat sound eerily macabre. Occasionally the spotlight will reveal only Alice, before slowly panning over to the piano where Lady Death is sprawled in a dramatic pose.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha has a favorite opening, but she'll never admit it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Tonight's show starts with the piano solo, and as Alice's haunting melody fills the air, Agatha allows herself a brief moment to miss Alice's presence in Sisters of the Craft. She also wonders, not for the first time, how no one has yet realized Alice Wu Guliver is the Knight of Wands.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her thoughts quickly evaporate when a second spotlight illuminates the center of the stage where Agatha knows there's a trapdoor hiding an elevator.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      This is new.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nothing prepares her for the sight of Rio slowly rising from below, her body jerking and twisting in rapid, unnatural movements, imitating what Agatha can only assume is a corpse putting itself together.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Just watching it makes her back hurt.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a wicked grin, her Lady Death face shining under the white lights, Rio strikes a pose and laughs maniacally, and the show starts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha loses herself watching her wife in her element. She wonders if this is how Rio feels watching her play, proud and a little bit jealous. One day, she thinks briefly, they should share the stage.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio bounds around the stage for the first two songs, her energy is contagious and the crowd is loving it. Agatha should be plotting, she has a competition to win after all, and a son to hunt down, but Nicky's enthusiasm is contagious, and she allows herself to dance with him, holding his arms as he jumps up and down mirroring the way his mama moves on the stage.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As the second song wraps up, Rio catches a water bottle someone throws from backstage and turns to the crowd.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey everyone, I'm sure you know who we are now, but if you're new here, we're The Court,” she takes a swing, water dripping down her chin, and winks in Agatha's direction, immediately turning back to the crowd, “Now this show is gonna be different for two reasons number one, I'm trying to woo Agatha Harkness,” the crowd erupts, half laughing and half booing, and Rio's grin widens,“Secondly, my wife and kids are here, so let's make this one a family friendly show, yeah?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The music immediately kicks back and the crowd falls back under Rio's charm. It's a deliberate move from her wife, Agatha knows, to avoid people focusing too much on her playful taunt about chasing after Agatha Harkness while married. Never mind that she's actually married to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With the way Rio is working the crowd, Agatha is gonna have to step up her game. People will start talking as soon as the show ends, if they aren't already. She begins to draft a message in the Sisters group chat, but Nicky tugs at her arm and she looks up to see Rio has finished the second half of her show, which means Agatha is about to learn whatever her wife has cooked up for the closing song.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If I may have your attention,” Rio says, a smug smirk on her lips. She doesn't need to look her way, Agatha just knows that smile is for her. “I'm sure some of you already know I finally got the attention or my beloved”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice picks her own microphone and joins her in the middle of the stage, “it's been a long awaited moment, I'm sure, Lady Death”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You know it, Knight. She asked me for a drink, I think”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The crowd laughs at Lady Death's deliberate reinterpretation of what happened.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We had a little surprise planned out for you tonight,” Rio continues, keeping the crowd, and Agatha, wondering where this is headed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Alice nods, giving the crowd a sly ‘you'll never see this coming’ look.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Everyone give it up for our guest guitarist tonight: Wiccan”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha knows before he even appears.. Billy steps on the stage, holding the guitar she got him for Christmas, smiling a bit too widely for a show of The Court.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      He jogs to center stage where Rio receives him with a half hug, “Now, Wiccan here has been practicing a couple of our songs, but I'm about to throw him a curveball. Sound good?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      From her spot Agatha can make out Billy's expression of terror. That'll suit him for betraying her and playing with Rio. He nods, trying his best to hide his nerves.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah, ma-my uh Lady Death,” he stammers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughs, “Good answer, son. Showbiz is ruthless.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy's face softens. This is his mama talking to him now, even if just the two of them know it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And Alice. And Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Probably Nicky too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before Agatha can even wonder if Eddie knew, the music picks up again, and Rio addresses the crowd once more.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “For the first time, and probably not the last time, The Court brings to you: The Ballad of the Witches’ Road”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha is sure she’s gaping. It’s not a good look, but she can’t help it.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       That’s her song.
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Well, technically, Sisters of the Craft’s song. Their first big hit after Rio started working with them, and Rio wrote it. Agatha would throttle her if she wasn't so impressed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio's version is different. The original sound much darker and more haunting than the one that ended up on the Sisters of the Craft album. This is the version Rio had always preferred, the way she’d originally envisioned it. Agatha feels an equal mix of thrill and apprehension.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A quick glance at the crowd confirms her fear, they're loving it. The eerie, somber sound really suits the lyrics. Rio commands the stage, pushing Billy to let loose and enjoy himself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha meets her wife's gaze with an instant, as usual there's a lot of mixed feelings. She's both proud and jealous, impressed and a little bit angry.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nothing Rio can't fix.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When the song ends, the trio on stage receives a thunderous ovation and chants for an encore. Rio laughs, Lady Death waves her hands dismissively at the crowd.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Now that you know the better version, be sure to let Maiden, Mother, Crone know who's boss, okay?” Rio teases.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The crowd, divided in response to Rio's antics not long ago, now cheers at her unanimously.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It's been real, faceless crowd,” Rio says with a dramatic bow. Alice and Billy laugh and bow too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As soon as their back bastage, Nicky let's go of her hand and runs to Rio, who scoops him up effortlessly. She peppers his cheek with kisses until he laughs, pushing at her hands to make her stop, his giggles filling the air.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hangs back, watching as realization dawns on Eddie’s face, he hadn’t known. She beckons Sharon over, instructing her to serve the boy an NDA before the night is over. Only then does she meet her wife’s gaze.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio's wearing that annoying smirk on, the one that says she knows she's surprised Agatha, and left her reeling, plotting and planning. Agatha strides toward her, stopping just a step away before opening her arms. Rio steps in, and with Nicky between them, they share a laugh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The little boy plants a kiss on each of them and jumps off Rio's arms, eager to chase after his brother.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So,” Rio says, holding onto Agatha's wrists, preventing  her from leaving, “Thoughts on the show, mi amor?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hums, “You're treacherous, cunning, evil, a little crazy, too. It was fantastic, Rio”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio grin widens, pleased at all the praise. Because that's what all that was to her. “I'm glad you think so, because it was all for you”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I did notice a surprising lack of pyrotechnics,” she comments, not knowing how to respond even after years being married. Rio just laughs, and pulls her into a close hug, mindful of the people bustling around them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They head over to the kids, where Nicky is gushing over his brother's painted face, and Billy smiles nervously when he sees Agatha approaching.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What did you think?” He asks, looking so small, even at seventeen. She can still see the little boy she and Rio adopted so long ago, the real start of their family. Agatha finds she can't be mad at him.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You should be proud of yourself, Billy,” she sits next to him, draping a hand over his shoulder, and tousling his hair. “You were a pro out there. I'm glad I could see it, even though…” she throws a glare at yer wife, “I would've liked a heads up”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio rolls her eyes, already used to Agatha giving her that look, “Then it wouldn't be a surprise, baby. Besides you're just mad you didn't think of it first”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wants to argue, but she knows Rio’s right, so instead, she pulls her by the hand, tugging her down to sit on her lap. They stay like that until Sharon comes to take Agatha to prepare for closing the festival.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Any heads-ups for me?” Rio asks, following after Agatha, she keeps her voice low for the kids.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shrugs, faking nonchalance, “You'll find out when you need to, and not a second before then”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There's a glint in Rio's eyes, like she's up for the challenge. Agatha, stupidly finds that attractive, so she leaves before she does something dumb like kiss her wife in front or all these people.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she moves through the final preparations for the show, she feels the familiar energy coursing through her. She's been doing this for decades, but it never gets old. Her bandmates exchange knowing smiles. Rio might’ve put on one hell of a how, but Agatha has one last card up her sleeve.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The Sisters of the Craft step into the stage in total darkness, only the glow of the crowds' phones illuminate the scene, casting a faint light over them, and then the lights turn on. Agatha slips into her game face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They tear over their first two songs, feeding off the crowd's energy. The anticipation for whatever their planning in response to Lady Death's tauns is palpable in the air. The band feels different, Agatha has toured all over the world with them, only to find out tonight all they needed was a fire lit under them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She will not be thanking Rio for anything. Even if it turns out Jen is less obnoxious when they share the same goal.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sheds her signature blue coat, as the second song ends, throwing it to the side.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Now the show can really start.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She steps up to the mic, a smirk on her face “Goodnight, everyone. We're having fun, aren't we? I'm having fun,” she grins, keeping the crowd on their toes, “we've got a little surprise, for you and for The Court, although…it is not a surprise to them anymore”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The huge screen behind her flickers, switching from the Sisters’ logo to a live feed of the backstage area. There, two chairs are set up facing the stage, and in them sit Rio and Alice, looking far too relaxed for Agatha’s taste. Above them hang paper signs reading Thing One and Thing Two.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The two security guys, standing on either side of them, look more amused than imposing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha turns back to the crowd, her smirk widening, “We wanted to make sure our friends of The Court had good seats to see the real musicians play”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The crowd roars, clearly enjoying the rivalry, cheering as the camera zooms in on the members of The Court, Alice rolls her eyes, and Rio looks challenging at the camera before laughing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha watches her wiggle from her seat to reach her discarded coat. Rio sits back in her chair, the coat draped over her lap and points at Agatha cheekily, making a call me sign. The crowd dissolves in laughter, echoing the amusement on her face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright, then,” she speaks again, keeping her voice steady in the face of her wife's antics. “Let's show them how it's done”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen and Lilia share a look and the tree begin to play the intro to their version of The Ballad of The Witches’ Road. She can feel Rio's gaze on her, feels her eyes over her shoulder on the big screen. Agatha is too absorbed in the performance to let herself be tempted. This is a competition she intends to win.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They reach the end of the second verse and the lights suddenly cut, leaving the stage in darkness. Agatha can feel the electric anticipation of the crowd, like one held breath. When the lights turn on again all three members of the band have changed into their original outfits for the song, Agatha's black jumpsuit gleams under the lights, hugging her body. She knows that will catch Rio's attention, and as Agatha launches into the chorus a smug smirk emerges on her face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The crowd is in a frenzy as they finish the song, cheering and applauding them. Agatha risks a glance at the screen and catches Rio's gaze. Her wife's eyes are dark, her jaw clenched under the face paint, she's holding herself back by gripping the armrests of the chair.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha felt the win the moment the lights turned back on, but now she knows she's done it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sisters of the Craft say their goodbyes and make their way out of the stage, with the crowd still chanting their name. They hand out their instruments and equipment to the stage assistants, and Agatha is eager to get out of the spotlight. As she makes her way backstage she thinks everyone can tell how she feels.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio finds her before she has to go searching for her. Her eyes are wide with excitement, her voice low and a little rough as she speaks, “Damn, babe. I think I need a cold shower after that performance”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha can't help herself, snorting as her wife throws her arms around her, pulling her closer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You win, by the way,” Rio says, holding Agatha tightly and for longer than is probably appropriate for professional rivals.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha can't help herself. She doesn't care if anyone sees, she kisses Rio, and her wife hums against her lips before responding.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It's Rio who breaks the kiss, keeping it short and sweet even if that's the last thing either one of them wants. Agatha laughs, surprised by Rio being the one with self control tonight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Let's go get the kids, and go home,” she whispers leaning into Rio's touch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nods, but doesn't let go, “You need to use the jumpsuit for often,” she mutters, and Agatha laughs again. Gently stepping away from the hug she offers Rio her hand. Cautiously her wife takes it, and they go in search of the rest of the family.
     </span>

    <p>
     <span>
      Later that night, they're slouching on the couch exhausted. Nicky and Billy had finally gone to bed, not without fighting it and claiming not to be falling asleep the whole time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio still has her makeup on, smushed around the edges, where Agatha held her face to kiss her backstage.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha's changed into her comfy pajamas, while Rio is still in the clothes she put on after the show, a loose white shirt and sweatpants. Agatha can tell her wife is falling asleep, her head nestled comfortably against her neck.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They stay like that for a while, savoring the moment of peace after the long day they had. Rio mumbles against her neck, swearing she's not falling asleep, though her breathing betrays her, slowing and steadying. Agatha glances down to see her wearing a faint smile, a sleepy, contented look on her face. Without thinking she reaches for her phone and snaps a photo of them. She stares at it for a while, and makes a decision.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha uploads it before she can lose her courage, and she puts her phone away.

     Agatha wakes to the soft, insistent glow of her phone on the nightstand.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     The room is dim, the heavy curtains keeping the morning sun at bay, but the harsh light of the notifications cuts through the early stillness.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She groans, unwilling to leave the warmth of Rio. One of her wife's arms drapes heavily over her waist, the other tangled in her hair. Rio shifts, murmuring something incoherent against Agatha's neck.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha reaches for her phone, squinting at the screen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     An obscene number of notifications crowd her screen, and they keep coming.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Oh no.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The memories flood back in a flash. Last night, the concert. The performance. The kiss. And...the photo.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her stomach drops.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She’d acted on impulse, uploading that picture to her public account, her public account, with the caption practically daring anyone to misinterpret the situation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      @AgathaHarkness
     </strong>
     : in case there were any questions as to who was the wife.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha grimaces.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fuck, fuck, fuck. Of course I broke the internet," she mutters to herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio stirs behind her, mumbling, "What'd you break now, mi amor?" Her voice is still rough with sleep, but Agatha can hear the amusement creeping in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shoves the phone in her wife's direction. "This."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio props herself up on one elbow, squinting at the screen. As she scrolls, her sleepy confusion dissolves into a grin, a big, self-satisfied one that Agatha already hates.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Oh, you really did it now, baby. This is great," Rio says, voice practically dripping with glee.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pinches the bridge of her nose. "It was an impulsIve decision."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "No," Rio drawls, scrolling faster. "It was spite, and I love you for it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s grin grows impossibly wider as she reads the replies. "Look at this one 'Glamorous goth lesbian supremacy'? They're getting us, Agatha. Or this one: 'How is Lady Death married to Agatha Harkness when they’re clearly fictional nemesis come to life?' Oh, and my favorite: 'Daddy Death does it again.'”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha groans, already anticipating where her wife's mind is going, “Do not call yourself that”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Too late. The internet has spoken,” Rio leans against the headboard, smirking, “I think I'll update my bio: Daddy Death: rockstar, superstar, wife stealer”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Thats very repetitive, you're enjoying this too much,” Agatha says, throwing a pillow over her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Just the right amount,” Rio says, pulling the pillow from her face, she gestures her phone at Agatha where more notifications keep piling up, “Look, they love us. Babe, they ship us”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A new wave of dread rises, and she snatches her phone away, “Give me that”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The trending tags confirm Rio's words. Variations of #GlamAndGoth, #DaddyDeath and #MarriedToTheCourt are dominating across social media. Under each one a flood of memes, fan edits and passionate commentary.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha stares at one post where someone has photoshopped their concert outfits into a mock movie poster. "Lady Death and The Witch: A Love Story”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How are they this fast?” She asks in disbelief.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles, “Dedication, obviously”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Stop having so much fun with this”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You broke the internet and gave me a kickass new nickname all in one night. If I wasn't married to you already, Agatha…” her voice drops seductively.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha glares, “I will divorce you”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio grins, like she knows it's a bold lie, “Counterpoint, you put your phone down, we make baby number three”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The sound of a door slamming interrupts their banter. Moments later, Billy storms into their room, holding his phone like it’s evidence in a trial.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Are you serious right now?" he demands.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sighs, sitting up. "Good morning to you too."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy scowls. "My friends saw that picture before I did! And now they're asking if Lady Death is my dad. Do you know how terrible that is?"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio, far from looking repentant, bursts out laughing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I imagine you said ‘yes of course’,” she says laughing, and ruffles his hair, “Besides you're a rockstar now, Wiccan. I told you showbiz is ruthless”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy bats her hand away, but his ears turn pink. "Don’t call me that," he grumbles, crossing his arms. He looks between the two of them like an angry parent to his children, "And don’t make this worse than it already is."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky pokes his head into the room, still in his Paw Patrol pajamas. "Mama, can I call you Daddy now?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio gasps dramatically, clutching her chest. "See, mi amor, he gets it!"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "No," Agatha says firmly, glaring at both of them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Yes," Rio counters, picking Nicky up and tickling him until he’s giggling uncontrollably.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy groans. "I can’t deal with this." He storms out, muttering something about blocking both his moms on social media.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     By mid afternoon the chaos has not subsided, it has grown. Agatha scrolls through her feed with growing annoyance as the sheer number of reactions becomes evident.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Every post, every meme, every frantic comment feels like a little stab at her carefully curated public image.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She's Sisters of the Craft’s commanding frontwoman, a powerhouse on stage, for crying out loud!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But no, today she’s Lady Death's wife first and foremost, and the internet is losing its collective mind over it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why won't they stop calling you Daddy?” she demands, glaring at Rio, who’s lounging on the couch in their living room, a glass of chocolate milk in hand and looking far too pleased with herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio grins, her face bare of make up after last night, she looks beautiful. as she sips her milk, “Don't be jealous, mi vida. You've got your own nicknames too,” she holds up her phone with a grinn and starts reading, “Glam Queen married goth gremlin? Relationship goals” she continues to scroll, “How about this one, ‘Find yourself a woman who looks at you like Lady Death looks at Agatha Harkness’ That's sweet, right?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha nods once, unwilling to give Rio anymore than that, as her wife continues to scroll on her phone. She laughs at something and Agatha leans closer to look at her screen over her shoulder.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Lady Death exudes chaotic Daddy energy. Agatha Harkness is serving tired wine mom realness. Power couple of the century” She raises an eyebrow, and Rio bites a laugh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “They get us”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “The do not get us,” Agatha counters, her eyes glued to Rio's phone. “Oh my god. ‘Lady Death is giving bratty bottom for Agatha Harkness’ Not a lie, but I have sponsors to answer to, Rio. A brand to maintain. And, oh God what if Billy's seen this!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As if on cue, Billy appears at the doorway, his phone in hand, his expression a mix of embarrassment and teenage angst. “Mom. Mama. Do you even understand what you’ve done?” He waves the phone dramatically. “It's everywhere. I can't go to school. You know how many classmates have texted me about this?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks genuinely intrigued. “Are they saying good things?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No!” Billy throws his hands up. “They’re calling you Daddy,” he hisses, pointing at Rio “And not the kind of Daddy you’re thinking of!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio blinks, her smirk growing. “Oh, that kind of Daddy.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Stop saying Daddy!” Billy groans, flopping onto the couch face-down. “Why can't you two just be normal? Like, quietly married normal couple”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I'd hate that,” Agatha quips, the suburban life has never been appealing to her. “It sounds so boring. Do I look like an annoying all over your business suburban mom to you, teen? You'd hate that”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy groans into the cushion, “I hate you both”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha smirks, he can be so dramatic sometimes, he takes after her on that front but she will never admit it. Rio would love that too much. “You love us,,” she counters, “You just hate your friends think we're cooler than you”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No they don't,” Billy says, his words muffled by the cushion, “They think you're cringe”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You're hurting my feelings, kid,” Rio says, with mock hurt.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy exhales dramatically and stands, shifting to sit between his moms. They instinctively move aside to give him space. “I'm sorry”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio throws an arm around his shoulders, “You're a good kid, Billy Vidal Harkness. This will pass, just gotta give it time. Tell anyone who bothers you at school that Lady Death will kick their ass”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy laughs despite himself, “You guys are the worst, but I love you”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pats his cheek gently, “We love you too, teen”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He leans into her touch for just a moment before pulling away, suddenly reminded that he’s too cool to be hanging out with his moms for too long. Standing, he stretches exaggeratedly. “Can we order pizza? I'm never leaving the house again”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Thats the spirit,” Rio grins, and turns to her “Pepperoni and extra cheese?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Go for it, I'm hungry,” Agatha says, turning back to her phone that hasn't stopped receiving new notifications since she out it down, “Oh my good, the bands official accounts are in on it too now”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy leaves with a groan, back upstairs to hide in his room.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shows Rio her phone. “I hate your band,” she mutters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      @TheCourt
     </strong>
     : So proud of our fearless leader, Lady Death for getting her woman! @AgathaHarkness, welcome to the family.

     The Sisters of the Craft account response comes a second later.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      @SistersoftheCraft
     </strong>
     : give it to our fearless leader to tame Death. Congrats to Agatha and her chaos gremlin wife.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha groans, glaring at her phone, “I can't tell it it's Lilia or Jen, but I hate it”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It's sweet,” Rio says next to her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “They called a chaos gremlin,” Agatha counters, annoyed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ““Your chaos gremlin,” Rio corrects with a playful grin. “And honestly, I’ve been called worse. Look on the bright side, they approve.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha wants to stay mad, but the sight of Rio’s soft, self-satisfied smile makes it difficult. The way she so proudly claims the title of Agatha's chaos gremlin as if it’s a badge of honor is almost endearing. Maybe this wasn’t a complete mistake. “We’ve been married for over a decade, hon,” Agatha points out, trying to keep her voice level.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio hums, considering her next words, then says, “Everyday feels like the first day”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sap,” Agatha mutters, but can't help but smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio's laughter, rich and genuine, fills the space between them. Agatha finds herself smiling too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Should we put out phones down, let out managers handle it and just-” she starts, only to be cut off by an amused Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Make baby number three?” she asks, voice dripping with mischief.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shoves her gently, half-scolding, half-laughing. An answer is already forming on her tongue when her phone buzzes with a new notification, lighting up the screen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Intrigued, Agatha unlocks her phone and taps on the notification.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      @KnightofTheCourt
     </strong>
     : Lady Death and Agatha Harkness? Guess this explains why she always leaves the studio for ‘urgent meetings.’ @LadyDeath, my friend, what's your secret? Asking for a friend.
     <br/>

     Below, the first response catches her eyes. Wanda. Her long time best friend, the traitor.
     <br/>

     : don't know about Daddy Death, but Agatha keeps secrets better than anyone I know. Except when she’s on Twitter after drinking wine. Congrats, you two. About time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha groans and sinks deeper into the couch. “We’re never leaving the house again.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio wraps an arm around her shoulders, pressing a kiss to her temple. “Sure, honey. Let’s call it a choice.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha glares at her but doesn't pull away.

     The pizza arrives with Sharon who looks tired but doesn't say anything, just a simple “I'm handling it.”

     Rio is already halfway through a slice of pizza, Nicky perched on her lap with his face smeared in grease and tomato sauce. “I've been thinking, people know you’re married to the lead singer of The Court,” Rio says around a mouthful of food. “They still don’t know who she is, though…”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha snorts, reaching for a paper towel and leaning over to dab at Nicky’s messy face. Rio dutifully holds him still, though the smirk on her lips promises mischief. “I guess you’ll have to walk all those red carpets and attend all the events in full face paint,” Agatha retorts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Challenge accepted,” she says with a playful smirk, and puts Nicky down so he can run across the room, calling for Billy to play with him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha settles back into her seat, half-watching as Nicky throws himself at Billy’s legs. The teenager barely reacts, casually scooping up his younger brother like a sack of potatoes before tossing him onto the couch. Nicky bounces back up immediately, laughing and throwing his hands in the air, demanding, “Again! Again!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She consodering intervening before someone gets hurt. Her gaze shufts to Rio, whos already watching her, and stands up, presumably on her way to get the kids to stop playing an enthusiastic game of “toss Nicky around like a football”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I spoke with Hela,” Sharon says, as she moves to sit next to her. Agatha groans at the mention of Rio's long time friend and manager.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We think you should make a statement,” Sharon continues, “You need to post a follow-up. Something clever and charming to redirect the narrative. People are obsessed, we need to control where the story goes”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The plan sounds a lot more Hela than Sharon, but Agatba kind of sees where it's coming from.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sharon goes home eventually, and Agatha speeds the rest of the day drafting and deleting the statement. From time to time she catches Rio playing with the kids, first the two of them and then just Nicky, when Billy remembers he's too cool to play with his mama.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Once the kids have gone to bed, Nicky asleep and Billy complaining to his boyfriend, Agatha finds herself on the couch, staring at the latest draft on her phone. She’s already got three unread messages from Sharon checking in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio sits down beside her, offering a glass of wine. “What's on your mind, hermosa?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sharon and Hela think I have to write a follow up statement,” she explains, swirling her wine thoughtfully, “I've written and deleted it one thousand times now”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Let me see?” Rio asks, holding out her hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha passes over her phone, watching as Rio reads. Her wife’s face lights up, her grin wide with approval.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do it” she says, and Agatha feels less unsure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      @AgathaHarkness
     </strong>
     : Glad to see the internet has impeccable taste. My wife is a handful, but she’s my handful. And yes, Lady Death fans, I see you. No, you cannot call her Daddy. That’s reserved for me. Goodnight.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio reads over her shoulder and laughs. Leaning in she kisses her, a quick peck. Her lips taste like wine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Chaos suits you, my love. Finally I'm the good guy”

      @CourtClown: If I had a nickel for every time Agatha Harkness accidentally broke the internet, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird it happened twice.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      @SotcStan101: “That’s reserved for me” is the modern equivalent of a medieval duel challenge. Agatha really said BACK OFF.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      @harknesshobby:Agatha’s out here telling us we can’t call Lady Death Daddy while her wife is literally changing her bio to DADDY DEATH I feel gaslit.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha reads the comments for the hundredth time. There are others, all along the same lines, each one more ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It would seem her attempt at calming the waters has failed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Sharon texts her about meeting to talk about it, and Agatha hates it, but begrudgingly agrees.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, she does enjoy the chaos a little bit, secretly. Rio’s good mood is contagious, even if it's because she's referring to herself as daddy, a joke Nicky has taken to, much to Agatha and Billy's dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Reluctantly on all parts, the kids go to hang at Alice's for the day, while Agatha and Rio, like chastised teenagers, have to stay back and meet with their managers.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently it's time to let the professionals handle it, in Rio’s retelling of her manager's words.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grumbles the whole time they're saying goodbye, and Alice gives her a mocking salute as she gets in her car.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have fun in the doghouse, you two”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're getting a dog?” Nicky asks excitedly, his head popping out of the back door window.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pokes his nose and pushes him back in. “You're not supposed to be able to do that, mister”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nods behind her, and Nicky laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, we're leaving now,” Alice announces, “Be in one piece when I dropped them back”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As they drive away, Rio leans, draping an arm around Agatha's shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You ready, babe?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groans, “For Hela and Sharon? No, I am not”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs, taking her hand and leading her back inside. “I'm sure it will be well, Hela and Sharon work for us, not the other way around”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha isn't sure Hela knows that. She likes Sharon because she knows Agatha, knows what she likes, and what she hates, and she easily moves between those lines. Hela is like a bulldozer.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha has never been a fan of bulldozers.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio makes her breakfast while they wait, every minute agonizing to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “When you think we'll get around to get drinks with Alice and your group?” Rio asks, her back turned to her as she flips the bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugs, noncommittally. The final show Sisters of the Craft is still delayed after the festival back down on having them close the second night due to security issues, so her agenda is a mess.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turns to face her, “What is it, babe? Breaking the internet is finally taking its toll on you?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” she says too quickly, “Did the internet ever decide who won? I need a drink and I think you should pay it”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thinks about it for a minute, “Yknow, I don't actually know. I got distracted somewhere between you forcing me to watch your show with a camera on my face and you taking a terribly soft picture of me to post online. And then or course, I got distracted again in the ensuing drama”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha narrows her eyes at her, and Rio laughs, dutifully returning to breakfast making.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They eat breakfast while watching cartoons on TV, Rio's choice, and Agatha sits next to her, pretending she hates it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, of course, sees right through her, throwing an arm over her shoulders to pull them closer so she can kiss her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We should send the kiddos away more often,” Rio says with a grin. “I miss the quiet times, just me and you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leans into her touch with a content sigh, then remembers something. “Weren't you trying to get me pregnant again the other day?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turns to her with a mischievous grin. “Why? You're interested?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You were complaining about the kids just now,” Agatha counters, dodging the question.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would be such a good girl dad, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is gonna be a whole thing now, isn't it?” Agatha asks, dreading the answer. “Calling yourself daddy.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckles and turns to face her fully, mock-serious. “But only for you, my love.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha follows after her, trying to figure out what she's walking into.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela Odinson stands at the foot of the stairs like she owns the house, her expression carefully neutral as Agatha and Rio make their way down.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, now that we are all here,” Sharon begins, a wide smile on her lips. “Congratulations on—”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Congratulations?” Hela cuts her off. “How about what the fuck?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha narrows her eyes at her, and Rio steps between them. “Let's sit down, have a drink, and discuss this like the hot grown, women that we are.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha and Hela stare down at each other until the manager manages to smile at Rio, stepping aside.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very well, I could use a beer.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nods, taking Agatha's hand, and they move to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's eleven,” Agatha whispers to Rio, who passes her the orange juice and then picks a beer, throwing it at her manager. She holds a second one and raises an eyebrow at Sharon.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh no, dear. I accept orange juice if that's all the options,” the woman says.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We've got chocolate milk,” Rio offers, already popping a box for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn't even look up as she pours two glasses of orange juice and passes one to Sharon. “Stop drinking Nicky's milk, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once everyone's had their drinks sorted, they sit around the dinner table. Hela brings her tablet to the table, and as they drink, she begins to read out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She starts with the tweets, some Agatha has already seen, others she seems to have found at the very bottom of the internet hell. Agatha suspects Hela is enjoying it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's on the news too now,” she says finally, putting her tablet down. “Sharon said you could handle it, but I don't know if that's the case.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just say it,” Agatha says exasperated. “What's your big plan?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela holds her gaze, a slow smirk beginning to spread on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Agatha is so fucked.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We do a Q&amp;A.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     An hour later, they're sitting on opposite sides of the dinner table, a laptop in front of each one while Hela has two lackeys sitting on Agatha’s couch doing ‘research’ for the Q&amp;A.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We can still say no, babe,” Rio says, catching her gaze. She holds her hand out over the table, and Agatha takes it. “I'll tell Hela to fuck off, just say the word.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It's sweet, but Agatha is stubborn. “No, it's okay. I can handle answering some tweets.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio holds her gaze for a moment and nods. “Okay. Just remember to have some fun.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha does not have fun. Hela chooses the tweets they can answer, but she does enjoy reading the ones she rejected and explaining why.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha said NO, we cannot call her Daddy. Fine. We call her Step-Daddy instead?
     </em>
     .” Hela laughs, looking at Rio. “You'll get ideas I don't want to enable right now.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finds herself agreeing for probably the first time with Hela. “Wise decision, Hela. Looks like there's a first time for everything after all.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela glares at her, and Agatha glares back.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha logging in just to flex her marriage and gatekeep Lady Death? Honestly, goals,
     </em>
     ” Rio reads aloud, her grin clear in her voice. “I'm gonna answer to this one.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha and Hela's stare-off ends immediately, and Rio smiles while she types.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you writing?” Agatha asks, eager to stand up. She gets a notification and narrows her eyes at Rio before turning to her laptop. She sighs, reading Rio's response aloud: “
     <em>
      Flexing. Yes. Gatekeeping. Always. Wife's orders
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela shakes her head with a laugh. “Could've been worse. My assistants will send you the preselected questions now. You answer those, and we should be done in an hour or so, yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is a nightmare,” Agatha mutters, and Hela rolls her eyes, moving further into the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They sit quietly in the dining room for a while until Rio chuckles, and Agatha looks up just in time to see her look of “I just did something truly chaotic.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What did you do?” she asks, brows raised.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looks at the new notification, then back up at her wife, eyes narrowed. “You're in trouble, Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     “We're not letting the people decide if we have a third kid,” she says, tone dry.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugs, already typing her next response. “They don't know that. Let the people dream, my love.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stares at her, her gaze pointed. Rio looks away. “What did you do?”

     “And it will never happen,” Agatha says, sliding her laptop across the table and sitting next to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio immediately abandons the laptop to throw her arms around her. She brushes Agatha’s hair away from her face and gives her a soft kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanna take a break, mi amor?” she asks, moving her lips to Agatha's temple and kissing it too.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hums, moving her head into Rio’s arms to kiss her again, sighing against her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, let's get back to work,” she rolls her neck a couple of times, as if preparing herself for battle. “Pick a question, and we can both answer?”

     “Go. Get. Me. A. Drink,” Agatha says, faking nonchalance. As Rio turns to leave, she slaps her butt.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio jumps a little and laughs. “Knew you liked it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scrolls through the tweets Hela's cronies sent, trying to think if and what she wants to answer while Rio is gone. Somehow doing this nightmare next to Rio and not across from her makes all the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She laughs at a couple of questions; people do have the strangest ideas, and judging by some of these, she doesn't want to see what Hela discarded.

     </strong>
     <strong>
      is Daddy, what are you? Mommy? The Boss? Or just the one holding the leash?
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      @agathaharkness: no, yes, yes. Next question.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Knowing Rio will want to take part in answering, Agatha scrolls aimlessly, laughing at people's responses. Rio returns with two cups of coffee and puts one next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you holding up, babe?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pretends to think it over. “I think you were right about people getting us.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs, not believing her for a second. “What did you find?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Evidence,” she says simply, beginning to scroll to show Rio just that. “Here.
     <em>
      Rio calling Agatha ‘Mommy’ and immediately getting in trouble is peak brat behavior
     </em>
     . Very true, you are a brat.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs, beginning her own scrolling to win. “Ah yes, this one.
     <em>
      The duality of ‘my love’ and ‘mommy.’ Daddy Death contains multitudes
     </em>
     . See, they say I have range.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snickers, looking over her shoulder. “I think they're saying your range is somewhere between hopeless romantic and a bottom, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They answer what feels like one hundred more questions. Rio encourages her to open up a little, but just a little, and Agatha hates to admit it, but it's fun.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The chaos of the last couple of days will probably not die out now that they've spoken about it, but maybe people can chill. Agatha feels like a circus monkey making party tricks.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're done,” Rio says out of nowhere, and Agatha looks up, thinking she'll find Hela giving them the all-good signal, but the woman is nowhere in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You sure?” she asks, looking at her wife, a mix of curiosity and relief.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugs. “Yeah, Hela can handle it. She knows our whole story. You need a massage.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha would moan at that if her house wasn't full of strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio seems to sense her discomfort. “Stay here, I'll talk to Hela and get everyone out.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaves after kissing Agatha, a quick peck because Hela's sidekicks are still a couple feet away on the couch, but the glint in her eyes promises there's more to come.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stares at the screen one last time. Maybe she can answer one more. She scrolls through the messages until she stops on one she thinks is very fitting to close the whole thing.

     <strong>
      @AgathaHarkness: Her kindness. She's actually pretty lovable under all the chaos and face paint.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio comes up behind her and chuckles as she reads her final tweet. “Sap.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slaps her hands away. “Don't make me regret it. You talked to Hela?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, she said we lasted longer than she thought we would,” Rio says, laughing, then turns to her own laptop, quickly typing and closing the lid. “There, done.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lets Rio drag her upstairs to their bedroom, dropping onto the bed with a content sigh. She follows Rio as she moves around the room.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, when Rio is working on the knots in Agatha's back, Agatha remembers she never saw Rio's last tweet.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Babe,” she says, her voice low and soft under Rio's hands, “What was your last tweet?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio doesn't answer immediately, too busy working on her shoulder, her fingers digging into the skin with deliberate pressure. Once she's satisfied with her work, she lays down next to Agatha, a little smirk tugging at her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just answered the same question as you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stares at her, waiting for Rio to elaborate.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Favorite thing about you,” she says, moving closer so they're side by side. “Your eyes, that you're secretly a softie…”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groans, but Rio persists, apparently not done.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And the sex is pretty next level.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my god,” Agatha rubs her face with her hand. “Billy is gonna hate us so much, and it's your fault.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs, waving her hands dismissively. “He'll bounce back like an inflatable castle. Besides, it's true. How are you feeling?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Better,” she says, moving forward to capture Rio's lips in a slow, soft kiss. “You're incorrigible”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Hela and her people are gone, they lay on the couch, a movie playing in the background on the TV and a bottle of wine on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Should we take a photo?” Agatha asks thoughtfully. “Post something cheeky like, ‘That was fun, let's never do it again.’”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes darken in a way Agatha can't tell if it's mischief or lust. She's up in a flash. “Yes,” and disappears downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha is left confused, but knowing her wife, she'll find out soon enough. She sips her wine and waits.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Sure enough, Rio returns a couple of minutes later, holding out a neon pink skull mask Billy got for Halloween last year.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Quicker than makeup,” is all she says in explanation, slipping it on her face. She steps into Agatha's space and beckons her closer. “Come here, mi amor.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha can't help but smile. Is it ridiculous? Yes. Is it working for her? Also yes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She slides her hands around Rio's waist, pulling her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who's gonna take the photo?” she asks, brushing Rio's hair behind her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio holds out her phone. “Now for poses.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckles, “I think I can figure something out”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “At the count of three?” Rio asks, head tilted to the side like she's curiously awaiting what Agatha will do next.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nodding, Agatha tips Rio's jaw forward, moving the mask up enough to kiss her without showing her face, and the flash goes off.
    </p>
    <p>

     A red carpet. That's Hela's next great idea.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha reads the email and groans, dropping her phone on the table.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio bumps her shoulder and gives her a quick kiss. Across from them, Nicky giggles, scrunching his face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ew, Mommy! Mama!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio ruffles his hair, “I love her, let me have her, kid”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy’s dramatic groan fills the kitchen as he walks in, ruining the moment. Rio sighs, resting her head on Agatha’s shoulder and nuzzling her skin aimlessly, clearly checking out of the conversation. Agatha rolls her eyes, turning to her eldest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Good morning, Billy,” she says, casually, “How did you sleep?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Did I sleep?” Billy retorts, his voice rising as he sits next to Nicky and snatches a piece of banana from his plate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha holds his gaze expectantly. Rio silently slides another piece of banana to Nicky.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I saw your Q&amp;A thing,” Billy finally says. “It’s everywhere. I hate it. Why did you do that?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha gives Rio a pointed look. Her wife groans but sits up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hela said so,” Rio replies simply.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha snickers. “It was a work thing, teen. Like going on tour or doing photoshoots.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Or getting stickers of your face saying, ‘Lady Death was here,’ to slap on every venue I play,” Rio adds unhelpfully.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha barely holds back laughter. “That’s just you marking your territory, babe.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fine,” Rio shrugs, “but my brand is more energy drinks, noise-canceling headphones, and se-”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha presses a finger to Rio’s lips before she can finish. Rio looks up at her, mischief in her eyes, her tongue poking out. Unbothered, Agatha pinches her tongue between two fingers, then turns back to Billy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “The point is, it was work,” she says firmly. “You have school; we have this.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy arches an unimpressed brow, and Agatha sighs, letting go of Rio’s tongue. Rio snickers, sipping her coffee.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I love your mom, Billy,” Rio says softly, though it’s clear she doesn’t want to have this conversation. “And it’s been a secret for a long time. Can I have this?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy sighs. “Fine, but can you not… talk about… y’know.” His face flushes red as he falters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha and Rio stare at him, waiting. He groans. “Your private life. People are calling Mama thirsty online.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio snickers, choking on her coffee, and Agatha massages her back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That doesn’t mean-” Billy starts, but Agatha cuts in, her tone matching his reluctance.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “She knows what it means, Billy.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods. “I’m not ancient. And have you seen her?” She gestures to Agatha. “How am I not supposed to show off?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy holds her gaze, exasperated. Agatha laughs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky, who’s been quietly eating, grins at Agatha and shows her his clean hands, then grabs a banana slice and squishes it between his fingers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Gross, Nicholas,” Agatha tuts, starting to stand. Rio puts a hand on her leg under the table and stands instead.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I'll deal with the baby gremlin,” she says, tone lighter, like she's won some secret challenge with Billy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With Rio and Nicky gone, Agatha turns her attention to breakfast, waiting for Billy to come around.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I'm sorry,” Billy says after a minute, “But you guys gotta admit this is mortifying”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Look at you, using big words,” Agatha teases. “Look, your mama and I have never been proper. You just weren’t paying attention. The only difference now is there’s an audience. I'll keep her in check, okay?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy groans again, his default setting of teenage angst and exasperation. “I’m quitting social media, then.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha laughs, “That's all it took?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy glares in answer, making her laugh again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Just eat your breakfast, teen”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The red carpet is for a movie neither one of them cares too much about. A small budget rom-com that used one The Court songs so Rio and Alice were invited.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice joins in the fun, arriving in face paint to match Rio’s. The two greet each other like clowns, posing for the cameras while Agatha watches from the sidelines as photographers swarm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When they’re done, Rio returns to Agatha, kissing her cheek sweetly. The gesture sets off a barrage of flashes. Agatha groans inwardly but accepts Rio’s hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As they walk the red carpet, the cast and director are quickly overshadowed, with the media focusing on the real stars of the night.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha almost feels bad, but at least their presence brings publicity to the movie. She’s certain the producers are thanking their lucky stars that the premiere coincides with the buzz from the reveal of her and Rio's marriage.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hela is managing them tonight, because Agatha trusts Sharon with the kids but not Rio's friends.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As they approach the journalists, Agatha spots familiar faces. The first is the young reporter who’d interviewed Rio during the festival, the fan of The Court. Agatha has to suppress her irritation, plastering on a smile instead.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She'll kill Hela later.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha, Lady Death, you’re making your big debut as a couple tonight. How are you feeling?” the journalist asks, her grin genuine, like she’s living the dream.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha maintains her showtime smile. “Oh, so far so good, but with this one,” she gestures to Rio, who grins back, “you never know.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The journalists turns to Rio then, “She keeps you on a short leash?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha knows exactly what’s coming and shoots Hela a glare. Her manager smirks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, she can try,” Rio says, pulling Agatha closer by the waist. “Now that she’s told everyone she's mine, there’s no stopping me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha smiles despite herself, charmed by her wife's absurdity. “I think my exact words were ‘she's mine,’ but sure, baby”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s eyes gleam with adoration, and Agatha resists the urge to kiss her and ruin their makeup.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The journalist stumbles through her follow-up question, clearly realizing Agatha and Rio are the kind of couple who make everyone else feel awkward.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Good, Agatha thinks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hela ushers them along, and after countless pictures and interviews, they near the end of the media circus.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Just a couple more interviews before going inside and sit in the darkened theater to watch a movie they don't care for.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha knows Rio has ideas about it that she was happy to share with another reporter, which is why she shut it down quickly, much to Hela's disappointment.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Someone has to think of the children.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha can't have another morning of Billy's teenage angst monologues.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is relieved until the next journalist—a young man in a pink hoodie—starts fumbling over his words.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hi! I’m so excited to be here,” he stammers. “Agatha, Lady Death, you’ve given us enough questions for a full interview.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha smiles politely. “You’ll have to contact our teams for that.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She glances at Hela, silently asking what fresh hell this is.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So,” the reporter continues, “you’ve been playing us all for a while, especially Lady Death. Now that the secret’s out, you’ve been posting some fun content on social media. Will we see more of that?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha laughs. “Probably not.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “She says that now,” Rio teases, leaning conspiratorially toward the reporter. “But she’s behind every post so far.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shakes her head, laughing despite herself. “Maybe Lady Death can post something today, as a treat.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio grins in triumph as they move on to the final journalist.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha recognizes her immediately, it’s the woman she accidentally revealed her marriage to a decade ago. The journalist greets her like an old friend.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha,” she says with a grin. “We meet the wife at last.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agahta doesn't have to fake her smile. So much. “Only took a decade”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You kept her well hidden,” the journalist replies, turning to Rio, who perks up, ready for mischief. “Lady Death, we meet at last.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio winks, and Agatha huffs a laugh. She knows these interviews are going to cause another social media crisis.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And so we do,” Rio says. “I feel like we’ve met all along, though. We wouldn’t be here if you weren’t so good at your job.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Gods these interviews are gonna cause another social media crisis, she just knows it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes. “Stop flirting with her—” She barely catches herself from saying Rio’s name. Both her wife and the journalist turn to her expectantly. Hela narrows her eyes behind them, clearly testing her. Agatha sighs. “Darling.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles, and the journalist laughs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Almost got you again,” the journalist says, turning back to Rio. “Lady Death, do we ever get to know your name?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Oh, that's a dangerous question. Rio has spent too much time telling Agatha jokes about this topic.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio, full of mischief, grins at Agatha.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You can call me Daddy Harkness,” she says, smirking. “That’s what Agatha calls me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I do not,” Agatha says, her face flushing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Darkness for short. That’s Harkness with a D, because-”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hela cuts in swiftly. “And that’s all the time we have.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Once inside the theater, Rio, still holding her hand, turns to Hela to whisper something and the manager nods and points to a corridor on the right.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Come,” Rio says, guiding Agatha in the direction Hela pointed. The first door on the right opens into a small office space with only a desk, two chairs, a couch, and a dead plant on the windowsill.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio pulls Agaths to the couch and sits next to her. Agatha drops her head on Rio's chest and sighs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Thanks, love,” she murmurs, absentmindedly playing with the buttons on Rio's suit jacket.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio kisses the top of her head, hands already waving through her hair. “Anytime, mi amor.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re a dumbass,” Agatha says after a moment.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles. “And to what do I owe the pleasure of your compliments?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shifts her head to glare at her, but she knows it’s ineffective, her smile gives her away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You like it,” Rio teases, tugging her closer for a quick kiss. “Wanna stay here till the movie ends?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Would you really do that?” Agatha asks, though she already knows the answer. Rationally, she knows Rio would stay in this dingy office with her if she asked. But tonight is important, it’s Rio’s night.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They’re here for Hela, yes, but this is about her music in a movie. Agatha has spent over a decade watching Rio’s talent shine through other artists, including herself, and then seeing Rio emerge as a formidable artist in her own right.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The movie feels like a natural progression of her wife’s career. Sure, rom-coms are corny as hell, but if Rio’s doing the music, Agatha will sit through it and nod along as the straight leads inevitably fall in love.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods like it’s no big deal. “I’d stay anywhere with you. Even some weird office space inside a theater.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha feels the urge to kiss her in a way that would ruin both their makeups beyond repair. But that can wait.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She stands, smoothing her dress to ensure it doesn’t look like she’s been lounging for the past twenty minutes, and extends her hand to Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “C’mon, superstar.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio grins, taking her hand. “It’s Daddy Death, actually.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m gonna smack you,” Agatha mutters as they make their way back to the screening room.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The movie had already started by the time they slipped in, their assigned seats near the front making their trek awkward and painfully long. People turned to watch them pass, some laughing, others shushing them, and Agatha had to resist the urge to stop and tell them all to shove it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When they finally reached their seats, Alice smirked up at them, her face illuminated by the screen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You know someone’s going to tell the press you showed up late, and it’ll start rumors,” she whispers, shifting to let them through. “I’ll make sure to confirm them on social media.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes as Rio nods at her bandmate, grinning.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She can’t remember Alice being this much of a troublemaker during her time with Sisters of the Craft.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Let’s just watch the movie,” Agatha mutters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You guys staying for the after-party?” Alice asks, but someone in the back shushes them, and Agatha shoots a glare in the general direction of the back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she turns back, both members of The Court are watching the movie.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha, however, can’t say the same for herself. Not once in the entire hour and forty minutes does she care about the characters or the plot. The only saving grace is Rio’s vocals during a scene where the main couple makes out in a park like a pair of weirdos.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Who even makes out in a park? Gross.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio slides her hands into hers as the lights turn on, and the next thing Agatha knows, Rio and Alice are on stage with the cast and production team for the movie.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha half-listens as each cast member takes a turn at the microphone, recounting stories from production that she barely pays attention to. When it’s the director’s turn, Agatha tunes back in just in time to see Alice pass the mic to Rio, who makes a dramatic show of pretending to pass it along to no one. The audience laughs, and despite herself, Agatha chuckles too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hi,” Rio says, and Agatha can see she’s nervous. “Turns out talking to big crowds at shows is a lot less nerve-wracking.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crowd laughs, like Rio just told a great joke, and Agatha can't believe it but she laughs too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I guess this is when Knight and I say something meaningful. This is our second time watching the movie, we actually got sent the final cut a couple weeks into post production when they asked if they could use our music for it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She finds Agatha’s eyes on the crowd and her gaze softens.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Anyone who's been online lately knows I'm a bit of a romantic myself,” Rio says, her voice warn, “So a rom-com seem fitting to have out music in the soundtrack even though that's totally not our style”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crowd claps, and Rio does a little bow, “Alright that enough,” she jokes, “Huge thanks to the team for choosing us, to the cast and directors for an excellent film, and totally self serving, a big thank you to my wife, who is the muse behind this song and now I can actually admit that."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her eyes meet Agatha’s briefly before she steps back, handing off the mic.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio and Alice return to Agatha, laughing. Alice bumps Rio’s shoulder as they walk. “You’re such a sap, Lady Death. I hope you’re happy.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio throws her arms around Agatha, who’s just in time to open hers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think I might just survive,” Rio teases, her hands softly cupping Agatha’s jaw.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice shakes her head with a laugh. “Were you two always like this? I feel so single right now.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chuckles. “Yeah, probably.” She turns to Rio with a small smile. “We heading home?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes, ma’am,” Rio replies immediately.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Go be single and jealous somewhere else, Knight,” Rio shoots back over her shoulder as she and Agatha follow the crowd leaving for the afterparty.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha takes Rio’s hand, their eyes meeting briefly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I love you,” Agatha says softly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Love you too, mi amor,” Rio replies, lifting Agatha’s hand to her lips. “Now let’s go home for our own afterparty.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Later that night, as Agatha slips into bed, Rio sets aside the book she’s been reading and opens her arms. Without a second thought, Agatha moves closer, nestling into her wife’s embrace.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’ve been thinking,” Rio says, her fingers gently threading through Agatha’s hair. The soft touch contrasts with the teasing lilt in her voice.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sighs, bracing herself for whatever’s coming.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You said I could post something… as a treat,” Rio finishes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chuckles, turning slowly to face her wife. She’s met with an exaggerated pout.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That’s called manipulation, and we don’t encourage it,” Agatha tuts, though the upward twitch of her lips betrays her amusement.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio grins, triumphant, and Agatha groans, rolling her eyes as she turns back around, resting her head against Rio’s chest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What did you have in mind?” she asks, cutting off Rio’s reply before it even starts. “And keep in mind, I have veto power.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio snorts, her hand pausing mid-stroke before continuing its soothing motions. “You don’t play fair, mi vida.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t try to charm me with your Spanish,” Agatha mutters, though her voice lacks bite. When Rio’s laughter rumbles through her chest, it makes Agatha laugh too, despite herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’ve got a few ideas I’d like to run by you,” Rio says, her tone playful. Then, after a pause, she adds, “Mi corazón.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Unsurprisingly, Agatha folds to Rio's request.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That’s how she ends up in front of Rio’s phone, facing the camera while Rio hides behind the book she’d been reading earlier. Agatha mutters complaints about the setup, and Rio concedes to showing her hand in the shot, though she also cheekily suggests undoing a couple buttons on her sleep shirt, a suggestion that Agatha vetoes without hesitation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After much back-and-forth, Agatha finally approves one of the countless photos they took, with her face half-hidden against Rio's chest. She keeps a sharp eye on Rio as she types out the caption.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Now put the phone down and kiss me,” she intends it to be firm, but it comes off as a soft request.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The effect is the same regardless. Rio sets her phone aside and turns toward her with a warm grin. “Yes, ma’am. Come here, my love.”
     <br/>
     <br/>

      Hela sends them an email every morning with a selection of unhinged tweets and comments about them, and suddenly it becomes their routine.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It seems they can't post online without people flooding to the comments or social media to talk about it.They read them over breakfast, and Rio texts her manager's answers Hela, wisely, never posts.

      Today Agatha reads them alone, in between breaks of rehearsals for the final show of the tour with the band. Thankfully they were able to get everything sorted within the week, and Agatha is ready to put the tour behind her for a while.

    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she's putting her phone down, ready to return to the last part of the rehearsal her phone begins buzzing, once, twice and then it goes on.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With Lilia and Jen waiting for her, Agatha does her best to ignore it and takes her place on stage. The band starts playing the intro to their closing number, but Agatha can still hear the damn phone buzzing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Goddammit.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She holds out her hand and the music halts abruptly. Someone asks what the problem is, but Agatha is already moving backstage to check her phone.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      What is going on? Her first thought is something happened to her family. Today was a busy day for everyone. Billy had a day date with Eddie, they were going to some sort of horror themed amusement park two hours away; and Rio had to stop by the studio to go over some stuff for The Court's show tomorrow, she had Nicky with her too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha is about to press on a notification when she receives a message from Hela, a link attached.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      It's being handled.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha presses play already pissed. Fucking Hela and her cryptic message.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The video begins with Rio stepping out of the studio, sunglasses low on her nose and her skull face mask firmly in place. Nicky is settled on her hip, his skull-patterned bucket hat askew. As soon as the journalist calls out, Rio's shoulders stiffen slightly, though her response is measured and polite.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Lady Death, motherhood looks good on you,” the voice of the young reporter Agatha has come to know comes up, the fan of The Court. “Can you tell us what you were doing in the studio? New music coming up?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio adjusts Nicky on her hip, her body language carefully neutral even as she keeps moving toward the parking lot. “Just a meeting,” she says lightly, her tone smooth but noncommittal. “Y’know how it is, some days it’s business, and only some days it’s pleasure.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The journalist doesn’t back down, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. She reaches out, lightly brushing Rio’s free hand. “I’m sure you can handle both. This is a very domestic look, I must say.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughs softly, the sound light and easy, though her pace subtly quickens. She leans in to whisper something to Nicky, before turning her attention back to the journalist with a wry smile that doesn’t quite reach her eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Y’know how it is. Even death has a home, darling. And I happen to be very good at keeping mine entertained.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The journalist chuckles, her tone edging closer to flirtation. “I bet you are. Lucky wife of yours.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s laugh comes again, quieter this time, a low hum of amusement tinged with just enough charm to disarm. “Careful,” she says, her voice lilting and teasing as she begins to turn away. “Flattery might get you in trouble. I'm gonna go now.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The journalist follows a step behind, undeterred. “Lady Death, final question, do we ever get to see beneath the mask?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio lets out a quick, practiced chuckle, pausing only long enough to deliver a quip. “We tried already, and the wife said no. Onto the next one.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You think Agatha will reconsider?” the journalist presses.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio finally glances back, a flash of mock exasperation crossing her features before she shakes her head with an exaggerated sigh. “What happened to that being the last question?” Her tone is faintly amused, but her body language says the conversation is over.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The journalist laughs, taking the hint. “Worth a shot. Thanks for your time.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Anytime, hot stuff,” Rio says, tossing the line over her shoulder as she strides toward her car, the journalist’s laughter fading into the background.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The video ends there. But it's enough to set the internet ablaze.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Comments flood in, speculation about Lady Death’s private life, curiosity about their kids and people loving her and Nicky's matching style. Most people, however, seem fixated on the tension laden exchange between Rio and the journalist.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha feels like yelling. She trusts Rio. She can read her wife like an open book, Rio was making the best out of a bad scenario, it's the journalist she takes issue with.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha stares at the blank screen for a moment after the video ends. Her jaw tightens as she replays Rio’s responses in her mind. The cool, almost playful banter, the way Rio’s voice dipped into that mischievous edge, classic Lady Death. But the reporter’s flirting? Pushing boundaries like that? Agatha feels a sharp, possessive heat flare in her chest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      How dare she touch her wife?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Flirt with her?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That's crossing a line.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha takes a deep breath, choosing very deliberately to trust Hela and Rio. She puts her phone down and goes back to her place on stage. The music starts again, and she throws herself into the rehearsal, but the video lingers in her mind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She's gone the second they are released from rehearsal and none of her bandmates try to stop her. It's clear people know what's happened and by the looks of it they know best than to try to stop her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen mockingly salutes her with, “Have fun dealing with your chaos goblin, Agatha”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha flips her off and drives away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The sound of muffled music leads her through the house as Agatha pushes open the door to their home gym. Rio is mid-workout, but she pauses when she catches sight of Agatha’s reflection in the mirror, leaning against the doorway, arms crossed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio grabs a towel, dabbing at her face as she strides closer, her grin widening with every step. “Hey, babe. What’s up?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha steps into the room, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studies her wife. “You’ve been busy today.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio straightened, reading Agatha's mood, she reached for her water bottle from the bench. The black bottle was adorned with stars and the word Daddy written in bold lettering, courtesy of Nicky's creativity a couple days ago.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She gestures for Agatha to come closer. “Caught the video, huh?” Rio asks, her voice soft as she takes a deliberate sip, half-hiding her face behind the bottle.

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Caught a journalist flirting with my wife,” Agatha shoots back, her tone light but her narrowed eyes betraying her true feelings. She takes another step forward. “Thinking she had a chance.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chuckles, setting the bottle down. “Aw, mi amor, there’s no competition. You know that.” Her hands find Agatha’s waist, pulling her closer. “But if it bothers you, I can stop-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Stop being hot?” Agatha interrupts, her lips quirking into a smirk,  “Not likely.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio leans in, her lips brushing Agatha’s ear. “So what do you want to do about it, Mrs. Death?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha reaches into her pocket and pulls out her phone. “We’re posting something.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio blinks, startled, before breaking into a grin. “You’re serious?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, very.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Within minutes Agatha has positioned a very amused Rio to stand between her arms, face hidden behind the water bottle, Agatha's arms wrapped around her waist possessively.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio fights her over the lighting, apparently by the window it will be better, the natural light will make her abs look more defined. Reluctantly, Agatha moves them over.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I hate to admit it, but the lighting does give it a certain…” Agatha trails off, eyes flickering appreciatively over Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes?” Rio prompts, her voice playful as she takes Agatha’s hand and guides it to her stomach. “Go ahead, baby. You can touch.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha slaps her hand away, fighting a laugh as she refocuses on the task.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughs, “You're being ridiculous”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha guides her hand holding the bottle to cover her face. “Hold still”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Several photos later, they sit on the bench, scrolling through the collection to find the perfect shot. Rio leans against Agatha’s shoulder, her smirk entirely too smug.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You know, jealousy looks good on you,” Rio teases.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha taps out the caption, ignoring Rio’s playful commentary over her shoulder.

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The post is live within seconds, and Agatha sets her phone down with a triumphant smirk, turning back to Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio leans in, brushing a kiss against her lips. “Feel better now?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Much,” Agatha murmurs against her lips, her voice tinged with mischief, “but I’m not done yet.” A plan is already forming in her mind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I love it when you speak chaos to me,” Rio smirks, kissing her softly before pulling back to look into her eyes. “And that we’re doing thirst traps now? I have so many ideas.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snorts, laughing despite herself. “Oh my god, Billy is going to hate us so much. This is a one-time thing.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You said that to me once,” Rio replies, her grin widening, “and now we’re married.” She laughs at her own joke, and against her better judgment, Agatha laughs too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As her laughter fades, she leans into Rio, letting the warmth of her wife’s presence steady her. “How’s Nicky?” she asks softly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “He’s napping,” Rio says, her voice gentle. “We had dino nuggets for lunch, that was the highlight of his day. He’s excited to see you play Saturday.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nods, resting her head on Rio’s shoulder.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m trying to convince him to paint his face with me,” Rio continues, her hand moving in soothing circles on Agatha’s back. “Billy has to do it too, or he’s never playing with me again.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Billy is one viral post away from never wanting to be seen with us again,” Agatha mutters, eliciting a burst of laughter from Rio that vibrates through her chest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How do you think the photo you just posted factors into that?” Rio teases.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groans, burying her face deeper into Rio’s shoulder. “I just want people to back off. Nicky’s a kid, he shouldn’t have cameras shoved in his face because of who we are.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s hand threads through her hair, holding her close. “We’ll work something out, baby,” she promises. “I talked to Hela about it. She said if we hand out more NDAs, I should be able to stop by the studio as myself.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groans again in response, and Rio laughs.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “In the meantime,” Rio says, her tone playful, “I’m really enjoying this possessive side of yours.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Agatha doesn’t respond, Rio pulls back slightly to study her face. “I’m going to shower,” she says, pressing a kiss to the corner of Agatha’s mouth. “We should put our phones down until at least tomorrow. Hela’s going to lose it over your post. But not me, I’m proud of you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha stays on the bench, feeling the absence of Rio’s warmth almost immediately.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha!” Rio’s voice calls from down the hallway, light and inviting. “There’s room for two in the shower, mi amor.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smiles to herself, shaking her head. It doesn’t take long before she’s following after her wife.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Later that night while they're laying on the couch, Nicky nestled asleep between them, a movie they're not watching playing on the tv, Billy storms into the living room. Without words, he throws himself on the couch them with a groan
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don't want to talk about it,” he mutters preemptively, throwing a hand over his face. “I just want to know if I can go to the show tomorrow, and if you guys are gonna be gross about it”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio snickers, poking his side with her socked foot, “I don't know what you're talking about, teen. You're gonna have to be more specific”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smirks next to her, “Oh, you didn't hear about your surprise guest in tomorrow's show?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy squints at them suspiciously from beneath his arm. “What special guest?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s grin widens, and Agatha’s smirk turns downright mischievous.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh,” Rio drawls, drawing out the suspense. “Guess you’ll just have to wait and see.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy groans again, sinking deeper into the couch. “You guys are the worst.”

     Despite The Court playing tonight, Rio refuses to cancel family breakfast.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha enjoys sleeping in, but she enjoys watching her wife just a little more. That’s why she follows Rio to the kitchen, savoring the sight of her in a skull-printed apron flipping pancakes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Leaning against the counter, phone in hand, Agatha scrolls through the latest batch of tweets Hela sent. A smirk curves her lips as she reads aloud. “The ‘anytime, hot stuff’ is KILLING me. Who is Lady Death really? Is she a rockstar, a spy, a chaotic god?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio glances back at her, amusement lighting her eyes. “Oh, say I’m a chaotic god.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha raises an eyebrow, unimpressed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio huffs a laugh and turns back to the stove.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And stop flirting with other people,” Agatha adds, her tone softer than intended.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles, letting the comment slide.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s gaze returns to her phone. “Okay, people are still not over us having kids. I didn’t hide my pregnancy, and I’ve spoken about Billy before. Why is this shocking?” Her voice rises with every word.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s laughter fills the room, as she continues.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If I have to read one more tweet about people asking about our kids…they don’t need to know their names.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Without missing a beat, Rio tosses over her shoulder, “Right. Let’s tell them the kids are Billiards and Nickidemus. And soon there shall be three. Isn’t that right, my love?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, but the fond smile betrays her. “You’re relentless.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugs, "I just know what I want."
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Agatha hums and steps closer, peeking over Rio’s shoulder. “Careful, Daddy Death. You’re burning the eggs.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio jolts, realizing the scrambled eggs are crisping around the edges. “Damn it!” She quickly lowers the heat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha wraps her arms around Rio’s waist, pressing a kiss to the back of her neck. “Focus, mi amor. Breakfast isn’t going to cook itself.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio leans into her touch, laughing softly. “You’re distracting me on purpose.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And what if I am?” Agatha murmurs, her lips brushing Rio’s ear.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Before Rio can respond, Agatha pulls out her phone and begins reading again, “Listen to this one,” she says, barely containing her laughter. "@mommyagatha: Agatha just ended the internet by claiming Lady Death with a waist grab and the thirstiest photo in history. We're done here.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio pauses mid pancake flip, “Thirstiest photo in history?” She looks over her shoulder, her eyes gleaming. “You hear that, mi amor, I'm so hot I broke the internet again. Lucky lady you are.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You're the lucky lady,” Agatha teases, squeezing Rio's waist. “Pretty sure they're talking about my moves, not yours”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio laughs, putting the spatula down and thinking around to face her fully. “Is that a challenge, Mrs. Death?” She leans, lips brushing Agatha's cheek. “I think we're gonna a have to take another photo to settle this once and for all”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You are a chaotic god after all,” Agatha mutters, but the smile tugging at her lips betrays her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Before Rio can respond, something infuriating by the look in her eyes, Billy walks in. He pauses mid-step, eyeing his moms with a mix of annoyance and resignation. Without a word, he turns and walks back out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio bursts out laughing, glancing at Agatha. “He takes after you, you know. With the dramatics.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pinches her side playfully and steps back. “I’ll get the kids. Try not to burn the rest of breakfast.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s laughter follows her out. “And if I do, we start working on baby number three, right?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I thought we already were,” Agatha calls over her shoulder, grinning as she hears Rio drop the spatula.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is still laughing when she reaches the boys bedrooms, she knocks on Billy's door first.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Teen, get your ass downstairs for breakfast,” she calls, hearing, him groan dramatically, like he's always doing lately.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A second later, Billy opens the door, already rolling his eyes at her. Agatha snorts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do I have to?” He asks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha resists the urge to ruffle his hair, his curls pointing in different directions. “Yes, mister. Your mama spent her morning making you breakfast even though she has a show tonight, so play nice.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy sighs. “Fine. But you two need to behave,” he mutters stepping back into his bedroom, surely to get his phone. “Want me to get Nicky?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is already crossing the hall to Nicky's door. The pirate sign with his name is crooked. She'll have to fix it later. “I got it,” she shouts back, “You check if your mama needs help”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She opens Nicky’s door carefully, avoiding the toys and books strewn across the room. A lesson about cleaning up after playtime is long overdue.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Pulling open the window, she lets light stream through his green forest-themed curtains.  Agatha turns to see her little boy sleeping soundly, stuffed bunny tucked under his chin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky looks so young still. Agatha can almost make out his baby features under the morning light. She remembers the first time she held him in her arms, loving him instantly. It was a lot like the moment she first laid eyes on Billy, his soft dark curls and his gentle smile, and knew that was her son.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She blames Rio for her thoughts, all that talking about having another baby.  Agatha loves her boys, but the more she thinks about it, the more she hates to admit that adding a third to their little chaotic family doesn’t sound so bad.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky stirs, pulling her from her thoughts. She sits on the edge of his bed, massaging his back slowly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mommy,” he croaks, scooting closer, eyes still shut as he curls into her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Wake up, bud,” she whispers. “Mama and Billy are finishing breakfast”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At the mention of food, Nicky opens his eyes, giving her a toothy grin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But I’m so tired, Mommy,” he protests, tilting his head to meet her gaze. “I think I should get breakfast in bed.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha tickles his side, and he jerks away, laughing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Would you look at that,” she says seriously. “Not looking so tired now.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky giggles, climbing to sit beside her and throwing his arms around her. “Carry me, Mommy?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha picks him up, holding him against her and kisses his cheek.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Maybe another kid is not such a bad idea.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She considers it as she makes her way downstairs, with Nicky's arms wrapped tight around her neck in a way that makes her think about the state of her vocal chords. But Nicky is cute, so she lets him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Motherhood has ruined her priorities. She's sure Rio would forgive her if she were to tell her of her thoughts. Motherhood has ruined them both.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When they reach the kitchen, she pauses in the doorway. Nicky tucks his face into her neck, releasing her airway just enough and giggles quietly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio and Billy are laughing as they arrange the plates.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “William, do not parent me,” Rio says, grinning as she steals bacon from his plate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy slaps her hand away, “Apparently I have to.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I already have your mother for that,” Rio mutters, earning a barely contained laugh from Agatha.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They finish plating and pouring drinks, but before Agatha can announce herself, Billy speaks again, something she doesn't catch but it prompts Rio, who groans.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “A gemini,” she exclaims in what feels like the start of a rant, making Billy laugh. “Can you believe people think that! Just from my hand in one photo!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha remembers the tweet, a fan guessing Rio’s sign based on the photo she posted after the gala. Rio hasn’t let it go since.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “To be fair, the whole secret identity thing is very Gemini of you,” Billy says with a smirk, and then he adds, “I wonder what they will make out of your abs. A pisces, maybe?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio turns to him wielding the spatula like a weapon, “William Vidal Harkness-”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Harkness Vidal,” Billy and Agatha quickly back at the same time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio glances between her wife and son, her expression one of mock betrayal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Daddy!” Nicky yells suddenly, wiggling out of Agatha’s arms and running to Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio catches him with ease, balancing him on her hip while holding a plate of pancakes in her other hand. She presses a kiss to his forehead. “At least someone in this house gets me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha and Billy's share a look and laugh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Let’s eat before you have to go, you goof,” Agatha says, tugging Rio toward a chair and sending Nicky to his spot at the table.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio leans in and kisses her sweet and brief. Billy groans anyways and Rio sighs exasperated.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I want him banned from my shows.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha steps into the backstage changing room, and Alice’s eyes widen as she takes in her appearance.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Damn, Agatha. If you kill my bandmate I expect payment,” Alice says, smirking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don't be so dramatic, Alice. I swear you weren't like this before her,” Agatha replies, though her reflection in the mirror looks smug as she finishes her makeup.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice chuckles, “I could say the same about you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha meets Alice’s gaze through the mirror and glares, “Don't you have somewhere to be?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hands raised in mock surrender, Alice heads for the door. “I’ll catch you on stage.” She pauses, thinking. “You sure we can tell Rio you’re coming out early?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s smirk grows. “I’m sure.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Shaking her head, Alice mutters as she leaves, “I leave the band and still get bossed around by you. Unbelievable.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes fondly. She’s missed playing with Alice. there’s something about her energy onstage that no one else in Sisters of the Craft has managed to replace. She finishes her makeup, adjusts her leather jacket, and heads out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha watches the first half of The Court’s show from a private booth with Billy. The venue is smaller than the arenas she’s used to, but it’s packed, the crowd buzzing with excitement. Rio and Alice take the stage, doing their little dramatic number by the piano.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy seems to enjoy himself, despite his boyfriend’s absence. He sings along, grinning even as he shakes his head when Agatha joins in, clearly embarrassed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     During intermission, after Rio cracks jokes about her abs and Alice insists she’s just as ripped, Agatha slips backstage to join the band for the second half of the show.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She watches from the wings as Rio settles behind the drums, her face focused on the beat. At Alice’s signal, the music swells, and Agatha strides onto the stage, singing in perfect harmony with Alice. The crowd erupts, their cheers growing louder when Rio notices her, her eyes taking in Agatha clad in leather and dark makeup.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Holy fuck,” the words blurt out of Rio’s mouth and she loses the beat entirely. She laughs, shaking her head and picking up the rhythm again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When the song ends, Agatha throws an arm over Alice’s shoulder, grinning at the crowd. “Hey, fans of The Court. I hope you don't mind me stopping by to say hi.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The audience roars their approval and Agatha turns to Rio who hasn't moved from behind the drums, still staring a her in disbelief.. Her Lady Death makeup only makes her slack-jawed expression funnier.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crowd cheers and laughs, calling Lady Death’s name. Probably surprised she's kept quiet this long.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, damn,” Rio says finally, her eyes finding Agatha's just as the big screen behind them focuses on them, “I mean this wasn't a kids show, anyways”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha smirks. “Hey, hot stuff”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crowd goes wild at the callback, Alice laughing as she teases, “She’s got you there, Lady Death.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio groans, covering her face with her arm before pointing at Agatha. “This is not the outfit she showed me, okay? I deserve a minute to take it in.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’ve had two,” Agatha quips. “Should I come over there?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice steps in, joking, “Anyone else feel like a third wheel tonight?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Laughing, Rio gestures for Agatha to join her, “Come here, you”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The moment Agatha is close enough, Rio covers her mic and wraps her free hand aroud Agatha's waist. ”Fuck, babe,” she murmurs, as her fingers trail over the leather.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You look good too,” Agatha smirks, brushing Rio’s sweaty hair from her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio clears her throat, releasing her mic and addressing the audience. “Alright, let’s all remember I’m a cool bad boy. My wife is just insanely hot.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You tell em, baby,” she says with a smirk. She can see Rio flushing all the way to her neck under the Lady Death face paint.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Death, you're killing your reputation right now,” Alice jokes from her place by the piano, already set up for the next number.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio giggles, a soft, un-Lady Death-like sound, her hold on Agatha tightening before she releases her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I mean, leather pants,” Rio says after a minute, she turns to the audience pointing at Agatha, who's moving back to the center of the stage. “What the hell, right?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The audience cheers wildly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha laughs, encouraging the crowd to keep cheering, then with a sly smirk she adds, “To our teen in the audience, I'm so sorry.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shakes her head, picking up her drumming sticks, “Here's our special guest tonight, my beautiful wifeAgatha Harkness!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha bows with a laugh, she can't help herself from teasing her wife one last time, “Happy to be here, I even dressed the part”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio smiles, but Agatha doesn't miss the way she grips her drumming sticks as she signals the band, “Don't even get me started”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The rest of the set flies by. Agatha relishes the energy of the crowd and the fun of playing with Alice again. She does wonder briefly if anyone will pick up on her and the Knight of Wands harmonizing a bit too well for it being the first time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They close with the Ballad of the Witches Road. It's Rio's version, and Agatha secretly enjoys getting to sing it with her wife on stage like it was always meant to be. She's pretty sure people will not make the connection between Lady Death and the Ballad's credited songwriter Rio Vidal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They share a brief kiss before she leaves the stage, she jokes it's because it will ruin Lady Death's iconic face paint and Rio remarks they are saving that for after the show is over.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Back in the booth, Agatha sits beside Billy, who keeps his hood pulled low. When she laughs at his attempt to hide, he mutters, “I hate you,” before laying his head on her shoulder. Agatha doesn’t move, knowing he’ll bolt the moment she acknowledges him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They watch the rest of the show like that, and when Rio and Alice exit the stage he stands up stretching, a tired smile on his face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “C'mon, mom, let's go,” he says excitedly, tugging her up, and Agatha sighs and follows him backstage.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy goes straight to Rio, hugging her and the two share some words. Alice slides next to her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You still got it, Harkness,” she smirks, “It was fun playing with you again”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ditch Rio and rejoin Sisters of the Craft,” she mutters, and Alice laughs, slapping her arm. “Worth a shot.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Later, after the crew wraps up, Agatha finally gets a private moment with Rio. Alice takes Billy off to find food, and Rio approaches Agatha with a knowing look.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How dare you?” Rio whispers, pinning Agatha gently against the nearest wall. Her fingers trace the leather jacket. “Looking this good onstage where I can’t touch you like I want to.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha laughs, hands on Rio’s shoulders to keep some distance. “Save that energy for when we get home.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles, the tension easing as she brushes a kiss over Agatha’s cheek. “Yes, ma’am.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Before she can step back, Agatha pulls her in for a proper kiss, cupping her face. Rio responds eagerly, their moment interrupted only by Alice clearing her throat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alice! You're back quickly,” Rio says nonchalant, “Hey, son”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is about to turn when she sees what her fingers have done Rio's make up and has to hide her laughter.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think this moment deserves to be immortalized,” Alice chimes in from behind Agatha, and Billy groans.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice ignores him, and takes the photo, immediately sending it to them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They go home after that, Billy keeps his eyes on his phone the whole time and Agatha shares a look with Rio, both of them laughing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio opens her phone then, and shows her the picture as they stop at a red light.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha can admit Alice is an okay photographer on top of being a singer, pianist and composer. The photo shows Rio's messy makeup from Agatha's hands, the skull a blurry gray mess and Agatha's nose and chin smudged in gray paint as well.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Y'know,” Rio says, and Agatha catches her mischievous look out of the corner of her eye. “I think I should post this.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha smirks, “You're too slow, baby. I already did.”
     <br/>
     <br/>

     Agatha wakes up alone in bed.
     <em>
      Guess nap time isn't sacred anymore,
     </em>
     she thinks to herself as she gets up, stretching and reaching for her robe.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She heads downstairs and finds Rio on the couch watching cartoons. A half-eaten grilled cheese sandwich and a dinosaur plastic cup sit on the table, while Nicky sleeps soundly, curled up on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks up, catching sight of her, and brings a finger to her lips, signaling her to keep quiet. Agatha approaches carefully and slides onto the couch beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry we left,” Rio murmurs, “This guy couldn't sleep so I made him a snack and we watched some tv.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I feel very abandoned,” Agatha whispers back, earning a fond eye roll from Rio, who leans in to kiss her gently.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Brushing Nicky’s hair back, Agatha remembers something she’d meant to tell Rio. She smiles to herself, hiding it on Rio's side.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll get him to bed,” she motions toward Nicky, “Make me a sandwich?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nods, and soon enough, Agatha carries their sleeping boy upstairs to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky never sleeps well when neither one of them is home, which isn't very often, but Agatha suffers through it anyways. It's why she drags everyone (minus Billy because he's a teen and therefore too cool) to take a nap after Rio's shows. The bed is big enough to fit them all three and Nicky enjoys cuddling with them. Agatha is determined to enjoy it before he too grows up.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She gently lays Nicky in his bed, tucks his stuffed animal beside him and kisses his forehead, before heading back downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio is picking up toys and putting them in a basket when Agatha returns. On the table there's a grilled cheese sandwich and two glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Missed one,” Agatha teases, pointing at a stray dinosaur toy.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio huffs, picking it up and dunking it in the basket before collapsing dramatically onto the couch beside Agatha, throwing her arms around her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That kid is too much work,” she mutters, her words muffled against Agatha's side.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you wanted another one,” she quips with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sits up, eyeing her suspiciously, “Still do.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hums noncommittally and Rio gets that look in her eyes, restless energy thruming through her, waiting for her to say more.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anyways,” Agatha says, deflecting with a smile. “Did you finally get to check your phone?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio has been avoiding it since waking up, too embarrassed to face the internet after the show and Agatha's relentless teasing this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I checked my email,” Rio admits, her tone betraying her reluctance to talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raises an eyebrow, encouraging her to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighs, looking flushed. “I think we got different emails this time. Hela said she spared me the tweets because my ego probably couldn't handle the carnage of my reputation.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite herself Agatha laughs, and Rio groans, hiding her face in her wife's shoulder.  Her arms stay wrapped around Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Poor baby,” Agatha teases, kissing Rio’s warm cheeks. “I thought you did great, once you recovered.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop it!” Rio slaps her hands away, but she laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lets her recover, and immediately pounces again. “Let me read you some of my favorite tweets?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes search her face for a beat, “What do I get out of it?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Well at least she's willing to negotiate.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pauses mid-scroll on her phone, her glasses perched on her nose as she considers it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let's go out for dinner.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once again, Rio's eyes search her face, trying to read her intentions. Luckily Agatha has a decade worth of experience keeping her wife in the dark when she wants to surprise her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't overthink it, love,” she murmurs, bringing their lips together briefly. “We deserve nice things. Let me take you out, and we'll figure out how you pay me back later.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nods, a smile playing on her lips at Agatha’s words, giving up on her quest to find out what her wife is after. “Deal. I'll text Hela to get us a table somewhere nice and private.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, listen to this one,” Agatha says, once dinner plans have been settled, her voice dripping with amusement. “Lady Death: I’m a bad boy. Also Lady Death: forgets her entire personality the second Agatha looks at her”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs softly next to her, her cheeks suspiciously pink. “I do forget I was Lady Death for a minute there.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Next one?” Agatha asks, and Rio nods silently against her side.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lady Death was trying so hard to stay cool, and then Agatha kissed her, smudged her makeup, and posted THAT photo.” Agatha stares at Rio with a devilish smile. “Any comment on that?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs, running a hand over her face, “The internet is never going to let me live this down.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirks, “Sweetheart, I will never let you live it down,” and then moves onto the next tweet.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leans over to snatch Agatha’s phone, but Agatha holds it out of reach, her grin mischievous.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop it,” Rio warns, but she smiles, and that's all the consent Agatha needs.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, no, no, this one is too good not to share,” Agatha said, eyes scanning the screen. “You don’t understand. I WAS THERE. I saw Lady Death forget how to drum because her WIFE walked on stage in LEATHER PANTS. She literally said, Holy fuck into her mic. I AM NOT OKAY.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “The holy fuck was warranted,” Rio murmurs, her pout betrayed by a smile, “How will I recover, my love?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “By letting me remind you that you’re adorable when you’re flustered,” Agatha teases, leaning over to kiss Rio’s temple.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groans dramatically, a grin breaking through her mock embarrassment. “Adorable? I thought I was supposed to be your bad boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you are, you have the range,” Agatha says, her tone playful as she pulls up another tweet. “Last one: ‘The way she grabbed Agatha by the waist like her LIFE depended on it… Lady Death? More like Lady Whipped.’”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of answering, Rio drops herself back on the couch, hands covering her face. Agatha observes her fondly, patting her leg.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You okay there, bud?” she asks, tone full of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You come out on stage, looking just–” Rio gestures vaguely towards Agatha. “You're hot, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her name comes out breathy, like she can't believe she has to explain this. Agatha smirks, leaning forward, arms caressing Rio's sides in a distracting manner.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you don't play fair games,” Rio finishes, moving her hands off her face to wrap around Agatha's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I play to win,” Agatha says, lowering herself on top of Rio with a teasing smirk. “Want me to tell them to stop?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wraps her arms around her. “You’ll make it worse.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That could be fun,” Agatha murmurs, her words brushing Rio’s ear. “If this is the outcome.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t get an answer, Rio pulls their mouths closer to kiss her. Agatha knows it's mostly to shut her up but she has no notes on her wife's strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shifts on the couch, deepening the kiss and sliding one leg between Agatha's, making her gasp and break the kiss. Her mouth trails down her neck, her hands pulling at her robe, and Agatha moans, letting herself be drowned by the feeling of her wife's touch–.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mom, mama,” comes Billy's voice from the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha jumps, but Rio's arms wrap around her, halting her escape. She kisses her one last time, smiling against her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We'll pick this up later,” she promises, sliding off the couch with a satisfied smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groans, collapsing back against the couch in mock defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Eat your sandwich, my love,” Rio throws over her shoulder as she heads to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sits up, adjusting her clothes back into place, and grabs her sandwich. She starts laughing then, the absurdity of the situation hitting her all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy comes barging into the living room a couple minutes later, his posture tense, lips drawn in a tight line. He plops down next to her on the couch, and motions for the sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're back early,” Agatha says, passing him half the cold sandwich, studying his face.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy shrugs, biting into the sandwich with more force than necessary. “Eddie and I had a fight.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who was just coming back with another glass, stops mid-step., “Do you want me to fight him?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It makes Billy laugh. He turns to her with a soft look in his eyes. “I think he was just upset that his parents didn't let him go to the show last night.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio joins them on the couch then, sitting next to Agatha and reaches across her to ruffle Billy's hair.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll fight them, then,” she says, tone mock serious. “Legally, it works best for me that way.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slaps Rio’s thigh, trying and failing to suppress her smile. She turns to Billy, schooling her features to something more appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Couples fight,” she says, “You're mama and I fight, but we're still together. It's what you do after what matters. Just give him some time and he'll come around, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy nods slowly, “Thanks, mom.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffs from the other side of the couch, and Billy laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And thank you, mama.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     He leaves after a while, heading upstairs and Rio asks him to wake up his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Billy is out of sight, Rio turns back to her with a smile equal parts fond and wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're hot when you're on mother mode,” she says, her tone teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha is too taken aback by the words to do anything but laugh That seems to have been Rio’s goal, because she starts laughing too, the sound warm and infectious.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're…hot when you're threatening to fight people to defend our son, too,” Agarha admits when they've calmed down. “In a very high school jock kind of way.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They dissolve into laughter again, Rio leaning her head on Agatha's shoulder
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Y'know,” Rio murmurs, her voice low and playful, “We were rudely interrupted earlier…”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirks, running her fingers through Rio's hair. “Well there's always tonight if you play your cards right.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They don't usually go out. With work, kids and being famous they don't really have the chance or the energy. It helps that Rio is a great cook and Agatha is an expert at making everyone's favorite food and not much else.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, they both jump at the chance of going out for dinner. Sharon sends in a nanny and Hela gets them a driver, which is her version of allowing them to get a little drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The reservation is at a restaurant they've been to once before with friends, but it's known around for having good food and discreet staff, which works for them since Rio pouted her way out of wearing her signature face paint. Agatha was only half joking about it, but she is a little giddy making her way into the restaurant with her wife by her side, face bare and grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio takes her hand as their lead to their table, delighted to be able to touch her publicly without causing a scene. Agatha laughs to herself thinking that in the worst case scenario someone will think she's having an affair with her wife.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha orders them wine and slides on the booth besides Rio, wrapping an arm around her and kissing her sweetly. She intends it to be a simple peck, but Rio captures her lips again when she pulls away.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Careful,” Agatha warns her, voice teasing, “You're gonna get us kicked out for public indecency.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shakes her head laughing, and moves back to put the barest of distance between them, just as the waiter returns with their wine.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once they get their food they're left alone, Agatha pours them wine again and raises her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “To my very hot wife,” she says, her grin playful, “The very talented, sexy drummer, rockstar, father of my children…Lady Whipped.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs, taking a sip, “You're terrible.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiles. Their easy banter has always been one of her favorite aspects of their relationship. Warmth flutters in her chest as she thinks of the life they’ve built together, something far beyond her wildest dreams when she first broke into music as a teenager.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Lately, she’s been thinking about their family, thanks to Rio’s playful comments about having a third child. What started as amused reluctance has slowly morphed into something real, something she could want.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're having a big think there, mi amor.” Rio says, breaking her away from her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clears her throat, taking Rio's hand. “Let's step outside for a minute?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio studies her briefly, then nods. She leads them to the terrace. The night is chilly, the city’s hum providing a steady backdrop.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've been thinking,” Rio begins, her voice tinged with humor. “I think I could turn this around, y'know, the damage to my reputation.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turns to her, lifting a brow in question and smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I could be a bad boy rockstar who is secretly obsessed with her wife.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio seems so serious about it, Agatha can't help but laugh, resting her head on Rio's chest.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's literally you already, babe,” she says, and Rio's arms wrap around her waist as she too laughs.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, there goes my rebound plan.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha steps back, pulling a box of cigarettes from her pocket. Rio gives her a look as she lights one.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've been thinking too,” she says, bringing the cigarette to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's with sapphics and smoking?” Rio asks, accepting the offered cigarete. “Do we all wanna die or–”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hands,” Agatha interrupts, laughing at Rio’s expression as her gaze shifts between her face and her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leans closer, lighting her cigarette with Agatha’s. “Tell me your thoughts.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha exhales slowly, silent for a moment. Rio tilts her head back, blowing smoke circles until laughter breaks her concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can’t believe I actually want a third kid with you,” Agatha blurts out.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chokes, turning to her with wide eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grabs her by the lapels, laughing. “I planned to tell you in a less chaotic way, but this feels fitting.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “So my plan worked?” Rio asks, her smile teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shoves her playfully. “You had no plan, just an idea and a lot of enthusiasm.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio takes her hands, leading her away from the ledge until Agatha’s back hits the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want a little girl,” Rio says softly. “With your eyes and your hair. I really like your hair.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasps as Rio kisses her neck, her words catching in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let's go home,” she manages, her hands tracing slow patterns over Rio’s jacket. “Now.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio takes a step back, laughing softly and takes Agatha’s hand. “You don't wanna finish your cigarette? It might be the last one for a while…”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha narrows her eyes but returns to the terrace to finish the cigarette. When she looks up, Rio is leaning against the wall, smug and proud. Agatha shakes her head, stubbing out the cigarette before taking her wife's hand and heading inside.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They return to their table to ask for the check.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We should go out for drinks with our bandmates, too,” Rio suggests, smirking.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pokes her side, “What was it you say in that tweet, about getting me pregnant? Maybe I'll get you pregnant.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio throws her head back in laughter, and Agatha watches with a fond smile.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She loves this woman.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     Agatha wakes to the incessant buzzing of a phone, but she can’t be bothered to move.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The buzzing doesn’t stop, though, and soon Rio’s phone joins in from the other side of the bed. Agatha groans, pulling the blanket tighter and poking Rio in the side.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Babe, your phone.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stirs, shifting closer under the covers instead of getting up. Agatha rolls her eyes fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “My love, I will push you off this bed if you don’t get your phone under control.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     That earns a groan and a small laugh from Rio, who blindly reaches for her phone without letting go of Agatha. Her effort only results in the phone tumbling off the nightstand.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dammit,” Rio mutters, exhaling dramatically as she drags herself out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha props herself up on her elbow to watch Rio in the dim light of their room. She’s wearing an old Sisters of the Craft tour shirt, one Agatha has tried (unsuccessfully) to get rid of more than once. She has to admit, though, it looks cute on her wife.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flops back onto the bed with a huff. “Twenty messages from Hela. Five missed calls…” She turns to Agatha with a frown. “I didn’t do anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha almost laughs but resists. Curiosity gets the better of her, and she reaches for her own phone. The screen barely shows Rio’s face in her lock screen behind all the notifications flooding in.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, something happened,” she mutters, and Rio drops her head onto Agatha’s shoulder to peer at her phone.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t get any notifications since Hela locked me out of all my accounts,” Rio grumbles.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hums noncommittally. She’s never been, and likely never will be, a fan of her wife’s manager. It takes all of two seconds after opening Twitter to figure out what the fuss is about.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The photos from the restaurant terrace don’t look too bad at first glance, until Agatha reminds herself that people don’t know Rio is her wife. That is what makes the pictures look…bad.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Like she’s cheating on Lady Death, her wife, with Rio Vidal, who is also her wife, but only publicly known as her band’s longtime producer and collaborator. The story practically writes itself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I look cool as fuck blowing smoke circles,” Rio says, pointing at herself in one of the photos. She laughs, successfully breaking Agatha’s spiraling thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pokes her side under the blanket. “You forget I’m publicly married to Lady Death, not Rio Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowns, mulling it over. “Well, as Rio Vidal, I have to say, you should’ve married me. I mean, look how hot we look together.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raises an eyebrow, fixing her wife with a mock glare. The stare lasts maybe ten seconds before she breaks into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They scroll through the pictures together, and Agatha can’t form a single coherent thought about them.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, we have to frame this one,” Rio says, scooting closer to zoom in on a picture of herself lighting her cigarette with Agatha's. “Follow-up question: do I always look at you like you hung the stars in the sky?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughs, taking the phone from Rio’s hands and dropping it on the nightstand. Her other hand holds Rio in place by the shoulder. When she turns back, Rio’s giving her a knowing look, tugging her to lie on top of her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re being very silly,” Agatha comments, just as her phone buzzes with a call from Hela, saved under the apt nickname She-Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leans over to decline the call without hesitation. “We’ve got at least half an hour before she jumps the fence and comes for us.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Laughing, Agatha leans in, capturing her wife’s lips. “Don’t tell Lady Death,” she whispers, her breath brushing Rio’s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s laugh is warm and breathy. “Shut up.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Am I cheating right now?” Agatha teases, her voice light and innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolls her eyes, pouting. “I’m literally your wife.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m cheating on my wife with my wife,” Agatha says with a mischievous grin.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wraps her hands around Agatha’s arms, pulling her closer, clearly intending to kiss her into silence. Agatha gathers she’s not upset, just flustered. Just the way she likes it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We should post something,” Agatha mutters, resisting Rio’s pull just long enough to be annoying. “Give the people something to really talk about.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally done with Agatha’s antics, Rio uses her full strength to pull her flush against her, their faces mere inches apart.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shut. Up,” Rio says, her voice full of mock exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only laughs, leaning in to kiss her wife again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After at least five more missed calls, Rio picks up the phone and agrees they meet with Hela. Which is why family breakfast is interrupted by the obnoxious roar of Hela's bike.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky leaps off his chair, intent on running to the window to get a close look of his favorite aunt, but Rio is quicker. She easily catches him and sits him back down, throwing a smile as a thumbs up Agatha's way.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently the press is nearby, knowing the neighborhood they live in, but not their exact address. Agatha has been on edge since Hela let that slip. Now everyone is on house arrest until they reach a solution.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, Billy is who had the most to say about it. Give it to the teenager to make everything about himself. They are apparently ruining his life because he won't be able to see his boyfriend today. Because video calls don't count. Such a drama queen that boy.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha carries the sour mood to the office where Hela sits too comfortably behind the desk, busy setting up her laptop to the projector. Apparently she came with a presentation ready. Who knew she had the time or the skills.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She glances up briefly, holding out a hand. “Pass me the cord, Vidal. I had one of my assistants put this together. If it doesn’t work, they’re fired.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Charming,” Rio mutters, tossing her the cable.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha takes a spot by the couch, Rio sliding in besides her. Hela moves stuff around to make room for herself before the screen, and then begins.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The first slide of the presentation reads: THIS IS A FUCKING NIGHTMARE.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorts, burying her laughter in Rio’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     To her credit, Hela just rolls with it. “I woke up from a pleasant dream of ruling over the underworld to a torrent of calls and emails,” she deadpans, moving to the next slide.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ‘I DON'T GET PAID ENOUGH FOR THIS’ is plastered across the screen, and this time even Rio has trouble holding her laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hela,” she teases gently, “pay your damn employees.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela presses on, ignoring the jab as she advances to another slide: the photos.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, here we go.” She clicks for the next slide, showing the photos they had seen online in the morning and before any of them could comment, ruthlessly moved onto the next one showing the new site's cover of the photos. “I'll go to the point because even a blind person could see what this looks like. This is a full brown scandal, and we have to get something out. Soon.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “They're good photos,” Agatha argues, just to annoy Hela.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela narrows her eyes, but keeps quiet moving onto the next slide, full of posts and comments from across social media. She reads a few of them out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      How are people missing the point that this IS Lady Death?! Like, her jawline is still doing all the work even without the face paint. WAKE UP, SHEEPLE.”
     </em>
     she reads, rolling her eyes. “I absolutely do not get paid enough to complement your jaw, but the gays are doing it for free. I will not tell you how many compilations I've seen of your jaw with and without makeup, but that's a thing now.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rubs her chin, smirking. “Can't blame people for having eyes, Hela.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela ignores her, swiftly moving on. "
     <em>
      Rio Vidal’s identity is already giving major Lady Death vibes. These two aren’t fooling anyone. Agatha’s married, but I’m not convinced Rio's just her ‘friend’.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilts her head. “I mean she's not,” she counters.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela sighs, “I know you can see the problem. Sure ninety percent of the people are simply seeing this as a case of Agatha having too much chemistry with her producer, worse case scenario she's a cheater. But some people are putting two and two together about Lady Death's identity.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She lets her statement sink in. Agatha doesn't really care if the world knows, but Rio's sharp intake of breath tells another story.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As the presentation continues, Agatha makes an effort to focus and tries to consider it from her wife's perspective. Agatha has always been the one to want privacy in their relationship, to the public at least. The people who matter have known she's married to Rio since they got hitched on a weekend in Las Vegas.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She knows Rio has enjoyed the privacy of not being known as Agatha Harkness’ wife granted her. Rio was able to focus on her career as a producer, writing and composing for other artists and then for herself when she and Alice decided to finally start The Court, but Rio was never about the fame, unlike her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And now, looking at her wife's professional account she can't help but smile, because it's almost adorable to see the contrast between Lady Death, the rockstar, and her wife. Rio describes herself as ‘wife, mother and award winning producer’, ‘Yale and Julliard alum.’ It's so quintessentially Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you really have to write your entire life in your bio?” Hela complains, gesturing at the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ignore her. You look cute, baby,” Agatha says softly, leaning over to kiss her wife's cheek. “I like this bio better than the other, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, yes,” Rio says, her smile almost outshined by the blush on her cheeks. “Daddy Death. Rockstar, superstar, wife stealer. I know you liked Daddy.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did not,” Agatha counters, scoffing. “You're giving soft, family-oriented music nerd here. Very you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's so rude, my love.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pokes her nose, “I know who I married, Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you're done,” Hela interrupts them, arms crossed over her chest, glaring at them. “Rio, you just need to come out at this point. It would be way easier than–”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The word is quiet but firm. Both Agatha and Hela stare at her, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela uncrosses her arms, then crosses them again. “I'll get the team online. We can discuss this.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     What follows is an hour long debate between people who's paychecks they pay about how their lives would be easier if Rio would just reveal herself. Agatha stays quiet at first, trusting Rio to hold her ground. But when some assistant or something of equal non-importance has the audacity to say ‘does Ms. Vidal need to look at Ms. Harkness like that in every photo? There's only so much spinning we can do with this’. Agatha snaps.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “ENOUGH,” she barks, her voice cuts through the team like a whip. Silence falls.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When every eye is on her, Agatha takes a deep calming breath, and speaks, her words carefully measured. “Everyone out. Hela, you too.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela groans but does as told, stepping out of the office and taking the laptop with her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When the door closes, Agatha turns to Rio, sitting beside her on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you want to do baby?” She asks, her voice softer now that's just the two of them.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio exhales, the weight of the meeting pressing down on her. “I'm not ready for everyone to know who I am. Not like this.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nods once, “Okay. So we do that, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Leaning in, she kisses her, and too quickly she steps back. “I'll go talk to them. We'll figure it out. I promise.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gives her a small smile, her grip on Agatha's hand tightening. “Thank you”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Always.” Agatha kisses her again, then stands up. “Why don't you take Nicky upstairs, you two can watch some tv. I'll go when it's fixed. Also once that prick has been fired.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's laughter follows her as steps outside. Her protectiveness and anger fueling every step.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha makes her way to her family hours later. She follows the sounds of laughter to Rio's home studio. Inside, she finds her wife sitting behind her drum set, Nicky perched on her lap holding the drumsticks. Billy sits next to them with a guitar in hand, barely holding in his laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do we have here?” Agatha asks, as she steps into the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky, taking advantage of the distraction, bangs on the drums with all the enthusiasm of a rockstar, grinning at her proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ve got a little drummer in the making,” Rio says, shooting Agatha a knowing look. “Just need one more, and we’ve got ourselves a band. I’m thinking
     <em>
      Retirement Plan
     </em>
     as the name.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorts, grabbing another stool and sitting next to Billy. “We can do better than that, right,  teen?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy hums thoughtfully, giving her a moment to turn to Rio and make an exaggerated throat-slitting gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mommy!” Nicky squeals, jumping off Rio’s lap. He stumbles a little but eventually reaches Agatha, who scoops him up with ease. Nicky grabs her face in his small hands and grins. “You said that’s a bad thing. You gotta have a time out!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughs. “Does it help my case if mama deserved it?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky glances back at Rio, who immediately pouts. When he turns back to Agatha, he shakes his head solemnly. “No. Say sorry, Mommy.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha throws Rio a sharp glare, but Rio grins mischievously, sticking her tongue out the moment Nicky isn’t looking.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “So sorry, my love,” Agatha says, her voice dripping with sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about
     <em>
      Coven True
     </em>
     ?” Billy offers suddenly, steering the conversation back to its original track.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha and Rio exchange a look.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's a good name, kid.” Rio looks almost impressed and Billy blushes a little.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nods, and turns to their eldest. “Billy, can you take your brother to watch some tv? Your mama and I need to discuss your future band plans.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy glances between the two of them before nodding. “For what is worth, I liked the pictures,” he says as he takes Nicky's hand. He smiles then, teasing. “Smoking is bad though. Do better, moms.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When the door closes behind them, Agatha stretches out her hand toward Rio, silently beckoning her to move from behind the drums. Together, they walk to the couch. The moment they sit, Rio throws her arms around Agatha, burying her face in her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “How did it go?” Rio mumbles, words muffled against her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wraps an arm around her, holding her close. “We reached an understanding in which I don't skin your manager and she fires that asshole assistant's assistant.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs, the sound warm and light. “And the other thing?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Right, the other thing. The scandal. The second one. And to think she used to pride herself on keeping her private life private.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hela drafted some statements for us to pick from,” she says, searching Rio's face for her reaction. “We post one in our socials and then they'll handle it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lets out a long sigh and sits up. “It's gonna have to be one hell of a statement to quiet the people with the way we look at eachother.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirks, leaning back comfortably. “I mean, if people want to think I’m having a secret affair with my wife, I don’t hate it.” Her smirk deepens as she looks Rio up and down. “I mean, look at you. So cute.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio huffs, her expression almost comically exasperated as she sits there in a pair of shorts and a dinosaur shirt she’d bought from the children’s section to match with Nicky.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that what the people are saying about me?” she asks, raising a brow.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugs, her earlier words still ringing true. “I know who I married. We can check what they're saying if you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hesitates, thinking about it for a long minute before nodding. Hela might want the statements out as soon as possible, but Agatha has never been good at following orders. Besides, she’s curious to see Rio’s reaction to the way the social media conversation has shifted over the last few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulls up her phone, and Rio leans in to read.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Sorry Rio Vidal, she doesn't belong to you
     </em>
     ,” Rio reads, her jaw clenching instinctively. “Yes, she does.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha almost laughs, biting her lip to keep from teasing her too much. “That is true.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Damn straight it is.” Rio shoots her smile, before scrolling to the next post.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha looking at Rio like she’s the only woman in the world while she blows smoke circles. Daddy Death, you okay?
     </em>
     ,” Rio laughs, shaking her head. “Probably not.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “My love.” Agatha reaches out, gently tilting Rio’s chin up so their eyes meet. “Are you hearing yourself?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, why?” Rio asks, her tone utterly unbothered as she dives back into the screen.
     <em>
      “Imagine cheating on a literal goth goddess with a music producer. Agatha, you’re doing this all WRONG.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hums, moving onto the next tweet. “
     <em>
      Rio Vidal looking at Agatha like a sick love puppy? SAME but also girl go away.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watches Rio’s profile, noting how her wife processes the words. She leans in and kisses her temple, holding back her own thoughts. “What’s on your mind?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “They're being mean,” Rio says, a small pout forming on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “They’re also defending you,” Agatha counters, searching her face for a reaction. “You’re Lady Death, babe.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leans into her shoulder, looking almost defeated. “But you’re my wife, and they’re making fun of me for looking like I’m in love with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are in love with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nods emphatically, her pout morphing into something much softer. This time, Agatha can’t hold back her laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright then, let me spell this out for you,” she says, wrapping an arm around her wife. “You’re in love with me. I tolerate you just enough because you look like that. We’re married, we have two kids–”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Three soon, right?” Rio interrupts, grinning mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s attempt at seriousness falters, a smile tugging at her lips, but she powers through. “Two kids currently, more pending. My point is, you goof, why are you wasting time on this when you have me right here?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, very audaciously, pretends to think about it, her hand on her chin in mock contemplation. Agatha is already grabbing a pillow to throw at her when Rio finally puts the phone away.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s post those dumb statements,” Rio says, standing up and holding her hand out to Agatha. “Then we’ll have dinner with the boys. And after that, we’ll head to bed and have a long talk about that third kid we’re absolutely having.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolls her eyes but can’t help smiling as she takes Rio’s hand and lets herself be pulled up. “You’re insufferable, Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And yet, here you are,” Rio teases, leading her out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>

     I see you internet sleuths, you've got some things right and some things wrong. Agatha and I have been friends for a long time. We have worked together, we're a good team. We are also both happily married, there's no need to stir drama. Have all the fun you want, but I do ask that you are mindful with your words and actions. My family will always be my priority, so while I appreciate your interest in my career and life, I ask that you're respectful. Thank you.

     alright folks, let's not lean too much into the drama. I love a good story, but this is not it. I love and respect my wife. Agatha can have friends AND she can touch her friends like c'mon. The music industry isn't that big and I know y'all have done the digging and found the connections already, I swear you're worse than my mom. The ONE thing I take issue with is the SMOKING. Sapphics let's not all die for looking cool, that goes to both Agatha AND Rio. Let's do better. Peace out

My love @daddydeath has already said it best, but i'll repeat it. We love each other, we're good, all is well. Goodnight.

     <span>
      Of course people read too much into the statements. It's like they were trained by the CIA. But true to her word Hela takes over in controlling the scandal and they get some peace and quiet.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It is the perfect time for a family vacation, if it wasn't because Rio still has work. She took over some mysterious project she won't tell Agatha about, which means Agatha gets to stay home with the kids and catch up on what she missed while on tour.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The good thing is Agatha adores the boys, sure Billy is being a broody teen half the time, but whenever he gets over himself they have a good time. So Agatha spends her afternoons keeping an eye on Nicky in the pool and subtly trying to bribe Billy, with painting his nails or a new guitar, in order to learn if he knows what Rio is working on.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It doesn't work, but she has a good time so it's not a complete loss. Nor is she deterred from her mission.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      On yet another afternoon of failed bribery, she jumps on the pool and tries baiting Nicky into spilling instead.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The kid is a fast swimmer, slipping out of her arms and giggling all the way to the other end of the pool where he ends up convincing Billy to join in on the fun.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky calls this game ‘water war’ which is very apt since everyone is so competitive about it. Everyone being mostly her and Nicky. The two of them being the sole instigators of the game in what would otherwise be normal pool days.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So now Nicky climbs over Billy's shoulders, all part of a plan he whispered into his brother's ear from the other side of the pool so Agatha couldn't hear them, and watches her with a devilish grin while Billy maneuvers them around the pool.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Now,” Nicky shouts suddenly and Agatha has no time to react and her son flung himself from his brother's shoulder and towards her like a cannonball.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She catches him. Thanks fuck she catches him and has half her mind made to dunk the little menace but he giggles, throwing his arms around her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And that's when Rio comes into view. Still in her work clothes, sunglasses perched on the top of her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha just catches the slight tension of her shoulders before Rio laughs, sitting on a recliner to undo her shoes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “This is very unfair, playing without me,” she comments casually.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha is about to open her mouth to tell her not to jump in the pool in her work clothes when Rio stands up again, a mischievous smile on her lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I want to play too, and I think the winner should get ice cream,” she's interrupted by Nicky's excited yelp and she holds out her hand. “If, and only if, they can behave till I come back. That's no waves, no spraying water and most importantly, no more jumping like that at your mom.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky pouts, in a very Rio move, but Rio herself is immune to it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     <span>
      “Play nice, I'll be back in a minute.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When she disappears back inside Nicky turns to Agatha, and whispers conspiratorially, “Mommy, how much is a minute?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio is back before Agatha can wrap her lengthy explanation on how time works that has Nicky attempting to subtly blow bubbles into the water to entertain himself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before Agatha can fully take in the always welcome sight of her wife in a swimsuit Rio gently drops herself into the water. Which again has Agatha thinking something's off.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Rio swims to Billy then, and whispers something in his ear. When he nods, Rio turns to Agatha and Nicky with a grin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Let's play.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They spend the rest of the afternoon in the pool. Even Billy who resists his allergy to leaving his phone unattended in favor of winning the right to celebratory ice cream.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As it always happens in ‘water war’ there is no clear winner, but when Billy pulls Agatha’s legs from underwater causing her to flinch and flail dramatically while he laughs, and Rio holds a giggling Nicholas over her head like he's bounty, Agatha in all her magnanimousness concedes to let them have the win.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And then Rio very kindly lets them have ice cream anyways if they say please and thank you. Which is why Nicky has ice cream and Agatha fakes not being hungry while shooting daggers at her wife. At least Rio seems to have finally relaxed, Agatha watches her laugh and joke with the kids, and sighs in relief.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Later on, as the sun begins to set, Rio takes Nicky inside to prepare his bath and Billy slides in the seat next to Agatha, looking conflicted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What's going on, teen?” She cuts to the chase and laughs, but Billy looks worried, which quickly sobers her up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There's a video online,” he says, turning his phone so she can see. “Some reporter caught mama this morning.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha immediately recognizes the building of Billy's school and remembers Rio told her she was dropping some books Billy had forgotten to return to the school before heading to the studio. But before she can make any more conjectures the video starts.

      Agatha feels her blood boil. She’s ready to start suing people like she’s a lawyer and not a singer. But Billy looks at her, worry coloring his features, as though he’s scared he did something wrong by asking his mom to return the books he forgot to school.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It's not your fault, kid,” she's quick to reassure him. “I'm not mad at you, and neither is your mama. If anyone is to blame here it's those goddamn reporters, okay?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy nods slowly, taking in her words. “Okay.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Good,” she smiles and pats his back, “Now get out of here, I know you're dying to talk to Eddie.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy smiles, more relaxed and stands up. Before he leaves, he stops, “I love you, mom. And mama, too.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smiles, the softness of the moment making her momentarily forget her anger. “I love you too, teen. As for the other part, you tell that to her, yourself.”

    <p>
     <span>
      Making dinner keeps her busy while she thinks. Knowing their managers they probably already have it handled, but she can't help but mull over why they wouldn't tell her about it. In the end only one thing makes sense, Rio must've told them not to.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wants to be mad about it, but she knows why Rio did it. Truth is, Agatha wouldn't have been able to enjoy the day with the kids knowing this had happened. It isn't fair, and she is not happy with it, but she can see where Rio was coming from.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Dinner rolls by, everyone still in high spirits from the afternoon games, even if Nicky is falling asleep before they can get to dessert. Rio goes to pick him up to carry him to bed, but Agatha beats her to it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I got him,” she says, her voice coming out harder than she intends with all the thoughts swirling in her mind. She clears her throat, then adds, “You two handle the dishes.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha takes her time putting Nicky to bed, trying to settle her thoughts before talking to Rio so she doesn't make a mess of things. She finds comfort in the motions, making sure he brushes his teeth, helping him pick a stuffed animal from his collection even though he for sure will go for the bunny, and then reading him a story. She reads it till the end even if she can tell he's fallen asleep halfway through. Finally, she kisses his forehead and goes back downstairs.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      On her way, she crosses paths with Billy, who’s heading to his room. He shoots her a smile and a half-hearted, “Goodnight.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio is not in the kitchen when she looks for her there, but Agatha knows a thing or two about her wife after over a decade of being married to her. When she's stressed, or overthinking, Rio prefers the outdoors.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sure enough, Agatha finds her by the pool, sitting on a recliner with two glasses of wine next to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey,” Agatha says softly, announcing her presence.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio's smile doesn't quite reach her eyes. Without the kids in sight, her walls are down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha kicks off her shoes and sits on the edge of the pool dipping her feet in the cool water. She pats the spot next to her and a second later Rio joins her. Rio leans her head against Agatha’s shoulder with a tired sigh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Billy told me you guys saw the interview,” Rio says nervously.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I did,” Agatha admits easily. “Why didn't you tell me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugs, but her stiff posture says more. “There was nothing you could do. This was my choice, remember?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Not like this,
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Agatha thinks. This isn't what they agreed on. Rio getting harassed by the press while she's going about her day wasn't part of the deal. But she's not really angry at Rio. She's frustrated, sure, but she's not mad. So she takes a deep breath and changes the topic.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How's your secret project coming along?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio eyes her suspiciously, and then smiles thankful. “It's going quite well. I'm happy with what I've got so far.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do I get to hear it yet?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nope.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha laughs despite herself. “You're being mean. Take the day off tomorrow.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What? Why?” Rio asks laughing as she turns to look at her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Because I'm asking,” Agatha says, but her voice makes it sound more like a demand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio takes her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I won't be able to do anything thinking the press will be waiting to get you, and I can't do anything about it.” Agatha confesses.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay. I'll work from here tomorrow then.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Thank you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smirks. “Can we make out now?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chokes on her wine, earning a snort from Rio. She glares at her wife, who simply grins in return.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We should start planning that vacation we owe ourselves.” Rio says, ignoring Agatha's glare. “We could go somewhere nice, a beach or something, go back to our roots, post artsy thirst traps with my face covered.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha's glare crumbles into a laugh. “I see your vision. I don't see how that fixes anything, though.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio bumps their shoulders together, grinning. “You'll think differently when we're sipping fruity cocktails out of coconuts on some beach in…Aruba.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We're not going to Aruba.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hawaii?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How about…Canada?” she quickly counters, throwing Rio off from her list of tropical destinations.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Canada?” Rio asks, baffled.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Maybe Greenland.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You would hate Greenland, my love.” Rio finishes her wine before slipping into the pool.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shakes her head, watching her wife swim. At least Nicky is asleep so he won't be getting ideas. She's half terrified of what their youngest would do with the knowledge you can go in the pool without a swimsuit.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She watches Rio swim for a while. The way she looks completely relaxed in the water, in their home, safe. The anger gnaws at her again, the frustration boiling over until that is all that remains.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You could put your project on hold, we could go on vacation now.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stops mid-lap and swims toward her. She pauses just out of reach. “No.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Once again, Agatha has to fight the urge to argue.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you remember how this all started?” Rio asks gently, breaking Agatha away from her thoughts. “You posted that cute picture of me on social media because you needed everyone to know Lady Death was your wife.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nods, “And what's your point?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I love you,”  Rio says, swimming closer until her arms rest on Agatha’s lap. “I love you and the kids, all three of them. I know you're scared, I'm scared too. But if we run now because we're scared, the bad, scary stuff will still be here, waiting for us when we come back.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rationally, Agatha knows Rio is right, but still–.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Give me a week,” Rio says. “I'll get a driver, whatever you want. I'll rappel down the building from a helicopter if you want–”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughs, “Alright, we save the rappelling for the vacation. But one week, and then we can go wherever you want.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Oh, anywhere she wants. Agatha grins, suddenly this plan isn't so bad.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “One week, Vidal.” Agatha grabs Rio's hands. “And then I'm kidnapping you and taking you to..Peru.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And the kids. Kidnap them too,” Rio says, stepping out of the pool to sit beside her. She throws her cold, wet arms over Agatha’s shoulders. “And then we've got ourselves the perfect vacation.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha playfully shoves her away. “First, dry yourself. Second, it's a deal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio ignores her, wrapping her arms around her again, peppering her face with kisses. “We should hike to Machu Picchu. It's only like three days long.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Only three days long.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       What the fuck
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . They're not going to Peru.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Aruba doesn't sound so bad anymore, actually,” she says, earning a laugh from Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Having given up on getting her wife to stop soaking her clothes, Agatha wraps her arms around Rio and pushes her back into the pool. Rio goes in all too easily, floating on her back with a mischievous wink.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come swim with me,” Rio calls.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha gives her a half-hearted glare before standing up. She pulls off her shirt and pants, stepping into the water. Rio wastes no time catching up and wrapping her arms around her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That was super hot of you,” Rio teases.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Slapping her hands away, Agatha laughs, then cups Rio's face, watching her wife intently. “Are you sure you're okay? With everything that happened today?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nods slowly, grabbing Agatha’s hands to keep them in place. She leans in and kisses her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm good now,” Rio says, breaking the kiss with a small smile. “As long as I come home to you, and the kids, I'm good.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha kisses her again. “Who would believe Lady Death is a big softie?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shakes her head, laughing. “You ruined the moment.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shrugs, already beginning to disentangle herself from Rio’s arms. “Let’s go inside. The water is freezing.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I could warm you up,” Rio offers, smirking in a way that’s far too charming for Agatha’s liking.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm gonna make you sleep on the couch,” she mutters stepping out of the pool.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughs, schooling her features in mock hurt.“You wouldn't”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don't tempt me,” Agatha throws back, but her smile betrays her words as she offers Rio her hand to help her out of the pool.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Instead, Rio swims back to the center of the pool, laughing. “Wait, one last thing before we go inside.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?” Agatha asks, crossing her arms over her chest with feigned disinterest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You look hot.” Rio smirks, swimming back to the edge of the pool. “We should post something.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha is so taken aback that all she can do is laugh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you even have your phone?” She asks, raising an eyebrow like she already knows the answer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio checks her pockets, despite being in the pool, and shakes her head. “Nope.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well there goes that plan,” Agatha says, picking up her mostly dry clothes and heading towards the house. “Go get dry.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      ***
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio finds her in the kitchen a while later. Agatha turns around, holding her mug and Rio's hot chocolate and spots her wife wearing that stupid old tour shirt she loves.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hates that she kinda likes it. She silently passes Rio the mug, suddenly lost in thought. An idea occurs to her then.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come here,” she says, motioning Rio closer. Her wife eyes her suspiciously, but obliges, meeting her halfway.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Setting her mug down, Agatha wraps one arm around Rio’a waist. “I hate this shirt. Can I take a picture?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughs softly, hiding her face in Agatha’s neck. “Okay.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha pokes her side until she looks up again. “I want to see your face.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio doesn't look entirely convinced, so Agatha is quick to reassure her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'll cover your face. Maybe a cute pink heart?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That earns another soft laugh, and Rio finally looks up, letting Agatha snap the photo.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They debate over what colour heart should cover Rio’s face while finishing their drinks and get nowhere. Rio gives up and drags them both to bed, where she promptly falls asleep.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha, however, stays awake. She stares at the photo on her phone for a long time. She’d love to post it just like that. Let the world know Rio Vidal is her wife. But she's not that much of a jerk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She covers Rio’s face with a black heart and only then notices the mug Rio is holding. It's ancient—a promotional piece from Agatha’s teenage pop star days.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Chuckling, she posts the picture and goes to sleep.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     Hela insists they do a couple interviews before going on vacation. She claims it's for people to cool down and leave them alone. Agatha thinks it's because she secretly enjoys watching them suffer. And so their one week timeliness turns into two weeks because they have to wait for Rio's schedule to clear up to make some appearances.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     First order of business is a radio interview. Agatha expresses her skepticism that there's a thing such as a popular radio show in this day and age, but Hela reassures her people will be listening.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That's how she ends up doing her wife’s make up after breakfast has been cleared and the kids are under Lilia’s questionable supervision.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Did Hela tell you she turned down tv interviews?” Rio asks, after about four seconds of silence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha hums in response, focusing on the intricate design on Rio's cheek.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “She said I wasn't ready,” Rio continues, her tone taking on a note of offense. “I could be ready.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha would laugh if she wasn't trying to paint a skull on a specific time frame. So instead she grabs Rio's chin, holding her still. “Hush, hon. I'm trying to work here.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio sticks her tongue out and laughs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I'm gonna draw hearts on you if you don't behave,” she warns, mock-serious.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio sighs dramatically, but thankfully does stay still and Agatha manages to wrap up painting her face so they can be on time for the interview.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Despite the fact that they make it on time, Hela is already there and looking like a scolding parent.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How nice of you to arrive at last,” she comments as they fall into step beside her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, “Do send Sharon next time.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If she has a retort, Hela doesn't voice it as they're joined by the hosts of the show. A man and a woman, who despite seeming professional enough from afar proceed to lose their minds when they're introduced. Agatha forgets their names immediately, as she nods along to their mindless gushing and chatter.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio catches her eyes and grins like she can read her mind and offers her hand, swiftly moving them away from the others so they can have their own conversation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You ready?” She asks, with the confidence of a seasoned pro that she's not. Agatha would tell her so if she didn't find it endearing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I should ask you that,” she says instead, straightening Rio's shirt of imaginary creases for an excuse to touch her. “This is your first real interview.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shrugs again with the misplaced confidence. “Can't be worse than that guy at Billy's school the other day.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha opens her mouth to curse that guy again, but Rio keeps talking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Or that other reporter at the show last night–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What reporter last night?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hela calls them over to start the show before Rio can answer. Agatha holds out a hand, signaling Hela to wait and turns back to Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “The minute you feel uncomfortable say the word and we leave,” she says, holding her gaze waiting for Rio to respond.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, okay,” Rio relents, looking over Agatha's shoulder at Hela and the radio hosts. She turns back to Agatha with a soft smile. “Same to you, I know you hate this stuff.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chuckles at that, she is a professional, but nods and lets Rio lead them into the studio, where they get set up while the hosts start the show.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha, Lady Death, it's an honour you've chosen us to be your first interview together,” one of the hosts asks, the woman with the mischievous glint in her eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha tries and fails to remember her name. Maybe Daisy?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Secondly,” the woman continues, “I feel it's a must ask, looking at the two of you, how did you meet?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Going straight to it,” Agatha jokes, buying time to think of an answer that doesn't scream ‘my wife is Rio Vidal’.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio lets out a laugh, taking her hand under the table and gives it a squeeze, and turns to the radio host. “We met in New York actually, it was…I think you could say it was a coffee date.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha takes in her wife's smirk and shakes her head. She'll always find it surprising how Rio can become Lady Death in the blink of an eye, turning on the charm to one thousand and no one ever notices she's never showing what's under the surface.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It wasn't a coffee date if you didn't have coffee, darling,” Agatha presses, a teasing tilt to her voice. She's trying to find what's their boundary when it comes to sharing their story.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shakes her head good naturedly. “Okay, so maybe I had hot chocolate–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “With little marshmallows,” Agatha supplies and Rio gives her a look of mock offense causing the table to erupt in laughter. “Every day,” Agatha adds with a grin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Every day?” The other host asks. A guy Agatha is sixty percent sure said his name was Tom, or maybe it was Todd. Todd looks between the two of them with a charming grin. “Please expand. How did it go from coffee date in New York to having chocolate with little marshmallows everyday?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Is this the famous lesbian u-haul?” The woman, (Dani? Darcy?) pipes in with barely contained laughter.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio bursts out laughing, she swivels in her chair facing Agatha, and lifts one eyebrow in challenge, like she too is trying to find what's the line they'll toe between the truth and what they're willing to share.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha considers her options. She doesn't really do sitting down interviews unless she has to, and even then she drags the band with her. Last time she sat down for an interview alone she ended up confessing that she was married for crying out loud.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She's never been a fan of showing too much, but now here they are, and Rio is letting her take the lead.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We did not u-haul. Mostly because I didn't like the idea of moving to a college dorm,” she retorts, playing it off with a laugh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio rolls her eyes, like the yes and man that she is. “But you did like me just enough to go visit occasionally.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shrugs playfully, “You were a little bit annoying, but had other redeeming qualities.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The two hosts look ready to swoon, and only then Agatha realizes they've been mostly talking to each other.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shoots her a wink and turns to the table, “And by redeeming qualities she means chocolate kisses.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Tom/Todd beats his fellow host to ask the next question. “I wanna circle back to Agatha visiting Lady Death in college. Agatha you must've been already famous–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh my gosh,” the woman chimes in again. Darcy? “This is great. Please spill everything about this story.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We've got a table full of profesional gossips,” Rio jokes, subtly giving them an out of this topic. She searches Agatha's face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “There's not much to tell,” Agatha says, and Rio eyes her curiously. “I did manage to sneak into quite a few college parties without being recognized.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles. “Party animal,” she bites back a laugh, “You're a legend to this day and they don't even know it was you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I'm just that good,” Agatha offers with a shrug, a proud smile on her face. She catches Rio's eyes and has to bite back a smile because heart eyes are the only way to define the way Rio is looking at her. Thank god this is radio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, they're doing it again,” Darcy says with barely contained laughter. “Dear listeners, I want you to know the way these two look at each other is diabolical if you're single. I want what they have.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well you can't have her because she's mine,” Rio jokes, taking Agatha’s hand over the table. “I got her fair and square, with my killer game. Isn't that right, my love?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha grins, studying Rio’s expression. “I rate your game at four stars,” she says, her tone teasing. “Could use some more practice, but the enthusiasm is appreciated.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The table cracks up at that, even Rio, who seems happy enough with leaving it at that. “Y'know what, I'll take it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, no,” Darcy speaks again, her grin widening. “Lady Death, you have to rate Agatha’s game.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks at Agatha for a long minute with a thoughtful expression, then turns to Darcy with a confident smirk. “Five stars.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Wait, really?” Todd asks. “Damn.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio smiles all too proud, and speaks again before Agatha can fully feel out of danger knowing her wife.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “She's that good,” Rio says, tone serious, but when she turns to face Agatha, she has that look in her eyes. “But then she did have some years of experience on me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chokes on nothing. “Did you call me old?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Experienced,” Rio says, but she can barely keep her expression neutral. “I love you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I love you too,” Agatha says, rolling her eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They go on a commercial break after that, and Hela gives them a thumbs up from the other side of the glass.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sighs in relief. Thank god that's over.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A producer walks in then, holding an open tablet where she's already typing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You guys were great. Any topics you don't want us to talk about in the second half of the interview?” she asks, looking up from her notes, “Your manager gave us a very thorough list of yes and nos, but I just want to make sure.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Can we ask about Rio Vidal?” Darcy asks, looking between the two of them as if trying to read into their reactions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hela taps the glass and shakes her head no. Darcy laughs, putting her hands up in surrender.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Your social media posts, then?” She asks, wiggling her eyebrows.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sighs dramatically. Rio catches her, rolling her eyes fondly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Go for it,” Rio tells the hosts, then turns to Agatha with a mischievous smile, rolling her chair closer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Stop acting like you don't enjoy it,” Rio whispers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don't know what you're talking about,” Agatha replies coolly, and as the show goes live again Rio leans over and kisses her cheek sweetly before returning to her place again as if nothing happened.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The hosts share a look, but decide not to comment on it, for which Agatha is grateful. Which is not to say she will say thank you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alright,” Darcy claps her hands together with a devilish smile on her face, cutting through the moment. “I think it's time to talk about what everyone's thinking. The thirst traps.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Todd shakes his head, laughing like he’s in on a joke they're not.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What is a thirty trap, anyways,” Rio says mock-serious. “Who's to say something is a thirst trap?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I will,” Darcy proclaims, selecting a file from beside her laptop, one of two, and emptying the contents over the table. Every single photo they've posted together.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Looking at them now, it's more than Agatha thought it would be. It makes her feel oddly pleased with herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, you printed them,” Rio grins, going over the pile and selecting a few. “Can I keep these?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think it's fair,” Todd gives Darcy a quick look. When he looks back at Rio he smiles softly. “Go ahead.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Todd, you're looking awfully smitten on Lady Death,” Agatha comments, taking the photo Rio passes, but doesnt look at it. She has selected her target. “I also noted, you have not once looked my wife in the eye until just now.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Todd laughs nervously, and Agatha gets a great deal of enjoyment out of it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “My name is actually–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sweetheart, I think Todd has a crush on you,” she tells Rio with a grin, cutting him off with savage glee.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks at Todd, assessing and he looks away. “No disrespect but you have no shot, my friend.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh no, she friend-zoned you,” Darcy pats Todd's back with a sympathetic smile. “Anyways, back to the thirst traps, what's up with that? How did it happen? How do we make it keep happening?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks at her instead of answering, the ghost of a smile on her lips. Agatha just shrugs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And most importantly,” Darcy says, grinning a bit too wide. “When do we get more Agatha centered thirst traps?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think she has a crush on you,” Rio mock-whispers to Agatha.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Guilty,” Darcy admits all too easily, shooting Agatha a quick once over and clearing her throat. “But anyways–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, no. Hey, now,” Rio cuts her off. “I saw that.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darcy has the decency to blush a little, laughing nervously. “I mean look at her.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio does look at her, and Agatha winks with the sole intent of making her blush. Her plan works, and Rio blushes under her make up, fumbling over her words until she just gives up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You're cute,” Agatha says and Rio looks away and laughs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Listen, Lady Death, I feel like this can be a bonding moment for us,” Darcy says, reaching a hand over the table. “Bring it here, for all the Agatha Harkness lovers out there.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio laughs and gives Darcy’s hand a gentle pat. “I win, though.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Todd gives Agatha a thin lip smile over the other two, like he's unsure where they stand and clears his throat. “This feels like a good note to close the interview.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darcy groans, then laughs. “Alright, thanks for stopping by you two. You're more than welcome to come back. We're open for announcements of any kind, maybe…face reveals?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, “I'm gonna say no. On her behalf. It's half the reason she has this much game.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So you recognize my game,” Rio says, grinning like she won the lottery.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I married you, goofball.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And then it happens, Rio pouts, adorable even under the Lady Death makeup. “Don't call me goofball.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha smiles, there's my wife, she thinks. “Isn't she cute?” she asks the two hosts who are now just looking at them with smiles on their faces.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey, I got a four star review. We can't all have your experience,” Rio replies with a playful smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha narrows her eyes at her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Listen, I have the enthusiasm to match,” Rio says with a charming smirk, “I'm free after this interview…”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darcy cracks up at that, “And that's all the time we have today. Thanks everyone for tuning in.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After exchanging pleasantries with the hosts and signing some autographs they're free to go, and Agatha is surprisingly pleased with how it went. Maybe she and Rio make a better team that she gave them credit for.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hela stops them in the lobby.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I have a car waiting in the private parking lot,” she explains.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As they drive away a few minutes later, Agatha catches photographers and fans outside the radio building.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Turns out people do listen to the radio after all,” she tells Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks up from the photos she got from the interview. “We should frame this.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha laughs, shaking her head. “Billy will not like that.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well he'll like tomorrow even less,” Hela deadpans, “Here's the schedule for tomorrow. I've got two more interviews lined up and Rio, I've got some stuff for you to look over about your project.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pretends it doesn't offend her when Rio moves back to read whatever Hela shows her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No interviews the day after,” Agatha comments with an air of casualness. “I've got a doctor's appointment.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio's head snaps up from the tablet, her eyes wide as she searches Agatha’s face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You can come,” Agatha murmurs, and Rio nods emphatically.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They drive back home in pleasant silence after that. Agatha needs it after all that, and she can tell Rio does too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Back home she helps Rio clean her makeup, and when she steps out of the shower Agatha kisses her. She tells herself it's because Rio looks like she needs it, but the way she holds onto her wife maybe she needs it too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She leaves the freshly washed tour shirt on the bed for Rio and goes to shower. Agatha takes her time, giving her body time to relax, letting the water wash away the stress of the day. The doctor did tell her to try and relax when they spoke last week.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she steps out of the bathroom, Rio is not in their bedroom, but she did leave a tour shirt from The Court's single tour on the bed for her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha laughs, slipping into the shirt and sighs, inhaling Rio's perfume.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I said this before, and I'll say it again,” Rio says, coming up from behind her and wrapping her arms around her waist. “You look so good in my clothes, mi amor.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chuckles, “You haven't even seen me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio hums against her back. “You think we can postpone my show off thirty trap of you till tomorrow?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We were doing that?” Agatha asks, humour tinting her words.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods, and places a kiss over her shoulder. “Absolutely. But first nap?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chuckles, turning around in Rio's arms and placing a kiss on her nose. She moves to her side of the bed, and Rio takes her place on the other side with a small pleased smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Come here, little spoon,” Agatha says teasingly, pulling Rio closer, between her arms.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I'm a bad boy, actually,” Rio mutters, making herself comfortable with her head on Agatha's chest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Of course, littlest of spoons, baddest of boys.” Agatha says mock serious. “That's a good caption actually.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I'm gonna sleep now,” Rio says with a huff.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Can I take your photo?” She asks, laughing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Spoilsport.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio doesn't answer anymore, she lets out a long sigh, relaxing into Agatha's embrace. She's asleep within minutes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha considers taking the photo anyways, but ends up putting her phone down with a dramatic exhale.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I'll get you next time,” she whispers to her sleeping wife.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The internet can wait one day.

     “Of course you rented a whole fucking island.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio!” Agatha covers Nicky's ears with her hands and locks eyes with Rio, her glare downplayed by her smile. “Language.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy laughs next to them, the first time it's happened since Rio gave the final no to bringing Eddie with them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha takes it as a win, and turns back to her wife, expectantly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You still rented an island, Agatha.” Rio gestures dramatically towards the boat where a young man is putting their luggage inside the cabin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And?” Agatha says, laughing despite it not being the best course of action. “You wanted beach, I wanted privacy. I think this is a compromise.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio narrows her eyes. “You. Rented. An. Island.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha looks at the boat and then back at her wife. “Okay, fine. Maybe I should've led with that–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And I would've said no,” Rio cuts her off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Exactly,” Agatha says, deadpan.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shakes her head, a small reluctant smile tugging at her lips. “Whatever.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, then. Let's go start our vacation,” Agatha says, grinning broadly, and takes Nicky's hand helping him onto the boat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Two days later, Rio has for the most part forgiven her about the whole private island thing. Especially after Agatha stopped pointing out things like ‘is not that big an island’ and ‘I only hired the minimum staff.’
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The kids are having fun, and Agatha can tell not having the fear of eyes on them has Rio feeling more relaxed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky declares it his mission as soon as they arrive on the island to build as many sandcastles as possible. Agatha secretly bets Rio he'll be bored of it after fourteen, and Rio accepts then proceeds to play architect to their son's sandcastle fantasies.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is pretty sure she's forgiven by sandcastle number fifteen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey Nick, what about a space sandcastle,” Rio says as they have lunch on the beach. Little artful sandwiches the hired chef prepared for them and had Rio glaring daggers at her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's a secret sandcastle after that, whatever that means. Billy, the traitor, joins them for the Dracula sandcastle and the ensuing werewolves sandcastle. Agatha can't tell what's supposed to be telling them apart from one another, they look about the same to her, but Nicky is so happy with it that Agatha nods along and helps him pick shells to decorate them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I'll be taking those two hundred dollars now,” Rio says, dropping herself on the sand next to Agatha. She's got that cocky smirk that Agatha finds far more attractive than annoying these days.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What happened to what's mine is yours?” she asks, putting her book down dramatically, like she was in any way invested in the book she picked at random from the bookshelves in the study.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh,” Rio says, her smirk turning into a playful grin. “You should've led with that. I'm gonna get a new drum set.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That's it?” Agatha says with a laugh, watching her wife drop herself completely so she's laying on her towel. “I'm still waiting for you to deliver on the posters of mine I know you had hanging on your walls as a teen.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio's grin falters for an almost imperceptible second, but Agatha notices. “I don't know what you're talking about.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Turns out, you can still learn new things about your partner after decades together.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh. We’ll revisit this when we’re back home,” Agatha remarks, her tone playful.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio laughs nervously. “Nothing to revisit.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sure, hon,” Agatha replies mockingly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio throws a handful of sand at her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Let's sell the house.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chokes on her drink, which momentarily derails her follow up question at the tip of her tongue. Just as planned.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I hate the press knowing where we live,” Agatha starts, putting her book down. She's been reading it for two days and getting nowhere.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio's eyes follow her movements, she's waiting for Agatha to finish.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha turns her attention to their sons playing in the water, and smiles. “Besides it would be small for y'know…adding to the family.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Turning her attention back to her wife, she catches the look on Rio's face. Her wife’s been looking at her like she hangs the stars in the sky since they went ahead with the first round of ivf. Agatha would find it annoying if she didn't secretly crave the attention.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Still, teasing Rio is one of her favorite pastimes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Like–a dog. Or cat, a rabbit,” Agatha says mock serious, earning a playful swat to the arm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I will take you up on the dog.” Rio grins, playing along “And a little you. Mini Agatha.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes. “So we sell the house then, yes?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I don't know,” Rio stars, looking unconvinced. “It's–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You can decorate the nursery.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You said that with Nicholas.” Rio’s voice comes out like a whine. She massages her forehead and laughs. “I had everything set up, and then you barge in as I'm painting the walls forest green and say, what was it?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha says nothing, barely containing her smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You said,” Rio says sitting up and holding a finger in her direction, “I changed my mind, I think it should be animal themed, and since I'm carrying the baby, my word goes.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I let you keep the curtains,” Agatha counters weakly and Rio bursts out laughing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How very generous of you, my love,” she says, her tone slightly annoyed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pulls her closer, so they're laying over their towels side by side, and throws a quick look at the kids before wrapping her arms around Rio, kissing her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You're hot,” Rio whispers against her mouth. “And I'm loving this side of you, but I'm not agreeing to sell the house–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha groans against her mouth, cutting her off. “Stop fighting me!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio gently rolls them over so she's laying on top, and kisses her sweetly. “I'll think about it. Okay?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sighing, Agatha nods. “Okay.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha wakes up alone in bed. She checks her phone for the time. 3 a.m. Tired and already annoyed, she slips into her silk robe and steps out of the room in search of her wife.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It doesn’t take long to locate Rio, she can hear the off-key sounds of the piano drifting from the living room as she makes her way downstairs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio,” she calls, and the piano falls silent immediately.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Agatha turns the corner, she finds Rio lying on the bench, her hands covering her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sorry,” Rio mutters but doesn’t move.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pokes her side until Rio sits up, and then slides onto the bench next to her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What’s going on, sweetheart?” she asks, the anger ebbing as she takes in her wife, shoulders slumped, tense posture, and a pout on her lips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio gestures to the piano and then throws her hands down.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Couldn’t sleep,” she admits after a beat. “I figured I’d squeeze in some work here so I wouldn’t bother you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But the piano is off-key?” Agatha teases, and Rio rolls her eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The piano is not Rio’s strong suit, which works just fine since Alice is a great pianist. Agatha considers herself semi-decent, having been forced into piano lessons by her mother from an early age. She’s no Alice, but she can definitely do better than Rio on most days.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Let me help,” she offers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio grumbles but nods, and Agatha sits up straighter, stretching her fingers. She laughs when she catches Rio staring.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Focus, hot shot. What are we playing?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I need a drink,” Rio declares, standing and heading toward the kitchen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha blinks in surprise. Rio isn’t one for impulsive drinking, that’s more Agatha’s style.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She has to hide her laughter when, upon entering the kitchen, she sees that Rio’s drink of choice is orange juice.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “My mouth got dry,” Rio explains. “Do you want some?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shakes her head, “Let's go back to work.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio sits back down and sighs, sliding two sheets of music over the piano. “This is what I’ve been working on,” she explains.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Curious, Agatha leans closer, trying to decipher Rio’s messy handwriting in the dim light, squinting without her glasses. Rio chuckles softly, her hand brushing against the small of Agatha’s back before leaning in to kiss her cheek.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We can go to sleep,” Rio murmurs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, placing her hands on Rio’s shoulders and gently pushing her upright. “Nonsense. Go get my glasses.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio doesn’t immediately move. She stays rooted to the spot, as if waiting for something. Agatha watches her, unsure if she’s supposed to say something. When it’s clear Rio won’t figure it out on her own, Agatha slides across the bench, tugs Rio so she’s facing the stairs, and slaps her ass playfully.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Go, fetch. I need to see my notes and lyrics, Daddy Death.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio yelps, then laughs, beginning to walk. “It’s Rio, actually,” she throws over her shoulder as she heads upstairs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alright then, Daddy Rio. Get me a glass of wine, too,” Agatha calls after her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With Rio gone, Agatha lets her fingers trace the piano keys.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     These days, her instrument is her voice, but this is how she fell in love with music: in the long hours spent watching her mother play, being allowed by her side and learning from her. It awakened something in young Agatha she's never been able to fully rid herself of. But it was something she had to rebuild later in life, to find her way back to music that wasn't tainted by her mother.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When the kids were younger she'd sit them in her lap and play anything that came to mind for them, from lullabies to whatever was playing on the radio. But Billy picked up the guitar as he grew older, and Nicky is more interested in drums, too excitable to sit still, wild enough to enjoy hitting things while sitting on Rio's lap.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And music should be about joy, about freedom. That's how it feels for her. Maybe…maybe Rio is onto something with a little her, someone to rediscover her love for piano with.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio returns then, glasses in hand but no wine. Agatha raises an eyebrow as she slides the glasses on her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Your handwriting is still shit,” she remarks, scanning the sheet music. “And you forgot the wine.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio murmurs something Agatha doesn’t catch, but a moment later she’s back with a glass of wine, sliding it reluctantly toward her before sitting down again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha takes a sip and sighs happily, finally content with being awake at 3 a.m. She catches Rio staring and sticks her tongue out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m not pregnant yet,” she mutters, knowing exactly what Rio is thinking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her wife says nothing, but Agatha catches her soft smile as her attention turns back to the music sheets.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Play,” she orders, opening her notebook to make notes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha leans in, curious about what Rio has been so secretive about.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Eyes on the music,” Rio says, bumping their shoulders together and angling the notebook away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sighing, Agatha begins to play. Rio hums a melody over the music, pausing occasionally to jot something down, then asking Agatha to repeat sections with small changes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One hour passes in the blink of an eye. Agatha yawns, resting her head on Rio’s shoulder while continuing to play.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio smiles softly, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s forehead.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I love you,” Agatha murmurs, and Rio starts laughing. “But if we keep going much longer, I'm putting my hands out of commission for the rest of our stay.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re very dramatic, my love.” Rio takes Agatha’s hands and places them in her lap before turning back to the piano. She rests her open notebook over the sheet music. “I think I’ve got it now.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This is Agatha’s favorite part when they work together. Rio is a visual learner, so while Agatha has been playing repeatedly from the music sheets, Rio has been watching her fingers, memorizing their movements.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Serenade me,” Agatha whispers, laying her head on Rio’s shoulder again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles softly and begins to play. “I uh…I'm thinking of calling this one ‘you ruined women for me’.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha hides her laughter in Rio’s neck, entirely unbothered by being a distraction. “Damn right, I did.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio scoffs, “Shut up.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Feeling generous, Agatha quiets down, allowing Rio to sing, shyly at first, the song she wrote for her, presumably. Agatha follows along with the lyrics in Rio’s notebook, thankfully written much neater than the music.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When the song ends, its final note echoing in the quiet room, Rio turns to her with a nervous smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What do you think?” She asks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think it better be about me,” Agatha teases.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks offended for the second it takes Agatha to lean in and kiss her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Somehow, in the midst of making out, Agatha ends up in Rio’s lap, her hands tangled in her hair. Agatha has no complaints.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I always thought being serenaded was cheesy,” she murmurs, pressing lazy kisses to Rio’s skin. “You, my love, may be the exception.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I was thinking it could be a nice duet,” Rio says slowly, testing the waters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That gets Agatha's attention. Regretfully, she pulls away and meets Rio's gaze. “You and me?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods, waiting for her answer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “As Lady Death or…?” Agatha asks, delaying her answer for fun, but also out of curiosity.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I don't know,” Rio admits quietly. “Is your answer dependent on mine?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha would normally laugh at such a question, but instead she takes Rio’s hand in hers. “I would love to do this duet with you, whatever version of you you're comfortable with.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio smiles at last, the tension leaving her body. “That's good–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Was this your secret project all along?” Agatha asks, cutting her off. “Did we delay our vacation because you were being a lovesick goofball writing me love songs in secret?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio groans, covering her face with her free hand. “Let’s go to sleep.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha stops her retreat only because Rio refuses to let go of her hand. She tries and fails to haul Agatha up the stairs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But we could make a cute post to celebrate this moment,” Agatah suggests, holding Rio's phone with her free hand. “I'll even let you post it yourself.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio sits back down reluctantly. After a moment she speaks again, “It should be you centric. For the fans.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Of course, for the fans. Come here.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha positions Rio where she wants her, her wife moving without complaint. Just as she’s about to snap the photo, she feels Rio’s hand slide over her thigh. Turning her head, she gives Rio a questioning look, but her wife only shrugs nonchalantly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Laughing, Agatha takes the photo and begins drafting a post.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Shouldn't I do that?” Rio asks, looking over her shoulder at the screen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Nope.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You're carrying the baby, so your word goes?” Rio jokes, already laughing at her own words.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes. “Jury's out on that one for a few more days. But since we're apparently manifesting our children now, sure. What you said.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With a dramatic flourish she hits post and stands up. “Let's go to bed.” She offers a hand to Rio with a playful smile. “This was enough practice for when you have to wake up for the baby.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What if we have twins?” Rio asks out of the blue.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha stops mid step and glares at her wife. “Don't even joke about that.”
     <br/>
     <br/>

     Agatha wakes up alone in bed again in the morning, but between the serenade and what they got up to when they got back to the bedroom, she feels much kinder towards her missing wife. After spending a while lounging in bed, she gets dressed and heads downstairs to find her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She finds some of the staff going about their tasks, and asks them if they have seen Rio. Agatha is directed to the pool they've never used, and that's where she finds her wife. Rio is sitting on the edge of the pool wearing Agatha's favorite robe, looking intently at something in her phone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I thought you said a pool on a beach house was dumb,” she says, sitting down next to Rio and dropping a kiss on her shoulder. “Also, this is my robe. Thief.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What's yours is mine, remember?” Rio says without looking away from her phone. Agatha still catches the playful smile tugging at her lips. “And, the pool is growing on me. I figured you'd appreciate me swimming here instead of the open ocean.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, it's growing on you, huh?” Agatha says, voice teasing, “Y'know, the island is on sale. If we sell the house…”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio doesn't look like she believes her, she is amused more than anything. “I haven't actually said yes to selling the house.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I could convince you,” Agatha offers with a coy smile, her hand already tugging at the knot of her stolen robe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha,” Rio says, her voice coming out breathy. So, of course, Agatha pushes further.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes?” She asks innocently, while hands move not-so-innocently beneath the robe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio doesn’t answer immediately. Agatha takes her time, moving her hands slowly, savoring the sight of her wife struggling to regain composure, from her closed eyes and deep, measured breaths to the tight grip on her phone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Leaning closer, Agatha rests her head on Rio’s shoulder, her lips trailing lazy kisses and teasing bites along her neck and jaw.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What are you doing?” Rio asks, her voice uneven. When she opens her eyes, Agatha is delighted to see the hunger there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Dropping one last kiss to her wife’s jaw, Agatha steps back with feigned nonchalance. “Nothing,” she replies lightly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio laughs, rubbing a hand over her face. Agatha still catches her smiling. “You're not being fair.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why not?” Agatha wraps her arms around Rio instinctively, feeling the way her wife leans willingly into her embrace.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Because,” Rio says, dropping her head on Agatha's shoulder with a laugh. “You're beautiful, and you know I can't resist you. You're using it against me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chuckles. “I don't know what you're talking about. You're gonna crack your phone, though, if you keep gripping it like that.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio sighs, putting her phone down, and turns her head to kiss Agatha sweetly. Gone is the heat from moments ago, at least for now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Morning, mi amor,” Rio murmurs. “Sorry I left. Alice called, and then I figured I'd check my emails.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha hums in answer, enjoying the moment too much to dare speak. There's no pressure here, no expectations, and most importantly no press that can find them. So she holds Rio a little closer, enjoying the warmth of her wife’s body.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio begins to fidget after a while and Agatha laughs, releasing her, but only a little.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think you're gonna like this one email I got,” Rio explains grabbing her phone, she passes it to Agatha after a minute.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To: Rio Vidal
     <br/>
     <em>
      From: Hela Odinson
     </em>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Subject: I hate you
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Please, please stop posting thirst traps, you make my job very hard. This is the very reason I keep taking over your account. That being said, this has your wife's name all over. And she's probably reading this too. Hello, Agatha–.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha cracks up at that, and Rio puts her phone down.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “She added a selection of responses to the post as well,” Rio comments casually as she lays back into Agatha and sighs tiredly. “Apparently the ‘thigh grab’ was ‘criminal’.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well I think you more than paid for your crimes last night then,” she replies with a laugh. Rio rolls her eyes fondly. “Unless you disagree? Should we take this back inside? Give it another try? Be extra thorough, just in case?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     By the end she can barely hold her laughter, her wife looking only a little exasperated.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I'm pretty sure the staff has breakfast ready,” Rio says after a beat, the tips of her ears tinted red.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chuckles, standing up and tugging Rio with her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alright then, food first.” She holds Rio's hand in hers as they walk inside. “And then–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m remembering now, people did say the caption was criminal too,” Rio comments with a playful smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh,” Agatha pretends to think of her answer, as if she didn't write it herself. “The caption, huh? On your post, in your account? Damn, daddy Rio, you sure know how to cover all the bases with your posts. Lucky for you–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh my god, shut up.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha laughs, grabbing Rio’s wrist at the last minute before she can get back inside the house. “Hey,” she says, gently pushing Rio against the wall. “I love you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You're a jerk,” Rio says, her tone light. “I–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A loud groan, that can only be Billy cuts her off and Agatha laughs, leaning in to close the gap between them. The kiss is nothing more than a press of lips, but Billy makes it sounds like he caught them doing something near sacrilegious, which only makes Agatha laugh more.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You're the literal worst,” he mutters as he slips past them and into the house.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha follows after him, tugging Rio by the wrist.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “One,” she says, “We're having this conversation on the literal island I rented for our family vacations. Second, stop acting like you caught us having sex, it was a kiss, then.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy groans at that, and Rio laughs. But Billy is the first one to speak.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ohmygod, gross,” he squeals, covering his face with his hands. “Why? Mom! Ew!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio releases her wrist from Agatha and begins to walk away, “I'm gonna go get Nicky.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Coward!” Agatha calls after her, before turning to Billy, and lets out a sigh. “You okay, teen? Do we need to have ‘the talk’ now?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy looks up at her, a look of pure exasperation on his face and turns away, taking his place in the table where breakfast has already been served.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mama already gave me the talk. She had a presentation ready, too.” He immediately turns back to his food, pulling out his phone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha thinks she does a pretty good job at hiding her surprise at that. She's gonna have to get Rio to show her the presentation later.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At Billy's request they decide to brave the mainland for the day.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When they step into the pier, Agatha passes Rio a hat and sunglasses, but refuses to give her her shirt back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Seriously?” Rio asks, laughing. “Mi amor, you want me to wear a hat and sunglasses, and no shirt?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shrugs, “I still feel a bit of chill.” A bold lie, and they both know it. “You'll be on the beach anyways, you don't need it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio rolls her eyes but doesn’t miss the way Agatha gently cradles her stomach in passing. Her smile softens, a touch of excitement in her voice as she replies, “Alright, but next time I’ll grab a jacket for you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agahta nods noncommittally, letting her eyes travel greedily through the expanse of skin on display. Rio rolls her eyes, and flexes a little for show.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy groans, dropping himself on the sand with a sigh. Rio and Agatha share a look and laugh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alright, go enjoy the beach and we'll meet back in two hours,” Agatha dismisses her family, still half annoyed Nicky picked Rio and the beach over shopping with her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio salutes her playfully as she and the kids walk towards the beach, Nicky holding both of their hands and jumping excitedly. Agatha watches the scene unfold, her family so happy and carefree, and she can’t help but smile. Billy and Rio exchange a glance, then both lift their arms the next time Nicky jumps, sending the little boy giggling into the air.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha has to remind herself she had a task coming here, and turns in the opposite direction to the main street.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Getting bad gifts her friends will hate is a hobby of hers during vacations. Last year, she gave Jen a “get well soon” card she picked up at the airport on their way back from Puerto Rico, and the year before, she found a cheap deck of tarot cards featuring European pop stars while visiting Croatia for Lilia. She needs to find something to top those gems.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Two stores in Agatha caughts sight of a red head she knows too well. Wanda.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha makes her way across the aisles in the opposite direction. If she barely  managed to avoid being recognized so far, her chances are slim to none with Wanda Maximoff at her side.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But luck would have, Wanda sees her and once she's made a decision, there's no dissuading Wanda.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey, you,” Wanda ways, sliding next to her with her peppy smile and throwing an arm over her shoulder. “So you took my suggestion.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It would seem that way,” Agatha replies, looking over her shoulder to see if they've been spotted. “Didn't know you were coming too.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Wanda laughs at that, “Well how else would I know about it?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shrugs, giving up on getting anything from this store and makes a turn for the exit. Maybe Wanda will stay back….
     <br/>
     <br/>
     No…it seems that won't be the case.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I will join you,” Wanda whispers with a laugh as they step outside the store. “Vis stayed back in the house, he wasn't feeling well. Too much sun, he said. How's Rio? Is she around? We should get dinner!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sighs. She should've taken the family to Sokovia, they wouldn't have found Wanda there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I'll have to ask Rio,” Agatha says, having only caught the latter part of Wanda's torrent of words. “Secret partners, you know how it is.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Wanda gives her a knowing look and laughs. “Vis and I are going to reveal our marriage after the elections. He doesn't want it to be biased when they show up to vote.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha snorts. If anything, being married to Wanda Maximoff would help him win the election. But she doesn't try to understand the logic of that guy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So, who are we getting a shifty gift?” Wanda asks as they walk around, and Agatha chuckles.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Maybe I was getting nice stuff this time around,” she mutters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Wanda stops them in the middle of the street, forcing Agatha to stop too, and takes her hand. “Are you dying, or is only Rio getting a gift?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, but laughs. “I'm gonna get you something so awful–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Wanda uses their joint hands to tug her forward, cutting her off. “Let's go find something nice for Vis and Rio. And after, I'll help you find gag gifts.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It’s two stores later, with Agatha carrying most of the bags, when she hears the distinct sound of a camera clicking behind them. She turns and spots the culprits: two teenagers doing a poor job of hiding their phones.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Wanda notices them too and sighs. “I’ll get us a car. It’s just kids; how bad could it be?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The answer, Agatha learns when she returns to the house, is really bad.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sometime between her and Wanda getting in the car and Agatha and the family getting back on the island, the photos have gone viral.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha takes a quick look at her social media to evaluate the damage. The photos have sparked a wildfire of rumors and jokes, and she quickly closes the app and sets her phone down.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     People now think (or joke?) that Wanda is Lady Death. It’s almost funny how easily they assume that any woman she’s seen with must secretly be her wife. The real challenge now is figuring out how to break the news to Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Turns out, though, she doesn't have to.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha knows the moment Rio sees the photos. One minute, Rio is laughing at something Billy is showing her; the next, her face falls. She frowns, looks up, and locks eyes with Agatha. Her gaze searches for something unspoken. Agatha tilts her head toward the dining room, silently asking to put a pin in this for now, and Rio nods.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Dinner passes like every other night on the island, with Rio and Agatha pushing Billy to join the conversation, and Nicky monopolizing everyone's attention as soon as he's given the chance. He tells Agatha about the beach on the mainland, the volley match Rio joined and how she helped the team win.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky is so excited about the story, he runs around the table to Rio and tries to climb the chair from behind her, “Mama put me on her shoulders and everyone cheered! She said I was the trophy. Mama! We gotta show mommy!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio catches him mid-climb and sends him back to his seat. “We can try after dinner,” she promises. True to her word, she ends up washing dishes with Nicky perched proudly on her shoulders.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha eventually convinces him to come down in time to watch a movie. Rio’s gaze softens as she mouths a silent thank you to Agatha before turning to wrestle Billy for control of the remote.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky is the first to fall victim of sleep, only twenty minutes into the movie. Agatha lowers him gently so that his head rests in her lap. They finish the movie like that, though Agatha loses the plot within the first half hour. The quick, playful exchanges between Rio and Billy as they compete to predict the ending are far more entertaining.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio and Billy agree on what the end will be and Agatha is impressed when they turn out to be right. They high-five each other laughing at their shared genius. Agatha rolls her eyes at the pair of them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Okay, I see it's the bro-ing hour,” she says standing to pick Nicky. “I'm gonna go to bed.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I got him,” Billy says, swooping in  faster than Agatha and picking up his little brother with ease. “Yes, mom, I'll tuck him in, and his stuffed animals too.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha narrows her eyes, trying to figure out what he’s up to. “Okay... goodnight, Billy.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy shoots her a grin and a not-so-subtle thumbs-up at Rio. “Goodnight, Moms.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With Billy gone, Agatha closes the gap between her and Rio, her hands sliding under Rio’s baggy shirt to rest on her waist. “Hey.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio drops her arms around Agatha’s shoulders and sighs contentedly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We did good with him,” Agatha continues, filling the silence. “We just gotta do it two more times.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Maybe even three,” Rio jokes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Is that all you heard from our visit to the clinic?” Agatha asks in mock disbelief. She knows Rio was paying more attention than her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Maybe, only time will tell,” Rio replies with a shrug, stepping back and holding out her hand. “Let's go to bed.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio pushes Agatha against the wall the minute they step into the bedroom. There’s a strange intensity about her that Agatha immediately finds very attractive.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh… you should do that more often,” Agatha says, her voice surprisingly level as she suddenly feels out of breath.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks briefly surprised by Agatha’s words but quickly recovers, pulling her into a hard, intense kiss. Agatha doesn’t have a moment to think about how they got here, she’s too focused on winning the battle of dominance in this kiss, this moment, wherever it’s going. She has some ideas, though.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio ends the kiss abruptly, but doesn’t move, keeping Agatha firmly pressed against the wall.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I saw the photos,” Rio says, sounding as out of breath as Agatha feels. “With Wanda.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Okay,” Agatha replies, searching her wife's face. “What—”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “They’re saying that she’s Lady Death,” Rio cuts her off, her voice rough around the edges in contrast with the soft touch of hands.“They’re saying she’s your wife, Agatha.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re my wife,” Agatha counters, maneuvering her hands around Rio’s hold to cup her face, tilting her head up to meet her eyes.“Not that I don’t love what’s happening here, and we’ll circle back to it in a moment, but you have nothing to be upset about, my love.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I am upset,” Rio admits quietly. “I’m not ready for people to know I’m Lady Death, but… I don’t want them to think your—”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio doesn’t finish the sentence. The thought is too unpleasant to put into words. She pulls something out of her pocket and brings it up for Agatha to see.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha scoffs, “Seriously?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio holds the sticker on her open palm between them. Her painted face stares at Agatha almost mockingly on the small, round sticker, the words ‘Lady Death was here’ in bold, bright letters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio.” It’s a warning, though Agatha isn’t sure what for. All logic has fled her mind. There’s only Rio’s body pressed against hers and those fiery brown eyes. Agatha almost wants to take a picture of her wife in this moment, frame it and put it somewhere everyone can see.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio doesn’t take the warning to heart. Her hands trace Agatha's neck, like she's tracing a map of her skin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha has trouble keeping her breathing steady as she follows the path of Rio’s hands, until they settle just below her collarbone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      “I think you want this, too.”
     </em>
     Rio whispers the words, like it’s a secret just between the two of them, and Agatha melts a little at being seen so clearly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio,” she tries again, watching intently as Rio peels off the sticker.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks at her then, her eyes dark but strangely comforting. She places the sticker under her collarbone, and Agatha gasps when Rio lowers her mouth to kiss the skin around it. Once satisfied with her work, Rio leans back, her expression barren of the intensity from before.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I love you,” Rio says softly, her voice full of adoration.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha nods, clearing her throat. “Yeah… I love you too, you beautiful weirdo.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles, running her fingers over the sticker with obvious pride. “Can I— Is it okay if I take a picture?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha doesn't know how to cry or laugh. “That's what you want to do right now?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shrugs, fishing her pocket for her phone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you gonna post it?” Agatha asks as Rio takes the photo.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I told Hela I’d behave today,” Rio says, distracted by the picture on her screen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha takes the opportunity to flip them so Rio is the one pressed against the door.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do it,” she dares, leaning in close. “Would a bad boy rockstar behave because her manager told her to?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio considers it, and Agatha wants to kiss her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How are you so sexy one minute and a total softie the next?” Agatha teases, leaning in to kiss her. “C’mon, sweetheart. Stake your claim over the great Agatha Harkness online, and then you're gonna put the phone down for tonight.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio narrows her eyes suspiciously. “Why?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha taps the sticker on her chest, smirking. “This wasn’t for free, my love.”
     <br/>
     <br/>

      “I want to get a dog.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha opens her eyes and sighs, deflating back into the bed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Good morning, my love. How did you sleep?” she deadpans.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio only laughs. “Buenos días, mi amor. ¿Cómo dormiste?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha closes her eyes, pretending she's about to fall back asleep. “You want a dog, you want a baby. What’s next? A pet chinchilla?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I want a chinchilla,” Nicky mumbles sleepily, throwing his arms around Agatha’s neck.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, Nicky slept here, by the way,” Rio says with a laugh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha glares at her over their son’s shoulder. “You don’t say.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before Rio can respond, Nicky lets out a dramatic groan and flops onto the middle of the bed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha and Rio exchange a look. Nicky has been sick since they returned from vacation, an ear infection that is being treated but still serves as an excuse for him to sneak into their bed in the middle of the night.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Everyone in the house has a soft spot for their youngest, but Agatha maybe more than anyone. She doubts Rio would even fight her for that title.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So Agatha scoops Nicholas up and settles him in her lap, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “How’s the patient feeling?” she asks softly, mindful of his sensitive ears.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio rolls her eyes from across the bed but doesn’t say anything.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mama’s being mean to me,” Nicky whispers. He hasn’t yet mastered the art of quiet whispering, so Rio hears him loud and clear and snorts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Young man,” she starts, her tone mock-stern, “you’re not getting pancakes in bed. More specifically, in my bed.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Our bed,” Agatha corrects, just to tease her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio rolls with it. “The point stands. This bed has three rules. Rule number one: no food in the bed—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “For one Rio Vidal,” Agatha finishes for her with a smirk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And,” Rio continues, undeterred, “one Nicholas Vidal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Harkness-Vidal,” Nicky mutters, and Agatha can’t help but laugh at the betrayed look on Rio’s face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Give it up, baby,” Agatha teases. “Go make the pancakes.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio sighs and gets up, though Agatha catches her small smile as she rounds the bed. “Fine, but we’re eating them at the table.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha beckons her closer with a hand for a good morning kiss, and Rio leans in eagerly, taking advantage of the moment to tickle Nicky’s side.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When he yelps, laughing despite his dramatic protests, Agatha swats at Rio’s hands. “Okay, bad boy. To the kitchen with you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio holds up her hands in surrender, turning just in time for Agatha to smack her butt.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I want strawberries,” Agatha adds, grinning.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio sticks out her tongue on her way out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      ***
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Reluctantly Agatha leaves Nicky under Sharon's care after breakfast. Hela is being awful and has planned out their day full of interviews to make up for Agatha canceling the last two before going on vacation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      In her defense Agatha was in her head about starting IVF, but Hela doesn't need to know that. Still, leaving their sick kid home has Agatha in a sour mood, and Rio, who can read her like she's her favorite book, takes her hand as they drive to the city, but doesnt try to get her to talk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The reveal of the interview actually being them reading thirst tweets about them does help lighten her mood, but it's a long way up and she's not willing to make it easy on anyone.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      After going through hair and make up she meets back with Rio on the set. Rio chats amicably with the production assistants who look a bit too sweet on her wife for Agatha's liking. But she's too proud to admit to jealousy. ,Instead, she drags her stool across the floor obnoxiously and sits down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio slides in the stool next to her with a playful smile not a second later.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you excited, mi amor?” she asks, pushing a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear, an obvious excuse to touch her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha exhales, already feeling more at ease. “I can tell you are.” She smirks when Rio beams at her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are we ready?” Someone asks from behind the camera and Agatha almost wants to march there and punch them for ruining the moment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio takes her hand under the table and nods. “We're good to go.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      An assistant slides the two phones with the preselected tweets already lined up and slides out of view.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They go over the presentations quickly, Agatha bored out of her mind having to perform pleasantries. People know who she is, she shouldn't have to spell it out for them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio flirts her way through introducing herself and Agatha rolls her eyes so hard people start laughing behind the camera.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You're ridiculous,” she mutters.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio responds by sliding the phone closer to her, her other arm sliding over Agatha's shoulder. “Go on, start reading, then. Let's see about these thirsting fans.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If there's not one tweet from you here, this is fake,” she bites back, and Rio rolls her eyes, her smile fond.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I thirst for you off-line strictly, my love.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha scoffs. “Your social media says otherwise.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio sticks out her tongue in answer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You're a goof,” Agatha says, containing another eye roll. Before her wife can recover, she turns back to the device holding the torture of the day. She can't tell if it will be torture for her or Rio yet.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright,” she scans the screen quickly, and chuckles at the first tweet. "
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Agatha being a diva is the reason I breathe. She’s mean, she’s hot, and she knows it. Destroy me, queen.
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She eyes Rio, more interested in her wife's reaction than her own, and by the silence in the studio, she thinks everyone else is too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio catches her eye and laughs, “I mean…okay,” she pauses, looking off camera. “Are they all gonna be like this?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      An assistant nods, and Rio grins, excitedly. “I bet they're so jealous of me. My love?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rolls her eyes at her wife, she'll have to find a better one next. Something to push her buttons. She doesn't want Rio to be a good sport about this.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She looks back at the screen, reading the tweet again and shrugs. “I'll destroy them. Next?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nods, encouraging.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You're enjoying this too much,” Agatha comments. “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Agatha Harkness didn’t just age like fine wine; she aged like a rare, expensive bottle I could never afford but dream of tasting.
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio seems more conflicted about that one, probably considering her odds of survival if she jokes about her age again, and Agatha lets it simmer. She waits, raising an eyebrow in challenge, knowing Rio will take the bait.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I thought you were supposed to be reacting too,” Rio says slowly, and Agatha can almost sense a pout in her words.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “This is more entertaining.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio rolls her eyes, and sighs. For a moment she stays still, like she's giving herself a mental pep talk, then she gives Agatha her trademark charming smile. “Only I can taste this wine,” she says confidently, but searching Agatha’s face, like she wants her to agree.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So of course Agatha doesn't. “They're right though, I did age fine.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio lets out a frustrated laugh. “You aged more than fine, Agatha.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay, stalker.” Agatha says with a mean laugh, watches Rio frown and leans in to kiss her cheek, before moving on as if nothing happened. “Next one.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Agatha Harkness in eyeliner and a leather jacket is proof the gods have favorites. And I’m not one of them
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is this one about my show?” Rio asks thoughtfully. Agatha smirks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah, the one where you lost the beat of your own song when I walked on stage.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio rolls her eyes, pretending to dismiss the comment, but Agatha can see the slight blush on her wife.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, I married you so,” Rio looks at the camera, smug smirk in place like she's got the killer blow all thought out. “They may not be the favorites, but I am.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rolls her eyes, and wraps her fingers around Rio’s chin, tugging her so she's looking at her. “Behave.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughs a little but nods. “Mean.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha ignores her, turning back to the camera, “And that was all.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She puts the phone down resolutely, and waits for Rio to pick up hers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm honestly a little nervous,” Rio admits quietly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha has to resist the urge to kiss her wife. Lady Death is being awfully soft today, it's doing strange things to her heart. Hela won't like how they're once again murdering her reputation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I will hold your hand if that helps, darling,” Agatha offers with a coy smile and Rio looks offended by the offer for half a second before taking Agatha's hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay,” Rio clears her throat and clicks on the first tweet. “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Lady Death growling into the mic is the auditory equivalent of a thirst trap. Growl louder, Daddy Death, I’m listening
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . Oh, okay. I feel encouraged now, like sure it will damage my vocal chords but I can-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do it.” Agatha keeps her gaze steady, challenging her, again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio narrows her eyes, like she's assessing what's the play. Finally, she laughs and gives a half hearted growl.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You can do better than that,” Agatha teases, enjoying the way Rio looks at her, absolutely done but also too soft for her to stop her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha,” Rio whines, dragging her name out.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just read the next one, baby,” Agatha says with a dismissive flick of her hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shakes herself, and reads the next tweet. “This is an attack,” she eyes the people behind the camera with a half hearted glare. “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Lady Death may be a bad boy on stage, but the way she melts for Agatha is peak simp energy. And it’s so hot.
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Well, at least it's hot?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha genuinely laughs at that. “Yes, take your wins. You're a simp but you're hot. Good job,” she adds with a condescending smirk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio makes use of the arm around Agatha's shoulder to tug her closer so they're nose to nose. "You're being so mean to me."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "You like it," Agatha replies without missing a beat.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Damn it, I do." And she leans in casually to kiss her for the briefest of seconds, when she steps back she looks like she'd rather stay put. "Next tweet?"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hums, nodding with her head in answer not trusting herself to speak. They need to ban kissing during interviews because there's no way she doesn't look like she wants to eat her wife alive right now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Lady Death’s abs? Her leather outfits? Her face paint? I’m ready to sign over my soul. Where do I apply?"
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Rio's face lights up. “I was hoping they'd bring up my abs at some point. As for the other thing, you can contact my manager-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groans, cutting her off by grabbing her chin a second time. Fans will make a whole thing out of this, she can feel it, but she doesn't care right now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey,” is all that she comes up with that isn't just a loop of ‘mine, mine, mine.’
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio looks up, her eyes soft despite the cameras and Agatha's hold.“Yes, my love.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha drops Rio's face like wasn't just staking her claim a second ago. “Are there any more tweets?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "I think this one is about the both of us,” Rio says, attention back on the screen. “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Agatha Harkness and Lady Death??? The MILF x DILF agenda is stronger than ever.”
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Rio reads, then turns to Agatha. "Thoughts?"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shrugs with ease, feeling herself slip back in control. "I'm a MILF, you're a DILF. Checks out.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "You can't say you're a MILF," Rio says, that mischievous smile on her lips like she just picked her newest hill to die on, and gods, Agatha finds her misplaced confidence way too attractive.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sighs, pretending she's not curious with what her wife has come up with. “Why not?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Because it implies you'd fuck yourself,” Rio replies, sounding absolutely too sure of her logic.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha immediately snorts. "I think you're thinking about this way harder than anyone else in the history of ever"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio just laughs, "Hey, I'm right."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Well so am I," Agatha declares, enjoying the back and forth so much it almost makes her forget they're on camera.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "So you're saying you'd fuck yourself." Rio shakes her head in mock-disappointment, and Agatha shrugs in response.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Well I still think I'm right," Rio says after a beat, and Agatha can't hold it any longer and just bursts out laughing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "No,” she says when she's managed to compose herself, and takes the phone from Rio's hand. “I don't trust you to read anymore.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Their dynamic is ‘mean hot wife and simp hot wife, and it’s everything I’ve ever wanted in a couple.”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha holds Rio’s gaze, waiting and Rio rolls her eyes. “Whatever.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, no. You're the simp wife to my mean wife,” Agatha repeats with a smirk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nods, smiling a little, “Don't forget hot.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Darling, I would never. I'm your hot mean wife.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The team behind the camera breaks out in laughter and Agatha takes it as their cue to leave. She remains unsure of who tortured who in the end, but at least it's over. Teasing and flirting with her wife on camera was fun , but she's tired and she misses her boys.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She hears in passing about the team having ‘Rio Vidal thirst tweets’ they didn't get to use and quickly sends Hela a message to get them for her, before moving onto her other messages. Sharon has been sending them updates on Nicky throughout the day, but Agatha still wants to see for herself that he's feeling better. She can't get home fast enough.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      ***
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The night finds them curled on the couch when the kids have gone to bed, Nicky asleep in his own bed for now, Billy probably on the phone with Eddie.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With the excuse that she has yet to take a pregnancy test Agatha sends Rio to fetch them a bottle of wine, but she's unsurprised when Rio returns with two bottles of non-alcoholic beer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Y'know that takes the fun from beer,” Agatha mutters as Rio sits down next to her and passes her one of the bottles.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio just shrugs, dropping her head on Agatha's shoulder. Her hair is still wet from the shower, immediately beginning to soak through Agatha's flannel.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I like this on you,” Rio says about the flannel in question. A gift from her, from the single tour of The Court, acquired on a random stop of the bus in Texas. Despite her initial reticence, Agatha has found herself growing fond of the garment over the years.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It's comfy,” she replies noncommittally and takes a sip of beer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughs, putting her bottle down and sitting up facing Agatha with a thoughtful expression. “It brings out your eyes,” she says after a minute.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You're such a simp.” Agatha laughs at Rio's tired sigh, and quickly decides to make it worse. “Speaking of which, I sent Hela to get me the thirst tweets about you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A second tired sigh from her wife, and Agatha puts her own bottle down and takes Rio's hands. “Not Lady Death, babe, you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stares at her in shock for about three seconds. “People write thirst tweets about me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha laughs at that, “Shocking news, you're hot.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Rio doesn't immediately answer, Agatha gets impatient.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “People think you're hot, Rio. I think you're hot,” she drops her phone on the table thirst tweets forgotten. “I want to show you off too, and not just the face paint, chaos loving side of you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “This feels an awful lot like manipulation,” Rio mutters but doesn't tell her to stop either.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is it working?” Agatha asks with a hopeful smile.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio exhales, dropping herself back on the couch. “I'm not a superstar like you, and I don't want to be,” she says it like it's the most make-sense thing. “There's a reason I wear a face full of makeup and use a stage name.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You want the best of both worlds?” Agatha asks, a smile tugging at her lips and Rio rolls her eyes. “Rockstar Hannah Montana.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Fuck off,” Rio says, but there's no bite in her words.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha picks up on it immediately. “If I'm being honest I always imagined you more of a Troy Bolton type.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio seems to want to ask for about a minute before deciding it would be fruitless.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is there a world in which I can hold your hand in public and attend industry events with you, no makeup, no pretense, and we don't have to say a thing?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The world catches Agatha by surprise, and she has to think about it, think what that looks like. Sure, she's never cared for her fans enough to want them to know about her life off the stage, but now that she has Rio to show off, that Rio lets her shower her off minus the face…well, Agatha quite enjoys it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don't know,” she admits after a beat, and then grins, her wife's expression puzzled before she speaks again. “But let's find out.”

     The video of them reading thirst tweets quickly, and unsurprisingly goes viral. Agatha has too much fun reading the comments to Rio, and they sit side by side on the edge of the bathtub, waiting for the pregnancy test results to be ready.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groans for the third time in just a few minutes, face a slight shade of pink that has Agatha holding her own laughter just so she can make the moment last.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     But as the seconds tick by, Agatha stops reading, anxiety creeping in. What if she's not pregnant? What if she is? It took three cycles of IVF to get pregnant with Nicky, and then she had such a terrible time for the first two months–
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio interrupts her racing thoughts when she reaches to take her phone from her ironclad grip.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I suspect you may be reading the ones that make you look good,” she says, her voice light.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looks up, catching Rio’s gaze and her wife’s mischievous smile. She nods once and tries to relax.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here's a good one,” Rio speaks again, laughter already coloring her words.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Agatha Harkness looked at Lady Death post-kiss like she was going to devour her and then tried to play it cool and FAILED.

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who's the simp now, babe?” she asks.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorts, not even giving her a moment to enjoy it. “Still you, I'm afraid.” She pauses then, and Rio catches her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We've got a couple more minutes left,” she says.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grabs the phone from her wife, and begins scrolling through her feed. Hela's selection doesn't do it justice to just how much damage Rio's bad boy reputation has taken.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “I thirst for you strictly offline, my love. LADY DEATH YOU ARE A CLOWN. AN EMBARRASSMENT. A SIMP OF THE HIGHEST ORDER.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha starts laughing half way through, but composes herself to finish, staring Rio down with a winning smile. “I still like you, though.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughs, slowly lifting her head up to face Agatha's grin. “Well you're stuck with me, so you better.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know exactly who I married,” she replies cheekily, quickly looking for the next tweet.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I thought Lady Death was supposed to be a badass, not a wife guy who blushes when Agatha teases her. SHE CAN'T EVEN PRETEND TO BE COOL WHEN HER WIFE IS AROUND.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm a badass,” Rio mutters stubbornly, and Agatha is about to reply when the phone buzzes over the sink, signaling the results are ready. Rio gives a small reassuring smile and picks up the tests, her face carefully neutral.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lasts exactly three seconds before Rio's silence becomes unbearable. “What does it say?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The answer, Agatha thinks, is on Rio's incredibly soft expression, but she still rips the tests from her wife's hand to see for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Positive. Positive. Positive.

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Shit.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm pregnant,” she mutters quietly, trying to wrap her head around it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio surges forward, wrapping her hands on Agatha's face, lifting her head gently so she's looking at her. Her expression is searching for a moment, and then she smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are being ridiculous,” Agatha says with feigned nonchalance.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sees right through her bullshit, Agatha knows it the moment her wife's soft smile deepens.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you feeling?” Rio asks.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tries and fails to keep her cool.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She loves being a mom. She loves watching Rio with their children. Loves the family they’ve built together, despite the doubts she had earlier in their relationship when Rio first brought up wanting kids, back when she was knee-deep in student debt and still applying to grad school.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     Agatha remembers looking at her then and thinking she was a fool. A fool who was just the right brand of weird to make Agatha reconsider her stance on having children.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio made her believe she could be a mother. That she could love a child right. And now, they’re about to do it again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She thinks of a little girl with Rio's eyes, and her cheeky smile and feels her heart flutter at the image she's conjured.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     In her silence, Rio reads an answer Agatha doesn’t bother to put into words.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     But when she leans in, bringing their mouths together, Agatha doesn't need to know anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you,” Rio whispers reverently against her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha is quick to use the baby as an excuse to get her way. So, naturally, she invites herself to The Court's weekend work trip to New York City.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, Rio's schedule will be packed, with an interview and photoshoot for a music magazine, plus a late-night show appearance as musical guests, but Agatha knows her wife. She will find them time.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice doesn't seem fazed by Agatha's appearance, but she rolls her eyes and spends the entire flight teasing Rio about it. Of course, Agatha tags along for that too.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As a sort of truce Agatha offers to pay for their dinner and insists they go to Rio’s favourite spot in the city, from way back in her Julliard days. She calls ahead to get them a private table and the three of them enjoy the peace and quiet before the chaos to come.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Over dinner, Alice brings up Rio’s latest project, the song she wrote for Agatha, and has way too much fun throwing ideas for a music video the fans would love. Agatha listens, one eyebrow raised, as Alice describes a fight scene, Rio in leather wielding a dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She's…intrigued.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You've always been a very creative mind,” she offers noncommittally.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice smirks and excuses herself  citing the need for a good night of rest before the busy weekend ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once they’re alone, Rio reaches across the table, taking Agatha’s hand in hers and looking every bit like a lovesick teenager. She’s been doing that a lot since they found out Agatha is pregnant.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “People are gonna talk,” Agatha teases, but she makes no move to let go.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile deepens and she pulls at their hands so Agatha has to lean forward. “Let them talk,” she whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hums in approval, she's not forgotten her early promise to Rio. To be seen together and then not talk about it. She's been waiting for the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you remember when you'd come to visit, and we'd come here to escape my shitty studio apartment?” Rio asks with a fond smile.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha does remember. Pregnancy has her feeling sentimental, maybe that’s why she decided to tag along for this trip. She hates to admit it, but a lot of their story happened here. Much of it, regretfully, in Rio’s tiny apartment near the school. To this day, Agatha still thinks the only reason they were never found out was because the neighbors refused to believe that pop star Agatha Harkness would ever set foot in their building. And, for anyone else, they would have been right.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As much as she loves to talk about how she’s ruined Rio’s bad boy reputation, her own reputation is at stake when it comes to her wife.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That hole in the wall with a door was awful,” she says dryly. “I regret to admit I have fond memories of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raises an eyebrow, a smile tugging at her lips. “Do tell.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shakes her head. She’s said enough. Rio doesn’t need to know how she always enjoyed watching her cook breakfast from the bed just a few feet away, or how they’d lie wrapped in each other’s arms at night, laughing at the neighbors yelling at their TV through the thin walls.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanna walk back to the hotel?” she asks instead, and as they step outside she makes sure to pull Rio’s hoodie off her head and grab her hand tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Let them talk indeed.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lies in bed, absentmindedly humming the tune of Rio's little love ballad, the one that's been stuck in her head since they came back from vacation, as she traces lazy patterns on her wife's bare back.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s put the house up for sale,” she says after a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence between them isn’t uncomfortable, but Agatha has never really stopped thinking about it. Rio hasn’t brought it up again either, and now… now that their family is growing, Agatha needs—
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckles quietly, the sound muffled by the pillow, halting Agatha’s train of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on,” she presses, though her voice comes out softer than intended. “I swear I’ll let you decorate the baby’s room.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turns then, her smile so soft it catches Agatha by surprise. She reaches for Agatha’s hand, guiding it under her own and placing it gently over her stomach. “My love, I would be a fool to fall for that again.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha resumes tracing patterns over Rio’s skin, thinking of her next argument.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you want?” she asks instead.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks up, smiling like she’s merely indulging her by having this conversation. She thinks about it for a few moments before wrapping her arms around Agatha’s waist and pulling her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I have the basement?” Rio asks, and Agatha rolls her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     No, she cannot have the basement—that’s Agatha’s domain. Always has been, always will be. She finds an odd sense of peace there, in the quiet of the room at the heart of their home. Rio is lucky she’s even allowed in. Not that Agatha doesn’t miss her wife lounging on the couch whenever she’s down there alone.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can have a custom-built studio,” she counters.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shakes her head, laughing. Agatha leans in, pressing a kiss to her lips, hoping to distract her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “A bigger pool,” she adds next, kissing her again. “Maybe a big home office? A game room?” Another kiss. “A treehouse?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lets out a shaky laugh. “Agatha…”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha playfully bites her, suppressing a chuckle. “Okay, last offer. You can—have your dog.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabs Agatha’s wrist, gently pushing her back to study her expression. “You mean it?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A baby. A dog. At this point, Agatha thinks she may have to admit she’s just as down bad as Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With a delighted laugh, Rio rolls them over so she’s on top of Agatha, kissing her sweetly before hopping out of bed and grabbing her shirt from the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m gonna get my laptop,” she explains, grinning. “Gotta check the dogs they have at the shelter. You think a big dog or a small dog? Personally, I think—”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha catches her wrist before she can escape. “It can wait. I can’t, though—I need my little spoon and my beauty sleep.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s seven-thirty,” Rio points out, though she lets Agatha pull her back into bed. “I have an interview at eleven. And you are always beautiful, my love.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sweet-talker,” Agatha mutters, burying her nose in Rio’s hair. “Even bad boys need sleep, hon.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice doesn’t say anything when Agatha joins them for their day of photoshoots and impromptu interviews between takes. But she does inform her that she’s looking clingy by following her wife everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignores her because Alice is wearing a ridiculous pair of red leather shorts with a matching vest, along with her usual face paint, and Agatha simply can’t take her seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You sound awfully single, Knight,” she says, mocking the stage name.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice huffs and walks away, joining Rio—who is also in an equally absurd leather ensemble—in front of the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They both look ridiculous. If it were Agatha, she’d be kicking and screaming, but the two fools currently being photographed seem to be having fun.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, you’ve gained a great deal of new fans since the festival a few months ago,” the journalist—who has been standing next to the photography team, asking questions at her leisure—says suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha perks up, suddenly interested.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s been your favorite part of the whole experience?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha puts her book down. She was lying to herself when she brought it along. Instead, she turns slightly to observe the two fools that make up The Court. She finds her wife already looking at her and shoots her a wink.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s face flushes pink under the white lights of the set. Alice rolls her eyes at her bandmate.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ve always felt the love of the fans,” Alice says, glancing at Rio to see if she’s recovered and agrees. “The Court is a decade-old project now. Death and I have been in the music industry for longer, but when we’re on stage, it’s been nice to see people show up and have fun with us.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With the attention now on her, Rio straightens slightly, as if preparing to slip into character. Agatha watches her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio keeps her gaze locked on the journalist, but she smiles like she knows Agatha is watching.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think, unfairly so, I’ve received more attention than my dear Knight here,” she says smoothly. “I appreciate our fans, old and new. I think my favorite part has been the conversations that have come up from our little band reaching fresh audiences. People are discussing our work, ranking our music and performances—I feel like a rat in a lab being performance checked. I enjoy it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cackles at that. There goes her request for Rio to act like she isn’t here.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The journalist looks at her, then back at Rio, then at Alice. Agatha doesn’t need to find Hela to know the woman is fuming somewhere in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio has abandoned her stool and is walking toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Was the set always this quiet?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t get to dwell on it because Rio has reached her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “My love,” Rio grumbles, sliding the drumsticks into the back pocket of her green leather trousers. Her hands slide over Agatha’s knees, parting her legs as she steps even closer.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Now Agatha is certain the entire production team has gone silent, like a communal held breath, watching them.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio doesn’t seem to have noticed. And when Agatha looks up, catching her wife’s gaze, she slips into their little bubble, too.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re ruining my reputation,” Rio whispers, her smile completely contradicting her words.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckles, wrapping her arms around Rio’s waist. “You were doing such a good job, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio holds her gaze, as if trying to figure out whether she means it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can’t focus with you here,” she admits with a resigned smile.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Neither can I,” Agatha confesses, thinking of her neglected book. “Do you want me to go?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shakes her head.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha has to resist the urge to kiss her wife. Although at this point… would it even make a difference?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll have Hela kick me out,” she muses. “God, she’ll enjoy it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She gives Rio her best puppy-dog eyes, and Rio snorts before closing the distance to kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s far too short-lived for Agatha’s liking, and she chases after Rio for another kiss just as she pulls away.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiles against her lips and playfully pushes her back.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll see you when you’re done with your bad boy rocker business,” Agatha teases as Rio steps away.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     On the drive back to the hotel, she shoots Hela a text:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Confiscate the prop drumsticks from Rio.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Staying in the hotel all day is boring, but Agatha isn’t fond enough of New York to want to go out. So she scrolls through social media for a while and talks to Billy, who has a long list of complaints, ranging from being left with Lilia to how people still won’t stop talking about the thirst tweets.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “If I have to hear one more classmate say my moms are hot, I’m gonna yell,” he says, exasperated.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t comment on how he’s already sort of yelling. She just nods along, and when he’s done, she suggests he give the same speech to Rio later.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky is much better company. Lilia sets him up in front of the phone on her floral-printed couch and offers him a chocolate chip cookie to get him talking. He doesn’t need it, but he gladly accepts it anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say thank you,” Agatha reminds him, her eyes searching his face carefully, taking in every little detail of her boy.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky stops chewing, and for an instant, his crooked smile makes him look exactly like Rio’s twin.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you, Aunt Lilia,” he says through a mouthful of cookie.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia chuckles somewhere behind him. “You’re welcome, kid. You’re more well-behaved than both your moms.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky giggles, covering his mouth with one hand as he stares at Agatha expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry, hon, I have no defense for that,” she admits with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky looks delighted by her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After lunch, she takes a long bath, attempting to distract herself from what feels a lot like misery now that her wife is gone for the day. When she steps back into the room, she checks her phone, hoping to find a text from Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she finds one from Sharon.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Scanning the message quickly, she learns that Jen is making an appearance on a talk show tomorrow to introduce her new beauty line. Apparently, the show is trying to get the band to show their support.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha isn’t sure if she actually supports it, but she sure as hell can show up and mess with Jen while Rio preps for her late-night appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She texts Sharon that she’ll do it and lets her manager handle the details.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Deciding she’s bored enough to brave New York City after all, she grabs some casual clothes from her suitcase and, on a whim, throws on Rio’s shirt from last night.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After texting Rio that she’s going out, she’s not surprised to find Hela waiting for her in the hotel lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your wife insisted I drive you around,” Hela says, sounding thoroughly disinterested. “She’s being more weird than usual.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha doesn’t answer, finding the idea of annoying Hela far more amusing than the conversation the manager is trying to start.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What does one do in New York for fun?” She asks Hela instead, knowing the woman is as fond of the city as she is.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck if I know,” Hela mutters following after her. “This place is a damn tourist trap.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, Hela’s demeanor surprises her throughout the day. She keeps her comments her usual brand of curt and cutting, following after her like a guard dog, a very reluctant guard dog. But when Agatha asks, Hela not only gets them coffee from Rio’s favorite shop but also agrees to help her find a flower shop.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha takes a sip of her coffee and pauses. She takes another sip, tasting it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You got me decaf,” she says, tone accusatory.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela barely looks up from her phone, where she’s searching for a shop that sells the specific orchids Rio likes but can’t get back home.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” she replies, voice giving nothing away. But Agatha has known her long enough to catch the hint of satisfaction there.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She's in a sour mood all the way back to the hotel, and Hela just laughs while carrying the bags.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When she arrives back at the hotel, Rio is already there. She’s standing in the doorway when Agatha opens the door, a lazy smile on her lips, arms already stretched out to welcome her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought I heard you,” she mutters against Agatha’s neck. Then, when she steps back, Rio grins. “You’re wearing my shirt.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugs, downplaying it. “Pretty sure it was mine before. If anything, I recovered it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opens her mouth to retort, a dangerous smile playing on her lips, but Agatha walks past her before she can.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “How did the rest of your day go?” she asks, dropping the bags on the couch and carefully arranging the potted orchids on the coffee table.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The plants catch Rio’s attention, and she joins Agatha, sitting on the floor and observing them with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “These for me?” she asks, gently tracing the dark black petals.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Figured they’d look good in the new house,” Agatha teases.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shakes her head, laughing softly. “The interview went well, I think. It all depends on whether they decide it’s newsworthy that you were there.” She grins. “I threw in my two cents for what the article should be called.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s hear it,” Agatha encourages.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “The Bad Boys of Rock,” Rio says with a straight face.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha immediately cracks up.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She takes so long to recover that Rio abandons the plants, sits next to her on the couch, and drops her head onto Agatha’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you,” Agatha whispers quietly. She almost thinks Rio didn’t hear her, but her wife tilts her head up and smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I love you, my love,” Rio says, her voice reverent. One of her hands falls gently on Agatha’s stomach. “And this little lady too… Agatha Junior.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slaps her hand away. “I hate you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, the mood swings,” Rio jokes, instinctively dodging Agatha’s next swat.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Y’know, it could be a boy,” Agatha says after a moment. Her own hand takes the place of Rio’s on her stomach, and she looks down, biting her lip. “Do you—would you—?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will love our baby no matter what,” Rio says, cutting her off before she can finish the thought. “I love them already, Agatha. I swear.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Realistically, Agatha knows it’s true. But having grown up the way she did, with her mother, doubts creep up at the worst times.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will still want to call them Agatha Junior, though,” Rio teases, tilting Agatha’s head up so they’re eye to eye. “You’ll still be my favorite Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s laugh is light, and she leans into Rio’s touch, closing her eyes briefly. “You’re a fool.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anything for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha believes her.

     <span>
      The early morning sunlight streams through the curtains of the hotel room, but Agatha is already awake. Matter of fact she's been awake for a while now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Waking up before Rio is such a strange occurrence, always has been, but the activities of their first day in New York seem to have tired her out enough for her to sleep past her usual wake up time. For thirty minutes and counting Agatha has enjoyed the rare opportunity to observe her wife under the morning light, to take in the soft features she loves so much looking peaceful and relaxed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Surely, it isn't weird to watch your spouse sleep, right? And Rio looks so peaceful, so beautiful. Agatha almost wants to forgive her for escaping her place as the little spoon, moving out of her arms in her sleep. Almost. At least Rio still reached for her in the night, her arms now resting against Agatha even in sleep.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stirs, then, and moves back in, burrowing herself on Agatha’s warmth, tangling their legs together.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Morning,” Agatha whispers, running her hands over Rio’s hair.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She smiles when her wife hums in acknowledgement, and then Rio's socked feet touch her shins and Agatha rolls her eyes so hard she thinks they may get stuck there one day.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The fact that you wear socks to bed is my least favorite thing about you,” Agatha whispers next, smiling against her better judgment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her breath sends goosebumps across Rio’s skin, but she doesn’t move. Instead, she just laughs—soft and sleepy. Agatha stares at her for a moment, debating whether to be offended or to kiss the sleepiness out of her like she really wants to.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It's not like this isn't a conversation they've had before, and is not like Agatha has gotten anywhere with it. She's not even trying to, these many years into their relationship she's learned to accept Rio is a weird one. If it wasn't a deal breaker a decade and a half ago, it sure isn't gonna be now, two and a half kids and still wildly in love later.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tell me your favorites then,” Rio replies after a moment, her voice thick with sleep.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, I'm dead serious,” Agatha says, but she knows Rio can hear the amusement in her voice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mi amor, my feet would get cold,” Rio whispers, hands tugging at Agatha's pajama top as she tries to burrow closer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha grins, feeling the satisfaction of a hunter that got their hands on the prey. “Personally, I care more about aesthetics.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio can tell she’s teasing, but she still plays along.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "I'm gonna sleep naked except for socks—for aesthetics' sake," Rio whispers, and Agatha can feel the smirk against her skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Don't you dare!" Agatha says in mock outrage, using their tangled legs to twist them around so she can land on top, hands on either side of Rio’s head. "No socks, and it’s a deal."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her hair falls around them like a curtain, shielding them from the rest of the world. Rio finally looks up at her, a soft, playful smile tugging at her lips—like this was what she wanted all along.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I can lift you,” Rio says half heartedly, too distracted by the sudden closeness to actually follow through.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckles, the sound almost mocking, because she knows Rio won't follow through. “I could lift you too.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio doesn’t even pretend to care. Instead, she runs her hands over Agatha’s arms, then her shoulders, fingers tracing the toned muscles there. "Not gonna lie, that's fucking sexy of you."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "I don't do it for you," Agatha replies nonchalantly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But she hums appreciatively when Rio’s hands slip under her shirt, fingers ghosting over her back before settling at her waist, pulling her down until she’s fully on top of her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A gasp leaves Rio’s lips the moment Agatha’s full weight settles against her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Good morning," she says, voice low and a little breathless.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Good morning indeed, Agatha thinks to herself.
     </span>

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What about Florence?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha puts her cup of tea down and stares blankly at her wife, who has spent the whole morning coming up with the most ridiculous names with no reason other than her own amusement.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That's a very pretentious name for a dog,” she mutters.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio absentmindedly swirls her spoon around her coffee. "For the baby, then.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I like Rio Junior,” Agatha retorts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I think you like Rio Senior,” Rio says without missing a beat, putting her coffee down to snatch a strawberry from Agatha's plate.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckles dryly, moving the plate further away. “I wouldn't bet on that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The sound of Rio’s laughter is music to Agatha’s ears, blocking out the noise of the city below. New York has only ever made sense with Rio in it. Even now, she only cares about the woman sitting next to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio searches her gaze, eyes impossibly soft. “This weekend had been a nice change of pace, I like–”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Having me all to yourself without thinking one of the kids will come bursting through the door?” Agatha supplies playfully, cutting Rio’s train of thought.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She's rewarded with a little laugh. “I mean, that too. I just like spending time with you like this, just the two of us.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wants to say that’s about to get a lot harder with another kid on the way, but she doesn’t. Not yet. Rio looks at her like the world only exists within the space of their hotel room, and Agatha isn’t quite ready to break the illusion. The weekend is coming to an end, and she does miss the kids, but being here—in this awful city—has reminded her of a time when she used to hate it a little less. When she reluctantly called New York home for two years, because her love decided to be foolish and get into more debt to get more into music.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      At this point, Agatha can’t tell if the pregnancy has made her sentimental or if she’s simply gotten older while she wasn’t looking. But Rio still looks at her like she’s the hottest woman alive. And, well—she is. But it’s nice of Rio to keep reminding her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "I should probably check my schedule for today," Rio says, voice quiet and unconvinced as she reaches for her phone, abandoned between their plates of food.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Do you really?" Agatha asks, taking her hand and pulling it into her lap.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio grins, her face lighting up with that mischievousness Agatha loves. “I think it can wait a little.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That's my girl.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha tugs Rio closer by the wrist she's holding and brings  their mouths together, sighing against her wife's lips. The kiss is lazy, slow and deliberate, like they have all the time in the world.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      ***
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>

      All the time in the world is short lived.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s phone begins buzzing on the table too soon after and Agatha reluctantly lets her check what all the hassle is about.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Rio steps inside to pick up Hela's call Agatha follows her pacing inside the room from her spot in the balcony trying to read her body language to figure out what's going on.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The pacing alone tells Agatha her wife is nervous.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But then, so did the way she lingered this morning—the lazy kisses she pressed into Agatha’s skin, the deliberate, slow touches meant to make every moment feel eternal. The way she stayed in bed long after they had caught their breath, instead of bolting up to start the day.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Breakfast had only come when Agatha's stomach broke the comfortable silence that had fallen between them, and Rio, always the dutiful wife, had kissed her temple and finally gotten out of bed to order room service.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And now, she paces the hotel room, her nerves manifesting in the subtle tics Agatha knows all too well but hasn’t seen before a show in years—not since the early days of The Court.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha takes note of each one. The way Rio runs a hand through her hair. The tension in her shoulders. The rhythmic tapping of her fingers against her leg as she walks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Rio ends the call, her head drops, and she exhales a tired breath. She doesn’t realize Agatha is watching her, and Agatha makes no move to show otherwise. She just waits, knowing Rio will come back to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey,” Rio says, stepping back onto the balcony.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha notices her empty hands, there are no pockets on her basketball shorts so she must've let her phone inside.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Come here,” Agatha says, beckoning her closer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio pretends to hesitate, but the truth reveals itself in the way she sags into Agatha’s touch—the way her body softens against Agatha’s chest, the quiet sigh she lets out when Agatha wraps her arms around her waist and presses soft kisses along her jaw.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What's the matter, my love?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio tilts her head back, granting Agatha more access. She happily takes advantage, but she hasn’t forgotten the question—no matter how tempting her wife is.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Rio," she tries again—but then gets distracted by the taste of Rio’s skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio gasps when Agatha drags her teeth over a particularly sensitive spot—one she loves to exploit—and Agatha debates, for a moment, whether she even wants to have this conversation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Fuck, Agatha," Rio breathes, voice low and ragged, and—nope. She doesn't wanna have this conversation, actually.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her hands move before her brain can catch up, sliding under Rio’s hoodie, dragging her nails over toned muscles of her abdomen.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you think anyone would notice if I were to fuck you on this very balcony?” she asks casually, and when Rio laughs, Agatha can feel the vibrations under her hands. “I’m serious.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You're insatiable,” Rio says, turning her face so she can catch her gaze.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha gets momentarily lost in the sight of her wife’s flushed face, her brown eyes turned molten gold under the morning light, pupils blown wide.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you…complaining?” she asks, raising an eyebrow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      One of her hands tangled in Rio’s hair, pulling her closer, kissing her before she can respond.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You're nervous,” she says when they break apart for air. “Let me get your mind off things.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio doesn't answer with words. She stands up and offers Agatha her hand. “Let's take this inside.”

      When Rio eventually has to get ready for soundcheck and some promo for the show, Agatha lays on her side in bed, watching her wife move around the room in just a white shirt and no trousers, searching for her shoes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Not that I don’t love the view," she comments casually, "but shouldn’t you find your trousers first?"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stops walking, looks down at herself, then back at Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "What if I don’t go?" she asks, stepping back toward the bed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckles, sitting up as she grabs Rio by the wrist and redirects her toward the open suitcases on the carpeted floor.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Okay," she says, inspecting the contents of the bags Sharon had so carefully packed—now a mess thanks to Rio’s intervention. Agatha pulls out a pair of black jeans and her own purple flannel. "Here, wear this. Your boots are by the door. I’ll check if your bag is all set."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She slides into her favorite silk robe before heading off to find Rio’s backpack.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Generally, Agatha would say backpacks are childish and impractical. But Rio is a messy person who could never live out of a handbag like a proper adult. She’s also weirdly attached to the backpack Billy got her for her birthday two years ago, and the zillion pockets for every little trinket Rio could ever find.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha quickly checks its contents: laptop, headphones, two sets of drumsticks. She spots Rio's little songwriting notebook tucked between two rolls of colored tape and her water bottle. Should I take a peek? she wonders, but before she can decide, Rio steps out of the room, adjusting the cuffs of her flannel.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha swallows, momentarily forgetting about the backpack altogether.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "You look… too good," she comments nonchalant, resting her hands on Rio’s shoulders just to touch her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio is quiet for a moment, probably overthinking her response. "I feel… soft," she admits.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wants to tell her she is soft, but she knows that wouldn’t help. Instead, she tilts her head. "And what’s wrong with that?"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugs, too careful for it to be careless. Agatha studies her wife’s face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "You have nothing to be nervous about," she murmurs, leaning in, whispering the words just for Rio, even though they’re alone. "You’ve played in front of bigger crowds before, and you’ll have Alice with you. Just take it one breath at a time. And if you decide you never want to do this kind of thing again, I’ll happily keep you all to myself."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughs softly, nodding as she grabs Agatha by the waist and bumps their foreheads together. "I’m just overthinking this, huh?"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Probably," Agatha whispers. She presses a kiss to Rio’s cheek before stepping back and handing her the backpack. "Off you go then, superstar."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a laugh, Rio grabs her stuff and heads for the door. But just as she reaches for the doorknob, sunglasses askew, she pauses.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Agatha," she says, "I love you."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smiles, a fondness swelling in her chest so strong she thinks it might actually hurt later. She crosses the room, presses Rio firmly against the door, and kisses her breathless.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Love you too, now off you go, rockstar.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      ***
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She had almost forgotten about the stupid TV appearance for Jen’s little launch of… something? A new passion project doomed to be quickly forgotten, or another scam.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But she’s chatting with the boys over a video call when her phone buzzes with a message from Hela—one of the makeup artists is coming up to help her get ready for the “interview.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Shit
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ,” she mutters, putting her phone down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky lets out a scandalized yelp that makes her laugh. “Mommy, you said a bad word!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha catches Billy failing to contain his laughter. “Not a word, teen,” she warns before turning her attention to the younger boy. “Mommy is sorry, bud. I’ve just had a very bad day. Why don’t you go ask Aunt Lilia for one of the chocolate chip cookies Mama sent for you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicholas, easily distracted by the mention of cookies, eagerly says goodbye, blowing kisses at her through the phone before running off, leaving her alone with an all-too-pleased Billy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You did good,” he says dryly with a smirk that is pure Agatha Harkness.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha bites back a groan. “Thanks for the validation, Mom.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy just laughs. “I’ve been texting mama all weekend,” he says instead of taking the bait. “She sounds nervous but happy. How are you—?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re not my therapist—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You don’t go to therapy,” Billy counters, grinning in that way very few people dare. God, motherhood has ruined her reputation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I feel very sane,” she says with a shrug.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy bursts out laughing. Agatha just stares at him blankly, waiting for him to calm down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s very offensive coming from someone living under my roof.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy rolls his eyes. “Tell Mama we’re proud of her and that we miss her.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You tell her,” she counters.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      After a few more minutes of bickering, they end the call when there’s a knock at the door.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The makeup artist—one of Hela’s people, usually responsible for Rio or Alice’s heavier makeup—lets out a sigh of relief when Agatha gives her specific directions.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      While the woman sets up, Agatha changes into a nicer shirt for the interview. She stops in front of the mirror to adjust it when her eyes fall on the bruises on her neck. Damn my pale, easily marked skin, she thinks to herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Cover this too, while you’re at it,” she says nonchalantly as she sits down. The woman, fiddling with her brushes, chokes on a laugh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I can do that,” she says, quickly schooling her features into something more professional. She is doing Agatha Harkness’ makeup, after all.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I had to do this for your wife too, earlier today,” the woman adds casually.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha doesn’t even acknowledge it. But she does make a mental note to ask Rio how that went down later.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Soon enough, she’s ready and seated in front of her laptop, talking with Sharon and a producer from the show Jen is appearing on.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Not five minutes later, the host introduces her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha!” The woman beams as the audience cheers loudly. “So glad you could take a moment from what I’m sure is a very busy weekend to talk to us—and to support Jen, of course.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Jen’s there?” Agatha jokes, grinning triumphantly when Jen just laughs, playing along for the cameras.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, Agatha,” her bandmate greets with a small, possibly fake smile. “How’s your gremlin wife?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smirks. “Oh, y’know, keeping busy. We’re in New York—she’s doing soundcheck for her late-night show appearance tonight.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Her first one ever,” the host says with a wide smile. “You must be proud.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I did come all the way here to be with her,” Agatha replies, going for a respectable smile—one that won’t have her reputation crumbling like Rio’s does every time she’s caught on camera.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Thankfully, the conversation moves on when Lilia is introduced. After a quick round of catching up, Jen finally launches into her sales pitch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A feminist podcast.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jen’s a feminist now?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Okay, maybe that was too harsh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nods along, keeping her thoughts to herself, saying the right things at the right times—like she was trained for this. Because she was.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Twenty minutes into Jen's monologue, the hotel room door opens, and Rio steps in.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha’s eyes are immediately drawn to her as she drops her bag and the flannel on the table by the door, kicking off her shoes. Rio’s gaze finds hers, and she smiles tiredly, moving around the room until she finally drops herself onto the couch across from her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That’s the moment Agatha's gone for the world.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stretches lazily, arms flexing over her head. Her shirt rides up, revealing just a hint of abs—abs Agatha knows like they’re her own (and, in a way, they are
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       hers
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ). And now, God, all she can think about is ditching this interview.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It takes her a moment to realize the host has said her name—probably not for the first time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Fuck.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha clears her throat, forcing a smile. “Yeah…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Because what the fuck are they even talking about right now?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio must sense the panic in her voice because her head shoots up, and she grins when she catches Agatha’s gaze. Agatha immediately looks away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I was asking,” the host continues, “since we were talking about Jen’s podcast Womanly and how it’s going to be a space for women in the industry to speak out on important issues. You’ve had some run-ins with the press—when those photos came out—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Nice, very subtle exposition,
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Agatha thinks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Also, Womanly is a dumb name for a podcast. Jen probably didn’t even come up with it herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But now is not the time.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah, it’s been, thankfully, a few calm months for my family—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The only chaos you want is the one you create yourself,” Lilia interjects with a laugh. “With your thirst traps.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckles, grateful for the interruption, but she keeps that to herself. “Chaos of my own making is my specialty. It’s also about agency—I post stuff because I want to.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She looks up and finds Rio already watching her with interest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It was tough,” Agatha admits—not just to the world, but to Rio. “I could keep my head down because I had no commitments, having just gotten off tour, but everyone else involved…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio. Lady Death. One and the same.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio stands up, as if sensing her discomfort.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       What is she going to do?
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Seeing my wife and producer be harassed by the press was not fun,” Agatha says, the words easily slipping through her lips—because they are true.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And then Rio is standing next to her, a hand on her shoulder, head just out of frame.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha locks eyes with her, and she can see it—the way this has been weighing on her too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is that Lady Death herself?” the host asks with a light laugh, clearly trying to cut the tension after Agatha’s unexpectedly candid confession. “Does she want to weigh in?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio’s fingers briefly caress her jaw before she reaches for one of Agatha’s earphones and slips it off. Agatha focuses really hard on keeping her breathing even.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hi,” she says, voice calm. “Lady Death here. Just came to drop off my beautiful wife’s coffee.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She slides a cup toward Agatha, who picks it up without thinking.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Thank you,” Agatha mumbles, lips wrapping around the rim—
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       fucking decaf.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio smiles gently. She looks like she wants to say more.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’ll leave you ladies to your conversation, then,” she says with a teasing smirk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Where did her nerves go?
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      Agatha wonders briefly, but Rio simply passes the earphone back and slides a chair over to sit at the side of the desk—just off-camera.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then she takes Agatha’s hand, where no one can see.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha is so
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       fucked.
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her bandmates will never let her live this down.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She has no proof, but she knows she didn’t look respectable, getting gently manhandled by her wife and served coffee like some spoiled popstar.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Which is not entirely a lie.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But with Rio’s presence grounding her, she relaxes back into the conversation—somehow even agreeing to appear on an episode of Jen’s podcast.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

      Agatha wears a white suit to the show, carefully chosen to mess with Rio. She checks herself in the mirror while the same woman from before does her make up and smirks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If she thought she was fucked before, she's about to fuck over Rio real well.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sweet payback. Or something.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So she decides to ditch the shirt she had originally planned to wear underneath at the last minute.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That'll just be enough to have her lovely wife tripping over herself again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The drive to the studio is quiet, it's just her and one Hela's many faceless assistants.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha entertains herself by checking social media. She's been hoping the infamous internet sleuths would've put two and two together with her walking hand in hand with Rio out in the open, and then wearing her shirt the next day. But no such luck so far.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That only means she'll have to try harder.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Honestly she should've been posting left and right this weekend. It was the optimal time for
     </span>

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha keeps scrolling through social media, ignoring all attempts by backup Hela to engage in conversation, and that's how she finds the posts from the show's official account.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       Oh

      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha looks away from her screen, convinced the assistant can see the thoughts running through her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Because damn, Rio looks hot in the black-and-white behind-the-scenes photos—drumming to her heart’s content, flannel wrapped around her waist. Agatha stops at a picture that seems to be a fan favorite.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio, sitting behind the drums, smiling widely at whatever Alice is saying, the stupid water bottle with

     <em>

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She reposts it before she can think about it any harder.

      The car stops, and she puts her phone down, stepping into a frenzy of cameras and reporters shouting for comments. Agatha just offers a smug smile and keeps walking. She’s here for her wife—nothing more.

      She doesn’t get to see Rio until two minutes before she goes on stage, and Alice laughs when the two of them stop in their tracks, openly drinking each other in.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wants to touch. She wants to run her hands over Rio’s dark green top take in the intricate design of roots and branches that stretch across her back and chest.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “This is new,” she mutters, running her hands over Rio's shoulders down to her bare arms.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alice thought we needed something new for tonight,” Rio explains distractedly, eyes hungrily tracing the expanse of Agatha’s exposed skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Her eyes are higher, my friend,” Alice jokes and when Agatha glares at her she scurries away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You look hot, baby,” Agatha murmurs, keeping her voice low so she doesn’t whimper instead.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You look

     <em>

      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ,” Rio laughs—nervous, but for an entirely different reason. “Wanna get out of here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shakes her head. “Exactly one second after you’re done blowing all these people’s minds on stage, my love,” she promises.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nods, but when she looks back at Agatha, she’s grinning. “I'm gonna hold you to that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smirks, uses her hands on Rio’s arms to turn her toward the stage, and swats her ass. “Go get ’em, tiger.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She hears Rio’s laugh just before the host introduces the band. Agatha hangs back, eyes trained on her wife as she steps onto the stage with Alice, greeting the woman waiting for them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Lady Death, Knight of Wands,” the host beams, “it is my honour to take your late night virginity tonight.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The audience loses it—like they were waiting for the joke. Alice and Rio share a look before cracking up too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Now, you're gonna play one song, and I was disappointed to hear it won't be The Ballad of the Witches Road,” the woman says, clearly leading them into something. “Lady Death, can I ask you a question?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio nods, running a hand through her hair in what Agatha knows is a nervous gesture.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yknow, Rio Vidal wrote The Ballad,” the host says casually, letting the words hang. She’s trying to catch her slipping.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chuckles, shaking her head just a little. Agatha can see the moment it registers for her—that she wasn’t overthinking things before. Maybe she was thinking just the right amount.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It’s also the moment she slips fully into Lady Death.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Standing a little straighter, Rio glances at the audience, then turns to the host with a smirk.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Didn’t hear a question there,” she quips smoothly. “Now, let’s get this show started!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckles and settles into her seat to enjoy the performance.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And if Rio moves with a little more swagger when she catches Agatha’s eyes and winks, it definitely doesn’t do anything to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Not at all.

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio presses Agatha firmly against the elevator wall, and Agatha moans. The sound reverberates off the walls, making them both pause—then burst into laughter.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you think there are cameras in here?” Rio asks, playful despite the fact that she still hasn’t let go.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha doesn’t bother checking. “Probably. Wanna text Hela to be on the lookout for footage of us making out in a hotel elevator?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shakes her head. “Let’s just go before we have to find out.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha doesn’t say that it’s probably already too late, because Rio steps back and offers her hand just as the doors slide open.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Under the yellow hallway lights, Agatha notices the gray smudges on her white suit jacket. The sight makes her laugh, and Rio looks at her curiously before following her gaze to the ruined fabric.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh,” Rio says, more amused than concerned. “Well, between the elevator footage and whatever story the dry cleaners come up with, we may have another scandal on our hands.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha ignores the teasing and pushes open their hotel room door. She’s about to kick off her shoes when Rio catches her wrist.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can I— I want a photo,” Rio says, tugging her closer. “You look hot.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You look hot,” Agatha counters, willingly letting Rio guide her toward the mirror.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We look hot,” Rio finishes, standing behind her and wrapping her arms around her waist. “You were really good to me today.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha presses herself back, fitting snugly against Rio’s front. “It wasn’t completely selfless.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That gets a snort out of Rio. “You had ulterior motives?
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       Shocking revelation.”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Shut up,” Agatha mutters, playfully nipping at Rio’s jaw despite the odd angle. “Give me your phone.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio hands it over without hesitation. The moment her hand is free again, she slips it under Agatha’s jacket, warm fingers teasing the waistband of her trousers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha bites back a gasp, grabbing Rio’s wrist to still her movements. She stares into the camera, looking smug, and snaps the photo.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Here you go,” she says, turning to hand the phone back. Then she steps away, smiling wickedly. “Now, I’m going to take a bath. You should remove your makeup. Maybe you can join me after. If you want.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And with that, she turns and walks away.

    <p>
     The early morning is always her least favorite part of any day, but on this Monday morning Agatha makes an exception.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It starts with Rio’s alarm. Her wife doesn’t really need it, she's been waking up naturally at the crack of dawn for as long as Agatha has woken by her side. She’s actually already awake by the time the godawful sound rips Agatha from sleep. Rio is laying on her back, watching her sleep like an absolute fucking fool, and Agatha rolls over and swats her arms away.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate you,” she whispers, aggressively hiding her face in the crook of Rio’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s arms wrap around her, and she places a soft kiss on her shoulder. “Mi amor,” she murmurs, “Mi cielo.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groans, already feeling her anger slowly dissipate. “Don't do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mi vida,” Rio keeps going, this time Agatha can feel her smile as she goes to place another kiss on her shoulder. “Mi…corazon.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you actually have a point?” Agatha asks, moving between Rio’s arms so they’re face to face. “Mi amor.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, she spanishes me,” Rio says, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Answer the question,” she mutters, shoving a finger on Rio’s sternum.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio makes a show of her pain, like Agatha viciously attacked her, and Agatha just stares at her waiting for it to be over with.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You wound me, my love. As for your question, I do, this is my attempt at buttering you up so you're not grumpy when the kids wake up,” Rio explains with a cheeky smile.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighs, “Well you're failing. What time is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Doesn’t matter,” Rio wiggles her eyebrows at her, and uses her arms around Agatha to press her against the bed, laying on top of her and pressing a kiss to her jaw. “We have time.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” Agatha says, “If it's like five am i swear to god–”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s laughter takes her by surprise, she holds onto Agatha’s shoulders as she tries to calm down. Agatha sighs, arms loosely wrapped around Rio’s waist and stares at her wife laughing to herself with equal parts exasperation and fondness.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is not five am,” Rio promises, slowly making her way down Agatha's body. She stops over her stomach and places a kiss there, over her belly button.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” Agatha says, her voice coming out breathy.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hush, it's daddy-daughter time, Agatha,” Rio says, throwing a quick grin at her. When she speaks again, it's directed at Agatha's stomach. “Good morning, Agatha Junior. Be nice to your mom today, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're not calling the baby Agatha Junior,” Agatha says, placing a hand on Rio's shoulder pushing her away. “You're a fool.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio doesn't answer, but she does move away so she's back laying next to her. Agatha counts to ten in her head before grabbing Rio's arm and tugging her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They stay like that until Rio's second alarm rings. Agatha isn't sure how much time passes in-between, just that Rio only complains a little when Agatha presses her back against her chest, effectively making her the little spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha has to remind herself to take a photo like this sometime to use as blackmail material, but she can't be bothered right now.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn't say it outloud, but she's not as grumpy to be awake early for the kids first day of school. If only she could have coffee, but instead she has to survive by holding her wife close. Such sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you think about it,” Rio says, voice soft and she tilts her head a little to lock her gaze. “Laying like this, we're kinda holding the baby between us.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha can't help the smile that draws on her lips at that idea. “You're a sap…I love you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She sits at the table by the window; the early morning sun offers little comfort. The laptop sits open, but Agatha's eyes are locked on what's happening in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicholas is obediently sitting on his stool, watching Rio work, giggling when she sneakily steals from his lunchbox, and immediately turning to Agatha for help.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mommy!” he exclaims, kicking his feet up. “Mama steals my food.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabs him by the shoulders before Agatha can intervene. “No playing in the chair, Nicky. You're gonna get hurt, and then Mommy will be sad.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nods dutifully, and Nicky looks between the two of them with an adorable little pout. “Sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're good. Now pick a snack and we're done,” Rio instructs, showing Nicholas the preselected options.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky giggles, pointing at something not in Rio's selection.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighs dramatically and catches Agatha's eyes. “Agatha, my love, can you explain to Mr. Nicholas over here that he can't have chocolate as a snack?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha purses her lips, sliding her glasses up and observing the pair of them like a judge about to make a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you getting chocolate as a snack?” Agatha asks, directing the question to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her wife shakes her head and throws her hands up dramatically, making Nicholas laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine, no one gets chocolate snacks,” Rio declares.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy enters the kitchen then, curls pointing in every direction, tie crooked, and shoelace untied. “I'm no one. Can I have chocolate?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, someone's done their summer reading,” Rio says, sounding proud. “I would give you chocolate, but you're looking a little disheveled. A little… Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She laughs, searching Agatha's gaze. “This one is all yours, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, and when Billy sits next to her, she fixes his tie and pats his hair into place. “The untied shoelaces are very reminiscent of your college days,” she counters, giving both her son and wife a stern look. “I will buy both of you Velcro shoes if you don't straighten up.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and Billy share a look and burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Literally too gay for that,” Billy says once he’s calmed down.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right there with you, son,” Rio says, shooting Agatha a grin. “I identify as agathasexual.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy groans, dropping his head in his hands. “Never say that again. Especially in public.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I prefer letting the photos tell the story, anyway,” Rio mutters, helping Nicky down from the stool. “Go get dressed so I can braid your hair.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky nods and runs to change into his uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “One, he's way too excited about school,” Billy says, moving behind Rio to attempt coffee for breakfast. “Second, the ‘photos’ you post are called thirst traps, and I hate it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gets a good laugh out of his expression of disappointment when Rio doesn’t stop him. Little does he know that’s Agatha’s coffee. Fucking decaf for the win.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can’t help I’m hot, William. And your mom’s a ten—look at her,” Rio says with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirks. She does love a compliment, and Rio looks at her with a glint in her eyes like she knows it too and did it all just for her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Want sugar with that?” Rio asks Billy as he passes by, holding one of the biggest mugs they own, filled with coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy takes the offered sugar suspiciously but doesn't comment, like he's afraid saying the wrong thing will keep him from his coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Listen, now that school is back, please don’t post anymore,” he says, looking between the two of them, but they both avoid his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, from her spot by the window, cracks up.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She takes a sip of her terrible coffee her wife lovingly made for her to calm down. “I don’t think she can help it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shakes her pointer finger at her, like she wants to say something but won't. Her stern expression makes Agatha laugh anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I get lunch?” Billy asks, giving Nicky’s lunchbox an appreciative look.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stares at the countertop, where the mess from Nicky's lunchbox adventure still awaits cleanup. She taps her chin thoughtfully. “I think I can whip something up.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks, Mama.” Billy slides into the spot next to Agatha again and grins. “Mom, can I have money for lunch?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snorts, continuing to make lunch for him. “Harkness through and through, I’m telling you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy rolls his eyes at the two of them. “Stop passing me around like a hot potato.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha and Rio share a look over his head and decide telepathically that they won’t.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha thinks back to when he was a little kid—his soft curls and the way he always sought her out, his little hand sliding into hers no matter if they were in the store or sitting on the couch watching TV.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     How he would follow Rio around and insist on sitting on her lap while she played the drums, content with just being next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not so much that they pass him around like a hot potato—they just like to point out to each other all the ways in which he’s theirs. Because he is, and they made a promise before Nicky was born that they were never going to make him feel different for being adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We just love you, teen,” Rio says, like she’s reading Agatha’s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy turns to her. Agatha just nods, confirming Rio’s words.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha has never been good at saying those words. She can thank her mother for that. But her family makes her especially soft in a way that still feels uncomfortable in a corner of her heart she’s not sure she can turn off anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio, with her stupid patience and her stupider heart, got her thinking she could be all these things she never thought possible. Her wife has a wonderfully terrible way of getting her way, and Agatha’s not sure she even knows that.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve been thinking about college,” Billy says then, and Agatha groans. She catches Rio’s excited grin and rolls her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. Nope.” She shuts down the conversation entirely. “You’re a kid, and it’s too early in the morning for this. Eat your breakfast, drink your decaf, and go to school.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolls her eyes from the counter as she finishes packing Billy’s lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why am I drinking decaf?” Billy asks after a beat. He looks between the two of them but eventually settles his eyes on Agatha. “Mom, you hate decaf. I remember because when—”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh-oh,” Rio sing-songs from the back, completely unhelpful.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy stares at Agatha so hard she thinks she may get a migraine, but she refuses to look at him. So he turns to Rio instead.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t look at me, I’m not drinking decaf,” Rio says with a laugh, and Agatha has to resist the urge to throw something at her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you—” he looks between the two of them, “pregnant?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio actually bursts out laughing at that, and Billy’s face turns crimson red.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate you guys,” he mutters under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, no,” Rio takes a moment to sober up. “That’s not allowed. I don’t like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicholas runs back into the room then, his polo inside out and holding his shoes in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gives Rio a pointed look. “That one’s yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When she catches Billy’s gaze, she softens, pulling her glasses down. “When we tell Nicky, you act like your life depends on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy grins, eyes falling to Agatha’s stomach, and he nods.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As far as weeks go, Agatha considers this one to be quite alright once Monday rolls around.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With the boys back in school, Agatha can drag Rio to bed as soon as her wife walks through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And they’re shooting a music video for their song.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Shooting starts after lunch—per Agatha’s request and to Hela’s dismay. But, sadly for Hela, Agatha’s mornings are already booked full of Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hela knows to pick her battles, though, and she wins them very carefully. As soon as she caught wind of a new song, she quickly bought into Alice’s music video agenda and got to work.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha has always been bad at compromise, but when the deal offered was absolute creative freedom for the video in exchange for Hela handling the release date, she was game. Rio, for her part, didn’t seem to care as much about the video as she does about the music itself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     So Agatha goes in with a vision for the video, partially inspired by Alice—but mostly driven by a desire to see her wife in leather and dark, moody makeup. She writes in a nude scene just for her too and doesn’t tell Rio a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her wife's busy anyways, she seems to get more work once the song is recorded.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They record it over two nights in their home studio, with Alice manning the board and Jen pouring wine with a little too much flair—because she, too, has guessed that Agatha is pregnant but is refusing to say it out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Want a drink, Agatha?” Jen says with a knowing little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha thinks she could get away with claiming self-defense—it is her house, after all. But Rio intervenes, taking the wine bottle from Jen and dunking it into the trash.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That was some expensive wine,” Jen says, looking dejectedly at what’s left in her glass. “I expect reparations. Jennifer is a good name for a girl…”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Rio know better than to get involved in one of those quarrels. The two members of The Court move aside to go over recording details like the nerds they are.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe it’ll be a boy,” Agatha says matter-of-factly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen snorts, like she doesn't have survival instincts (and she probably doesn’t, at least where Agatha is concerned). “It won’t be if your wife has any say on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifts her head, looks between the two of them, and then looks away again. Agatha rolls her eyes at her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “For what it’s worth, I put fifty dollars on it being a girl,” Alice cuts in with a little shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turns her glare on her then, but Alice is completely unbothered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate all of you,” Agatha mutters, turning back toward the recording booth.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not me though, right?” Rio whispers, taking her hand to slow her pace. “I think you like me, my love.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swats her hand away, but regrets it a second later and kisses Rio’s cheek as they take their seats. “I do like you, hon.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you’re done being disgusting,” comes Jen’s voice through the intercom, “we can pick up where we left off.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flips her off through the glass and turns to Rio. “I don’t know why Alice invited her.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We had plans, Agatha,” Jen replies through the intercom. “You should be more thankful.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You should be more quiet,” Agatha counters with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen doesn’t immediately answer, and Agatha—stupidly—lets herself fall into a false sense of security.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And since you owe me,” Jen finally says, and Agatha groans, “you can confirm your news when you come on my podcast. Which you promised you would—on live TV.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stares at a single point through the glass and hopes Jen knows the glare is just for her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck off, Kale. If I go to your show, it’ll be to mock you relentlessly.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I go?” Rio asks, and Agatha turns to her traitorous wife.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? It sounds fun,” is Rio’s entire defense.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, Daddy Death, you can come,” Jen says, and Agatha swears she can hear the smirk in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It can be an OG Sisters of the Craft reunion for all I care,” Alice says. “But let’s get this fucking show on the road—please and thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio isn’t scheduled to shoot until the final day of filming. Agatha has a hard time even getting her to agree to be in the video, because Rio is hellbent on obsessing over every little detail of post-production.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When the day arrives, Agatha waits patiently outside Rio's trailer.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Well maybe not patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, sweetheart,” she says sweetly as she knocks not-so-sweetly on the door. “I want to see you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It takes at least two long minutes before Rio finally opens the door and steps outside. She leans casually against the trailer, smirking like she knows Agatha absolutely played herself with this get up, and Agatha takes a couple steps back to fully take in her wife clad in leather trousers, and a black cloak over a black shirt with very nicely placed cut-offs.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like what you see?” Rio teases, tone playful.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nods dumbly. “Maybe.” She clears her throat, and closes the distance, dragging her hands over Rio's sides, over the cutoffs of her shirt. “You look too good. No one else should see you like this.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckles, a little breathlessly. “Should I go back inside?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Agatha says, letting her eyes linger in her wife's face, on her lips. “This was a terrible idea, I don't want to share you, actually.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     That gets a soft laugh out of her wife. Rio looks at her like she thinks Agatha has lost her mind, but she doesn't mind it one bit.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have to go to makeup.” Rio's arms find Agatha's waist  pulling her closer to kiss her sweetly instead of going to makeup, and bring their lips together, smiling against Agatha's lips. It lasts only a moment, before Rio breaks away, bumping their forehead together.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulls her back in. “Yeah, totally–”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A loud cough breaks them apart.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hides her face in Rio's neck, not out of shame, because she has none of that, simply to extend this moment a little more.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes?” She asks nonchalantly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lets out a giggle that ruins both the moment and the outfit Agatha picked for her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you two have places to be?” Hela asks, sounding bored.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha repeats her words back to her mockingly, but when Rio puts a hand on her shoulder she steps back.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright then, see you when it's show time, hot stuff,” she tells Rio, letting her eyes stare appreciatively one last time.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stands on her mark, playing with the belt of the floral robe she's wearing. The set is quiet, and she’s bored of waiting for her wife to arrive. It feels like their wedding all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio walks in, running a nervous hand through her hair, Agatha has to fake a cough to hide her gasp. It draws Rio's attention straight to her—and to the robe that's not a prop, but Agatha's own.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Baby,” Rio says the pet name like she's both loving it and hating it, as she cuts the distance between them. “What is this? Where are the rest of your clothes?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckles, her arms falling onto Rio's wrists when they come to rest on her shoulders. “This is the most clothes I’ve worn on set, actually.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her wife doesn’t seem all that surprised by the reveal; she rolls her eyes fondly and adjusts the collar of the robe a little higher. “You're a tease.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The director clears his throat from behind the camera, and Agatha thinks it wise to ignore him for a moment longer. “Kiss me,” she whispers conspiratorially.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks over her shoulder at the twenty-something crew members who suddenly seem very interested in the set décor.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I made them all sign very thorough NDAs,” Agatha adds, looking smug.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You do love an NDA,” Rio says with a laugh, giving her a quick kiss before stepping back.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watches Rio speak with the director and an assistant, going over the scene. God, she’s such a professional. Agatha stays where she is, leaning against the wall next to the fake fireplace, staring intently at her wife in those ridiculous leather pants. Rio catches her looking and winks.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s go, people! Come on!” Agatha claps her hands together, turning to the crew and ignoring her smirking wife.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Thankfully, they get to work after that. They go over the fight scene—Rio has a lot of questions and wants to make sure Agatha won’t be getting injured, which is how she ends up on her back with Agatha straddling her legs and grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you feeling?” Agatha asks her when the director calls the end of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio taps her thigh, asking to be released, and Agatha chuckles, standing up and offering a hand to help her up.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Awkward,” Rio mutters, running a hand through her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirks, dragging her by the hand to the other end of the room for the next scene. An assistant gives Rio a prop knife.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh.” Rio grins, playing with the knife like a seasoned pro. “Okay, this one is better.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now all you have to do is stab me,” Agatha says, grabbing Rio’s wrist and guiding the knife so it rests over her clavicle.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes follow the movement. When she looks up and catches Agatha’s gaze, Agatha inhales sharply. Her wife’s eyes darken just a beat, and she smirks, pressing the knife down.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cut.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Double fuck.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey–” Agatha says, tirade at the ready.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio drops her hand and wraps an arm around Agatha, gently pushing her away from the wall. They sit side by side on the couch, catching their breaths. At some point, the assistant comes back for the prop knife, and Rio chuckles when Agatha follows the retreating woman with a disappointed frown.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can we go home now?” Rio asks, bumping their shoulders together.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighs. She wishes. “Just one final scene, and then we’re done.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re so not done, baby,” Rio says—like a promise she fully intends to keep.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ***
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stands in front of the door, bouncing on her heels, excited. She catches Agatha’s eye and grins—all swagger. The crew around them looks relaxed, ready to go home. This is the last scene; it’s literally just Rio’s character kicking the door open to come fight Agatha’s character.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha purposefully left it for last so she could get one good look at Rio in those sinful leather pants while lounging in a chair behind the scenes. She’s a genius.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You got this, hot stuff,” she yells as Rio prepares to start the scene. A few crew members laugh when Rio puts her leg down with a little huff.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you, babe,” Rio mutters.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     God, Agatha loves her. She doesn’t even need to see her face to know she’s blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Action,” the director calls.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio slams her foot into the door. It flies open with a satisfying crack.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cups her hands and calls out, “You call that a kick?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s head pops up, grinning. “Really, my love?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugs. “I’m just saying. I think Nicky could kick harder.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her wife grins, stands a little straighter, and signals the director. “One more take?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The man shakes his head with a laugh and nods.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, everyone, let’s do one more shot.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the door is reset, Rio rolls her shoulders back and stares at it for a beat too long. It makes Agatha laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Rio rears back, going for a more dramatic kick. The moment her foot lands, it sounds wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha immediately knows something isn’t right. She thinks she hears Rio’s leg pop—and then her wife crumples to the floor, cradling her leg.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shit,” Rio says, her voice tight with pain. “Shit… shit… shit… Agatha…”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha is on her feet in an instant, rushing to Rio’s side. She thinks she elbows a production assistant to get there.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When she sees her wife, she drops to her knees beside her, cursing inwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s okay, sweetheart. I got you,” she promises, holding Rio to her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Someone calls for a medic, and Rio trembles in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wonder briefly where the fuck have they gone to get a medic. She's about to start yelling when she feels her wife shift.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio winces as she grips Agatha’s shirt, her voice dry. “Okay… maybe Nicky can kick harder.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffs a laugh, heart breaking and loving her all at once. “I told you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You still think I'm cool, right?” Rio asks through a shaky breath and Agatha had to resist the urge to shake her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, baby, you're the coolest person I've ever seen kick a door wrong,” she says dryly, and sweetens it by kissing her cheek. “Now shut up.”

     <span>
      Rio is scheduled for knee surgery three days after the accident.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha is on edge the entire time. No one’s sleeping well—Rio’s in pain, and the boys are worried.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy keeps giving her looks she works hard to ignore. But he corners her in the kitchen when she goes to grab an ice pack for Rio, and Agatha has never been good at resisting the power of his sad brown eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?” she asks, hating how much her voice gives her away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You're stressed,” he says, frowning and stepping closer.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha stiffens for a moment when he hugs her. He’s taller than her now—an affront she’s still not ready to let go of.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I read in a book that stress can be bad for the baby.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The comment catches her off guard, and she lets out a laugh that’s half-sob.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re reading parenting books now?” she asks, giving him a gentle shove and catching his eye.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I borrowed it from Mama’s study,” he explains with a small shy smile. “When are you guys telling Nicky?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Truthfully, she doesn’t know. She and Rio have barely spoken about anything other than pain management and the surgery. Rio’s tried to have other conversation—there’s still a move happening in a month, and now that Rio’s out of commission and Agatha is pregnant, there’s a lot they can’t do. (Or rather, that Rio won’t let Agatha do.)
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t know,” she admits. “Probably sometime after the surgery. Stop worrying.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Stop stressing,” he calls after her as she turns to leave.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do your homework, then, teen,” she fires back, leaving the kitchen. “And don't go snooping in my books next.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She finds Rio on the couch where she left her, Nicholas curled up at her side, the two of them watching a movie with talking dinosaurs on the TV.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They’re speaking in hushed voices, and when Rio catches Agatha’s gaze, she smiles. Agatha can tell she’s in pain—there’s a sheen of sweat on her brow, and her body’s been tense since the accident. But she’s smiling at Nicky, nodding encouragingly as he chatters away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It’s easy to imagine, then—Rio holding their baby in the middle of their chaotic life. That’s what she does: she makes Agatha’s messy world hold still. She did it with Nicky when he was born and Agatha was beyond exhausted. She’d wake up every few hours in the hospital and always find Rio there, holding him, feeding him, talking to him. Always smiling, always staring at him like he was magic. He always wore some ridiculous new outfit that would’ve made Agatha laugh if she weren’t in so much pain.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What are we watching?” she asks, gently placing the ice pack on Rio’s leg. She slides behind her, and Rio lets her head rest in Agatha’s lap with a contented sigh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Mom!” Billy says in his most appalled teen voice. It gets immediately more ridiculous when he passes around a plate of cookies he made himself. “It's
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       The Land Before Time
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It's the fifth one,” Nicky adds with a grin that's all Rio. He sits up excitedly, gesturing with his chocolate smeared hands. “The lead gobblers ate all the plants in the great valley!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nods like this is crucial, world-shaking information, and grabs a napkin from the table next to the couch, then one his hands to clean it. “The fifth one, huh?” she asks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Of fourteen,” Rio supplies with a laugh. She holds the wiggling boy steady for Agatha, tugging Nicky’s hair out of his eyes. He’d wanted Rio to braid it, but she hasn’t gotten around to it yet. He looks a little disheveled. Maybe more adorable for it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha hands him a cookie when she's done.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That's a lot of movies. Think you'll make it to the fifth one today?” She asks, smiling gently at him, encouraging.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nicky stands on the couch excitedly. “Yes!” He exclaims, and promptly loses his balance.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha catches him before things get worse, but there’s no mistaking the pained groan Rio lets out from the sudden jolt.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She sets Nicky on the floor. “Go sit with your brother.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Billy scoots over, grabbing the abandoned bowl of popcorn to lure his little brother over. It works.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You okay?” Agatha asks, running a hand through Rio’s hair.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio gives a tight-lipped smile. “Yup. Never been better.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re a shit liar,” Agatha says, though the affection in her voice softens the words.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay, maybe I’ve been better,” Rio admits quietly. “I do think a kiss would greatly improve my situation.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckles, rolling her eyes fondly. She kisses Rio’s brow. Rio squirms, but Agatha holds her still, planting a second kiss on her nose that makes her giggle.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha glances at the boys—still absorbed in the movie, talking between mouthfuls of popcorn—then turns her attention back to Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Finally, she kisses her wife, soft and tentative, almost like she’s afraid it might hurt. But Rio sighs into it, her body melting into the couch like this—Agatha’s touch—was what she needed all along. And Agatha, never one to turn down an ego boost, deepens the kiss, despite the awkward angle.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She forces herself to slow down, breaking the kiss even as Rio chases after her lips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rests a hand on her shoulder and smirks. “Easy, lovergirl. You’re hurt.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio snorts, then pouts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So, naturally, Agatha kisses her again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha shouldn't be surprised when Hela shows up in the hospital a few hours after surgery. Actually, Agatha thinks she may have been outside the whole time, making mental maths on the right time to strike.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So,” Hela takes a seat at the end of the hospital bed, ignoring Agatha’s glare. “We need a new strategy.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio groans tiredly, kicking Hela with her good leg. “Fuck off.” She whispers it harshly, like it would pain her to be louder but she still wants Hela to know she means business.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smiles, biting her tongue—for now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Lovely,” Hela says, grabbing Rio’s ankle. “I’m serious, dumbass. People already think you’re Lady Death. Now Rio Vidal’s gonna be hopping around on crutches after Lady Death injures her leg? How long is recovery gonna be?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugs. Hela looks between the two of them, hoping one of them will throw her a bone.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “People aren’t dumb, Rio,” she adds when neither speaks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not saying they are,” Rio replies, her voice bone tired. “I’m saying they’re not entitled to my identity just because they are right.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just give us some time to think about it,” Agatha says, shooting Hela a look. “This is hardly the time.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The manager nods, unconvinced but willing to let it go for now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Once Hela leaves, off to find Rio's doctor and go over the recovery timeline, Rio lets out a sigh and turns onto her side, facing the window.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rans a hand over her back but keeps quiet. She’s never quite sure what goes on in Rio’s mind, and Rio usually has no trouble letting her know—either with words or with actions. But there are moments like this, when Rio doesn’t want to let her in, and Agatha can either wait it out or kick the door down. Rio has kindly left the choice to her discretion.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The topic of fame has come between them before. Agatha grew up with it; Rio saw it first through the toll it took on her. It never sat well with Rio—and that’s ultimately why she chose to stay behind the scenes, writing and producing for others.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha knows because they talked about it at length—how, after graduating from Yale, Rio nearly joined a jazz band that later got signed and did as well as jazz bands can. And then, during her two years at Juilliard, they spent countless late nights talking about the future. First under the splatter-painted ceiling of Rio’s studio apartment, and later in the house Agatha bullied her into letting her buy. Music always came up. Fame never did.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There’ve been countless bands and projects that tried to get a piece of her. Rio may be reclusive and hard to reach, but when artists manage to work with her, they always want more—and always get a polite ‘no, thank you’ that makes Agatha want to kiss her wife in the mouth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So Agatha knows Rio’s not after fame. Not even a little bit. But Rio did marry a star. She had children with a star. She became one in her own right—even if she wears a face full of makeup to do it, and started out playing to hundred-something crowds on the punk rock scene during weekends and showing up on Mondays in a slick suit to produce Sisters of the Craft’s next award-winning album.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And now here they are. In limbo.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Because it’s become painfully clear over the last few months that people care far more about Lady Death’s identity than either of them anticipated. And the closer fans look, the clearer the picture becomes. Because they never really went out of their way to hide it. There are countless photos of them together—dinners and coffee runs, basketball games Agatha was dragged to, courtside seats where Rio whispered play-by-plays into her ear. They may not be making out in them, but Agatha has heard enough about the way they look at each other to think it's realistically possible for fans to figure out Rio is Lady Death.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I hate it,” Rio mutters, pulling Agatha out of her spiral.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She looks up and sees tears in her wife’s eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey, no,” Agatha says, carefully climbing into the bed beside her, mindful of the injury, and wrapping her arms around her. “You’re just high on painkillers, babe.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She feels Rio laugh against her, her face still buried in the pillow. It’s a start.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “My love, I’m serious—we don’t have to say shit. I’ll break Wanda’s leg if it keeps the fans off your back.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She laughs, imagining the look on Wanda’s face if she heard that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shifts, slowly rolling onto her back and relaxing in Agatha’s arms. “I love you. Don’t break Wanda’s leg.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why not? I’m sure I could come up with a reason she deserves it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But Rio shakes her head decisively. “I don’t want people saying she’s your wife again.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha chuckles dryly. “Well, I know you keep a stash of stickers in case that ever happens.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That gets a real laugh out of Rio. “Just say you liked it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t know if I’d go that far,” Agatha mutters, eyes locked on Rio’s smug smile—one that knows she’s lying through her teeth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “When can we go home?” Rio asks after a moment.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha leans in to kiss her. “We’re going to the beach house,” she reminds her, and when Rio groans—still not sold on that idea—Agatha takes her hand, threading their fingers together.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s just a few days, Rio,” she says, repeating the same line she’s used the past few days. “How many times did Nicky accidentally bump into your leg, or you tried to help Billy carry something because you forgot you’re hurt?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Who taunted me into kicking a door harder?” Rio counters.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha swallows. She’s thought about that, too. If this is somehow her fault, the guilt has been eating at her for days. Rio hadn’t said anything—until now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m sorry,” Agatha whispers, hiding her face on Rio’s shoulder. “I just want you to be okay.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio brings their joined hands to her lips and kisses Agatha’s knuckles. “No. I’m sorry, my love. I know you didn’t mean for any of this to happen. You know that, right?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She searches Agatha’s eyes, her warm fingers gently tilting her chin up. “This isn’t your fault, Agatha.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nods, not fully believing her just yet. “It’ll probably be a couple of hours before they release you,” she says, moving to sit up. “Want me to terrorize a nurse into letting you go sooner?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Stay with me,” Rio says, dropping her hand like she wants Agatha to be the one to choose.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She nods slowly, laying back down and pulling Rio closer, her wife’s head resting on her chest.
     </span>

     <span>
      The beach house is quiet when they arrive. It's late and the only sound it's the waves hitting the shore in the distance.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Hela had offered to drive them, but Agatha thought they had had enough with the manager for the day.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio grumbles with her crutches as they make their way inside. Despite Agatha's protests she carries her own bag inside, then promptly drops it by the couch and sits down with a tired exhale.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha closes the door and carries their bags to the downstairs bedroom the housekeepers arranged for them. When she returns to the living room area she sits on the couch next to Rio, examining her wife's profile.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Let's get to bed?” she asks tentatively. Rio has been unusually grumpy since they got out of the hospital.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugs, but doesn't move. Her fingers trace the edge of her leg brace and her shoulders fall.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I miss the boys,” she mutters.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I know.” Agatha says, mind racing for the right thing to say. “I know, baby. But you got your girls with you, right?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio follows Agatha's eyes down to her stomach, her eyes stay there for a few moments. “My Agathas,” she jokes, her words soft.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha would smack her for it if she wasn't injured, and it was maybe a little bit her fault.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Let's go to bed, then,” Rio says to Agatha's silence, repeating her own words back at her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rolling her eyes fondly, Agatha stands up and offers her hand to Rio. She helps her get ready for bed, and arrange her medicine in the nightstand on her side of the bed. Agatha tries to get her into her pajamas, but they only make it as far as getting rid of the shorts and the hoodie before Rio gives up and decides to sleep in her underwear and t-shirt.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When Agatha gets in the bed a few minutes later, she stares at her wife for a long moment taking her in.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, you'll get no complaints from me,” she says  greedily, letting her eyes run down her wife's body unabashedly.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio gives her a smile that doesn't quite reach her eyes, but Agatha decides not to comment on it and they go to sleep.
     </span>

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It becomes apparent very early on that Rio is not having a good time. Is not the first time she's injured herself, because Rio has never been one to sit still for too long for as long as Agatha has known her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There's a stillness to Rio on the first day that throws Agatha off so much she spends the first half of the day playing catch up. Agatha lets Rio to her own devices, hovering just out of sight making sure she's not accidentally walking into any more door frames, and offering her quiet support.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio spends the day in bed, with the doors thrown open to let the ocean air in, switching between staring at the ceiling and playing video games.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      By mid afternoon Agatha slips into the room, having just gotten off the phone with Hela for a completely unproductive call.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She sits on the bed, next to Rio and drops her hand on Rio's thigh over the leg brace.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I'm gonna take a bath,” she speaks softly, and Rio drops her head on her shoulder with a little sigh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Join me?” She asks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio takes a few moments to answer, nodding slowly against Agatha's shoulder.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The bath is warm when Agatha slips in, and she helps Rio slowly sit down between her legs. They are quiet for a while, Agatha washes Rio's hair, hands treading carefully through her hair, massaging her scalp, and Rio sighs, sagging in her embrace.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don't know if I can do it,” Rio says, almost a whisper.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha kisses her shoulder, tightens her hold around her waist as she thinks over what to say. It turns out she doesn't have to, because Rio keeps talking.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Being a star,” she explains. A dry chuckle falls off her lips, “You make it look so easy, like you were born for it. I'm not like that, Agatha.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nods slowly, encouraging her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don't think I could handle it without losing myself,” Rio whispers it like a confession, like this is a weight that's been holding her down for so long. Like she kept it locked in because….why? “and I have so much to lose, Agatha.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The final part hits her like a truck, and Agatha wants to wrap this woman in her arms so tight she becomes a part of her. “My love, you can never lose me. Or the boys. I–”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can you promise that?” Rio asks, voice full of doubt.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha doesn't even let her take a breath before she answers. “Yes! Yes, Rio. I promise you they will have to take you from my cold dead hands. Whatever fear you have, my love, I promise you, I got you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio exhales heavily, taking one of her hands under the water, treading their fingers together.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay.”

      It gets easier after that.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio decides to disregard trousers altogether, opting for boxer shorts and making Agatha lose her fucking mind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They eat pizza on the bed—which Agatha is usually against—but Rio is acting more like herself again, her smile a little lighter, and still not wearing trousers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Some reality show plays on the TV, and Rio rests her head on Agatha’s shoulder. She talks occasionally, making snide comments about whatever's happening on screen, but Agatha isn’t listening.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She is, understandably, distracted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Did you ever read the article?” she asks, cutting Rio off mid-rant.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What article?” Rio rolls with the sudden change in topic.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha smirks, grabbing her phone from the nightstand. “The Rolling Stone one. About you. Let me read you my favorite parts.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio chuckles and mutes the TV, turning to give Agatha her full attention.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And you should consider yourself lucky I’m not reading the comments,” Agatha mutters as she scrolls, pausing when she catches a look on Rio’s face.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t wanna know what the fans are saying yet,” Rio says slowly. “I never care what they say about me. I just want to show you off.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nods, considering that. “I am very show-offable.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You are. Now read,” Rio says, nudging the phone closer to her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I just need my glasses,” Agatha laughs, pulling Rio’s hand down and reaching for them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shifts on the bed, watching her closely.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?” Agatha sighs, already tired of the delay. Why is it taking so long to get to this article?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The day you got glasses was the happiest day of my life,” Rio says, with a serious tone and a stupid smile.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha groans. “We have children, Rio. I birthed one of them. Right out of my—”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m missing the correlation here, baby,” Rio cuts her off, one hand running over Agatha’s stomach.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha takes a deep, calming breath. Well, at least Rio clearly feels better.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What was your point, my love?” Rio asks again, smile soft and coaxing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That your choice for ‘best day of your life’ is… questionable,” Agatha mutters, turning her phone screen back on.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You look so hot, babe,” Rio insists, tracing her cheek with a cold finger. “Like a… a very sexy teacher.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snorts. “Fifteen years is a long time to hide your kinks from me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio just laughs and raises her eyebrows, urging Agatha to get on with it. Agatha rolls her eyes and starts reading.

      “First of all,” Agatha says, looking away from the screen to face her smiling wife, “how dare you advertise my band’s breakup with Alice. Secondly, I love the timing of Hela taking the drumsticks from you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugs. “I took her right from under you guys.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They’ve had this argument before—just the two of them and with the rest of their bandmates. Rio is hellbent on claiming she stole Alice, and not a single member of Sisters of the Craft, past or present, is willing to accept that. Which only seems to encourage her. Agatha would be more annoyed if she didn’t find it so endearing.

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>

      Agatha puts her phone down, trying not to laugh. “Baby…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes?” Rio asks—but there’s no teasing lilt in her voice this time. There’s an edge to it, something deeper.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha thinks back to their conversation from earlier. Rio being afraid of fame—not just unsure about it. Realistically, she’s always known Lady Death was a character, a mask. She’s always seen Rio. And maybe that’s the problem. Because the line between the person and the star has been blurring for a while now.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Maybe they’ve only just noticed it. But it’s always been there.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I love you,” Agatha says—and it sounds so loud in her head. She catches Rio’s little smile and sets the phone back on the nightstand. “Come here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio moves all too willingly, wiggling awkwardly with her leg brace. Agatha gets tired of the waiting and grabs her by the waist, dragging her between her legs.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you gonna forgo pants all week?” she asks, tracing the skin between the brace and Rio’s boxer shorts.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio hums, drawing out her answer as Agatha’s fingers linger, absentmindedly drawing patterns.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio, tell me,” she insists, just for the sake of hearing it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Great. Fantastic.
     </span>

      This is going to be a long week.

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wakes up to a loud sipping noise coming from nearby. She opens one eye—and then immediately opens both and sits up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What the hell are you doing?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Because, standing by the door looking oddly proud of herself, is her wife. Knee brace and crutches, casually sipping a cup of coffee. And still not wearing pants—in Agatha's third favorite robe.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugs, the movement slightly shaky. “You were taking too long to wake up.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha narrows her eyes. “Oh, I’m sorry. Was your pregnant wife, who spent all of yesterday tending to your every need, being tired and messing up your morning coffee schedule?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Uh…” Rio glances down at her cup. “That’s not what I said.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Deciding it’s best to calm down, Agatha flops back onto the bed with a sigh.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Baby,” Rio calls gently. Agatha hears her hopping toward her side of the bed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Stop moving!” Agatha groans, exasperated. After a moment, she sits up and grabs her phone. “Stay still.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio huffs out a laugh. “What are you doing?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Documenting your transgressions,” Agatha mutters as she snaps a photo. When she puts her phone down, she beckons her wife back to bed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is it decaf?” she asks innocently.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio rolls her eyes. “It’s the only kind of coffee in the house, my love.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha takes the cup from her. “I’ll be taking this.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She feels calmer after the first sip of fake coffee, and Rio drops her head in her lap, watching her with curious eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio just shrugs.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It’s easy like this. It’s always been easy—just the two of them, and the kids, and their friends who know.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha takes another sip of her coffee and feels Rio’s hands tugging her shirt up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you gonna say good morning to the baby?” she asks with a laugh, because Rio is obsessed with the baby—and the baby being a girl.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why?” Rio asks, pressing a kiss to her stomach. “Are you gonna want to document it too?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Yeah. She might.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sets the coffee down and picks up her phone. Ignoring the flood of notifications and twelve messages from Jen about her stupid podcast, she opens the camera and snaps a photo.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you gonna post that?” Rio asks, shifting her head to look up at Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t have to,” Agatha says, and slips the phone away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Her fingers thread through Rio’s hair, and they stay like that for a while. They have nowhere to be—the morning can last as long as they want it to. Agatha thinks they better seize the chance while they can.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You should do it,” Rio says after a while. “Post the photo, I mean.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why?” Agatha asks, curious.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio shrugs. “Show off.”

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      After four days stuck in the house, and Rio hopping around in her underwear, Agatha decides they need to go outside.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Put on pants,” Agatha says, stepping out of the shower and giving one quick look to her wife, splayed out on the bed wearing pink boxers with little skulls on them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio sits up slightly, dragging her leg with a pained sigh. “Why?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha drops her cool pretense and sits beside her on the bed. “You okay? Does it hurt? Have you taken your painkillers?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Slow down, baby,” Rio says, voice quiet. “I’m okay. Why do I need pants?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha nods, trying to calm her racing heart. “I mean, one, I wanna jump your bones and you're out of commission. But two, I was thinking we should go out?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We can get back to point one later,” Rio says with a teasing smile and pushes Agatha’s shoulders until she gets the message and stands up.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Where are we going?” Rio asks, sitting on the edge of the bed, watching Agatha search for her clothes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, since we can’t go to the beach, I was thinking that café the kids liked the first time we were here,” Agatha says. She turns around and passes Rio a pair of sweatpants. “What do you think?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She watches Rio’s face, searching for any sign that she doesn’t want this.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can I drive?” Rio asks, all her focus on getting her leg through the trousers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha snorts, kneeling in front of her to help. “No.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The café is empty when they arrive. It’s late for lunch and a weekday in autumn. Still, Agatha slides a hat onto Rio’s head as she helps her out of the car and then into a seat at an outside table. After ensuring she’s comfortable with her leg propped up on a chair, Agatha goes inside to order the food.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      She pays ahead, hoping her ridiculous tip will keep the staff from getting too comfortable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      When she returns to the table, Rio is typing on her phone, the hat now crooked on her head.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You look like a fool,” Agatha says, stepping in front of her and fixing the hat. “Much better now.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do I look hot?” Rio asks, wiggling her eyebrows.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha rolls her eyes and scoffs, sitting down across from her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wow, okay. Thanks for the support, babe,” Rio says dryly—but she’s smiling when Agatha looks at her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Their food is brought out by a teenager who looks ready to explode when she glances between the two of them. Rio waves at her, and the girl yelps.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ohmygod,” she whispers.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Kid,” Agatha says, her tone sharp, pulling the girl back to task.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Here’s your food. Enjoy. Bye!” She bolts back inside, and Agatha laughs at her retreating figure.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Damn, babe. One word,” Rio says with a teasing grin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha grins back. “I am that powerful.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      They eat slowly, enjoying the quiet of the afternoon, the sound of waves hitting the shore. It’s almost too good to be true. Agatha keeps an eye out for onlookers, but every time she looks at her wife—her easy smile, her relaxed posture—she relaxes a little too.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio pops a fry into her mouth, a stolen fry, because she ate all of her own and is now going for Agatha’s, and continues to talk about how excited she is to see the kids—who are coming to the beach house for the weekend so they can all go home together on Sunday—when a huge dog comes barreling toward them, seemingly aiming for Agatha’s fries?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then the beast stops, right in front of their table, and sits down, wagging its tail, tongue lolling out of its huge mouth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, hey, bud,” Rio says, patting the dog’s head, completely disregarding her personal safety. The beast leans into her touch happily—and from where Agatha is sitting, it's clearly aiming for Rio’s unprotected, half-eaten sandwich.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh, you’re a good boy…girl?” Rio laughs. “You’re a cutie.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The waitress from earlier comes rushing out, terror in her eyes. “I’m so sorry. I’ll handle her. It’s one of the dogs from the shelter, they—doesn’t matter. Come here, girl!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The dog tilts its head, like it hears her, but doesn’t move. Agatha catches Rio slipping it a fry. When Rio meets her gaze, she gives her a look.

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sits on the couch, frowning at her wife on the other end, patting the dog—their dog—AJ, who’s laying on the floor belly up because Agatha refused to let it climb on the furniture.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      AJ looks at Agatha, big, dumb, empty eyes pleading. She looks away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha doesn’t want to ask what AJ stands for. She has an idea—and she doesn’t care to confirm it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I think I’m gonna post the photos,” she tells Rio instead.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio looks up from the damn dog and smiles at her. She looks so good, hair wet from her shower, wearing one of Agatha’s tour hoodies and those stupid boxer shorts. She looks soft. Kissable.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay,” Rio says, and she keeps her eyes on Agatha the whole time she’s typing, despite AJ’s whining on the floor.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Take that, dog. Agatha types the caption and clicks post, dropping her phone back on the couch.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m gonna kiss you now,” she tells Rio, moving carefully around her injured leg.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha sighs when their lips meet. She’ll never get enough of her wife—of the way Rio relaxes into it, mouth pliant beneath Agatha’s.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then, a cold, slimy thing licks across her cheek, and Agatha curses, pulling back.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      AJ looks up at her, tongue lolling, and Agatha swears the dog looks proud of itself for that one.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio laughs softly, arms keeping Agatha from pulling away completely.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I hate that creature,” Agatha groans.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t be mean to Agatha Junior!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha stares at her wife blankly for a moment. Then—
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What the fuck did you just say?!”

     Sisters of the Craft are nominated for a shit-ton of awards at the grammys. As it should be.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Court gets no nominations and Agatha is pissed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A quick search online reassures her she's on the right side of history as fans are kicking and screaming about it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As it should fucking be.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha goes on Twitter and makes a one word post. ‘Cowards’, she says, and the fans are loving it. Rio slides on the couch next to her. AJ lifts its big, thick head from Agatha’s lap.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What cowards are we calling out tonight?” She asks, scooting closer and placing her head on Agatha's shoulder.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "The recording academy,” Agatha mutters, continuing to scroll.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles, “Aren't you guys receiving some special award thing this year?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, “A lifetime achievement award. Can you fucking believe? That's the kind of shit you give artists in their eighties. I'm not even forty, Rio!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Maybe you're just that good, my love,” Rio says, kissing her cheek sweetly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha resists the urge to kiss her wife silly. Leave it to Rio to make it better with a half baked counter argument.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You're coming with me,” she says instead.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do I have to?” Rio asks, eyes dropping to her injured leg.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes,” Agatha says resolutely, like that’s final.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shakes her head, looking at her with such fondness Agatha would mock her for looking like a lovesick fool—if they weren't already married and Rio wasn't, in fact, a lovesick fool.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Okay, my love."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They have been keeping a relatively low profile since Agatha posted those pictures of Rio half-naked on the beach house. Hela was furious about it. Apparently the fact that she was wearing Agatha's third-favorite robe didn't help, nor did the fact Agatha covered ninety-nine percent of her wife's face under the skull emoji. She left a piece of jaw uncovered and now, over a month and a half later, there are still edits being made about it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha has a good laugh out of the fan-made charts comparing Rio and Lady Death’s jaw, or her hands out of an overly zoomed-in screen shot from that one street interview. What's funnier to Agatha is the people fighting over it, like they're trying to gaslight her into thinking her wife is not her wife. It's infinitely more hilarious because Lady Death is out of commission until she's back in top shape so Rio has taken to pretending she's not the rock star whenever Agatha brings it up. Agatha oscillates between wanting to smack her or kiss her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But between Rio's injury and Agatha's band being on a break, the most excitement they get is school rides and doctor appointments. They went for a few ultrasounds since the pregnancy tests came back positive, and Rio cried every time and squeezed her hand like she was gonna be the one giving birth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Really doing everything to steal Agatha’s thunder.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She can't even joke about their baby resembling a wonky bean because ‘That's my daughter, Agatha," Rio says with a pout, but at least Agatha Junior is off the table for baby names.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Because they have the beast named AJ instead.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It shouldn't be a surprise how fucking easy the beast makes a place for itself in the family.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Still Agatha sees it happen, if not with surprise, with resignation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The boys love the dog. That is not surprising. The first weekend on the beach, Nicky had squealed so high upon seeing the beast Agatha swears she can still hear it. She had, at the time, been half terrified AJ would hurt the boys. She has learned since then that the only way the stupid dog will harm the boys is by accidentally sitting on top of them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What's worse, AJ is absolutely obsessed with her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio finds it absolutely hilarious so she's very unhelpful about it, and wherever Agatha goes, AJ follows. If she sits down on the couch with a book or to watch TV, she can be sure within five minutes the black fluffy beast will be at her feet, waiting for the moment Agatha makes eye contact to start wiggling its tail making the furniture rattle.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The dog has a wonderful way to get her from okay to annoyed in seconds– and then refusing to follow her commands of ‘move, you’ or ‘move beast’. The only response she gets is an increased speed of tail waggle and big dumb empty eyes staring back at her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AJ only ever listens to Rio, unlike Agatha herself, who ignores Rio’s calls whenever she's reminded of the easy way her wife gets the dog to do what she wants. Also for ignoring her suggestion to at least teach her a useful command than come or sit– maybe attack.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Instead Rio teaches AJ to find Agatha and deliver her flowers she cuts from the garden of the new house.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One time she gets a slightly nibbled carrot instead, and demands the beast at least do the carrying in a basket. When Rio complies too quickly, and gets Nicky to help her paint a sign for the basket Agatha is immediately suspicious.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then, she's casually sitting on the couch watching some reality TV show with Billy, when AJ barrels into the room with little grace, carrying a basket that says ‘daddy death’s garden patch’ with little stars and skulls drawn around it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy groans dramatically, dropping himself face-down on the couch, and Agatha turns around to catch her wife and younger son’s smushed faces over the patio doors giggling like a pair of fools.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The matching grins, braids and overalls have nothing to do with how easily Agatha forgives them.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Music video out tonight. Live at the awards ceremony.
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha looks at the text from Hela for a long moment—so long, in fact, that Billy clears his throat pointedly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "I said I'm done, Mom," he says, a hint of amusement in his eyes. "Are you nervous? You know Mama is gonna love the look. You guys are gonna be so embarrassing," he adds with a groan.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Oh, and you haven't even seen the dress I got her!" Agatha smirks in delight as she moves to the mirror, fidgeting with her tie..
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Stop!" Billy steps beside her and slaps her hands away. "It's perfect. Don't touch it!"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha gives it a little pull just to mess with him. "Look at you, such a grown man making your mom's tie."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy rolls his eyes, but his eyes are soft as they stare at their reflection on the mirror.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Y'know I love you, right?" She asks, voice betraying her intent of making it playful. It comes out soft and vulnerable. Agatha hates it immediately but it's too late to take it back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Billy catches her eye in the mirror biting his lip and nods. When he goes to speak she beats him to it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Now, be a dear and get me earrings to match,” and she shoves him, gentle but firmly away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Picking up her phone from the bed, she reads Hela's message again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That motherfucker. She's been sitting on that video for two months and now is when she decides to pull the trigger. On Agatha's night? When she planned to show off her wife? And try easing Rio into the spotlight?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sits on the bed thinking over her options. She could have Hela pull the video, but it is a good time to drop it. Also a huge fuck you the academy for giving her the stupid lifetime achievement award like she's a decaying old crone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Should she give Rio a heads up? Like, hey babe, by the way I decided to show my naked butt for the music video.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Maybe not like that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sends a quick text to Hela just as Billy returns with the earrings.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Thanks, teen.” She ruffles his curls as she walks to the mirror and he slaps her hands away with a long suffering sigh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After an appropriate amount of time checking her outfit out in the mirror– she looks hot– Agatha makes her way to where she last saw Rio, watching some dumb space movie with Nicky, pretending they weren't attending a red carpet event in a couple of hours.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So…I'm wearing a suit,” Agatha announces, patting down the lapels of her dark purple suit jacket, feeling a little nervous all of sudden.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She loves a suit, but the act of putting it on and showing it always brings back a memory—her mother's eyes when she tried to wear one to her first red carpet at sixteen. She had ended up in a dress and spent the entire night fidgeting with the straps, pretending she didn't notice the way Evanora was shooting daggers at her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio doesn't immediately turn, but she hums in acknowledgement as she continues to braid Nicky's hair while a game plays on the TV.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “A suit, huh,” she says after a beat, like she can tell where Agatha’s mind is going. “Am I gonna need to take a moment after I see you, baby?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sweetheart,” Agatha says, drawing out the pet name.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio laughs softly, and kisses Nicky’s head. “You're ready, kiddo. And your mom, she's very demanding. Let's have a look, okay?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky nods, and Rio counts to three under her breath making the little boy giggle. When they turn to face her, Agatha finds their reaction acceptable.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky covers his face with his hands, the picture of childish excitement. “Mommy! You look so pretty!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He jumps from Rio’s lap before she can stop him, throwing his arms around Agatha’s legs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods, following behind him, silent. Agatha picks Nicky up, but her eyes never leave Rio. Her wife looks at her like Agatha is a goddess, eyes dark and greedy taking her in. When she reaches them, she drops a kiss to Agatha’s jaw, breathing deep like she's training to keep her cool– and failing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It's a beautiful sight.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Okay, I accept. We can go to this ridiculous award ceremony.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha grins– she hopes it looks menacing. “I got your outfit too.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Did you? Better go check it out then. Shall we kid?” she asks Nicky without breaking eye contact with Agatha,
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky nods excitedly, jumping up and down as he waits for his moms to stop staring so intently at each other.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Gods, Agatha could stay here forever, basking in the quiet intensity of her wife's gaze. Rio looks at her like she's never seen something more beautiful, and Agatha thinks her sixteen-year-old self could've used someone like Rio in her life.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mama!” Nicky tugs at Rio’s free hand, but Rio doesn't look away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha,” Rio whispers, closing the distance between them despite their son’s insistence. She moves her hand holding the cane behind Agatha, trapping her in the middle. “You look so good, babe. I have no words.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You can show me,” Agatha whispers back conspiratorially, grinning as she moves even closer until their noses bump.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mama! Mommy!” Nicky insists, tugging again at Rio’s hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio, ever stubborn, keeps her eyes on Agatha, lifting an eyebrow in challenge.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha breaks first, she puts a hand on Nicky's shoulder and he drops Rio’s hand. She loves the kid but she's still half terrified he'll trip Rio– and they just got her graduate from crutches to the cane. Agatha spent a lot of money on that ridiculously fancy carved cane. So she follows after them, keeping an eye on the kid.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When they enter the bedroom Rio’s eyes quickly zero in on the garment bag over the bed, and she shoots Agatha a look. “A dress, baby?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha nods, with a grin, encouraging Rio to open the bag. Nicky follows along, climbing the bed and helping Rio open the bag. That kid is so impatient– Rio's genes through and through.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio lets him help, slowly revealing the black silk dress, thin straps and the high slight over the left leg. Agatha had seen it while getting her suit and knew Rio would look good in it. It's simple, yet elegant. Something just a little out of her comfort zone, a little more Lady Death than Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You should try it on,” Agatha says, clearing her throat, and her mind. “See if you like it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Did you get me a spare if I don't?” Rio asks, amused at something she sees in her eyes that Agatha is unwilling to admit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She shakes her head no, and calls Nicky over.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Go watch the game, and I'll call you when mama's ready, okay?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nicky nods and runs out of the room. When she turns back to face her wife, she catches Rio eyeing the dress with a shy smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Need a hand with that?” She asks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shakes her head with a laugh. “I need a whole team, actually.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha raises her hands, “I can offer you two.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She gets an eye roll for that, but Rio sits on the bed and kicks off her socks. “Come here.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So, before we go,” Agatha pulls her phone out of her pocket and opens the video Hela sent her. “The video is premiering at the awards tonight. I thought… just, watch it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks at her, raising a brow, amusement and confusion mingling in her eyes. She takes the phone and sits on the bed. Agatha takes the spot next to her as Rio hits play.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh my god,” Rio says two seconds into the video.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha bites her tongue. She hasn’t even seen the worst part yet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The video opens with Agatha rising, her bare back to the camera, revealing her secret rune tattoos. Rio pauses it just before Agatha’s butt fully faces the camera.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why are you naked?” Rio asks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha simply presses play again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio never quite recovers after that. At some point—after Agatha’s character steps out of the house, her boobs barely covered by her long hair (very classy, in Agatha’s opinion)—Rio hides her face in Agatha’s chest and lets out an exasperated sigh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “My love,” she says, voice muffled against Agatha’s shirt. “I love you so much, and you look so hot right now—and also in the video—but why? This is going to be shown at the Grammys? With the song I wrote for you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chuckles, running a hand through Rio’s hair. “It’s my love letter to you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha, I know for certain your character chokes my character,” Rio says, with a laugh that sounds far more amused than she’s trying to seem.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t forget your character also stabs mine,” Agatha adds, her tone serious—but she starts laughing halfway through. “You’re such a freak.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shoves her away, but when Agatha falls back on the bed, she willingly follows, landing softly against her shoulder.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re okay with it?” Agatha asks. She knows Rio is—her wife is more than capable of showing her when she’s not—but she needs to hear it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah,” Rio says, shifting slightly so she’s facing her. “You owe me, though,” she adds, a playful grin promising trouble—and fun.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They stay like that for as long as possible, but eventually Hela texts to say the car is on the way, and they have to rush to finish getting ready. Rio stops them at the door after they’ve said goodnight to the kids and gone over Billy’s long list of dos and don’ts—most of which she’s already forgotten.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I want to take a picture,” Rio says as they stand in front of the mirror by the door. “Just for me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha nods. They’ve taken so many photos and shared them with the world. They can have one just for themselves.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio kisses her, soft and careful not to ruin their makeup, but Agatha feels it in her bones. Feels the words Rio still hasn’t found to describe how she feels about the suit in the hand that wraps around the tie pulling her closer. Rio’s fingers grab her jaw, deepening the kiss, turning it hungry.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A loud honk breaks them apart. Rio laughs, cheeks flushed and out of breath. Agatha considers ditching the grammys altogether, but Rio takes her and tugs her towards the car.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We're getting back to this,” Agatha whispers when they climb into the car. She busies herself finding the button for the divider while Rio checks her makeup in a hand mirror.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I thought you wanted to go to the afterparty after the awards,” Rio says, locking eyes with her as she fixes her lipstick. “Baby, I'm not making out with you in a room full of people.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chuckles, finding the button and pressing it with glee. They're alone again. She takes the lipstick and mirror from Rio and drops everything back in her clutch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I would make it so worth it,” she says pouting, fingers gripping the fabric of Rio’s dress at her waist. The high slit catches Agatha's eye again and she sighs, trying to sober up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio cups her face, her fingers cold over her jaw. “No, thank you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ***
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The red carpet is loud, and crowded. Agatha can tell without even stepping out of the car, watching the chaos from behind the tinted windows.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ready?” She asks Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I've walked red carpets before.” Rio shrugs, but Agatha can tell she's thinking about it too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Not like this,” she says, because Rio won't. Agatha reaches for her hand, tangling their fingers together. “Not with me, barefaced, on a stage this big.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She doesn't get an answer– she doesn't need to. Agatha knows her wife, and she's been paying extra attention lately. She wants to take care of her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do you wanna turn back?” She asks, searching Rio's face. “We can go home, order food, and watch a movie with the kids.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio mulls it over, playing with the band on Agatha's ring finger.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, I want this,” Rio says, looking up and locking eyes with her. “You look so so handsome. I want everyone in that stupid red carpet to know they don't stand a chance with you because you're with me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha thinks about twenty things she wants to say (and another few she wants to do) but their car moves again, stopping in front of the literal red carpet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It's showtime,” she says, just as one of the event assistants knocks on their door once, and opens the door for them. Agatha squeezes her hand, “I got you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The lights blind them the moment they step outside the car. Agatha tightens her hold on Rio, guiding her at their own pace, shooting glares at the event assistant who tries to tell them to move faster. Agatha considers asking Rio for her cane to use as a weapon. The smile on Rio’s face as she reaches to ease the furrow in Agatha’s eyebrows makes her think she probably noticed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They stop for some photos here and there, Agatha refuses to let Rio out of her sight even though most photographers want her, and not her producer. Assholes. As soon as each stop is done Agatha returns to Rio, and they continue their pilgrimage.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They meet the band in the chaos, Jen and Lilia– and Alice finds them and shares a conspiratorial smile with Rio because they each have two seats at the awards.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “The news tomorrow is gonna be that The Court skipped the grammys,” Alice says with a grin as the five of them pose for a photo.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “As we should,” Rio responds, biting back a laugh. “We didn't even get best new artist nod.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You're not technically new artists,” Jen says through gritted teeth. “So, shut up and smile.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The photographers ask for a photo with just the band and Alice, and begrudgingly Agatha drops her hand on Rio’s waist.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You'll be okay?” She asks, ignoring the murmurs from the band.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio rolls her eyes fondly, fixing Agatha’s tie like it's just an excuse to touch her. “Go, baby.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The minutes it takes for everyone to get over their fucking selves feel eternal—first the photographers and then the reporters and their stupid camera crews. Agatha feels Rio’s eyes on her as she smiles for the camera and talks nonsense, because really, Agatha is not sure what she's saying. The only thing on her mind is for these interviews to be done so she can go back to her wife in that sinful dress, all alone on the red carpet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Rio, lovely to see you on the red carpet. You look stunning,” someone says out of nowhere and Agatha snaps her head to where she heard the voice.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some man in a glittery suit with slicked-back hair is giving Rio his most charming smile. Don't they know her wife is gay?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Thank you," Rio says to the man, finding Agatha’s eye over her head. "I always get pulled into these things, you guys just never notice. I like that."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha has to hold back her laughter, and Jen steps on her foot.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Well you're looking hard to miss today,” the glitter-suit guy says.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Thanks, my wife picked it for me," Rio replies without missing a beat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen elbows her, and Agatha returns the gesture while answering the next question with a forced smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Agatha finds Rio again she's being accosted by another reporter.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "You're sporting an injury similar to Lady Death,” the woman says with a knowing look. “And showing up on Agatha Harkness’ arm– anything you wanna say to that?"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shrugs, a smile tugging at her lips. "Not really."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "You think we'll ever find out who Lady Death is?" The woman tries again, like a dog with a bone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "That's for her to decide,” Rio replies diplomatically, catching Agatha’s gaze and tilting her head subtly in a silent request for a rescue.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "And you don't know when or if she ever will?" The reporter insists, getting a little pushy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha makes a quick exit– she never did care to be polite after all. She has a reputation as a raging asshole to uphold.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "How's April 31st?" Rio answers, just as Agatha reaches her side.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The reporter looks taken aback, "Wait, are you—no because April—"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ignoring the blabbering woman, Agatha wraps an arm around Rio’s waist, letting her drop some of her weight on her. She feels Rio relax against her, her smile a little less tense.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We should go inside, hon.” Agatha doesn't wait for the reporter to cut in, focusing entirely on her wife.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Lead the way, then, handsome." As they step away, Rio turns to the reporter with a grin. "Have a good night.”
     <br/>
     <br/>

     <br/>
     <br/>
     The ceremony takes too long to start, and the host isn't even funny—just like every year. But at least she has Rio by her side this time around (Jen is to her right, and Agatha does her best to ignore her).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Enjoy the moment, my love,” she whispers in Rio's ear when a member of the academy steps onto the stage for the achievement award. “Before you have to live knowing you're not the only one who's seen my butt.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio snorts, her smile playful as the man starts talking on stage. “Me and how many models before?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pretends to look shocked, just as the cameras approach the band. “Well, that was my twenty-year-old butt.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You've gotten hotter with age,” Rio says without missing a beat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha laughs. “You know there are people on TikTok who read artists' lips at events and stuff.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, I'm sure they won't be disappointed in us,” Rio says, just as the camera guy gets the group into focus.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes at the camera. She's not letting anyone think she's happy about this. Which is why, moments later, when she's on stage, she delivers her speech with just enough malice to pass for acceptable.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "I don't usually write speeches because that's bad luck, but then I was told this one wasn't optional,” she starts, holding the stupid award in her hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her bandmates—and Alice (how did Alice get on the stage?)—roll their eyes, amused behind her, like they just knew Agatha would pull something like this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha smirks, loving the attention of a room waiting with bated breath. She catches her wife's eye across the stage. “So, I'd like to dedicate this win to my wife—the only real achievement worth celebrating. The Grammys can wait another thirty years before trying for special awards again. Thank you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she makes it back to her seat, Rio grabs her hand but doesn't say anything. Agatha catches her smiling and lets out a breath she didn't know she was holding.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Before she can say anything, though, the not-funny host steps back on stage and announces their music video.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Now, a surprise—Agatha Harkness and Lady Death's first collaboration: the ‘You Ruined Women for Me’ music video premiere.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A cameraman approaches them again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha squeezes Rio's hand and smirks. This should be fun.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Afterparty?” Agatha asks, wiggling her eyebrows as the car drives away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio drops the award on her lap, moving her hands to Agatha's chest– over the lapels of her jacket– and leaves them there. “Are you planning any funny business?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Only freaky business,” Agatha says, mock serious. “After having defiled the grammys with my naked butt, I wanna defile this stupid award before Jen tries to steal it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And how do you plan on doing that?” Rio asks curiously,  a little bit encouraging.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha stares at the trophy for a long moment, “Overly ornate coffee mug?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Shot glass?” Rio counters, holding the award closer and inspecting it from side to side.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha cackles, “This is why I married you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I married you for your butt,” Rio deadpans. “I want a burger when this is all over. And fries.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At the afterparty they're received with applause and whistles– and Jen, rolls her eyes, falling to hide her proud smile. Lilia raises her martini to Agatha in congratulations.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha takes a dramatic bow, soaking in the attention before using her newfound power to cut through the line at the bar and order a beer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she returns to her wife's side, Rio raises an eyebrow at her. Agatha shrugs, passes the bottle to her, and offers her a hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They walk around for a while, chatting with other artists they rarely see. Agatha keeps her hand on Rio, enjoying the warmth of her wife's skin under her fingertips, the way Rio leans closer and doesn't shy away from being seen with her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     People here know, or assume and Rio doesn't seem to care. Agatha hasn't had a drink but she feels drunk. Every interaction feels charged somehow. People she's known and seen in passing over awards and events give them knowing smirks, and the more bold tease them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     No one says the quiet part out loud.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That Rio is Lady Death.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     No one cares.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha feels bold, she feels stupid. Like she's twenty-two and in love again, ready to burn the world to the ground to get the woman she loves.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How are you feeling?” She asks Rio, tugging her to a secluded corner, beneath a pillar covered in golden drapery. Ridiculous.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio searches her face, her eyes soften. “I like this,” she murmurs, wrapping her free hand around Agatha's waist  under her suit jacket. “I could get used to this part of fame, at least.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha nods, her mind hazy, thinking of all the years of parties they’ve missed. She lets Rio pull her closer, hides her face in the crook of her shoulder, and inhales.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Oh, she's so far gone. She places a kiss on Rio's neck and prays to the heavens above that her wife is stronger than she is. Agatha is not God's strongest soldier.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio lets out a slow, measured breath. Her hold on Agatha’s waist loosens for a moment before tightening again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Kiss me,” she whispers against the shell of Agatha's ear.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Fuck
     </em>
     .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha throws caution to the wind. She's holding her Grammy and Rio's cane in one hand, but she hooks her free hand around Rio's waist and pulls her closer, bringing their mouths together.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One kiss never hurt anyone.
     <br/>
