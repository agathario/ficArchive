<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha whipped her head and body towards the student. “What the fuck is your problem?”</p>
<p>“No problem,” She shook her head, smirking. “I like talking to you.”</p>
<p>“You like pissing me off.” Agatha sniped, plucking her glass off the bar when it arrived.</p>
<p>“Those two seem to be one in the same.”</p>
<p>“Just tell me something.” She said after letting a sip burn down her throat. “Where do you get off speaking to a respected professor like that?”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“You were argumentative, disrespectful, dismissive–”</p>
<p>“No, Agatha, that was you.”</p>
<p>“Dr. Harkness.” Agatha corrected. “Only people I like can call me Agatha and I don’t like you.”</p>
<p>“Now, that’s not true.” Rio tilted her head. “You’re talking to me, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Newly tenured professor, Dr. Agatha Harkness, has nothing to prove. That is until she meets a smug, twenty-three year old PhD student in Copenhagen after her first keynote speech. Never one to shy away from a challenge, Agatha seeks to put Rio in her place by any means necessary. No matter what the consequences…</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Welcome to the long awaited collaboration fic between Midwestprincess_01, Saturnreturn, and AnonFandomBandit. You all thought we were just edging you, but no, we're 3 neurodivergent lesbians and decided to dedicate time to writing these sick fucks.  Each of us wrote two chapters, try and see if you can guess who wrote what:)</p>
<p>(BTW, to address any concerns you may have, Rio's surname is purposefully incorrect in this chapter for plot reasons. She is NOT white, she is still boricua. Plot reason will be revealed as the fic continues.)</p>
<p>Fic title comes from "One That Got Away" by MUNA</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha did not particularly care for social gatherings, let alone those that required her to make idle chatter with the far intellectually inferior.</p><p>What she did care for was presenting her findings from her latest paper, the one that earned her tenure at forty years old, and rubbing her genius in everyone's face. Because despite the fact that she had published many, <i>many</i> papers, this one made her noteworthy. It made her the keynote speaker at the International Conference on Multidisciplinary Studies, Anthropology, History, and Archaeology in Copenhagen this year.</p><p>Hundreds of professors, students, and doctors flying in from different universities all over the world to listen to Agatha. Praise her and her work at U-Mass’ history department. Hear her speak and sit back in awe that they were too fucking stupid to do the work and make the connections themselves.</p><p>Her body thrummed with anticipation as she stormed through the conference center, simply moving from point A to point B. She refused to get involved in pleasantries, it was the worst part of academia. The small talk, the pretentious bullshit, the playing of devil's advocate.</p><p>Agatha’s loafers carried her farther down the hall, her loose braid swishing with every step. Her glasses clung to the tip of her nose, black slacks and matching belt sitting on her waist, wrinkled white button up with the sleeves rolled beneath her navy sweater vest. A messily scribbled ‘Dr. Agatha Harkness’ nametag on the cashmere of her top, leather messenger bag slung on her shoulder. Some have said she presents herself as too intimidating, but clearly those people had never met a butch lesbian. More than that, Agatha liked being intimidating, it kept the dumbasses from arguing with her.</p><p>She’d gone the entire first day of the conference going from lecture hall to lecture hall, enduring the torture of listening to others drone on. Finally, with day one coming to a close, it was her turn to present, stalking past a group of twenty-something PhD students on her way into the largest auditorium the center had.</p><p>“There’s a pub like three blocks over, I think we should take advantage of Denmark’s nightlife.” One of the students said, the others agreeing.</p><p>“Rhodes?” Another one asked for confirmation.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flickered over, for no reason in particular.</p><p>The student in question, Rhodes, smiled. Hair down, dressed in baggy jeans and long sleeved button up, along with very chunky boots that screamed <i>dyke</i>. She was leaning against the wall nonchalantly, hands in her pockets, the small gap in her two front teeth appearing through curled lips. The warmest brown eyes made the briefest contact with Agatha’s before she answered.</p><p>“Gotta stay warm somehow…” Rhodes replied, gaze lingering on Agatha’s back even after she had passed by the group of probable morons.</p><p>Agatha paid no mind to it, getting checked out by someone who might as well be a fetus. She stood confidently at the front of the auditorium, laptop queued with visual aids. Speaking to a room of mostly Gen Z and millennials meant she had to keep showing them different pictures to keep their attention. Like fish with shiny, reflective surfaces.</p><p>Once everyone had filed in and settled, she began, idly noting that one brunette from the hall all the way in the back.</p><p>“Hello everyone, I’m Dr. Agatha Harkness. I am a tenured professor from the University of Massachusetts’ history department, and I’m here to discuss my paper on the Tesseract. Also known colloquially as ‘the space stone’ due to its celestial appearance, the Tesseract has had few brave enough to track its origin.” She smiled almost to herself, leisurely holding the clicker in her hand as she stood behind the podium. “I could bore you with previous attempts, but I prefer mine…for obvious reasons.”</p><p>The crowd let out soft murmurs of laughter, that one brunette included.</p><p>Fuck, why did Agatha’s eyes keep landing on her?</p><p>Her being hot might have something to do with it, Agatha’s brain helpfully supplied.</p><p>And no older than twenty fucking five.</p><p>“Let’s get started, shall we?” She clapped her hands together, microphone clipped to her collar making her voice reverberate throughout the auditorium.</p><p>It went off without a hitch, Agatha’s work spoke for itself. She had painstakingly tracked this stupid cube from the big bang all the way to the present day. Nobody had done that before, well not accurately at least.</p><p>An hour later, she concluded her findings, wrapping everything in a nice little bow for these nitwits.</p><p>“We can track the Tesseract through roughly the last thousand years.” Agatha declared. “From the very creation of life to Norway. From Norway to the middle of the ocean only to be recovered years later. Where it now stays today, under lock and key for observation by the U.S. government.”</p><p>With one last click of the remote, she was done, letting the applause of the crowd wash over her.</p><p>“Any questions?” She asked, though it was rhetorical. This shit was so airtight, there was no way fucking way someone could find a flaw–</p><p>“I have one.” A familiar voice from the back row called out.</p><p>“Fucking hell.” She mumbled, hoping the microphone didn’t pick it up.</p><p>“What’s up, I’m Rio. PhD student. Berkeley.” She introduced herself before standing. “You started your timeline with the big bang before concluding that the Tesseract turned up in Tønsberg, Norway.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “There a question in there somewhere?”</p><p>“You didn’t account for how it got to Norway to begin with.”</p><p>“If the previous studies done by planetary geologists are to be believed,” She held back from rolling her eyes. “The Tesseract landed there after several thousand years of floating through space.”</p><p>“But–”</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>“Did you even take into account the theory of a cult or other race coming into contact with the Tesseract before the Germans or Hydra in 1942?”</p><p>“Of course, but there’s no academic backing to any of those claims.”</p><p>“Well–” Rio pressed. “There have been other papers that propose the stone was in the Asgardian’s protection.”</p><p>Oh, this woman wasn’t hot.</p><p>She was driving Agatha up a fucking wall.</p><p>She clenched her jaw, forehead vein popping as she kept her composure. “I am aware, and to reiterate, those have little to no academic evidence.”</p><p>“I’d disagree.”</p><p>“Asgardians are a fictional race that have never proven to exist, let alone care for a stone that the U.S. military keeps in a vault under twenty-four-hour surveillance.”</p><p>Rio was undeterred. “There’s been several–”</p><p>“Rio, was it?”</p><p>She grinned. “Yeah.”</p><p>“Well,<i>Rio</i>, I have researched the validity of those claims multiple times.” She kept her voice soft before letting it go cold. “Over the past three years <i>I</i> have spent creating this timeline. There is no substantial evidence that a made-up group of people <i>ever</i> came into contact with the Tesseract. If there was, I would have taken it into account before submitting.”</p><p>Agatha waited, staring the younger woman down. Almost challenging her to keep pushing.</p><p>Push the respected keynote doctor, Rio.</p><p>After a beat of silence, Agatha relaxed. Satisfied that she had wrangled this student into submission.</p><p>“I disagree.” Rio shrugged. “The notion that a civilization didn’t exist simply because you didn’t research thoroughly enough is, frankly, reckless.”</p><p>Agatha cocked her hip in cadence with her head. “The opinion of one pretentious PhD student does not detract from the fact that my timeline is airtight. <i>Frankly,</i> that is.”</p><p>“I meant no offense.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t be offended by someone who goes to <i>Berkeley.</i>”</p><p>“You should tell your face that.” Rio deadpanned, causing snickers to erupt from the crowd.</p><p>Agatha let out a deep exhale, mostly because mauling this woman in the middle of a panel would be frowned upon. She gave a bitter smile before moving on.</p><p>“Any other questions?”</p><p>Rio stayed standing. “Yeah, I have a few–”</p><p>“Anyone at all?” Agatha asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>Another from the crowd stood, a man, old. Definitely a professor. “What was the inspiration behind choosing to research the Tesseract?”</p><p>Oh, thank fucking god.</p><p>“Now <i>that</i> is an excellent question.” She smirked.</p><p>Once the keynote had come to an end, Agatha fled. She burrowed into her long coat, pulling it tight around her as she stepped out onto the street. Whoever's idea it was to host a conference in Denmark in late January had a special place in hell reserved, she decided as the bone-chilling air enveloped her.</p><p>Her hotel was a short walk from the center, passing by shops and restaurants. Agatha couldn’t actually feel the cold through her broiling rage. The fucking audacity of that student to go toe-to-toe with a respected doctor.</p><p>What did Rio even know?</p><p>Agatha sulked as she made it another block.</p><p>Rio wasn’t a doctor.</p><p>Rio wasn’t anything.</p><p>Why is she still thinking about Rio?</p><p>Rio motherfucking Rhodes.</p><p>It was one mouthy dumbass. Agatha dealt with those every day.</p><p>So why was this one throwing her off?</p><p>Her stride broke as she passed a pub, <i>The Black Dog</i>, and she could think of no better time where alcohol was warranted. Agatha recoiled at the sheer amount of people in the bar, pushing through and finding a stool. She dropped her bag on the floor, letting her head slump into her hands, taking a breath before she fucking lost it.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness?”</p><p>Oh, she <i>was</i> going to fucking lose it.</p><p>Agatha looked up, and sure enough–</p><p>“Not you.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, “Is this seat taken?” Not even waiting for an answer before perching on the stool next to Agatha.</p><p>The younger woman had a Polaroid camera slung around her neck, hastily raising it in her arm and taking a picture of herself with Agatha in the background, scowling. The flash was blinding, the pretentious fucker.</p><p>She set her glass down on the bar top next to Agatha’s elbow, pocketing the photo printed from the camera. “Are you stalking me?”</p><p>Rio fidgeted with the plastic toothpick in her drink, turning her body to face Agatha’s. She noted <i>MORS</i> tattooed across Rio’s knuckles of her right hand. “This is the closest bar to the convention center.”</p><p>“Not an answer.” She muttered, waving down the bartender. “Whiskey, Macallan, neat. Three fingers.”</p><p>“If I had a nickel for every time I heard that one…” Rio murmured over the rim of what looked to be some fruity monstrosity in her tumbler.</p><p>Agatha whipped her head and body towards the student. “What the fuck is your problem?”</p><p>“No problem,” She shook her head, smirking. “I like talking to you.”</p><p>“You like pissing me off.” Agatha sniped, plucking her glass off the bar when it arrived.</p><p>“Those two seem to be one in the same.”</p><p>“Just tell me something.” She said after letting a sip burn down her throat. “Where do you get off speaking to a respected professor like that?”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“You were argumentative, disrespectful, dismissive–”</p><p>“No, Agatha, that was you.”</p><p>“Dr. Harkness.” Agatha corrected. “Only people I like can call me Agatha and I don’t like you.”</p><p>“Now, that’s not true.” Rio tilted her head. “You’re talking to me, aren’t you?”</p><p>“You commandeered the seat next to me.”</p><p>“You didn’t tell me not to.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, tightening her grip around her glass. “And it’ll haunt me for the rest of my life, I’m sure.”</p><p>“How’d you get this far without being able to take criticism?”</p><p>“I can take <i>valid</i> criticism. The type with actual merit.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio leaned in. “Then let me walk you through it.”</p><p>And Agatha wasn’t dumb, it was obvious what Rio wanted. The flirtatious jokes, the close proximity, the snarky comments. And yes, knowing a PhD student wanted to fuck her was flattering. But Agatha would also rather chew glass than admit to being wrong, admit that Rio’s rebuttal wasn’t completely out of left field. So, she leaned in too, her free hand dropping to Rio’s knee.</p><p>Agatha furrowed her brows in mock confusion. “Oh, please do.”</p><p>Brown eyes flickered to Agatha’s hand, her breath catching. “Uh, the existence of a third party or outside race being in possession of the Tesseract has been studied–”</p><p>Agatha let her hand drift up further, keeping her eyes on Rio’s face like she was listening. “Mmhm.”</p><p>Rio’s tongue quickly licked her bottom lip, but didn’t address how Agatha’s fingers were steadily reaching her thigh. “There’s- there’s a great journal from 2012 on h-how Asgardians felt a sense of duty to the stone.”</p><p>“I’ll look it up.” Agatha spoke casually, her hand reaching its final destination at the apex of Rio’s thighs. “Do you remember the name of the university that published it?”</p><p>Rio’s face faltered, eyes fluttering. “Um…”</p><p>“Or the author?”</p><p>The younger woman flushed, her hand choking her drink. “I’m- I’m forgetting.”</p><p>The pub was dark and packed, nobody giving a second thought to the way Agatha and Rio were huddled by the bar. As Agatha cupped Rio’s crotch through her jeans, she felt a semi-hard length almost twitch.</p><p>Her pulse spiked at the realization, at the effect she had on her. She had barely done anything and Rio was already so willing, so reactive.</p><p>“How are you going to give criticism without having the citations to back it up?” Agatha innocently asked, letting her palm give the softest amount of friction possible.</p><p>Rio canted her hips fractionally, trying to get more. “Y-yeah…” She incorrectly responded.</p><p>Agatha curled her lips, lifting her hand completely. “Well if you’re not even going to try–”</p><p>“No. Wait.” Rio grabbed her wrist with the hand that had <i>VITA</i> inked across the knuckles, attempting to put it back where it had just been.</p><p>Agatha’s traitorous mind flashed with the thought of that hand wrapped around her neck, <i>VITA</i> grasping her windpipe. The irony of life choking her.</p><p>“Uh-uh.” She scolded, her hand hovering. “Ask nicely.”</p><p>And just like she knew Rio would–</p><p>“Please,” Rio spoke so earnestly, pupils blown wide.</p><p>Agatha let her hand rest against Rio again, but didn’t apply any pressure. “Please, what?”</p><p>“Please, Dr. Harkness, touch me.”</p><p>Agatha sympathetically pouted, fingers wrapping around Rio’s cock as much as possible through the loose denim. “You desperate for it?”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio’s jaw slackened, grasp on Agatha’s wrist growing loose.</p><p>Agatha licked her lips like a predator about to pounce, palming and feeling her become even harder. “You’re pathetic, aren’t you.”</p><p>It wasn’t a question and Rio didn’t even try to give a response, instead pressing her lips together to smother a moan. “Mmhmm.”</p><p>“Say it.” Agatha pawed at the younger woman with a renewed intensity. “Tell me, Rio.”</p><p>“I-I’m pathetic.” She choked out, her torso going rigid.</p><p>Agatha leaned in further until her lips brushed the shell of Rio’s ear, adorned with a million piercings. “<i>Good girl.</i>”</p><p>A pained whimper left Rio’s mouth, the hot air caressing Agatha’s cheek. “Agatha.”</p><p>“Are you going to come in your pants from just a few touches?” Agatha’s tone dripped with condescension.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer, her right hand almost clawing at the bar top while Agatha stroked her.</p><p>“Where’d all that cockiness go?”</p><p>No answer, Rio writhing in her seat.</p><p>Agatha felt the strain in Rio’s jeans and found herself wanting to know exactly how big Rio was, how long. From what she could feel, Rio sure as hell wasn’t fucking small. Agatha wanted to feel Rio somewhere else, specifically inside her.</p><p>Clenching her own thighs together, her panties utterly ruined by now, she kept going. “Where’s that confidence?”</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>“No rebuttal?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, her eyes fighting to stay open.</p><p>“Aww,” Agatha t’sked. “Sweetheart...poor little <i>slut</i> can’t think.”</p><p>A staggered breath exited Rio’s throat, her body hunching over slightly, her hand atop the bar relaxing. Agatha’s hand felt a warm sensation pool beneath the fabric, the strain no longer there.</p><p>“Yikes.” Agatha blew out a breath. “Quick trigger, huh?”</p><p>It was too dim to see much, but if she really focused, she could make out the outline where the denim was darker than the rest. She dragged her hand back down Rio’s thigh, giving her knee a quick squeeze before pulling away.</p><p>“You should really improve on your argumentation if you’re going to have a shot at that PhD.” She picked her drink back up, swallowing the rest of the whiskey. “Because I remain unconvinced.”</p><p>The younger woman sat there for a beat, seemingly trying to catch her breath.</p><p>Agatha laughed at the almost catatonic student in front of her. “You might want to head back to your hotel and change before your pants get stiff.”</p><p>Rio finally looked at her, face flushed. “Are you coming back with me?”</p><p>Agatha grinned, pushing her empty glass towards the bar mat. “I don’t think a twenty year old could handle me.”</p><p>“I’m twenty-three.”</p><p>As if that made it better.</p><p>Agatha picked her bag up off the floor, throwing some money down,  standing and whispering in Rio’s ear before she left. “Good luck with your studies, darling. You’re going to need it.”</p><p>With that Agatha turned on her heel and made her escape. She stepped back out into the freezing streets of Copenhagen, now warm because of the whiskey and arousal rather than fury. Because she had won, reduced that smug prick into a whining mess and all it took was ten minutes and her hand making indirect contact.</p><p>Not that Agatha ever gave without getting off herself, as soon as she got to her room she whipped off her clothes. Laying back on the bed and working that same hand between her own thighs, her cunt dripping from thoughts of the twenty-three year old. She plunged two fingers into herself wishing they were Rio, she fucked herself picturing Rio fucking her. Wondering what Rio would do and say, how she’d taste.</p><p>It took half the time to get herself off as it did Rio, arching her back off the bed with her eyes screwed shut as a single word spilled from her lips.</p><p>“<i>Rio!</i>”</p><p>She got in the shower immediately after and got ready for bed, falling asleep that night with a victory under her belt and the satisfaction that she’d most likely never see that woman ever again.</p><p>Yeah, that satisfaction didn’t last long.</p><p>It was around 9AM when Agatha sat down for the first panel of the second day, grabbing a seat in the last row of the lecture hall. She slung her cerulean winter coat in the chair next to her, unbuttoning her gingham blazer before sitting down and pushing her braid off her shoulder. She flipped through the pamphlet of the day's itinerary, glasses on her nose.<i>The Witches Road: fact or fiction?</i>Agatha quietly chuckled to herself, that road <i>does not</i> exist. It was an old wives tale based on a song that had been warped throughout the centuries.</p><p>“This seat taken?” The soft timber of a voice Agatha hadn’t anticipated hearing again hit her eardrums.</p><p>She peered up over the pamphlet. “Now where have I heard that one before?”</p><p>Rio smiled, moving her coat and flopping down next to her. “If you had a nickel?”</p><p>“Where’s the rest of the dumbasses? I seem to remember more of you yesterday.”</p><p>“Oh, they’re all sleeping off their hangovers.” Rio cocked her head. “Lucky for me, I had to tap out early last night so I got here bright and early this morning.”</p><p>“Yes…” Agatha hissed, “How are your pants? Have they cracked in half yet?”</p><p>“It's going to be interesting trying to fold them back into my suitcase, but oh so worth it.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, sighing as the speaker began the presentation.</p><p>The first forty-five minutes were fine if not slightly dull, until Rio shifted in her seat, grabbing Agatha’s long coat and placing it over their laps.</p><p>“Chilly in here, right?” She said as she adjusted it over Agatha’s hips.</p><p>“No.” Agatha scrunched her face.</p><p>“Weird.” Rio’s hand disappeared under the jacket, coming to splay on Agatha’s upper thigh. “I’m cold. You cold?”</p><p>Agatha sharply inhaled.</p><p><i>You cold?</i> Translated to <i>You game?</i></p><p>And she so fucking was.</p><p>Fine, she’d let the annoying PhD student finger her in the back of a lecture hall, at least it would make this presentation interesting.</p><p>“Freezing, actually.” Agatha turned her head toward the front of the room, placing her chin in her hand, pinky finger resting on her bottom lip.</p><p>Rio turned her head forward too, fingers deftly undoing the buckle of Agatha’s belt and the button of her trousers. Agatha held her breath, anticipation flooding her veins. She didn’t exactly have high hopes, it’d be a miracle if this twenty-three year old could actually make her come. Between the cockiness and the age, Agatha was almost certain Rio was too green to fuck her correctly.</p><p>Long fingers sheathed themselves beneath her pants, then the waistband of her underwear.</p><p>“Lace, huh?” Rio snarked, keeping her eyes on the speaker.</p><p>Agatha steeled her jaw. “I like to treat myself to nice things. You should be on your fuckin’ knees right now thanking god you get to know what kind of panties I wear.”</p><p>Rio’s nails dragged through her bush, sending shivers down her spine.</p><p>“Spread your legs.” She murmured.</p><p>“Fuck off.” Agatha snorted, primarily out of spite.</p><p>Rio casually leaned over, fingers curling and giving Agatha’s bush a harsh tug. “Spread. Your. Fucking. Legs.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth in a silent moan, the pain going straight to her clit. She slouched in her chair, lazily letting her thighs part.</p><p>And though she wasn’t looking at her, she could hear the smirk as Rio echoed a version of Agatha’s words last night. “<i>Good boy.</i>”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes nearly rolled back, but she fought it, bringing her pinky between her teeth as an outlet for her increasing frustration.</p><p>“Thought you’d like that one.” Rio spoke as her hand drifted further down, fingers cupping Agatha and stopping at the sensation of metal against the pad of her finger.</p><p>Agatha peeked through her peripheral, a razor sharp grin covering Rio’s face as she stuck her tongue against her cheek. Two fingers pinched the clit piercing that she’d gotten as a rebellious undergrad, quickly tugging that too and forcing Agatha to hold onto the arm of her chair with her free hand.</p><p>“Sensitive, baby?” Rio whispered though not directly to Agatha, her fingers dipping through Agatha’s lips and collecting the ever-growing amount slick before bringing it back up to her clit.</p><p>Agatha felt her neck and face go rosy with arousal, the vein in her forehead popping out as she struggled to stay silent. Her teeth had sunken further into her pinky, her bottom row baring down on the flesh.</p><p>“Fucking dripping for someone who doesn’t like me.” Rio said as she essentially toyed with Agatha’s clit in a public place.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to refute that statement, but the second she did so, Rio’s digits came to her entrance. Two fingers, only to the first knuckle. A tease at best.</p><p>“Fuck you.” Agatha settled for, tone hushed and hips canting as much as possible without drawing suspicion.</p><p>“I’d bet you’d love to.” Rio’s fingers sank to the second knuckle and Agatha almost keened. “Tell me, sweetheart, were your panties this soaked at the bar last night?”</p><p>“No more than yours.” She bit out, causing Rio to push until her fingers had bottomed out. The faintest whine left her throat, only audible unless sat right next to her.</p><p>Agatha involuntarily clenched around the first pump of the lithe digits, hearing Rio chuckle.</p><p>“What are you laughing at?” Agatha’s eyes fluttered at the way Rio’s fingers curled on the next return.</p><p>“Your needy cunt swallowing me.” She responded through deep, restrained strokes. “I can only imagine how you’d take something else.”</p><p>“<i>Mmhph.</i>” Agatha moaned around the nail of her pinky.</p><p>“I bet you’d be loud, right?”</p><p>She didn’t respond, the feeling of Rio’s palm resting against her clit was distracting her.</p><p>“And greedy.” Rio added, the way she was rubbing at her piercing was too good and Agatha didn’t trust herself not to moan aloud during this presentation.</p><p>“Shit, you’d probably fucking ache for it. Me inside you, feeling me stretch you. Ruin you.”</p><p>The pace Rio had set was nowhere near as brutal as Agatha would have liked, but the outside stimuli was drawing her closer and closer to her peak.</p><p>“And god,” Rio sighed. “I can only imagine how’d you feel with your mouth on me, I’d make you choke on it, love.”</p><p>She suddenly found her mouth watering at the image. Rio’s <i>MORS</i> hand fisted in her hair, pulling her closer while her mouth eagerly awaited its reward.</p><p>“Or–” Rio casually ascertained, digits dragging along her walls again and again. “I could always eat you out ‘til your legs shake. Leave you a pathetic mess.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath was ragged by this point, her lungs burning from holding her breath just so she didn’t miss a single word Rio was saying.</p><p>“You could use my mouth to get yourself off, I’m sure it does a better job than your own hand.”</p><p>Yeah, Agatha was sure of it too as she fluttered around Rio’s fingers.</p><p>“You’re leaking for me, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p>She needed to get out and go back to the hotel and change immediately after this, because this pair of underwear had also been fucking ruined by the same student.</p><p>Rio turned her head, as if to comment on something the lecturer just said. “Now who’s desperate?”</p><p>Rio applied more pressure to her clit and Agatha’s back bowed off the back of her chair.</p><p>“Aww,” She tsk’d an inch or two from Agatha’s ear. “The scary doctor turns into a whimpering whore with a couple of fingers up her cunt?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers wrapped around the arm of her chair in a white-knuckle grip, her eyes momentarily closing as her pussy clamped around Rio’s fingers. Her clit pulsed in sync, causing her whole body to go static as she came.</p><p>Agatha felt the sweat on the nape of her neck as she damn near bit off the tip of her pinky as though it were a carrot. The overwhelming pleasure unable to bubble up from her throat.</p><p>Rio turned her attention back to the presentation, her fingers stilling and staying there as Agatha pulsed. Even once the shockwaves had subsided, Rio’s hand didn’t retract. She stayed there, purposely keeping Agatha sensitive and twitching around her. She wouldn’t put it past the smug fucker to try for another orgasm.</p><p>But Rio didn’t thrust again, content to keep her fingers warm and wet, safely nestled inside Agatha’s cunt. It was when the lecturer concluded her presentation, asking if anyone had questions. Rio slipped out of her, out of her pants, and shot her hand up in the air. Agatha could literally see her own slick coating Rio’s middle and ring finger, and she prayed to god the speaker couldn’t.</p><p>“Yes, you in the back.” She smiled.</p><p>Rio smiled back, immediately pointing to Agatha. “Yeah, I think Dr. Harkness had one.”</p><p>The professor's eyes shifted to look at Agatha expectantly. “Yes?”</p><p>And Agatha, brain still fuzzy with oxytocin, cleared her throat. She’d find a way to make Rio fucking pay for that one. She caught her breath as she recycled her question.</p><p>“What was the inspiration behind the research?” Her voice wavered as she tried to project from the back of the hall.</p><p>Rio snickered next to her, waiting until the professor had her back turned to show something on the monitor up front. When she knew she was in the clear, she looked to Agatha before popping those same shiny fingers in her mouth, moaning quietly at the taste.</p><p>“You’re delicious, cariño.”</p><p>Fuck, she was not expecting the Spanish. Especially how it rolled so perfectly off Rio’s tongue.</p><p>“I know.” Agatha zipped her fly and redid the buckle of her belt, storming off as soon as the lecture had concluded. Her legs still tingled as she stampeded down the hall of the conference center, not giving Rio another look or word as she did so.</p><p>Sure, she could’ve said bye as a courtesy, but she needed to get out of here. A twenty-three year old calling her ‘good boy’ knuckle deep? And her getting off to it?  Agatha needed to spiral in solitude. Because now Rio had the fucking upperhand again, and even worse, Agatha couldn’t wait to get it back.</p><p>Her thoughts were muddled with the fantasies of Rio fucking her, like <i>really</i> fucking her. No more of these public quickies. Somewhere with a bed, where she could throw around that insufferable pain in the ass.</p><p>Shit, she should’ve packed her strap-on, then she could be Rio’s pain in the ass. She subconsciously bit her lip at the idea of Rio naked on the bed, back arching as Agatha fucked her from behind.</p><p>Agatha made it back to her hotel room in record time, quite literally peeling her underwear from herself. A thin, glistening string of slick connecting the fabric of the gusset to her pussy before finally snapping.</p><p>She told her colleagues that the complimentary hotel breakfast gave her food poisoning before spending the rest of the day barricaded in her room. Once changed, she dumped out her satchel onto the bed, pawing through the clutter to reach her laptop. As she did so, batting away crumpled old papers and empty tubes of chapstick, her fingers grazed a small rectangle.</p><p>She flipped it over–</p><p>The Polaroid from the bar.</p><p>Rio must’ve slipped it into her bag when she wasn’t looking.</p><p>Her thumb ran over the glossy coating of the photograph.</p><p>Copper eyes, crooked grin, smile lines already forming.</p><p>Agatha stared for a beat before dropping it into the wastebasket next to the desk.</p><p>Metaphorically and literally discarding the woman.</p><p>She sat down, cracking open her laptop and responding to emails in the hopes of distracting herself.</p><p>The third and final day in Copenhagen, after another day of presentations and no run-ins with Rio, Agatha got ready for the conference dinner. She opted for a tailored maroon suit, simple white top beneath, tasteful gold chain resting at the hollow of her throat. Her hair was down in all its glory, something she reserved for special occasions. She slipped on her leather loafers, giving herself a once-over before making her way to the waterfront restaurant, <i>Alchemist</i>.</p><p>She wouldn’t be partaking in the food, seeing as it was banquet style and she could not afford to get actual food poisoning before hopping a trans-atlantic flight tomorrow morning. Agatha ordered an old-fashioned and made the mind-numbing polite chitchat that her peers thought necessary.</p><p>She didn’t listen as the room, primarily men, all exhaled hot air on wasted words. Her eyes roamed the room in the hopes of finding someone, literally anyone–</p><p>“Old fashioned?” Rio asked from behind her.</p><p>She turned, immediately dropping her sights on Rio’s appearance.</p><p>Black trousers, boots, a matching little gay vest that covered anything that academia deemed taboo. But there was nothing underneath and Agatha's eyes went wide as she took in Rio’s arms for the first time.</p><p>The woman had tattoos, not just on her knuckles, but half sleeves that cut off at her elbow. All black and white, all shaded, all flowers or vines or foliage. And the muscles under the ink? Toned.</p><p>Shit, that was not fair because now Agatha wanted to bite those biceps.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha almost squeaked.</p><p>“Your drink.” Rio spoke to Agatha, but her eyes were roving over Agatha’s body before landing on her face. “Your hair…”</p><p>Agatha lifted a hand to her locks, suddenly self-conscious. “Yeah? So what?”</p><p>“No, it’s just–” She appeared to be struggling to verbalize her thoughts. “I’ve never seen it, like, fully down. Looks good.”</p><p>“Oh. Okay, thanks.”</p><p>Rio lifted that asinine polaroid camera slung around her neck. “Picture?”</p><p>“What is your obsession with this?” Agatha tilted her head. “Trying to prove how deep you are? How you wax poetic prose about life and love?”</p><p>“I just like the physical reminders of memories.” She shrugged. “Means something. To have it be tangible.”</p><p>“How romantic.” Agatha snorted.</p><p>“I find it a form of intimacy to share that with someone. A memory to keep.”</p><p>“Fuck, you’re so gay.”</p><p>“And water is wet.” Rio held up the camera. “Humor me?”</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>“I don’t have one yet, I gave you the pic from the pub. Let me have something to remember you by.”</p><p>Well, when she put it like that…</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha conceded, fixing her suit jacket and fussing with her hair.</p><p>“You look hot.” Rio assured. “Seriously, you look very handsome.”</p><p>That was too genuine, too sincere.</p><p>“Shut up.” Agatha exhaled, getting closer so Rio could take the damn thing.</p><p>Rio raised her arm, positioning it a little ways above them and clicked the shutter. Momentarily blinding Agatha yet again.</p><p>The younger woman held out her hand as the photo exited the mouth of the camera. Keeping a hand over it to aid in its development.</p><p>“You have to flick it back and forth, it helps.” Agatha spoke, flicking her wrist and mimicking the motion.</p><p>“That’s a myth. It actually hurts the photo.”</p><p>“It is not a myth.”</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>“I literally lived through Polaroids, the original. It helps.”</p><p>“Good for you, doesn’t make it true.”</p><p>“Unbelievable.”</p><p>“Want me to Google it?”</p><p>“Yeah, I really fucking do.”</p><p>Rio whipped out her phone, thumbs typing. The screen buffered before the answer appeared, Rio reading it aloud.</p><p>“Shaking or waving a Polaroid photo does not help it develop faster and can damage the image.” Rio proudly said, quirking an eyebrow as she looked at Agatha. “How’s that for citations?”</p><p>“Yeah ‘cause Google is such a reputable source.” Agatha’s gaze focused past Rio, to the man currently headed to them. “Oh, fuck me.”</p><p>Rio’s posture stiffened. “I’d be happy to, but I don’t think I’ve ever gotten laid from a Google search before.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha rolled her shoulders back, preparing for battle. “The guy heading this way. I work with him at U-Mass, total fucking dickhead. I’d suckerpunch him if it wouldn’t cost me my job.”</p><p>“Why's he a dickhead?"</p><p>“You’ll see.”</p><p>“Agatha.” His tone dripped in false niceties. “I haven’t seen you all weekend.”</p><p>“John.” Agatha greeted in the fakest tone she could muster. “Rio, this is Professor Walker. John, this is Rio, PhD student.”</p><p>He held out a hand to Rio. “Good to see more women in the room. Too many prioritize frivolous pursuits rather than taking the time to educate themselves. We gave you guys the right for a reason.” John chuckled like the douchebag he was. “The ladies just have a gentler disposition it seems.”</p><p>Nothing about the way John spoke made Agatha <i>feel</i> gentle.</p><p>Rio didn’t take his hand, her voice cold. “Yeah, you men were so kind to take pity on us helpless women with that one.”</p><p>Agatha smirked against her better judgement. “Enjoying yourself?”</p><p>He didn’t pick up on Rio’s sarcasm, just let his hand drop. “I am. I’ve been so busy running around, I haven’t even congratulated you on landing tenure.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha kept her reply curt, hoping he got the hint.</p><p>“I mean,” He raised his hands, feigning surrender. “I don’t know how you manage to get so many of your works published.”</p><p>“Hard work and dedication?” Rio sardonically questioned. “Just a thought.”</p><p>“Is that what we’re calling it now?” He cocked his head.</p><p>“Calling what?” Agatha raised her eyebrows, waiting for what she already knew was coming.</p><p>It most unfortunately came with the territory of being a successful woman in academia. Men assuming that because someone was a woman, she must’ve used her ‘feminine wiles’ to gain notoriety rather than her feeble, hormone-addled mind. Because that was just too foreign of a concept for their pea brains to understand.</p><p>He dropped his hands, putting them in his pockets like he wasn’t about to say what he was going to say. “Trading ‘favors’?”</p><p>Agatha fisted her hand, resisting the urge. “Don’t know what you mean.”</p><p>“Hey,” He soothed in the most condescending way possible. “No shame, whatever gets you ‘ahead’, right? Who’s to say I wouldn’t give it a go if I thought it’d work.”</p><p>Agatha sighed as her blood pressure spiked, jaw clenched at his stupid little pun. “It’s 2020. Nobody is stopping you from sucking a dick, John.”</p><p>“Professor Walker?” Rio’s voice was sweet as honey, playing dumb. “Would you mind speaking to me for a moment? Alone maybe? It’d be great to pick your brain and have you walk me through a few things. My thesis paper is just so <i>hard</i> and I get so confused."</p><p>He grinned. “Of course.”</p><p>Agatha watched in horror as he placed a hand on the small of Rio’s back and began walking away with her.</p><p>She knocked back her drink, slamming the empty glass on the counter. Whatever Rio was about to do to that man was worrying. Because John thought he was possibly about to get laid and Rio just…let him assume so? Encouraged it, even?</p><p>She was just about to order another drink when a hand shot out of nowhere, grabbing hers and pulling. She was dragged through the restaurant, noticing the hand belonged to Rio, <i>MORS</i> now bloody and split open. She didn’t stop until they were outside, the chilled night air engulfing them as they padded through the street. The fog misting from the waterfront, the smooth ebb and flow of the water drowning Agatha’s ears.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha made her body dead weight, tugging Rio’s body to hers. “What the fuck?”</p><p>“Oh,” She grinned wolfishly. “We had to get out of there.”</p><p>Agatha flickered her eyes to Rio’s hand, which she was still holding. “Why?”</p><p>Rio held up their interlocked fingers, blood now seeping out of her knuckles. “I punched that dude.”</p><p>And yeah, Agatha got that much. “Why the fuck would you do that?!”</p><p>“I didn’t appreciate the way he spoke to you.” She shrugged. “And I don’t work for U-Mass.”</p><p>“He could still report you to the fucking people in charge. Get you in trouble.”</p><p>“He doesn’t know where I live or study. He doesn’t know my last name, or my first for that matter, Rio is a nickname.”</p><p>Agatha let go of Rio’s hand, crossing her arms for warmth. “My jacket was in there.”</p><p>“My hotel is less than a block from here.” Rio pointed down the street. “If you wanna warm yourself up.”</p><p>“You think I’m going to sleep with you just because you punched someone for me?”</p><p>Rio’s face dropped in fear. “No– Agatha, I swear that's not what I was–”</p><p>She fisted a hand into Rio’s vest, tugging her into Agatha’s space. “Baby, <i>I am absolutely</i> going to sleep with you for punching someone for me.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Yes, really, she needed Rio inside of her as soon as possible.</p><p><i>All of Rio</i>.</p><p>Agatha grabbed Rio’s wrist, keeping eye contact as she dragged her tongue along the injured knuckles. Letting out a hum of approval at the metallic taste of the younger woman’s blood. Rio’s lips parted in awe, a soft moan being released.</p><p>She started leading Rio by the grasp she had on her. “C’mon, pretty girl.”</p><p>“<i>Fuck me.</i>” Rio whispered, gate already thrown off from a semi hard-on as she let Agatha pull her.</p><p>“That’s the idea, darling.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The walk was short, the longest Agatha had to wait was when they reached Rio’s door, the student fumbling with her keycard for far longer than Agatha’s patience could withstand.</p><p>“Here.” Agatha nudged her out of the way, swiping the card and gaining entry on the first try.</p><p>“I loosened it for you.”</p><p>“It’s not a pickle jar.” Agatha yanked on Rio’s vest again, pulling her into the room before slamming Rio’s back against the door and making it close the rest of the way.</p><p>Rio gasped for the breath that was knocked out of her as Agatha dropped to her knees, deciding not to waste time on pleasantries when she could see the clear outline of Rio’s cock straining against her pants. The younger woman unwound the camera from her neck, tossing it onto a chair nearby.</p><p>Agatha’s hand flew to the zipper of Rio’s trousers when hands grabbed her wrists, stopping her. Agatha peered up in confusion, being met with a shit-eating grin.</p><p>“You’re that eager to suck my cock?” Rio husked.</p><p>Fucking duh.</p><p>“You heard it yourself, I’m a big fan of <em>hard work and dedication</em>.”</p><p>“That guy was a prick.”</p><p>“Told you so.” Agatha’s eyes flickered back to the bulge that was currently level with her face. “Now, you gonna let me thank you…?”</p><p>“Ask nicely.”</p><p>Fuck, Agatha knew that’d line at the bar would come back to bite her. And though she was not usually the type to beg for pleasure that was not her own, or the type to let a twenty-three year old be in charge of her, Agatha couldn’t ignore the saliva pooling in her mouth at the prospect of getting to taste Rio.</p><p>“Please?” Agatha whispered, placing a kiss to Rio, feeling the resulting twitch against her lips.</p><p>Rio let go of her wrists, instead threading through Agatha’s hair. “Please, what?”</p><p>One beg and the power had gone to Rio’s head, of course.</p><p>“Please let me suck your cock.” Agatha’s fingers undid the button and fly of the trousers.</p><p>Rio’s pupils dilated further, chest heaving. “Good boy.”</p><p>That term was going to be the death of her. It made her head spin and go fuzzy in the most delicious way.</p><p>She clenched her thighs together at the praise, pressing her lips to the length through Rio’s briefs where a spot was already wet with precum.</p><p>“Go on, mi cielo.” Her fingers scrunching at the root and guiding Agatha closer to her prize.</p><p>Agatha hooked her fingers into the waistband of Rio’s briefs, working the fabric down over her hips until her cock sprung free. Her eyes went wide at the full view, erect and shiny at the tip. Her jaw dropped, more so out of shock than anything else.</p><p>Rio noticed her reaction. “Yeah, I’m a little–”</p><p>“Massive?” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>It wasn’t just the length, it was everything. The girth alone would give Priapus a run for his money.</p><p>“Or so I’ve been told.”</p><p>“It’s a missile, Rio.”</p><p>“It’s only like seven-ish inches.”</p><p>“<em>Only?</em>” Agatha rapidly blinked, drool gathering in the back of her mouth. “You’ve measured?”</p><p>“Being on estrogen can make it atrophy if I don’t…take care of it regularly. I measure just to make sure I’m good.”</p><p>“You jacking off on a constant basis doesn’t surprise me.” Agatha let her hand wander to the base of Rio’s shaft, and fuck, her fingers almost didn’t close around it. “Seriously, you should have to register this thing with homeland security.”</p><p>Rio blushed. “You flatter me.”</p><p>She wasn’t trying to be complimentary, her brain was just struggling to conceptualize Godzilla’s third leg staring her in the face.</p><p>“Don’t get used to it.”</p><p>“I actually got a nickname in undergrad for it, my friends still use it. It’s–”</p><p>“That won’t be necessary.” Agatha’s hand briefly left, only to spit into her palm before returning and stroking the length. “I don’t need to know how they called you ‘beer can’ or some shit.”</p><p>“Beer can?”</p><p>“Like the Tallboys.”</p><p>“Tallboy?”</p><p>“Fuck, you’re young.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio gently tugged on Agatha’s mane. “Time to put your mouth to better use.”</p><p>Agatha would make her pay for that later, but for now, her mouth fell open, tongue flat as just the tip entered. She involuntarily moaned at the sweet taste of Rio, a hint of salt from the pre-cum.</p><p>“<em>Ohhhh.</em>” Rio let her head fall back against the door, but kept her eyes trained on Agatha. “Knew you’d look good with my dick in your mouth.”</p><p>Agatha relaxed her throat as she let her jaw slacken, taking more into her mouth. Her hands came to rest on Rio’s thighs, using them as leverage as she began bobbing her head, letting Rio go deeper on each return.</p><p>“Eso es todo, guapo.” Rio’s hands didn’t push, but they guide as her hips stayed stationary. “That’s it.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back, spit pooling in the corners of her mouth. “Move your hips.”</p><p>“I don’t want to hurt you.”</p><p>Agatha lazily swirled her tongue around the head of Rio’s cock. “I’m asking you to.” Before parting her lips and taking as much as possible back into mouth. She let the tip brush her soft palette and forced a gag as encouragement.</p><p>“Shit.” Rio’s hips bucked, causing Agatha to gag once more. “That what you want, hm? Want me to fuck your throat like the whore you are? Wanna choke around my cock?”</p><p>Agatha whined in approval, her throat straining at the intrusion. Yeah her voice would be fucked tomorrow, but it was so fucking worth it.</p><p>The younger woman’s hips snapped, simultaneously pulling Agatha by the grip in her hair. “You look handsome on your knees. Eyes watering because you can’t fit it all in your mouth.”</p><p>Agatha’s clit throbbed, aching to be touched. She needed to be filled, she needed to hold Rio down and fuck her with reckless abandon.</p><p>Drool started running down her chin as Rio used her mouth to get off. “You love this don’t you? Love my cock.”</p><p>She hummed around her dick, her fingers scrunching in the fabric of Rio’s pants.</p><p>“Be good for me and maybe I’ll let you feel it in your ass.”</p><p>She sputtered for a moment, not because of how big Rio was, but because she suddenly needed nothing more than to feel that.</p><p>“Shit, baby…?” Rio started to pull back when Agatha chased her, silently communicating she was fine.</p><p>Agatha sucked harder, snaking her hands up and pinning Rio’s hips back against the door, taking control of this since Rio was taking too long for her liking. She bobbed her head faster, tracking Rio’s facial expressions as she did so.</p><p>“Oh dios,” Rio moaned, breath short and shallow. “Mierda, Agatha–”</p><p>She didn’t stop. Not as she felt Rio’s cock pulse, not as she felt it begin to twitch. Agatha only redoubled her efforts, the weight sliding backing and forth down her throat.</p><p>“I’m gonna come, I’m gonna–” Rio said as a warning, as if she assumed that Agatha wouldn’t want it.</p><p>Agatha didn’t let her pull back again, giving Rio a wink as she finally came in her mouth. White ropes of cum hitting her tastebuds, coating her tongue, her eyes fluttering closed to savor the taste. Rio’s body went slack as Agatha kept going just a while longer, milking whatever she could get.</p><p>Rio heaved, attempting to regulate her breathing. “Swallow, querida.”</p><p>Agatha kept her mouth in a tight, closed mouth smile as she stood. She snaked her hands over Rio's collarbones and neck, mimicking a swallow and pulling her in for a kiss.</p><p>Their first kiss, now that she thought about it.</p><p>Which made what she was about to do all the more satisfying, pressing her lips to Rio’s ferociously. The younger woman returned it, pawing at Agatha’s blazer and trying to get it off. Agatha chuckled as Rio opened her mouth, tongue darting out to run along Agatha’s bottom lip. She granted Rio access, letting her tongue slip against Agatha’s and subsequently collecting her own cum, still warm.</p><p>Rio whined in realization, Agatha moving her own tongue to transfer it into Rio’s mouth. She kept Rio’s head stationary, hands threading into her hair as her jaw worked. Once it had all been pushed into the younger woman’s eager mouth, Agatha’s hand slid down to her throat. Her fingers rest against the thrumming pulse.</p><p>Agatha victoriously grinned, parroting Rio’s words. “Swallow.”</p><p>And Rio did, Agatha felt it through the hand she had wrapped around the student’s neck.</p><p>“Open.” She ordered.</p><p>Rio obediently opened her mouth, tongue out as Agatha checked that it was all gone.</p><p>“Good girl.” She rasped, using her hold on Rio’s neck to guide her to the bed.</p><p>Agatha began to push her down, when Rio’s body resisted, staying upright. “Wait.”</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Agatha dropped her hand.</p><p>“Nothing, nothing.” Rio quickly assured, moving to her suitcase in the corner of the room. “Just need to grab a condom.”</p><p>Agatha snorted before melting into full-blown hysteria. “Baby, I appreciate the thought. But I’m forty-one, well almost.”</p><p>Rio grabbed the box, placing it between her teeth as she began unbuttoning her vest. “Hot.”</p><p>Agatha whipped off her blazer, languidly lying back on the mattress. “Got about five years ‘til pre-menopause. Real hot.”</p><p>Rio yanked off her pants and underwear, leaving her completely naked.</p><p>Mother of fuck, her body was better than what Agatha had imagined.</p><p>She let her teeth release the box of XL condoms, catching them in her hand. “The E makes the chance of getting someone pregnant pretty low, but I’ve always used one so I just figured…”</p><p>“You’ve never come inside someone before?” Agatha’s eyebrows shot up. “Shit, if I had had a dick I’d be fucking raw nonstop.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s a good thing you don’t have one, then.” Rio opened the condom, beginning to roll it on. “Have you ever had someone come inside you before?”</p><p>No.</p><p>But Rio didn’t need to know that.</p><p>“How are you still hard?”</p><p>“I’m twenty-three.”</p><p>“Stop fucking reminding me of that.” She groaned. “I’m robbing the cradle.”</p><p>“I’m almost twenty-four.” Rio attempted to placate. “Wait, you said you’re almost forty-one. When’s your birthday?”</p><p>“In a few days, on the first.”</p><p>“No way, mine’s the twenty-ninth! I’m a leap year baby.”</p><p>“Whoa!” Agatha gasped in faux shock. “Can you fuck me now?”</p><p>Rio placed the box on the nightstand before reaching Agatha on the bed. “You’re still dressed.”</p><p>“Yeah, thought I’d make you do the work.”</p><p>She chuckled, hands coming to rest on Agatha's thighs and gently sliding upwards. “Am I going to be doing a lot of the work tonight?”</p><p>“If you’re lucky.” Agatha’s lips curled upwards. “If you beg.”</p><p>“You want me to beg to fuck you?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes zeroed in, dissecting the woman in front of her. “Like you don’t get off on the thought of begging to feel my pussy stretching around you. Hell, we both know you’re desperate just to see it.”</p><p>Rio gulped. “Y-yeah, I am.”</p><p>“It’s gorgeous.” Agatha raised her hips so Rio could undo and pull off her pants. “And my tits…mmh, they’re my best feature.”</p><p>Rio discarded the fabric before going for Agatha’s shirt. “No, your best feature is your nose. Looks like it was conjured by the Roman gods. Like something carved from ivory.”</p><p>Agatha felt herself flush at the sincerity in Rio’s tone.</p><p>“And there’s the waxing of poetry…”</p><p>Rio’s mouth landed on her neck, kissing along the skin as her thumbs hooked into the lace of her underwear. “Fuck, and your body. I wish I could lick every inch of it.”</p><p>“Different perverted fantasy for a different time, sweetheart.” Agatha pulled at the cotton of her bralette and threw it into the growing pile of clothes on the floor.</p><p>She expected for Rio to have pulled her panties down by now but instead, her thumbs just stayed in the waistband. Her mouth continuing its journey down her sternum and pausing to nip and suck at her tits, occasionally wrapping her lips around one of Agatha’s nipples and biting. The one not being lavished, was being palmed with the hand not teasing her underwear.</p><p>When she felt that hand, the non-injured one, starting to delve further. She fisted her hand at the nape of Rio’s neck, harshly snapping the woman’s head back. “Beg.”</p><p>Rio let a pathetic whimper escape, eyes rolling back at the tension from Agatha’s fingers knotted in her hair. “Please, por favor–”</p><p>“Please, what?” Agatha kept her tone cold, a stark contrast to the way her whole body felt smoldering.</p><p>“Please, <em>sir</em>.” Rio’s voice cracked as Agatha pulled harder. “Please let me fuck you, sir.”</p><p>“Three fingers.” She demanded, gaze venomous. “Need to get me ready.”</p><p>Rio laughed through desperate whines. “It’s not that big, love.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha quirked a brow. “It might as well be the fucking plane that hit the second tower.”</p><p>“What can I say? I’m a huge fan of bush.”</p><p>“Prove it.”</p><p>Rio placed one hand on the bed for stability, the other drifting underneath the lace. Her fingers brush through the hair, already sticky. “You’re soaked.”</p><p>Agatha arched into the touch, refusing to make a sound yet. “What’d you expect?”</p><p>Rio’s fingers grazed over her clit before running through slick folds. “God dammit.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Rio’s hand twitched as her face scrunched. “It’s my non-dominant hand. I can’t–”</p><p>“You can’t fuck me?”</p><p>Rio nearly growled in frustration, ripping her hand out and switching it for the one that was on the bed. Shoving the bloody and bruised hand into her underwear, gathering Agatha’s arousal and sinking two, then three fingers in.</p><p>“Fuuuuck–” Agatha hissed, the stretch making her feel momentarily woozy.</p><p>“Good?”</p><p>“S-so good.” Agatha grabbed onto the muscles of Rio’s back, nails unapologetically biting into the skin. “Such a good girl for me.”</p><p>Rio started pumping, ignoring the obvious pain her hand was in, pupils eating away the amber of her iris. A small whimper came from the back of her throat as she leaned down to kiss Agatha, this time unsullied by Agatha vying for control. Rio seemed more than content to serve, to obey. And Agatha couldn’t fucking wait to see just how compliant she’d be.</p><p>“You feel amazing.” Rio husked against her lips.</p><p>“Now imagine how I’d feel around your cock.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes almost rolled back in her skull, boner pressed against Agatha’s thigh as her fingers worked.</p><p>Agatha purposely squeezed her kegel muscles, letting out a dry chuckle at Rio’s resulting moan. “God, such a slut, you’re nearly busting at your fingers inside of me.”</p><p>“Yeah.” She dumbly agreed, the degradation only propelling her fingers faster and deeper.</p><p>A moan rang out through the otherwise quiet room, one from Agatha as Rio’s fingers curled and hit her g-spot. “You like when I mean to you, hon?”</p><p>“I fucking love it.”</p><p>“Shit,” Her thighs tensed as Rio’s thumb began to play with her clit piercing, basically a cheat code to get Agatha to come at breakneck speed. “You weren’t lying when you said you’re pathetic, huh?”</p><p>“N-no.”</p><p>“Careful, don’t want to waste a condom before you’ve even properly fucked me.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Do you think you’ll even last more than a few pumps?”</p><p>“Agatha…” The younger woman buried her face in Agatha’s neck, panting as if she were the one on the brink of orgasm.</p><p>Maybe she was.</p><p>“Uh-uh.” She threaded her hand through Rio’s hair, snapping her head back and forcing her to look at Agatha. “I want you to look at me when I speak to you, do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio’s hand never stopped, but it did falter as Agatha pulled her locks again.</p><p>“A simple tug and you’re down for the count?” Her voice was becoming breathy as her blood overheated, her body growing rigid in anticipation.</p><p>“Please, I can’t–” Rio tried. “I need to be inside of you.”</p><p>“You are.”</p><p>“No, like, <em>really</em> inside of you.”</p><p>“Then prove you’re not useless and make me come.”</p><p>Not that it would be hard, Agatha was already on the precipice. But it’s no fun if Rio didn’t at least try and earn it.</p><p>Rio moved with renewed energy, her fingers rubbing at her g-spot while her thumb moved faster on her clit.</p><p>“Jesus, fuck!” Agatha yelled as her back bowed off the mattress, hand all but ripping out Rio’s hair. Not that the younger woman seemed to mind, her eyes trained on Agatha.</p><p>The thread holding her together snapped. Her walls contracted around Rio as her chest went red, coating the constellation of freckles in crimson. Her airflow stuttered and her eyes went screw shut.</p><p>Rio held her through it, much too tenderly for her liking.</p><p>The way those brown orbs peered down at her made something flutter in her chest, which was insane because she should not be having that reaction to a twenty-three year old she's known for three days looking at her while three fingers deep.</p><p>“Good?” Rio’s voice had an inkling of hope, her lips curling upwards.</p><p>“Depends,” Agatha spoke once she’d gotten her bearings again. “Did you waste that condom?”</p><p>“No, sir.”</p><p>Agatha bared her teeth in something akin to a smile. “Good girl.”</p><p>Rio’s hand easily slipped out, inspecting the drenched digits before popping them into her mouth and moaning. Agatha took hold of her wrist and pushed, causing Rio to gag. She didn’t stop, she kept pushing until Rio choked and sputtered.</p><p>“If only I had my strap, then I could really see how pitiful you are.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes scrunched, seeking approval as she let Agatha keep her own fingers at the back of her throat.</p><p>“I’d train you to take it all. Make you fall to your knees like an eager whore at the snap of my fingers.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers were now beginning to drip with spit, each gag sounded like a symphony to Agatha.</p><p>“But I’d bet you’d like that, right? Bet you’d love to be my own personal fucktoy.”</p><p>At the next gag, the one where Rio’s eyes watered, Agatha preened. “Oh, and you’re such a pretty crier.”</p><p>Rio mewled, making no effort to stop or pull away.</p><p>“C’mon baby, let a few fall for me.”</p><p>Rio rapidly blinked, letting the tears streak down her face.</p><p>Agatha stretched upwards, darting her tongue out and gently lapping up the saltwater. “Mmmh. Delicious.”</p><p>One final heave and Agatha let go of Rio’s wrist, letting her fingers go slack and fall from her mouth. Rio let out a few harsh breaths, gulping down new air. As she did so, Agatha shoved her onto her back and climbed on top of the younger woman.</p><p>“Now, I think you deserve a reward, don't you?”</p><p>“Please.” Her voice now hoarse from essentially deepthroating her own fingers. “Please, Agatha.”</p><p>“I didn’t even make you beg that time, you’re just that desperate.” She faux pouted, voice laced with disingenuous sympathy. “My poor girl.”</p><p>Every insult, every snipe, every dig only seemed to turn Rio on more.</p><p>Agatha degradations were a soothing balm to whatever masochistic kink the student had.</p><p>She languidly grabbed at Rio’s cock, rock hard and already throbbing. She chuckled to herself, knowing Rio wouldn’t last.</p><p>She slid her underwear to the side, lined herself up with the tip, and began to lower herself down. “Oh, oh g-god.”</p><p>And yes, she’d felt Rio in her hand and mouth but now that she was sinking down inch by inch, Rio felt <em>so</em> much bigger. Her cock might as well have been that gargantuan bronze statue of Helios in, ironically enough, Rhodes, Greece. Honestly fitting, that was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world and Rio’s dick was one of the seven of the modern.</p><p>Not that she’d verbalize it.</p><p>Agatha had gotten down three inches before hovering for a beat.</p><p>“It’s o-okay if you can’t take it all. It’s happened before.” Rio’s hand came to rest on her hip.</p><p>Agatha leaned over, fingers coiling around Rio’s neck and lightly squeezing. “Don’t insult me. I’m going to take every inch of you and you won’t be able to stop yourself from watching.”</p><p>Rio brought one of her hands to the one Agatha had choking her, applying more pressure as her eyes lidded and her lips formed a grin.</p><p>“Yessir.” She slurred as Agatha’s hand constricted.</p><p>Agatha let herself sink further, the mix of pleasure and a hint of pain from the stretch was intoxicating. When she had finally bottomed out, she let out a few broken breaths. The tip brushing her cervix meant as soon as she started moving, it’d hit every single time.</p><p>She experimentally clenched, using her free hand to pin down Rio’s forearm. The younger woman still had one free, holding onto the handle of her hip like a lifeline.</p><p>“Hijo de puta.” Rio whined, eyes fighting to stay open as Agatha had ordered.</p><p>“That’s not nice.” Agatha scolded, rolling her hips as she did so. And fuck, she was right, the head of Rio’s dick dragged along her cervix <em>perfectly</em>.</p><p>“Agatha–”</p><p>“Apologize.”</p><p>“Sorry, ‘M sorry.”</p><p>“Better.” She praised, lifting herself before sinking back down. There was a bead of sweat forming at Rio’s hairline, she was straining against herself not to come. The knuckles at Agatha’s hip were white, nails digging into the skin enough to bruise.</p><p>Agatha picked up her speed, basking in the way Rio watched with intent. Trying to sear the image of Agatha riding her into the back of her eyelids. Just hoping to catch a glimpse every time she blinked.</p><p>“I can’t.” Rio choked out, “I-I-” Before her hips bucked upwards, spearing Agatha completely.</p><p>“<em>Fuuuuuck.</em>” Agatha swore she could feel Rio in her stomach, her mouth opening and closing rapidly, processing.</p><p>Rio on the other hand, couldn’t stop twitching, coming in under two minutes. “Sorry.”</p><p>“You flatter me.” Agatha echoed Rio’s earlier statement. “It’s sweet even.”</p><p>Rio somehow didn’t go soft, still hard inside her cunt. “Yeah?”</p><p>And call it a moment of weakness, but the younger woman was eager to please, and contrary to popular belief, Agatha wasn’t heartless.</p><p>She let her hand drift from her neck to cup her cheek, a soft smile across her features. “Yeah.”</p><p>Something flickered behind Rio’s eyes, a fire being reignited. “Okay, fuck this.”</p><p>Rio’s hands bolted to Agatha’s underwear and yanked, the lace tearing clean off and allowing her to rip the fabric from Agatha’s body. Her arms, which felt like fucking steel, wrapped around her. She flipped them over so that Agatha was on her back.</p><p>“Next time I come, it’s from fucking you properly.” Rio snarled, diving teeth first to Agatha’s tits as she thrust her hips, barely giving time for Agatha to adjust.</p><p>“<em>Rio!</em>”</p><p>Her mouth was busy nipping and sucking along the expanse of Agatha’s chest, mumbling something similar to, “Keep screaming my name, baby. Gets me real fuckin’ hard.”</p><p>Agatha would’ve rolled her eyes if she had the wherewithal, Rio was already real fucking hard.</p><p>The way Rio was driving into her, like a rabid animal in heat, was going to kill Agatha. <em>Here lies Agatha Harkness, dead from a twenty-three year old’s dick that apparently never went flaccid ever</em> would be on her tombstone.</p><p>And she couldn’t think of a better way to go if she was being honest with herself.</p><p>She locked her legs around Rio’s back, clawing at her shoulder blades since it was the only way to get back at her for the hickies she was no doubt leaving.</p><p>“R-Rio.” She moaned, and she was correct. Her cervix would be sore tomorrow, that much she was sure of.</p><p>Rio’s head remained buried in her tits, teeth grazing her nipple, the other being pinched by her fingers.</p><p>“Greedy girl.” Agatha husked, clinging onto her for dear life.</p><p>“You’re so fucking perfect.” Rio uttered, taking a minimal breath before turning her attention to the breast she hadn't yet lavished.</p><p>Rio’s pace was brutal, the only noise in the room being lewd noises of skin slapping and filthy moans.</p><p>“So fuckin’ tight.” Rio praised, peering up at Agatha for a beat. “Take me so well, feel fuckin’ amazing around my cock.”</p><p>Agatha’s wall fluttered, involuntarily canting her hips to give Rio more of her. And she was aware control was slipping, but it took a backseat to how sinfully full she felt.</p><p>When her back arched, Rio slid her arm underneath, pulling Agatha flush with her. Their tits pressed against one another, Rio’s abs grazing her stomach. Everything about the way Rio fucked her felt carnal.</p><p>Feral.</p><p>Raw.</p><p>Like a tiger caged for far too long, starved for more. Or like a horny PhD student who was currently very turned on by the thought of fucking a professor.</p><p>Rio’s hips snapped, a harsh exhale fanned over Agatha’s face as she spoke. “God, I wish I could really feel you. Your pussy is one of the best–”</p><p>Agatha gasped, but not out of lust, out of offense. “<em>One of</em>?” She sank her nails into Rio’s back, almost enough to draw blood. “<em>One of</em>?!”</p><p>“T-the best. The best, querida.” Rio quickly amended. “Best pussy I’ve been in.”</p><p>“I suggest you watch your wording if you wish to remain inside it.” Agatha had to fight to speak, but she was nothing if not stubborn.</p><p>Rio let out a pathetic whimper. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>Agatha clamped down. “Say it again.”</p><p>“Yours is the best pussy I’ve ever been in, cariño. Ever.”</p><p>“Thought so.”</p><p>Agatha knew every vein in her neck and forehead was popping, her skin straining against itself to survive. Which was a pipedream because Rio’s dick kept hitting her g-spot and the feeling in her gut communicated that she was about to come. But this one was stronger than the last, she could tell, something in Rio’s words and movements were ruining her.</p><p>“Rio– Baby…” Agatha shut her eyes, head thrown back.</p><p>“Yes, yes, come for me, sweetheart. I wanna feel you come around me.”</p><p>Agatha’s whole body was an inferno, her and Rio’s sweat melding together, their skin growing sticky. Her pussy had a mind of its own because with no warning, Agatha came– <em>loudly</em>.</p><p>“Rio, Ri– Fuck! Oh my– My god!” Agatha wailed, swallowing Rio whole and gushing around the length currently stuffed seven inches deep inside of her. She didn’t register it at first; usually Agatha needed clitoral stimulation to aid in her orgasm, but Rio’s cock must’ve been otherworldly.</p><p>She shook as wave after wave took her under, pummeling her without mercy. Rio still thrusting to prolong her orgasm. Her brain felt fuzzy as it happened, as Rio shuddered on top of her.</p><p>“Agatha.” She whispered above her like a fucking prayer, like a religious experience. A god to be grateful to.</p><p>And she registered in her mind that Rio came too, but what she didn’t realize is that she had literally, actually, fucking gushed around Rio.</p><p>“God damnit.” She spoke, finding the sheet below her drenched. “I–”</p><p>She tried to find the words.</p><p>She sure as hell wasn’t sorry.</p><p>“That was so hot.” Rio looked at the same spot on the bed, bewildered. “You’re so hot.”</p><p>“Gimme a minute.” Agatha groaned, her cunt aching from the sheer size of the other woman.</p><p>Rio nodded, gently pulling out. As she did so, she looked at the condom still on her. “Fuck. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.”</p><p>“What?!” Agatha propped herself up on her elbows.</p><p>“The condom, it- it broke.”</p><p>Her eyes flitted to where Rio pointed. Her dick, now soft–</p><p>Oh, so it can go soft?</p><p>Was still wrapped, but there was a ripple on the side.</p><p>“It’s fine.” Agatha dismissed. “There’s a higher chance of Asgardians existing than you getting me pregnant."</p><p>“Are you sure? Agatha,” Rio sobered on a dime. “I’m <em>so sorry</em>. I wasn’t thinking, I should’ve put on a new one–”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her brows furrowing. “You’re not worried?”</p><p>“I’m forty and your swimmers have little to no mobility,” She snorted. “I think we’ll be fine.”</p><p>“You’re sure you’re okay?”</p><p>Agatha sat up, her fingers deftly unrolling the latex before spilling both of Rio’s loads on her mons. The cum trickled through her bush and down her outer lips, milky white making its way through flushed pink.</p><p>“Clean me up.” Agatha challenged, pushing the hair that was currently sticking to her face out of the way.</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate, shuffling off the bed and onto her knees, yanking her to the edge and throwing Agatha’s legs over her shoulders.</p><p>“Fuck, your cunt is gorgeous.”</p><p>“Told you so.”</p><p>The cum made its way downward, coating her completely and dripping onto the bed.</p><p>“Hurry up.” She ordered, shooting out a hand and pushing Rio’s head towards its final destination.</p><p>“Mmmmh.” Rio moaned as her tongue made first contact. The wet muscle was flat as it swept through Agatha’s drenched pussy, unabashedly parting her.</p><p>Rio’s thumbs dug into the soft skin of her thighs, keeping them parted as she worked. “You’re addictive.”</p><p>“If I can hear you speaking, you’re not doing it right.”</p><p>Rio didn’t put up a fight; her mouth returned, lapping up her own semen. Agatha jumped as Rio’s tongue delved inside her, still covered with her own seed. Essentially tongue-fucking her own cum into Agatha.</p><p>And it was too much, too fucking good. She hardly had the awareness to notice Rio’s back, also covered in ink. Black and white orchids cascading down her spine. Leaves, stems, buds, and petals blanketing all the way down the expanse of skin. Agatha did note how the roots went past the small of Rio’s back and onto her ass.</p><p>“Messy eater.” Agatha whined, peeking at Rio’s shiny chin and famished face.</p><p>“We taste <em>amazing</em> together, baby.” The student ground out between heavy licks. “Nothing will ever compare to this, Agatha.”</p><p>So this woman was a romantic, then.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Agatha didn’t acknowledge that, instead pivoting to something safer. “Prove it. Make me come on your tongue.”</p><p>And Agatha supposed she couldn't blame Rio for what happened next, the other woman basically unhinging her jaw and tucking in as though Agatha’s pussy was ambrosia. Her mouth moving as an act of worship as Agatha gripped at the mattress, fingers cramping from how long they stayed bunched up around the semi-scratchy sheets of the hotel bed.</p><p>Rio’s tongue thrust as her nose pressed against Agatha’s clit, giving her something to grind on. Rio ate pussy well, she would give her that. Every part of her face being utilized to maximize Agatha’s pleasure.</p><p>She tried closing her legs as her peak came closer, but Rio’s hold didn't allow it. As if she was so focused on the taste, she forgot a person was attached. It made Agatha feel utterly used, and she <em>loved</em> it.</p><p>Rio was eating for her own pleasure, <em>not Agatha’s.</em></p><p>Rio’s hips ground against the bedside, unaware she was humping the mattress. Agatha bucked her hips, undulating without remorse on Rio’s face. The admittedly beautiful features now coated in a sheen of Agatha’s slick. Not that Rio was complaining, her eyes hadn’t opened once, eating like she’d be executed tomorrow.</p><p>“Ri–”</p><p>“Please.” Rio spit out, her mouth moving and speaking into Agatha’s cunt. “Please come on my face.”</p><p>And who was she to refuse such an earnest plea?</p><p>Agatha’s stomach constricted as Rio’s tongue curved and something broke inside of her. Coming again, this time on Rio’s tongue. A clipped whimper emitted from her mouth, one stemming from her chest based on how strong it was.</p><p>Rio lapped and sucked like Agatha had just served her a gourmet meal, a divine collation to keep her satiated.</p><p>Even as Agatha’s body spasmed, Rio did not stop. Lost in the flavor of them, consuming every drop she could drink. She had to literally wretch Rio away from her oversensitive cunt, panting and attempting to get air. It was a trick, there was none. Not in Agatha’s lungs, at least.</p><p>She took stock of her current state, body covered in sweat, spit, bite marks, and small flecks of blood from Rio's knuckles. Agatha grinned to herself, her hair damp at the root, the ends most likely tangled. She locked her sights on big, brown puppy dog eyes, waiting for approval.</p><p>“Good job, darling.” Agatha said, still reeling.</p><p>Rio placed a chaste kiss to her inner thigh, voice smaller than before. “Good?”</p><p>“Perfect.”</p><p>Rio proudly smiled, placing another and much less chaste kiss to Agatha’s clit. She shuddered as a result, threading her fingers through Rio’s long locks, petting her like a kitten purring in her lap.</p><p>“Wait.” Agatha chided as Rio threatened to nestle herself between Agatha’s thighs yet again. “Let me pee.”</p><p>“Thought you weren’t worried.”</p><p>“It’s not about your cum, sweetheart. It's more to do with not wanting to deal with a UTI while I’m flying over the Atlantic Ocean tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio nodded, getting up and slumping onto the mattress at the same time Agatha got herself back upright. Her legs stiff and hamstrings trembling, walking like she’d just been kicked in the crotch. She squeezed her kegel muscles together to keep the minimal amount of cum inside her, not wanting it to drip onto the carpet. No cleaning staff in the world was paid enough to deal with that.</p><p>Agatha reached the bathroom, peed, and washed her hands. Flicking the light off as she entered the bedroom, only to find Rio there, face down, licking the spot where Agatha’s squirt had stained the sheets. Her eyebrows shot up as she noticed the lace that was once her underwear currently wrapped around Rio’s cock as she lazily jerked herself off.</p><p>“Sick fuck.” Agatha spoke, but her tone was laced with affection. “I was gone two minutes.”</p><p>Rio looked up, not even feigning guilt. “I missed you.”</p><p>“I hate you.” Agatha snorted as she stalked closer to the bed. “But I must say, I admire your level of depravity.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“I wish you could see–” She stopped at the edge of the bed, idea forming. Agatha harshly turned around, back to the bathroom. Upon hearing Rio’s confused whimper, she peeked over her shoulder and motioned with her finger for the younger woman to follow. “Come, pet.”</p><p>Like a gunshot, Rio was up and off the bed, obediently trailing after. Agatha switched the bathroom light back on, standing in front of the vanity. She rested her hands on the counter, eyes flickering to the mirror that took up the entire wall.</p><p>Rio flushed at the insinuation.</p><p>“I want you to see how utterly pathetic you are.”</p><p>“O-okay.” Rio chirped.</p><p>“Go put on a condom.”</p><p>“Wait, why?”</p><p>“Because they come pre-lubed and I have yet to see you have any.”</p><p>“Not to sound cocky, which I know you pretend to hate but actually find very attractive…” Rio smirked. “But you’re kind of already dripping for me, handsome.”</p><p>Agatha huffed an incredulous laugh, planting her elbows and bending over. “My pussy needs a break…”</p><p>Rio momentarily scrunched her face in confusion before it dawned on her. “Oh.”</p><p>“Haven’t stopped thinking about it since you said it.”</p><p>“Fuck.” Rio moaned, dick twitching like a puppy excited to see its owner. “One sec.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, waiting and checking herself out in the mirror. Still bent over, she admired herself, her hair might be wild but the sex gave it a certain volume that she could appreciate.</p><p>Rio rushed back in, tripping over herself to return, frantically situating herself behind Agatha.</p><p>“Eager are we?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth ghosted over her back, hastily kissing along the curvature of her shoulder blade. “I don’t think most women would let me do this on the first night.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her neck when she felt canines inching closer. “You’ll find I’m not like most women.”</p><p>Not in the sense that she felt a yearning to be different from other women in order to gain male validation, but in the way she didn’t give a single fuck about men. She didn’t cater to them, didn’t think about them, didn’t like them.</p><p>“And don’t get it twisted,” Agatha continued, “If I had my strap, you’d be the one about to take it in the ass.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, eyes as wide as saucers. “Maybe next time?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, but there’d be no next time. Aside from the fact that Rio lived on the other end of the country from Agatha, she was twenty-three. She challenged Agatha in a way that scared her. Rio didn’t seem to so much as blink at Agatha’s cruelty. She saw through the facade and that simply would not work for Agatha in the long run.</p><p>“Next time, baby.” She assured as Rio’s cock pressed against her ass, the length settling between her ass cheeks. “Now, be a good girl and warm me up.”</p><p>Rio brought two fingers to her mouth, sucking on them before spitting on them for good measure. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>She preened at those words, the control back with her, safe and sound.</p><p>Rio’s left hand spread her while the right gently prodded at her asshole, sinking in a single finger. She watched Agatha’s eyebrows knit together in pleasure, mouth falling open and legs spreading further. After a few pumps, Rio pulled out and added a second finger. Agatha’s fingers dug into the granite of the counter, her clit already throbbing.</p><p>“You’re taking it so well,” Rio spoke, awestricken. “Got a nice gape for me, cariño.”</p><p>“I keep myself well trained. I’m nothing if not hospitable.” Agatha quipped, arching her back and sticking her ass up as much as possible.</p><p>Rio curled her fingers, if only to hear Agatha moan. Damn woman had a sadistic streak, it seemed.</p><p>“We’ll see.” Rio pulled her fingers out but kept Agatha’s cheeks spread, bringing the head of her dick to Agatha’s hole. “If you thought your pussy needed a break…” Rio trailed off, not even finishing the sentence as she pushed her hips forward.</p><p>At the feeling of the tip entering, Agatha shrieked. Because fuck, Rio was right, this was a much tighter fit and Rio was still the exact same size–</p><p>Which was fucking enormous.</p><p>“O-oh f-fuck.” Agatha whined as Rio fed another inch and stopped.</p><p>“Take your time.” Rio snickered, almost mocking her. “I’ll wait.”</p><p>“You ever taken seven inches up your ass?” She hissed.</p><p>“No.” Rio shook her head and chuckled. “I have taken seven and a half, though.”</p><p>“Slut.”</p><p>Rio pushed in a little more, causing Agatha to shoot her hand up and clutch the mirror. “Look who’s talking.”</p><p>“Fucking prick.”</p><p>Rio’s clean hand ran along her side before groping her breast. “Come on, querida, you’re almost there. You can take more of it.”</p><p>Upon another inch, Agatha choked on her own spit. She could’ve sworn Rio’s cock was making its way up the back of her throat. “<em>There’s more</em>?!”</p><p>Rio sweetly smiled, “Yup.” And pushed in the last of the length until her hips were right up against Agatha’s ass.</p><p>An honest to god sob fell from Agatha’s lips as Rio bottomed out, the stretch felt incredible but pushed her to her limit. It had been a while since she’d taken something this long and thick, what can she say, it had been a slow year for casual anal sex.</p><p>“Oh– I, I–” Agatha babbled, her body a live wire. “I– holy fuck.”</p><p>“So fuckin’ tight.” Rio muttered, dragging her hips back. “Do you like to be spanked?” Her hand palming the flesh of Agatha’s ass cheek.</p><p>“W-what do you think?” Agatha replied through gritted teeth, quickly emitting a sharp exhale at Rio’s hand making harsh contact. The smack rang out, the hot sting making Agatha’s eyes water.</p><p>“Thought so.” Rio thrust forward again, slowly at first to help Agatha adjust before picking up speed. “Guess I’m not the only masochist here, right, baby?”</p><p>The question was rhetorical and Agatha didn’t dignify it with a response, partly out of spite, partly because speaking was becoming much more difficult as Rio started her rhythm. The hand that was on her breast moved to her throat, lightly constricting at the sides as Rio drove into her.</p><p>Agatha’s brain flashed with what was once a fantasy turning into reality. In the mirror her lidded eyes saw in perfect clarity, <em>VITA</em> snaked around her neck. The irony of life choking her only added onto everything else. Rio’s free hand spanking her again, her mouth biting at Agatha’s back, the things she whispered against her skin.</p><p>“Your moans are so pretty.”</p><p>“Next time, I’m going to watch myself leak out of you, sweetheart.”</p><p>“You look <em>so pathetic</em> for me.”</p><p>Yeah, Agatha was more than aware her own plan had backfired on her, the power she had coveted was out the fucking window. How this student, of all people, was able to covertly snatch the power back with ease, Agatha didn’t fucking know. And though she didn’t enjoy the vulnerability, she did very much enjoy everything Rio was currently doing.</p><p>Agatha only kept her balance because of the hand she had out in front of her, her hips hitting the counter with each thrust. They’d be bruised tomorrow and she couldn’t wait to trace the purple and blue when she got back home. Rio fucked her with reckless abandon, chasing her own pleasure as much as she was chasing Agatha’s. Her heart raced as her lungs struggled to receive air. Not because of Rio choking her, no the younger woman’s technique was perfect, but because Rio’s hips snapped like a rabid animal trying to breed its mate.</p><p>“Ri-o.” Agatha forced out, her speech broken.</p><p>Rio’s eyes hadn’t moved from Agatha’s face the entire time. “Yes?”</p><p>Agatha shakily tried moving her hand on the counter towards herself, but failed when there wasn’t enough space between her hips and the lip of the counter. “I- I need…”</p><p>“Oh, is your poor clit feeling neglected?”</p><p>“Yesssssss-” Agatha answered through merciless thrusts, aching at the apex of her thighs.</p><p>“You want some help?” Rio offered, but her tone indicated that she was not trying to be helpful in the slightest.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha blinked back a few tears, she felt <em>so</em> full.</p><p>“What’s the magic word?”</p><p>And if she could’ve, she would’ve spun around to whack her in a fit of rage. Instead, she purposely clenched around Rio, causing the younger woman to stutter in her movements and allowing Agatha to push her hips back just enough to wedge her hand between her body and the edge of the vanity.</p><p>“Fuck off.” Agatha hoarsely spoke, throat dry from all the heavy breathing. Her fingers immediately rubbing at her clit, working herself closer.</p><p>“That’s two words…” Rio didn’t even seem surprised, she looked dazed, her cock straining inside Agatha’s ass. “Come with me, baby.”</p><p>She focused on her clit piercing, flicking the metal a couple times and letting herself crumble.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>She wailed as her knees buckled due to her orgasm, Rio removing her hand from her throat to wrap around her waist to catch her from falling face first into the counter. Which was impressive considering Agatha could feel Rio’s body gently shake from her own orgasm. Her cock pulsed inside Agatha, both of them panting as though they’d just sprinted a 5K.</p><p>They stayed there for a few minutes, Agatha dropping her hand from the mirror to push the sweat-sodden locks of hair out of her face. Rio’s hold never faltered as she slowly pulled out, mindful of every sound or twitch Agatha made as a result.</p><p>Agatha remained limp as Rio rolled off the condom, discarding it into the trashcan underneath the counter.</p><p>“You okay?” She asked, kissing Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“Mmmmh.” Agatha hummed, her own weight coaxing her into a lethargic state. “I’m great.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, moving to the side to wash her hands. “Shower?”</p><p>At that, Agatha stood up straight again. “Um, no. No, I can just have one when I get back to my hotel.”</p><p>“It’s thirty degrees outside and you have no jacket…”</p><p>“I can grab a cab.”</p><p>“It’s almost midnight.”</p><p>“Shit, it is?”</p><p>“And you’re not exactly…hygienic enough for a cab ride right now.”</p><p>“Nice way to say I’m covered in your bodily fluids.”</p><p>“Hey, they’re your fluids too.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, fighting the urge to fall asleep on the nearest flat surface.</p><p>“If you stay for a shower, I can lick off all those fluids…” Rio offered. “Or not. We can keep it completely innocent.”</p><p>She narrowed her gaze. “Yeah fucking right.”</p><p>“So is that a yes?”</p><p>Well, with no other way out, Agatha let herself be coerced into a hot shower with an even hotter twenty-three year old who took it upon herself to wash Agatha’s hair for her. Normally, she would’ve denied the intimacy, but what the hell, sure. She was too tired to fight it, so she didn’t. She also did not object to Rio falling to her knees and eating her out while Agatha leaned back against the tile.</p><p>After they had gotten out, Agatha’s stomach growled because she hadn’t eaten at dinner. Rio leant her a pair of boxers and tank top, and ran down the hall to the vending machine, coming back with her arms full of Danish snacks.</p><p>“Okay, I can’t pronounce any of these brands.” She announced as she returned, dressed in a Berkley sweater and snoopy boxers. “But I have sour cream and onion or sea salt chips.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, reclined on the bed, hair still wet. “Sea salt.”</p><p>“Perfect, I wanted the sour cream and onion.” She climbed in next to Agatha, handing her a bag. “I also got some candy bars, but Denmark has a certain attachment to white chocolate….”</p><p>“Gross.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>And Agatha kept the conversation flowing while mentally cataloging where every article of her clothing was. After they’ve both scarfed down their stale chips and Rio broke into the minibar for waters, they settled into bed.</p><p>“I was thinking we could hit up that bakery down the street in the morning.” Rio innocently suggested. “I basically live there because of the pastries, they’re so fucking good.”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha lied, putting the cap back onto her water bottle and turning on her side. “Sounds great.”</p><p>“Great.” Rio beamed, curling her body against Agatha’s after clicking the bedside lamp off. “Maybe I could get your number…while we eat those pastries…?”</p><p>Her heart twisted, the lie forming so easily. “Yeah.”</p><p>Rio slung her arm over Agatha’s waist. “I could wake you up with head too.”</p><p>Damn, this woman was the whole package–</p><p>And twenty-three.</p><p>And just as smart as Agatha.</p><p>And just too fucking real for her to handle.</p><p>She forced a laugh. “Can’t wait.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha.” Rio hummed, voice quiet and filled with hope for tomorrow.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes didn’t close, her body didn’t relax. “Night, Rio.”</p><p>She bided her time, waiting and listening for Rio’s breath to grow heavy, her body going slack. It was around 2AM when Agatha slipped out of the bed, using the flashlight on her phone to locate and put on her suit. She vaguely searched for her underwear, eventually finding them tucked under the corner of Rio’s pillow.</p><p>She quirked an eyebrow at that because Rio definitely put them there on purpose. Eh, fine, let the panty freak have a keepsake, she figured. It’s not like she planned on seeing her again, so if the perv did her daily wank to them, then all the better.</p><p>Agatha slipped her loafers back on, a miniscule part of her debating whether or not to leave a note.</p><p>
<em>Hey. Great sex, amazing cock. Best wishes in your academic and professional endeavors. Catch you later and enjoy my underwear. –Dr. Agatha Harkness</em>
</p><p>No, that's insane, and more importantly, unnecessary for a one night stand. Plus, the less evidence of her fucking a student, the better. Even if Rio wasn’t her student, she was at a different stage in her life. Agatha didn’t need to burden her.</p><p>Agatha placed a quick kiss to the crown of Rio’s head, terrified that if she did more, she might not leave. Which she should, she should, without a doubt, leave and never look back.</p><p>She was careful to let the door shut with a soft click so as not to wake Rio, storming down the hallway of the hotel and constantly checking over her shoulder that no Berkley staff were around to catch her. She did not feel like explaining sneaking out of a student’s room in the early morning hours.</p><p>A cab was easy enough to flag down, taking her the ten minute drive to her hotel. As she got back to her room, she made sure to book her flight earlier, making the chance of running into Rio nonexistent. Agatha should’ve slept, but instead spent the next hour packing. She changed into a U-Mass sweater and leggings for the airport, planning to spend the seven hour flight passed out from exhaustion.</p><p>It was 5AM when she slipped her laptop into her messenger bag, making sure she had her passport and phone charger in the front pocket. She slung the bag over her shoulder and looked down to grab her shoes, when her eyes roamed to the trashcan.</p><p>The polaroid.</p><p>It sat right on top, unharmed, with the stupid night from the pub laughing in Agatha’s face. Against her better judgement, she plucked it out, Her thumb running along the glaze of the film.</p><p>Rio Rhodes.</p><p>Copper eyes, crooked grin, smile lines already forming.</p><p>She scowled, pocketing the damn thing and shoving it in her satchel before turning and grabbing her suitcase. Getting through the airport post-sex was not something she’d recommend, all the walking making the ache in her thighs and cunt unbearable. Agatha passed out in her business class seat before they even took off, never to see the twenty-three year old ever again. Just how it should be.</p><hr/><p>It was six weeks later, after the world had shut down due to a stupid fucking virus, that Agatha pulled out that polaroid again.</p><p>She had just upchucked for the third morning in a row, her breasts beyond tender, and her period missing in action. She’d been isolated for the last month, teaching on Zoom and tolerating those asinine Breakout rooms. Honestly, whoever invented Teams should eat shit and die.</p><p>She studied the photo as the timer on her phone counted down what she already knew, internally she just <em>knew</em>. The Postmates driver who picked up the test bought the wrong brand, stupid fucking man, but it beat going out into public during a global health crisis.</p><p>Agatha tried to gaslight herself, because realistically, what were the odds?</p><p>
<em>There’s a higher chance of Asgardians existing than you getting me pregnant.</em>
</p><p>But she knew her body, and nothing about her cycle or brand new aversion to eggs was normal for her. There were worse things, she reasoned, than being knocked up by a twenty-three year old stranger in the midst of a literal pandemic.</p><p>She was fixated on Rio’s minuscule tooth gap for the fiftieth time when her timer went off, startling her. Agatha set aside the photo on her bathroom counter, looking at herself in the mirror and taking a deep breath.</p><p>When she flipped over the test, it wasn’t much of a surprise. The tiny pink plus sign mocking her as it proclaimed to the whole world that she was, in fact, pregnant by a twenty-three year old stranger amidst a pandemic. What <em>did</em> surprise her, was how non offensive the idea of having a child was. Agatha hadn’t given it much thought throughout her life, considering the megalomaniacal cunt that she called ‘mother’ had ruined the prospect of motherhood for her pretty early on.</p><p>Evanora was cruel and cutting, she was fucking evil incarnate. So Agatha had written off children and had been fine with that—</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Until she looked at the test again and wondered if this was it. If it was now or never. She was already in her forties, maybe this was her shot to give her kid the childhood she would’ve wept for. Kids were cool, she could raise one…hypothetically.</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>Agatha dropped the test back onto the sink, glaring into the mirror above. “You just can’t keep it in your pants, can you?”</p><p>The worst part being, she couldn’t even pinpoint exactly when she would’ve gotten pregnant. Could’ve been when the condom broke, could’ve been when Rio fucked her own cum into Agatha. She was clouded by horniness that night, and so sure there was no way her forty-one year old uterus was hospitable enough for sperm that swam at a snail’s pace.</p><p>Of course that obnoxious fucker just <em>had</em> to prove Agatha wrong by knocking her up. Always a fight with that one, always an argument.</p><p>Jesus, this kid was going to come out of her womb with a law degree by the way they were already predisposed to debate. They were going to fight Agatha tooth and nail over books and bedtimes. They were going to correct her when she inevitably told them that they have food at home, pointing out that she hadn't gone grocery shopping in a week. They were going to be smart and so damn witty. Maybe they’d have Rio’s eyes. Maybe they'd have her smile.</p><p>Maybe the pregnancy hormones were already starting to turn her brain to mush. Because her first thought should not be about her child looking like their mother who Agatha didn’t even know properly or have a phone number for. Shit, she should’ve gotten her phone number, should’ve gotten those pastries the morning after. She should’ve given Rio that decency.</p><p>And now she had to scour the godforsaken internet for a twenty-three year old who was in no financial or professional position to have a child. Rio’s life was just starting, she couldn’t be responsible for a baby. Rio should be out, being stupid and partying. Living her life to the fullest while she could, not caring for an infant.</p><p>Agatha nervously chewed on her lip as she weighed her options. Rio had every right to know her child would be sharing a planet with her in t-minus eight months. But would she even want it? And would she want it with Agatha of all people? The woman who verbally humiliated her in a bar after knowing her for an hour? The woman who couldn’t take a little criticism? The woman who left her to wake up alone in a cold bed in Denmark? No fucking way. And she couldn’t even fault Rio for it, she understood.</p><p>Agatha didn’t aim to be liked, she expected to be tolerated and respected. But after how she was raised? Agatha didn’t want her child to view their parents as two people who simply tolerated one another. She wanted her kid to know nothing but love.</p><p>But keeping something like this? Withholding Rio’s potential bond to her own child? It wouldn’t be fair. It would be a hell of a lot easier, but resolutely unfair.</p><p>A trembling hand fell to her stomach as the most nauseating, heinous thought wormed its way into her mind–</p><p>Her apologies to the Asgardians, apparently.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio slipped her signature Montres watch on - light brown leather, green glass encased in sterling silver. It was over five hundred bucks and it was expensive to Rio when she bought it as a gift to herself for graduating with a doctoral degree. She might not be the type of doctor to raise her hand if someone screamed for one on a plane, but she <i>was</i> the first person in her family to get something past a bachelor’s degree, and that certainly meant something.</p><p>She’d lectured at Berkeley for two years after that before she got this gig on the other side of the country. <i>Tenure track</i>. Anyone in the academic world knew how much of a fucking game changer that was, so Rio did her best to look her sharpest for the first day in office. It was meant to be casual, was how it had been explained to her - Jennifer Kale, the Assistant Dean of the Liberal Arts Department at Salem University, had told Rio in an email last week it was just a refresher of professional development guidelines and rubbing elbows.</p><p>And free store-bought cookies and charcuterie on prearranged plastic trays, but Rio decided that now, as a tenure track professor, she need not care about the free food academic functions carried. She was finally and officially past that point in her life.</p><p>An olive-toned, floral-patterened button down, long-sleeved even if it was the beginning of a hellish August, dark brown slacks. Her belt matched her shoes <i>and</i> her tie. Rio put on the rest of her jewelry and spritzed some cologne on before she got in her Volkswagen Jetta old enough to drink and chugged along to the small, prettily landscaped campus.</p><p>Rio had scoured the campus map on the website a few days ago and found that it wasn’t complicated at all to find her appropriate building. Compared to UC Berkeley, Salem U was a drop in the ocean.</p><p>She got out of her car and walked at a leisurely pace, not wanting to build a layer of sweat and grime. Rio could only imagine what the campus would look like in the fall. Lamp posts with purple and green flags labelled <i>Go Witches!</i> stood every hundred feet or so from each other. It was just kitschy enough that Rio liked the uniqueness; other than job security, it had been one of the reasons she’d chosen this job.</p><p>“Rio!” Rio recognised Dr. Kale’s voice. Rio walked in the direction of one of the only people she knew. “Glad to see you could make it. How’d moving go?”</p><p>Pretty horrible. Rio owned over five hundred books (she has counted them all, yes) and had to pack all of them. At some point during the process she just threw kitchen utensils into the same box as her socks, taped it up, and called it a day. “Oh, not too bad. I’m just happy I’ve got mostly everything unpacked.”</p><p>Dr. Kale, who insisted on Rio calling her Jennifer (“You’re my colleague, Rio, not my student”), introduced her to a few other faculty members. Lilia, of course, who Rio had met over email - she seemed to be one of those administrative members that kept this department from folding like a house of cards. Alice Wu-Gulliver, a woman who seemed just as grown-up punk as Rio from the looks of the tattoos peeking out of her shirt sleeves, taught several Eastern history sections, mainly for upperclassmen. There was also Sharon, who had not given Rio her last name, and gave off kind but a bit ditzy.</p><p>“Don’t tell Kale,” Sharon had whispered, “but I brought a flask of Pinot.” The way Jen looked at Rio told her she’d heard every word.</p><p>At some point, Sharon had begun chatting Rio’s ear off about the social implications of Chaucer’s work - which, apologies to every “Wife of Bath”-head out there, but mega yawn - and Rio must have shot Jen a look of panic, because she came rushing over.</p><p>“Oh!” Jen pushed Rio by her shoulder and directed her… somewhere. Rio wasn’t quite sure where, to be honest. “I just realised, you haven’t met the Dean.”</p><p>And it was true; Rio hadn’t met the Dean or even knew their name. She had been so excited over getting a tenure track position at a university that wasn’t some sort of Lutheran or Presbyterian hellhole (or god forbid, an SEC school) that she had just accepted it. And the past couple of months she had spent packing, preparing her syllabi… and playing video games and smoking the last of her Cali weed, but that didn’t sound as high-brow and productive, so it wasn’t anyone’s business but her own.</p><p>Rio had admittedly not gotten to know the ins and outs of the faculty here, but it was why she was here. This office shindig wasn’t mandatory, but Rio needed to make good first impressions.</p><p>Jennifer splayed her hand out to introduce her to someone, and Rio took in and appreciated  the shapely form in plum slacks and a blazer before her gaze snapped up and met a pair of piercing blue eyes she hadn’t locked on to in a horrifyingly long time.</p><p>The only joy in running into Agatha Harkness again was that it looked like just as much color drained from Harkness’s face as Rio can assume drained from her own.</p><p>“This is -”</p><p>“Rhodes?” Dr. Harkness asked, shocked laced through her tone. She was holding a plate of snacks and cut fruit, and Rio realized her hand was slightly trembling.</p><p>Rio now had to fight color from reddening her face. “That was, um, a nickname. It’s Vidal, actually.” Rio shot a gaze toward Jennifer. “Don’t worry, you don’t need to introduce us. We know each other.”</p><p>Biblically. Yeah, and Rio was also biblically <i>fucked</i>, and obviously not the fun kind.</p><p>Dr. Harkness (Agatha? Can Rio still even call her that?) seemed to quickly pull herself together, like an actor getting into character. She stuck out her free hand. “Well, I didn’t realize the C.V. of Rosario Vidal was you.”</p><p>Rio did her absolute best not to allow a nervous laugh escape from her when she replied, “I didn’t realize you were faculty here. I thought you were still at the University of Massachusetts."</p><p>Dr. Harkness’s - fuck it, Agatha’s hand was warm when Rio clasped it in her own, and Rio swore a spinal tap level of electricity shot up her back as their skin brushed. Agatha said, “We’re all full of surprises.” And then she added, “My apologies for not meeting with you until now. My flight from Prague got in a few days ago and I’ve been sweating off the jet lag. I spent the summer nose-deep in archives.”</p><p>“I’ve been busy, too,” Rio said. Which wasn’t <i>not</i> true. “We can share the blame.”</p><p>“Gotcha.” Someone called Jen’s name, and she looked to Rio. “Mind if I let you fend for yourself for a bit?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, actively wanting to stick her head into a volcano. “No problem.”</p><p>And then there were two.</p><p>They stood in silence so thick with tension that you could cut it with a knife, for a moment.</p><p>“So,” Agatha started, “how’s trying to track down Zeus?”</p><p>Rio sucked on her teeth and smirked. So that’s how this was going to be. “You know that’s not what my research is.”</p><p>“But it <i>is</i> chasing a fairy tale,” Agatha remarked. Rio immediately noticed when Agatha wet her lips. The air conditioning in this building was definitively out of date and it made every room feel drier than a 1950s housewife. That was the reasoning Rio stuck to, anyhow.</p><p>She took the bait, almost able to feel the hook sink into her cheek. “If I’m chasing fairy tales, I obviously did a good enough job to get hired here. Of which you had a part in deciding, might I add.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Agatha broke the conversation by spearing an olive in her mouth. Rio could smell the brine, and she glanced away as Agatha chewed and then said, “Well, like you said, I only had a part.”</p><p>“And if I snag that tenure, your department will get to fund my research.” Rio smiled cheekily at that.</p><p>“Doesn’t come out of my paycheck,” Agatha quipped. “You know, you get a certain look in your eye when you think you have the verbal upper hand.”</p><p>Rio felt her eyelid twitch. “What?”</p><p>“Like a kid who thinks they’ve stuck their hand in the cookie jar when no one’s looking.” Agatha gave Rio a once-over (with a look on her face that Rio immensely hoped was appreciatively) and then pointed to Rio’s shirt. “You’ve got a stain.”</p><p>“Huh?” Rio didn’t even remember eating anything today that would have been messy enough to stain. Also, she’d changed outfits right before getting here. She glanced down at her shirt and saw it was perfectly clean, and had no type to react before Agatha took her finger and flicked the tip of Rio’s nose. Rio looked back and glared as Agatha snickered at her. “Seriously?”</p><p>“If you’re gullible enough to think you spilled something on a shirt that looks like it should be on the rack at the boys’ section in Target,” Agatha started, while Rio looked down at the leaves and flower stems drawn on her shirt and frowned, “how am I supposed to trust that you aren’t on that same level of thinking with Asgardian folktales?”</p><p>“Well, thankfully there aren’t any academic papers being written about my choice in fashion,” Rio snapped. She almost felt a little bad about her tone of voice, but then she saw the fire simmering in Agatha’s eyes. Oh, so the freak enjoyed this. “Also, dismissing oral tradition as a legitimate anthropological source? I thought an academic with your stature would rightfully consider that beneath you.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Saying Asgardian mythos has oral tradition is being too considerate. It’s a religion. A much respected one, but I don’t see anyone claiming Jesus of Nazareth held the Tesseract.”</p><p>“Maybe that’s the exception that proves the rule,” Rio pointed out.</p><p>Agatha just smirked. Rio thought that if ‘smirk’ had a picture under its definition in the dictionary, it would hold the shape of Agatha’s lips. “That’d work out squeaky clean for you, wouldn’t it?”</p><p>“I don’t mind getting a little dirty, actually,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha cocked her head a bit and looked Rio up and down unabashedly. Like she was studying the other woman; Rio prided herself in the way she just squared her shoulders and met Agatha where she was. Agatha <i>hmm</i>ed in thought. “You seem the type.”</p><p>“Seem?” Rio sounded almost offended. She knew Agatha remembered. Maybe. Did she remember it as vividly as Rio did?</p><p>Agatha leaned into Rio and whispered so that it was assured no one could hear. “Do you think what we did was dirty? I thought it was pretty tame, myself.”</p><p>A collection of spit had quickly salivated in Rio’s mouth at Agatha’s words. She swallowed hard.</p><p>Agatha leaned back as if nothing had happened, and then said a little too loudly, “Well, I’ve gotta head out. I’m meeting someone for dinner.”</p><p>“Hot date?” Rio asked cheekily.</p><p>Agatha just tutted. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”</p><p>Rio spent the rest of the time in the casual-like meeting getting contact info from her coworkers. Sharon gave Rio her Pinterest, which Rio nodded and accepted but forgot the name of by the time she got to the car. She accidentally cut someone off on the way home, too distracted by the fact that <i>Agatha fucking Harkness</i> had been there. Agatha fucking Harkness, who is now her coworker.</p><p>What the fuck had she just gotten herself into.</p><hr/><p>Rio’s first day back in the classroom was as normal as she expected. Different coast, same students with a gay little walk who noticed her attire and how she carried herself and then decided to imprint on her like a duck. She taught the standard four classes a semester, and Salem University must be popular with 19-year-old bisexuals, because she for sure had a few zone in on the carabiner clipped to the left side of her pants like a seagull to a pile of unattended French fries.</p><p>They nipped at her like a fry, too. Rio was lucky she’d always been fairly decent at remembering names. One student in particular, a boy named Billy who had a diligently shaved eyebrow, had excitedly told her that “between her and Doctor Harkness, almost half of his professors were lesbians!”</p><p>Yum. Rio wanted to find the nearest patch of dirt and stick her head into it like a distressed ostrich.</p><p>She didn’t know why she had birds on her mind today. Maybe she should pick up that birdwatching hobby she’d tried and epically failed at about three or four years ago. Maybe Massachusetts had more interesting avian variety than the Bay Area.</p><p>Maybe it was because, when she’d had her lunch in her office today, she was four doors down from the nameplate that read Agatha Harkness, and there was a sticker on her door: a cartoon crow holding a mug that said, “I love caw-fee.”</p><p>Rio had decided to start walking to her own office at the perfect time, because she was a respectable, not-obsessive amount of steps away from Agatha’s door when it swung out and Agatha marched into the hallway like she’d built the brick and mortar herself. Rio looked at Agatha and didn’t say anything: not because she didn’t want to, but because no words came to her mind.</p><p>Agatha was in glasses. Wow. It was an amazing look - and she must have taken off whatever blazer she was wearing because she wore only a pair of slacks and a white button-down shirt, the sleeves rolled up to her elbows. It showed off her forearms. Sure, Rio had seen the woman naked half a decade ago, but that’s a long time in dog years, and Rio had the attention deficit skills of a cartoon golden retriever who consistently got distracted by a squirrel in the window. It was safe to say that, in Rio’s mind and memory, she had basically never seen Agatha’s forearms before, and there was a pleasant buzzing in her head.</p><p>Rio was too lost in the sauce to do anything when Agatha spotted Rio and jumped, startled. “Were you going to say anything?” Agatha snapped, and then, her eyes widened. “Oh. You cut your hair.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio said, and ended it there. Agatha didn’t need to know where her thoughts had gone. So she gratefully accepted the pivot Agatha had unintentionally offered. “Yeah, it’s more humid here than in L.A. My neck kept getting sweaty.” Rio scratched the back of her head sheepishly. Her hair, which had sat at her mid back, now rested with the ends brushing her shoulders.</p><p>“I did my undergrad in Florida,” Agatha stated. “It was… very swampy there. So I get it.”</p><p>“Yeah, U of F.” Rio nodded along in understanding until the meaning of Agatha’s smirk connected to the two overworked brain cells rubbing frantically and desperately in her brain. Ah, okay, so she’d just inadvertently admitted to searching Agatha up. Cool and hip and very normal. “Anyway.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows knit together in a serious fashion when she hit Rio with an insane amount of emotional whiplash. “Does anyone know about what happened in Copenhagen?”</p><p>Rio felt as if her heart had seized up and started flopping around like a half-dead fish. “What? No. I mean, I told like two people in my program that I… uh, had relations with a professor, but I didn’t say who. I wouldn’t do that to you.” Rio searched Agatha’s expression, hoping to find some sort of understanding. The awkwardness ballooning in her chest made it seem like Rio was about to burst, so she gave an awkward chuckle. “Nothing rotten happening in the state of Denmark.” No, that was bad. “As in, nothing rotten happened there. I would say. But we can put it behind us. And nothing rotten is happening here -”</p><p>“That was a stretch,” Agatha interrupted. “Four out of ten. What if I don’t like Shakespeare? Not everyone wants to read the play of a dead white man.”</p><p>Rio pointed to the poster on Agatha’s office door that read: <i>Want to join the Salem Shakespeare Club? Email Dr. Agatha Harkness for questions!</i></p><p>“Lucky guess,” Agatha grumbled. She then looked visibly uncomfortable, like she was wrenching out her own teeth with a rust pair of pliers. “Look, I… do apologize.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. She had a sneaking suspicion as to what this was about, but she wanted to hear Agatha explicitly say it. “Yeah? What about?”</p><p>Agatha gave Rio the stink eye, but Rio could tell the flicker of guilt that was still making its home in that ocean blue. “For not giving you any sort of contact info… or note… but I truly did have to make my plane.”</p><p>“I get it,” Rio said. And she did - she had also flown international for that conference, too. Time and distance had made the sting in her heart from Agatha’s past actions hurt less, but it was certainly still there, so hearing Agatha’s words did help a little with the healing. “But I do appreciate you admitting it could have gone differently.”</p><p>“Past is in the past.” There was a look in Agatha’s eye that Rio couldn’t quite place. And then she straightened up, as if to wash away whatever it was. “Now get out of my way. I don’t have time for breaks today and I need to piss.”</p><p>Rio backed away before Agatha could shoulder check her - though, in hindsight, maybe getting a slight touch of Agatha would have felt nice - and no, Rio was not some weird fan. She would be fine.</p><p>The rest of that week, every time Rio saw Agatha, Agatha glared at her. It made Rio wonder if she’d done something wrong. Sure, Rio carried herself with a tomboyish charm, but her TikTok algorithm told her that was charming, and she liked to agree, if only because it served her.</p><p>Sure, it was nice to be under the heat of Agatha’s gaze, but Rio felt like a cat who had scratched up the furniture, and she honestly didn’t understand what she’d done to deserve that kind of treatment. Agatha stared at her as if she were a poltergeist come back to haunt her - as if Rio’s very <i>face</i> somehow unsettled her.</p><p>So about two weeks into the semester, when Rio went into the copy room to steal some paper clips and the only other person in the room was Agatha, she took her golden opportunity.</p><p>“Not to be blunt,” Rio said, bluntly, “but you look at me like I took a dump on your desk.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha looked away from whatever papers she needed shooting out from the printer to give Rio a bemused expression. “What the hell are you talking about?”</p><p>“You’ve been mean-mugging me since the beginning of the semester,” Rio explained. And squaring her shoulders, she went, “And just so you know, telling people of the <i>thing</i> would also mar my reputation, not that I’d do it if it didn’t. I like to think I’m a decent human being, so I wouldn’t. And as for the Shakespeare comment -”</p><p>“I didn’t realize I was glaring at you,” Agatha admitted. “I’ve… had a lot of stuff on my mind. Beginning of the school year chaos.”</p><p>“Right, and I happened to be the target of it.”</p><p>“Not always,” Agatha corrected. She broke eye contact with Rio and brushed what was probably nonexistent lint off of the navy waistcoat she was wearing today. “One of my overachieving students - and I don’t care about how not politically correct this sounds, but gay as a two-dollar bill, so he eats out of the palm of my hand - definitely thinks I hate him after I told him to let other students in the class speak.” Agatha sighed. “Some students just need a reminder that there are others in the room, but he looked at me like I’d told him I’d killed his dog.”</p><p>“Billy?” Rio guessed, and Agatha raised her eyebrows in shock. “Yeah, I have him, too. He doesn’t take up as much of the conversations in my classes as he seems to yours, but I’ve learned that treating him like a chihuahua in a field full of land mines. Just gotta treat him with a little cautious care.”</p><p>Agatha peered at Rio before she said, “You have a very interesting way with words.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio responded cheerfully.</p><p>At that, Agatha smirked, though Rio could tell it was playfully. “Who said it was a compliment?”</p><p>“<i>Eres tan jodidamente confusa</i>,” Rio muttered. <i>You are so fucking confusing.</i></p><p>“I like to think I’m interesting more than confusing,” Agatha stated.</p><p>A deer in the headlights, Rio paused before she said, “You… understand Spanish?”</p><p>“Duh,” Agatha said, as if she hadn’t just changed Rio’s whole perspective on her. “And Italian, and German. Tried to learn Mandarin, but…” Agatha’s eyebrows scrunched together. “Tonal languages are a bitch.”</p><p>“Uh huh.” Rio stared at Agatha’s lips. Because she was amazed at how those lips knew multiple languages, obviously.</p><p>“I’m not going to butcher the language by replying back,” Agatha joked. “I’d say I’m somewhere between a B1 and B2 in terms of fluency.”</p><p>Rio barely understood what those levels meant, but she nodded, anyhow. And maybe it was the way Agatha looked today - her hair was down, and that always made Rio feel as wild as the tumbling of Agatha’s locks. She blurted out, “Doesn’t surprise me. That you have a skillful tongue, I mean.”</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened, but they sparkled as if Rio had taken the bait. “Don’t open a book you’re not willing to read.”</p><p>“I’m an academic,” Rio stated. “I love reading.”</p><p>“Uh huh.” Agatha gathered her papers from the printer, which stopped its whirring. She took her packets in one hand and bent her wrist, checking the time. “My next class is in twenty.” She breezed past Rio and whispered, “See you later, <i>cosita bonita</i>.”</p><p>Agatha was gone by the time Rio realized what Agatha had said. <i>Pretty little thing?</i> Rio touched her cheek with the pack of her palm. It was warm.</p><hr/><p>The thing about working at a small school, Rio learned, is they really liked throwing parties.</p><p>“Parties,” of course, not actual parties. This one was for a beginning of the year celebration even though Labor Day weekend had already come and gone. Rio didn’t understand why that should be considered a celebration; the best part about teaching was you got about ten weeks off. But Rio went, anyway, genuinely liking some of the people she’d met and talked to her first few weeks here.</p><p>Also, she’d run out of free Hinge swipes.</p><p>Rio’s shoulders perked up and a small smile formed on her face when she saw Alice was there. She’s liked talking with Alice the few times they’d bumped into each other on campus.</p><p>Alice noticed her, too, and greeted her with, “Hey, Rio!” Then she looked down at the short-sleeve polo Rio was wearing, and whistled. “Like the tats. Knew you at least had a couple, but those are some pretty dope sleeves.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Yeah, don’t ask how many times I decided to eat ramen and peanut butter sandwiches until my next paycheck so I could complete this.”</p><p>“Don’t I know it.” Alice was wearing a leather jacket that Rio was beginning to learn was her signature look. Although she couldn’t see whatever Alice had on underneath, it’d track that she had some sort of sleeve art. “The wife likes it when I keep my tattoos a secret. She says it’ll attract students to me like flies, and you didn’t hear it from me, but she’s possessive.”</p><p>Alice spoke the last bit in a dramatic whisper, and Rio laughed until Alice not-so-discreetly pointed her finger to Jen and Rio abruptly stopped. “Oh. Really?”</p><p>“Yup.” Well, fork in kitchen moment. Academics really loved shitting where they ate. It was depressing how much Rio longed to be nestled in that cutlery drawer with the others.</p><p>But thankfully, Alice was a good distraction. Rio realized while talking to her that, out of the small department of faculty and staff here, she probably had the most in common with Alice. They had a similar taste in music, they had the same phase in undergrad where they were going to multiple political protests a week, they each had a tattoo they regret.</p><p>(Rio’s was some shitty stick and poke she’d done herself in her hip in high school; it was a dinosaur. Though it looked more like a nugget form than the actual reptile. Rio was meant to be a wordsmith, not an artist.)</p><p>Rio noticed the second Agatha walked in. She definitely looked like one of those people who considered herself to be on time, and everyone else early. She was wearing a baby blue button down shirt, though the sleeves were rolled up and cuffed to her forearms. She was wearing a bolo tie.</p><p>Agatha just smirked haughtily when she caught Rio staring. It made Rio angry; it made her want revenge.</p><p>She made her move when Agatha swaggered over to the food table. Grocery store subs slices in eighths, grapes, cheese cubes. Shit like that. Rio broke from Alice - though she was very polite about it, citing she wanted to take advantage of a free meal - and grabbed a little plastic plate, placing herself behind Agatha.</p><p>“Excuse me.” She brushed past Agatha to get to the fruit artfully placed in the middle of the table. As she did so, she set her hand on Agatha’s waist and acted like there was much less space to get by than there really was. She could feel Agatha’s body tense under her touch. Out of the corner of her eye, she watched Agatha glare at her.</p><p>Her hand was off of Agatha as quickly as it had been on her. Rio grabbed the tongs and picked up a few strawberries; they were the last pieces on the platter.</p><p>“Leave some for the rest of us,” Agatha commented.</p><p>Feeling a bold rush of adrenaline course through her veins, Rio said, “You’re welcome to taste some.” When Agatha held out her plate expectantly, Rio grinned. Hook, line, sinker. “Oh, I didn’t mean you’d get to eat any.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. Not in anger, but in the way that an archer did when notching an arrow and pinpointing their target. “You’re toeing a line.”</p><p>“Care to explain to me what that line is, Dean Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opened to respond when a shrill voice interrupted. “Oh my god, they have <i>free wine?</i>”</p><p>Sharon bustled excitedly past Agatha and Rio to set her small plastic cup under the nozzle. “I bet I can get a dozen trips in before Lilia cuts me off,” she commented.</p><p>Rio shot Agatha a bewildered look and mouthed <i>A dozen?</i> Agatha shrugged as if to say <i>This is what normally happens</i>. Rio schooled her expression and said, “Free wine sounds like a fantastic idea, Sharon.” Nipping a plastic cup from the stack, Rio looked at Agatha. “You?”</p><p>“I think I’d enjoy siphoning from a gas nozzle more than drinking whatever’s in there.” Agatha sneered and wrinkled her nose.</p><p>“Bet you’d be good at it,” Rio murmured, just loud enough for Agatha to hear, and Agatha’s eyes widened in realization as her jaw clenched, not used to being abandoned in the midst of a double entendre she hadn’t purposefully constructed herself. Rio cleared her throat. “More for me, I guess.”</p><p>Agatha stomped off to a corner of the room, clearly wanting to get away from Rio. Oh, not gonna happen. Rio abandoned her fruit plate and quickly filled up her cup of wine (which didn’t take very long, as the cups were fairly small) and followed Agatha.</p><p>“You know what I think?” she started.</p><p>“You don’t,” Agatha sniped.</p><p>“You act like this free box wine is beneath you, but you,” and at this, Rio motioned to Agatha’s plate, “don’t even eat the skin of your apples. Those look like little watermelon rinds. You know that’s the most nutritious part of the apple, right? You tried to tout a highbrow palate back there but it’s clearly a farce. What’s your go-to restaurant order, tenders?”</p><p>“Get to your point,” Agatha grunted out. If it was possible to white-knuckle a flimsy plastic plate, she was doing it.</p><p>“Maybe you don’t want to see what this wine makes you think. Or feel.” Rio took a hearty sip, and her lips puckered. “Eugh. Well, it is awful.”</p><p>Agatha swiped the cup from Rio’s hand and tasted it herself. Her face scrunched up and she instantly pushed the cup back towards Rio, as if holding it would make it worse. “Jesus.”</p><p>“If that’s the kind of wine Jesus is making, I think I’d rather be drinking water in Hell.”</p><p>Agatha let out a little snort at that; and then her face sobered up as she realized the sound escaped her mouth. Her bottom lip stuck out in frustration.</p><p>“Aww,” Rio cooed playfully, “you laughed at a joke I made.”</p><p>“Careful,” Agatha warned. “Don’t push.”</p><p>Rio ran her tongue over her teeth, and in that moment, decided to take the icy plunge. “Why not?”</p><p>“Because I’ll push back.”</p><p>Rio nudged Agatha’s shoulder with her own. “And what’s that look like, hmm?”</p><p>A dangerous look flashed in Agatha’s eye before she pointed out a finger. She then placed it under the bottom of Rio’s cup and pushed. Rio’s cup slipped out of her hand before it fell to the floor. A bit of it got on Rio’s shirt, and she frowned.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shined with mirth as she theatrically exclaimed, “Oh, no! Rio, you’re so clumsy. Here, we’ll go get some paper towels. Sorry, everyone, just avoid this spot while we go get stuff to clean it up with.”</p><p>Agatha practically pulled Rio by the ear as they turned a few times in the building’s endless hallways until they came upon a door labeled ‘SUPPLY CLOSET’. Agatha got out a set of keys from her pocket (on a carabiner, obviously) and unlocked it before she pushed Rio straight in, the dig of her palm into Rio’s sternum still stinging even when she let go and got in right after, closing the door behind her.</p><p>The closet was stuffed to the brim with toiletries and cleaning materials and already cramped for one adult person, but two was miserable if said adults didn’t want to be essentially meshed together at their atoms. Luckily for Rio - and hopefully for Agatha, too - she didn’t mind this at all. Rio could feel the heat radiating from Agatha’s body.</p><p>“You are so fucking infuriating,” Agatha practically snarled, accusing finger jabbed in Rio’s face.</p><p>Rio’s physical form acted before her stupidly slow monkey brain could catch up to stop it and she took her hand and wrapped it around Agatha’s wrist. It was a gentle hold, but Rio might as well have pinned Agatha to the wall with the way her body recoiled at the touch.</p><p>“Do you really hate me that much?” Rio asked, doing her best to hide the hurt little creature nestled and shaking in her chest.</p><p>“No.” Agatha was unabashedly staring at Rio’s lips now.</p><p>Rio wondered if Agatha's brain felt as fuzzy as hers did. Maybe it was the body heat in this cramped room. Like that itchy insulation that sticks to the attic walls. Rio leaned her head down and Agatha must also want it enough because her lips met Rio’s in a way that was only possible if she had tilted her chin up in a silent acceptance. It was too slow to be uncertain.</p><p>Agatha tasted like the wine they just consumed, of course. She also tasted like something uniquely Agatha, when Rio got bold enough to dip her tongue out just enough to swipe across Agatha’s bottom lip. It was a taste she hadn’t been able to get out of her head for the handful of years they’d been off doing their own things - Rio could still remember that one night three years ago she’d got absolutely crossed and woken up to the taste of cotton and the ghost of Agatha from some dream. She’d been so <i>ashamed</i>, and Rio did not wear shame well. It didn’t come with the territory of who she was, of who society perceived for her to be.</p><p>Agatha took Rio’s tongue as a hearty invitation and pried Rio’s mouth open with her own and licked all the way into Rio’s soft palate. Rio couldn’t help but moan at the sensation of Agatha’s tongue exploring her mouth like it was reuniting with an old best friend. One of her hands found its way into Agatha’s hair, her fingers carding through the tresses. She loved Agatha’s hair down. The soft thickness of it. The unruliness was in character.</p><p>Agatha was the one to break the kiss; Rio would have forgone breathing if it was what Agatha wanted. Rio was a few inches taller than Agatha, but the hard look in Agatha’s cobalt eyes made Rio’s inner self wither to a point where Agatha might as well have been towered over her. There was a tiny smudge on the bottom right of Agatha’s glasses, and Rio knew she would get in trouble and end their moment if she gingerly reached for them to clean.</p><p>When Agatha’s hands gripped Rio’s torso and slid down, Rio shivered as if she’d been thrown into the arctic buck-naked.</p><p>“Seems like you missed me,” Agatha teased, her voice low with what Rio wished to identify as lust. Maybe her neurons were swimming in too much boxed wine and projecting.</p><p>Rio could only breathe out, “Yeah,” in open agreement.</p><p>That’s when Agatha smirked and cupped Rio’s crotch. Rio felt the air in her lungs expel like a deflated balloon from her mouth; her moan was way too loud considering the circumstances, and extremely broken with desire. Agatha frowned, and the cute (<i>cute?</i>) lines in her face deepened as her other hand clamped over Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“You think you can be quiet for me?” Agatha barely asked above a whisper, her vocal chords vibrating just enough to carry her words into Rio’s ear to make the hair on her neck stand. Rio could only nod, worried that any verbal answer she gave would not satisfy Agatha’s demand for quiet.</p><p>Agatha murmured, “So obedient for me,” as she started to knead at the increasing bulge in Rio’s slacks. Rio nodded: like a dog, excited. Agatha’s eyes shot from Rio’s hips to her face when she then said, “Put your hands behind your back. Clasp them.”</p><p>Rio followed Agatha’s orders, which then caused her body to jut out minimally more. Her hips jerked uncontrollably when Agatha’s thumb swiped over a particularly sensitive section of Rio’s body. It’s as if every one of her nerves was being lit on fire and Agatha was running around with the glowing match.</p><p>When Agatha’s hand started to undo the zipper fly of Rio’s pants, the hiss that Rio emitted can be heard through the cracks of Agatha’s fingers encased over her mouth. Two layers of clothing between Rio and the warmth of Agatha’s hand was already a lot; when it became one, and Agatha started caressing Rio through her boxers, Rio wouldn’t help it. She whimpered, and her hips moved to the rhythm of Agatha’s squeezing fingers.</p><p>“You’re practically straining through your underwear,” Agatha said, amazement or maybe frustration laced in her tone. She put pressure on her hand that covered Rio’s face so Rio knew to lean down as Agatha rasped in her ear, “You’re pathetic. I’ve barely touched you, and we’re in public. Still a fucking freak, aren’t you?”</p><p>There was a little meanness to her tone that felt like toeing the line of playful and a true insult. Instead of turning her off, Rio - a bonafide lesbian - found it incredibly intoxicating that an older woman was essentially bullying her, and she twitched in the palm of Agatha’s spiteful hand.</p><p>“Guess that answers my question, darling.” Agatha started to separate her fingers, tracing them around the now-hard outline in Rio’s underwear, which now felt tight as all hell. Then a glint appeared in Agatha’s eye, and she started to take her hand away as she mused, “Do you even deserve this?”</p><p>Rio let out a whine as if to say <i>Yes!</i>, and she followed it with a thrust of her hips. Her nails dug into the wrist of her other hand as she kept them behind her back. Agatha added, “In a supply closet where anyone could walk in on you whimpering like a bitch in heat?” She leaned into Rio’s ear. “Dirty slut.”</p><p>Rio’s head moved of its own accord into the crook of Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha took it, her hand moving from Rio’s mouth to cradle the back, fingers threaded through Rio’s hair.</p><p>“You’re so big,” Agatha purred. “I still think about how deliciously you bruised my cervix.”</p><p>Rio choked back a moan, trying to be good. She panted into Agatha’s neck, to a point where Agatha chuckled and teased, “I can feel your drool.”</p><p>Rio felt herself getting close. She humped into Agatha’s palm, the older woman’s fingers kneading her hard length. “Can I come?”</p><p>“Of course you can. I like the idea of holding it over your head.”</p><p>It took a couple of moments, but soon enough Rio’s mouth opened in a breathless gasp as she creamed her underwear. Rio’s hands shot up to curl around Agatha’s neck and shoulders, afraid of losing her balance. She practically hung off of Agatha as she worked through her orgasm. Agatha massaged her cock until Rio finished and she grew soft. When Agatha took her hand off of Rio, Rio was sad at the loss of contact, and she backed up, straightened her back.</p><p>Agatha inspected the palm of her hand. Even in the light of the singular bulb with a chain switch hanging in the closet, Rio noticed the sheen of Agatha’s outstretched hand. Nothing too crazy - Rio hadn’t come so hard she’d spilled clean through her boxers - but Agatha’s palm was shiny with Rio’s spend.</p><p>All Agatha had to do was give Rio a look. A quirked eyebrow. Rio gently grasped Agatha’s wrist and drew out her tongue. She licked Agatha’s palm until it was shiny with her spit, instead.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha praised, and Rio felt her heart treacherously flutter.</p><p>When Rio began to slide her hands down Agatha’s torso suggestively, Agatha grabbed her wrists and practically wrenched them off her body. “You can owe me one,” she said, and Rio felt like she’d done something wrong; maybe she had. Agatha fluffed her hair out at her scalp, as if trying to make her hair look less like sex unruly and just normal unruly. “How does it look?”</p><p>“Really good,” Rio croaked, a stupid and silly frog.</p><p>“Put yourself together,” Agatha ordered, her hand on the doorknob. “I’ll get some paper towels in the bathroom across the hall from here. And then we can go back.”</p><p>“Smart.” Rio watched Agatha leave and tried not to feel ashamed. She then breathed in deeply.</p><p>Rio looked around, and when she saw one of those bulk packets of toilet paper, got an idea. She shamelessly ripped the plastic open and took a couple of squares before she looked down at her crotch. Her underwear was a pattern of little cartoon Woodstocks - which, fuck almighty, Agatha had <i>seen them</i> - on a mint green background. An obvious spot of Rio’s humiliating orgasm stained, but her pants looked fine, thank god.</p><p>Rio cleaned herself up as best as she could and then zipped her fly up. She looked normal from the outside, though for the next hour or so she had to stay in the office before she could maybe get away with an Irish goodbye, she was going to be uncomfortable, remembering the way Agatha had affected her.</p><p>And maybe that was what Agatha wanted.</p><p>When Rio exited the supply closet, she noticed Agatha already out, paper towels in hand.</p><p>“Do I look okay?” Rio asked.</p><p>A look Rio couldn’t scrutinize crossed Agatha’s face; it was gone before she could get a good look at it. Agatha licked her thumb and flattened a flyaway hair near Rio’s temple. “There.”</p><p>Once they made it back and cleaned up the spill, Agatha didn’t talk to her for the rest of the time she was there. Rio didn’t even notice her leave. When Rio, very chill-like, told Alice she noticed the Dean was gone, Alice shrugged and said, “Yeah, apparently something came up at home.”</p><p>Rio’s pants felt tight. She did her best not to pout, lest Alice ask suspicious questions. But there was a metaphorical rain cloud hanging over her head, full and gray, until she put her head on her pillow that night.</p><hr/><p>Fall Break was early here.</p><p>Rio was used to it being in October, which made sense, because October was a fully autumn month. One could argue it was <i>the</i> month for autumn - the trees were still brilliantly colorful, there was no Thanksgiving. Sure, there was Halloween, but that’s an autumn holiday. Thanksgiving only exists as a protective barrier so Christmas doesn’t snake its way into the fall season, though that certainly doesn’t stop grocery stores from selling inflatable snowmen and Santas starting in August.</p><p>Rio found her four-day weekend to straddle the end of September on the east coast. It annoyed her; three-fourths of September was technically <i>summer</i>. And they’d already had summer break. At the end of it all, though, the placement of the break didn’t matter. Rio spent it stress cleaning, anyway.</p><p>Toothbrush between the grout of the bathroom and kitchen (separate brushes, obviously, as she’s not a fucking animal). Dusting the baseboards. Fixing the bad outlets she was too lazy to call her landlord about. Rio had always started picking things apart when stressed - OCD had been one of the many things she’d been diagnosed with as a teenager until she got a doctor with two brain cells to rub together while in college and she finally got told she had autism.</p><p>Rio liked control. She liked order. It was important to her to know what happened next. This move had already been emotionally exhausting for her, but she knew the routine of an academic calendar like an old friend and took the job because it meant she could build her life up in a place while still keeping to her comforts. That was how it was <i>supposed</i> to go until Agatha Harkness showed up in Rio’s life again.</p><p>She was almost thankful when her mother asked to call. That’s how Rio’s mental state was. Not that she didn’t love her mother, but she was what her students would call a yapper and who her cousins called <i>tía chismosa</i>. Rio was also having to navigate the already complicated road of building your relationship with your parents as an adult, but being a trans lesbian on top of that.</p><p>She could remember when her father once asked her why she needed to transition if she was just going to wear men’s clothes and end up with a woman, anyway - but Rio gave her parents credit: they weren’t always caught up with the lingo, but they put in the effort and cared about her happiness foremost.</p><p>(And when Rio came to her mother her the tail of of her junior year of high school and cried, trying to explain that her body was changing in a way that made Rio want to cut herself open and crawl out like a hermit crab desperate to find a new home, her <i>mami</i> cried too, but wondering where she went wrong. And it took her until Rio found university-funded hormones her freshman year of college for her to realize, oh shit, this is what this kid looks like <i>happy</i>. And it also probably helped that Rio had two brothers and she was overjoyed to have a girl to dote on.)</p><p>Her mom didn’t understand FaceTime and would unintentionally exit out of the app too frequently for Rio to keep up with, so they stuck to phone calls with the occasional Zoom.</p><p>“Rio.” Her mother’s voice sounded tinny through the phone. Rio had her AirPods in and she was rearranging her spice cabinet. “How is your semester going? <i>¿Cómo has estado?” How have you been?</i></p><p>“It’s been pretty normal,” Rio lied. “Though Benito was telling me Mateo broke into the neighbor’s pool?”</p><p>Her mom was ten minutes into explaining the backstory of Rio’s through-the-grape-vine comment when she gasped. “Rio. <i>Deberías avergonzarte.” You should be ashamed of yourself.</i> “You distracted me. Are you trying to hide something? Did you get fired from your new job already?”</p><p>“<i>Mami</i>, no.” Rio pinched the bridge of her nose. “It’s just been very busy. If I told you everything that’s happened in the last few weeks, we’d be here for hours.”</p><p>“I’m retired,” her mom pointed out. “I have the time.”</p><p>“I’ve just been getting used to my students. Teaching lower level classes means I have to deal with the riff raff. Though there are a couple of students who like me,” Rio explained. She told her <i>mami</i> a respectable amount of details without getting too into it, but then she started complaining about how frequently the coffee machine in the departmental office kept breaking. And she was too much on a roll, she didn’t notice she started naming <i>names</i> until it was too late. “And Agatha kept placing my mug in the back of the communal cabinet last week, I <i>know</i> it was her -”</p><p>Her mother hummed. “Riooooo. Who is Agatha.”</p><p>“Agatha is my coworker,” Rio said. She sounded very normal and composed.</p><p>“And she’s the first woman you’ve named!” Rio’s mother then cooed. “Oh, <i>mijita</i>, I can hear you blushing.”</p><p>Rio slapped her cheek with the speed she went to inspect it. “Blushing doesn’t even make a sound.”</p><p>“Ay, but you checking does.” Rio’s mother let out a little giggle. Ugh. “So, what’s this Agatha like?”</p><p>“It’s not what you think it is,” Rio tried to explain. “She moves my things and glares at me and makes fun of me. And she’s rude. And pretentious.” Rio moved onto organizing the canned goods. “She makes fun of my research!”</p><p>“So she is pulling on your pigtails.” Rio’s mom tsked. “You should get a crush on somebody more emotionally mature, but I guess you got it from me. You know your <i>papi</i>.”</p><p>“I don’t have a crush!” Unless one counted it as soul-crushing; maybe then.</p><p>“Okay, <i>no es</i> crush.” There was a pause as Rio’s mom got to thinking. “<i>Mateo estaba usando una palabra de</i> Tikky-Tock. <i>Un</i> ‘situationship’?” <i>Mateo was using a word from</i> Tikky-Tock. <i>A</i> ‘situationship’?</p><p>Rio felt her heart drop into her dinosaur-slipper clad feet. “<i>Dios mío, Mami,</i> did Mateo even tell you what that word means? That’s not what this is.” It totally was. “You’re using that word incorrectly.” She was not. “Stop using lingo you learn from your fifteen-year-old son.” Sound advice.</p><p>“What’s it mean, then?” Her mother’s tone was a little haughty. Like she wanted to prove something.</p><p>Rio called her bluff. “It’s sexual. It’s like… in your telenovelas when two people hook up and say they’re not going to catch feelings but they do.”</p><p>Well, or one were to get their energy out by fucking their extremely hot coworker who they also fucked five years ago, and now, because they would be a self-flagellator if born in the thirteenth century, they like being around a woman who seems to barely tolerate them long enough for an orgasm. Though that wasn’t the definition Rio’s mother needed.</p><p>“Eugh.”</p><p>“I told you,” Rio said. “Has Mateo been telling you anything else?”</p><p>Another ten minutes of Rio having to painstakingly explain that she, also, did not fully understand what skibidi toilet was, and they ended their phone call when one of her mother’s neighbors came by with gossip of her own.</p><p>It was later that afternoon, when Rio was taking off the knobs of her stove to clean under them, that she decided to take a different approach to her long weekend. After screwing the godforsaken knobs back on, she went grocery shopping and spent twice as much as she normally did so that when she got home she could very understandably roll a couple of joints - the Mass weed wasn’t bad, though she did miss the beauty of a California bud - and play Legend of Zelda stoned until Sunday, which is when she allowed herself to sober up, eat some fiber, and catch up on her grading.</p><p>There was one singular moment of weakness where she masturbated in the shower, imagining the squeezing of her fist around her hard length as Agatha’s warm and smart mouth, instead, but it was an easily dismissable moment of weakness. If anything, the shower was the classiest place to pull one’s pork, and Rio was a lady with decorum and incredible mental fortitude.</p><p>Rio decided that when she went back to class, she would not fall to Agatha’s whims; her kite-high state of mind saw her as a smooth, stone wall, one Agatha would be unable to climb over or smash. She’d be undefeatable.</p><hr/><p>It was a month of Agatha teasing her before Rio shattered.</p><p>She hadn’t assumed Agatha was a very physical or touchy person, and to be quite frank, Rio still believed that. But lately, it seemed like Agatha was going out of her way to make the handful of moments a week they saw each other make getting drawn and quartered look like a stroll in the park. If Rio had the audacity to be at the office keurig the same time as her, Agatha would skirt her fingers across the small of Rio’s back as if she were some hulking dudebro at a bar. She’d shoulder check Rio as they passed each other in the halls leading towards their offices, raising an eyebrow, daring Rio to say something about it.</p><p>She’d stopped wearing as many ties and started keeping her shirt collars unbuttoned at the top two, which for the kind of dapper butch Agatha appeared to be, was <i>incredibly</i> slutty. Agatha was practically acting like she’d been raised in a barn; which, being part of the latchkey generation, maybe she very well had been.</p><p>And unlike Agatha, Rio had the very big problem of having to hide waist down if she went down the rabbit hole of desire Agatha seemed to enjoy choking her with. Rio, like anyone else with her anatomy who’d gone through puberty, was used to calming herself down to tamper down any untimely desire.</p><p>But there was something about Agatha that gave Rio’s body fault wiring; everything she’d known to do before wouldn’t work. Rio would be sitting at her desk, trying to think ‘naked grandma’-like thoughts, and then a thought would creep up on her like a hungry predator: did Agatha get as hot and bothered as Rio did? Rio couldn’t tell. Not only was Agatha fairly well-composed in demeanor, but she couldn’t get a boner.</p><p>No, Rio’s mind would conjure up an image of Agatha squirming in her office chair, thighs rubbing together. Rio remembered what the sweat-covered skin of those thighs tasted like. It was agony. Rio would have two options, at that point: take three times as long to cool down or grit her teeth and quickly jack off under her desk.</p><p>She’d already had to resort to the latter decision twice.</p><p>Now, it was about a week out from Halloween. Rio had plans to go with Alice and Jen to the renaissance fair three hours away (the distance and timing was in hopes to not run into students while inebriated). But before then, Rio needed to finish her midterm grading. She was incredibly close to outlawing computers in her classroom and making her students write everything with pen and paper, because what the fuck was this.</p><p>Rio was not stupid. The same 18-year-old student who had come to her the second week of class to ask how to take a screenshot on his two-thousand dollar Macbook had used the word ‘ameliorate’ correctly in his essay. She smelled a snake.</p><p>But there wasn’t much one could do to prove a student had used AI. Rio essentially gave them high Cs on their papers and decided she’d get nasty if any of them had the audacity to bring up wanting a better grade. Thankfully, this was only a handful of students - and the Venn diagram of students that were her queer little chickadees and the students that had excellent, human-written essays was a circle. She saved those essays for last, wanting to end on a good note.</p><p>When she finished, she checked her email one last time before heading out and saw that Agatha had emailed her a couple of minutes ago. <i>Hello, Dr. Vidal, I was perusing an article and thought it’d catch your interest…</i> Rio glanced down and saw the title. <i>Inconsistencies in Asgardian Folklore and Cultural Impacts: How and where do these stories differ, and what does that mean for the ‘canon’ of the mythos?</i></p><p>Rio gritted her teeth. There went her happy mood of saving her best papers for last. She was done with this nonsense; she was going to end it once and for all.</p><p>She knew Agatha was in the office when she saw a dim light peeking out from underneath the door. Rio didn’t even knock; she strode right in, internally grateful that Agatha was alone and her bursting in made a statement.</p><p>Agatha startled, her body jolting before she looked up and realized it was Rio. Her eyes had a sly sort of expression swimming around in them. “What are you doing here?” Her hair was in its signature professional French braid (nay) and she had her big, square framed glasses perched on her perfectly strong nose (yay). Rio wanted to lick her face.</p><p>Rio noticed Agatha’s desk was fairly blank of personal belongings. No cute paperweights. No framed pictures of partners. Hmm. “No picture of a beau?” Rio joked, and she motioned to Agatha’s desk.</p><p>“Do you really think I’d stroke you in a closet if I was taken?” Agatha said, and Rio just grinned, glad she had to explicitly admit it. “Anyway, I don’t put pictures of my family up here. It’s no one’s business.” Agatha then repeated, “You never answered my question.”</p><p>“Office hours are for my students,” Agatha chastised. Rio glanced down to see that Agatha was grading papers by hand.</p><p>Rio pointed. “It’s a miracle you haven’t gotten carpal tunnel. It’s faster to do it on the computer.”</p><p>Agatha only rolled her eyes at Rio’s statement. “Millennial’s attitude towards technology is going to make robots conquer the world in a matter of decades. I’m thankful I’ll probably be dead or drooling in a nursing home.”</p><p>“You should be thankful,” Rio said, “I’m about ten months away from technically being Gen Z.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and shakingly set her pen down, setting her head in her hands.</p><p>“Just like your students,” Rio continued, “so I only thought it was fair to stop by. It counts.”</p><p>“You’re certainly dressed like one.” Agatha sat up, back straight, and motioned to Rio’s outfit choice of a graphic tee over a collared shirt tucked into slacks and Doc Marten stompers. “Care to tell me what this ‘stopping by’ is for?”</p><p>Rio got to the chase. “You’re obsessed with me.”</p><p>Agatha sucked on her teeth, the <i>tsk</i>ing sound connected to it ringing around the office. Why did she grade in dead silence? Weirdo. “Excuse me? Are you delusional?”</p><p>“You’re emailing me.”</p><p>Agatha raised a stupidly pretentious and nicely shaped eyebrow. “I email many of my coworkers. What makes you think you’re so special?”</p><p>“Because you -” Rio felt like her body was going to crumble from beneath her like an aged and neglected statue. “You’re you! With your touching. Your humiliation.” Rio almost growled out her next words. “I didn’t even get to repay the favor.”</p><p>Rio noticed Agatha’s eye twitched at that. Rio grinned when the silence turned into the tips of Agatha’s ears growing red. When Rio’s tongue habitually wet her bottom lip, she could see that Agatha’s train of thought zeroed in on it.</p><p>Good. Wait - no, fuck, wasn’t her goal to <i>end</i> whatever the hell they had going on? But making Agatha blush like this… it was like fire running through Rio’s veins.</p><p>“It’s no bother,” Agatha said through grit teeth. She repositioned herself in her office chair, and Rio walked closer, her thighs cushioning themselves against Agatha’s desk. She stood loose.</p><p>Rio took the pen Agatha had been using and started twirling it between her fingers. It was a nice-looking fountain pen, and Rio knew from her meticulous (and slightly pathetic) paying attention Agatha manually refilled it with red ink to scratch her witty little comebacks on students’ mediocre writing samples. Rio appreciated the environmental aspect of it, even though she knew Agatha chose this method because of its pomposity. She was like one of those fluffed up little show dogs in that regard.</p><p>“You don’t seem like the type to not take what’s offered to you,” Rio observed. She gave Agatha an obvious once-over: another tailored suit. The blazer is fully open to show a matching vest, and, yes, there was a pocketwatch chain hanging from its pocket. Yet again, a pretentious motherfucker.</p><p>“You’re presuming.” Agatha leaned back in her chair, head cocked, and Rio got a chance to see one of her neck veins popping. Hopefully in irritation.</p><p>“It’s deductive reasoning.” Rio set the pen down. She walked around to the same side of the desk Agatha resided on. “When I fucked you, you took me for everything I’m worth. You don’t stop until <i>you</i> want to be done.” And then Rio got down on her knees and grasped the underside of Agatha’s chair to turn it towards her. When Agatha let her, Rio counted it as a huge victory. Agatha’s legs widened in a hot sort of manspreading fashion, and Rio placed her hand on one of Agatha’s thighs, lightly squeezing. She husked, “I just want to give.”</p><p>“And what makes you think you deserve that?” Agatha asked, though her blown eyes gave her away.</p><p>Rio chewed on her bottom lip for a moment before a thought rushed to her head and lit up every endorphin working overtime. “I just thought… you know, I’ve been trying to raise my grade, and…”</p><p>“Oh, god.” Agatha huffed out a breath of pitiful laughter, wiping sweat from her brow. “I can’t. Don’t do that. You’ll ruin the mood.”</p><p>“Sorry.” Rio was flushed for a multitude of reasons, now.</p><p>“Get up,” Agatha ordered. Rio jerked up as if she’d been a kitten picked up by the scruff of her neck. Agatha hummed. “Good girl. You going to do what I tell you?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio responded dazedly.</p><p>“Yes, what?”</p><p>Rio swallowed the enormous amount of spit she’d naturally collected in her mouth to keep from drooling when she said, “Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Lock the door.” Agatha’s voice became an octave lower.</p><p>Rio scrambled to the front of the office, and her hands as she clicked the lock in. She had expected Agatha to be in the midst of taking her pants off when Rio turned back, but she was in the same condition. Makes sense that she’d force Rio to do all the work.</p><p>Though Rio didn’t mind. She hurried back over to Agatha and instead of kneeling down again, bent over to mouth at Agatha’s jawline.  Rio could feel the muscles tense under it when Agatha muttered, “Don’t leave any marks.”</p><p>Rio whispered, “Yes, Sir,” right below Agatha’s ear and got to experience the way Agatha shuddered underneath her touch at that. Rio sucked on Agatha’s earlobe as she started to undo the buckle of Agatha’s belt.</p><p>“I’d make you beg if I had the time,” Agatha snapped, as if she needed to prove something.</p><p>That’s when Rio finally knelt: when she pulled down both Agatha’s slacks and her underwear. “Of course. Don’t worry, handsome, you’re still in charge.”</p><p>Rio lifted Agatha’s legs for a split second so that she was able to work her way underneath them and stand trapped between Agatha’s thighs, both of them too impatient to tug Agatha’s clothes off with her loafers still on. It would take too much time and effort - time and effort Rio definitely wanted to use elsewhere.</p><p>She slid Agatha by the backs of her thighs to get a better angle. Rio then took her fingers and spread Agatha’s lower lips, peeling them back from the now-sticky thatch of hair that protected them. Her bush had gray patches speckled in it: a salt and pepper carpet to match the drapes.</p><p>And Rio thanked all the stars above that Agatha still had her clitoral piercing - it glistened with Agatha’s arousal and made it much more obvious how harshly she was twitching. She wondered how and when Agatha got the piercing - she gave off huge vibes of rebellious college girl. Rio watched the jewelry bob up and down as Agatha dripped onto her leather chair.</p><p>Rio’s mouth watered. Rio could smell Agatha’s musk, heavy with desire and sweat, and it clouded her senses.</p><p>“Hurry the fuck up,” Agatha barked out, and she took Rio by the hair and tugged.</p><p>Rio pushed forward until she could feel Agatha’s wetness on the tip of her nose, and she wasted no time in darting her tongue out to catch what she could. Agatha still tasted like everything Rio had hoped for. She knew she was doing a good job by the strength and direction with which Agatha pulled her hair.</p><p>“Easier to handle your hair when it’s this length,” Agatha mentioned, her blunt nails scraping Rio’s scalp. “Did you think of that when you cut it, darling?”</p><p>Rio moaned when she started sucking on Agatha’s clit, tugging on the sterling silver jewelry right next to it, and could hear the older woman restrain from a loud moan in response. It was then that Rio wished they were in a more private or secluded room (a bedroom, Rio thought treacherously, but then quickly pushed away such an intimate idea). An Agatha that was allowed to be vocal was one that Rio desperately dared to dream of experiencing again.</p><p>She then moved her two fingers to Agatha’s entrance, teasing. Rio looked up from her ministrations and shot Agatha a toothy grin when she realized Agatha was glaring at her, wondering what the hell she’d stopped for.</p><p>“I just have a question,” she started.</p><p>Agatha grunted. “How important must it be?” Rio was delighted to hear that Agatha was trying to knit her words together in a nonchalant fashion. And her glasses were slightly askew. Oh, she was affected.</p><p>“It is to me,” Rio countered.</p><p>“Then get on with it, dammit.”</p><p>Rio started to brush her fingers against Agatha’s drooling hole, and then back up her slit. Down again to where Agatha wanted her. It was less about collecting the natural lubrication and more about teasing. It was about how good it felt to Rio herself.</p><p>“When you fucked yourself the night after the office party, did you picture the fingers inside you spelling ‘MORS’ or ‘VITA’?”</p><p>Agatha vocally growled at this, as if she were a feral animal fighting for a meaty bone. “I should -”</p><p>Rio didn’t give Agatha the dignity of finishing her thought before inserting two fingers inside her, and Agatha’s sharp words turned into a shattered, stain-glass gasp. Rio had to bite back a moan at how wet and open Agatha was, trying to be mindful of where they were.</p><p>She could get lost in how warm it felt to be inside Agatha. Instead, Rio brought her mouth back down and started pushing Agatha’s vertical clitoral hood piercing with her tongue, letting it bob back and forth and create friction the way she remembered Agatha enjoyed it. Agatha grunted through her orgasm, biting into the sleeve of her blazer. Rio hoped she had teeth marks on her arms from how hard she had to clench her jaw.</p><p>Rio didn’t slow down her movements; she sped up as Agatha rode out her climax. Not astronomically so - she still wanted enough pressure involved to scrape her fingertips across the spongy parts of Agatha’s vaginal walls, still wanted Agatha to feel every thrust. The priority was dexterity, not girth or strength. Rio knew her plan was working when Agatha’s sounds started to pitch, her well-maintained groans turning into desperate whines.</p><p>Rio lifted her head from Agatha’s cunt, and she felt its remnants drooling down her chin and quickly drying in the cool air. Rio saw how Agatha’s braid was a bit frayed, some stray hairs having come loose from their confines and undone like the woman who carried them.</p><p>Rio replaced her tongue with her thumb and opened her big mouth. “You got it, pretty boy.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes split open, her eyes the kind of angry blue fire historians studied in mythological scrolls tucked deep into unknown tombs. When the loudest sound in the room became a sopping kind of squelch, Rio grinned just as wetly.</p><p>“Oh, is the seemingly composed professor going to squirt all over her office chair? Hope you’ve got some nice cleaner in here.”</p><p>She could tell Agatha wanted to say something, but then Rio curled her fingers in a way that had her entire body seize up. Rio squared her shoulders and spread Agatha’s thighs with strong forearms, not allowing Agatha’s thighs to clench in overstimulation.</p><p>When the first gush of Agatha’s orgasm spurted out, her body went limp as she subconsciously decided to ride the wave. So while continuing to pump her fingers in and out of Agatha, Rio took her free hand and slipped her pointer finger underneath Agatha’s clit and began to flick it where she knew it’d probably be the most sensitive.</p><p>Agatha had already succumbed to the white noise of loosening her body up and so she was unable to control the way her thighs spasmed at Rio’s decision; she could only cover her mouth with both of her hands as more liquid pushed out of her and pooled beneath her ass cheeks onto her leather chair.</p><p>“You look so handsome like this,” Rio cooed. She began to slow her movements. “So compliant for me.”</p><p>Rio knew Agatha had gotten over the peak of her climax when her growls started to carry more vocal gravel in them and became more solidified. Still, Rio was surprised when Agatha somehow managed to shuck her pants off past her shoes and get up on shaky legs, tugging Rio by the roots of her hair until her forehead slammed not-so-nicely into the lip of the desk. Rio hadn’t even had time to suck Agatha’s come off of her fingers, which was fairly rude.</p><p>“Hey!” Rio complained, and she rubbed her temple. “I’m gonna get a knot there.”</p><p>“Get the fuck up.” Agatha was even kind enough to keep her grip on Rio’s hair firm so that when she yanked her arm up, she essentially helped Rio stand.</p><p>Rio was upright for about two milliseconds before she sawAgatha swipe across the desk to clear it. Then Rio felt an arm cross perpendicular to her back before it slammed her onto the desk. Rio then heard some shuffling, and she tried to turn her head around and peek, but Agatha moved her hand up to the crown of Rio’s head and pushed her back down. About thirty seconds later, Rio’s head was freed. She didn’t get another chance to look, though, as Agatha yanked her arms behind her back and secured them with something silky soft around her wrists.</p><p>It hit Rio: Agatha had undone her own tie with one hand and was now restraining Rio with it. Rio had no choice but to scoot forward on the desk so she didn’t lose her balance. She also spread her legs for a wider stance.</p><p>“Already begging for me to touch you,” Agatha grunted, and she palmed Rio’s ass. Rio whimpered, her body grinding into the touch.</p><p>“Fuck me,” Rio begged. Her back instinctively arched at the thought, which bared herself more to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Do you know what the lordosis reflex is, sweetheart?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched, because she did. She mustered up a small nod.</p><p>“Right.” Agatha’s fingers traveled down Rio’s back; Rio could feel gooseflesh rise in the shape of the way Agatha trailed her hand. “Tilting the pelvis up to show sexual receptiveness. But that’s from non-primates, baby. Humans who do it are just desperate whores.”</p><p>Rio’s hips jumped into Agatha’s touch at the degradation, and she voiced a little whine.</p><p>“Not yet, pretty girl.” Agatha’s hand moved to cup Rio’s ballsack before pressing her fingers in just enough that Rio had to choke back her yelp. Instead, a mangled gargling sound came from her mouth. Agatha’s hand wandered up and started to undo Rio’s belt. When the tongue was loose from the buckle, Agatha wasted no time and dipped her hands into Rio’s pants.</p><p>“This fly is way too casual,” Agatha muttered. “Practically glorified jeans.”</p><p>“I’ll have you know I dress very professionally -” Rio lost the rest of her sentence in her scrambled brain as Agatha cupped her hardened length through her boxers. “Um.”</p><p>“Saying something, sweetheart?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, grabbed with her hands as if they were in reach of anything productive. “G-go under.”</p><p>“Why should I do that? Do you think you deserve it?” Agatha’s finger swirled around where the tip of Rio’s cock was pointed. Rio had a feeling that even under the layer of sheer clothing, Agatha could feel the sticky precum she’d begun to leak.</p><p>“I made you come?” Rio could still taste Agatha’s pussy on her breath.</p><p>“Sounds like a question, not an answer.”</p><p>Rio mustered enough strength in her voice and stated, “I made you come. Multiple times, actually.”</p><p>“There we go. Good girl, using her words.” Agatha dipped her hand and brushed over bare skin. Rio wasn’t even able to remember the language she was supposed to be using to form words for a witty comeback; she simply groaned as Agatha lightly stroked her.</p><p>“I think I’ll be nice,” Agatha said, and then her hand went away. This confused Rio - who did not comprehend how being <i>nice</i> could go in tandem with <i>stopped touching me<i> - until Agatha pulled down Rio’s pants and underwear so that she’s naked from the waist down. Well, naked enough. “I figured I’ve already made you spoil your pants while dry humping multiple times.” Agatha chuckled at that, and Rio easily pictured Agatha’s smirk, the way she was probably darting out her tongue to wet her lips at the memory. “I’ll give you a little dignity with a handjob for this one.”</i></i></p><p>
<i>
<i>“Thanks,” Rio grumbled.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“You’re welcome,” Agatha said, sweet in voice but extremely condescending in tone. She held Rio’s dick from behind, which had hung from gravity when freed from its confines and was easy enough to grab. “Wait, what’s this?”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Oh, yeah. Rio hadn’t gotten the piercing until <i>after</i> the Agatha fiasco. One could even say the Agatha fiasco <i>was</i> the catalyst. She’d gotten what was traditionally called a frenum piercing; the piece of sterling silver jewelry was snug against the underside of her penis, about an inch below the head.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“It’s been over five years,” was what Rio answered with. “Surely you knew I couldn’t stay the exact same.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Hmm.” Agatha flicked the piercing with the back of her finger, which caused Rio to jump. “If I knew any better, I might say somebody’s a copycat.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio strained her neck to turn around and look Agatha in the eye. “Actually, I decided to get it because when I fuck a woman doggy style, it can scrape up against her G-spot and make her see stars.” Rio managed a haughty smirk. “Want a demonstration?”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Cute.” Agatha smacked Rio’s bare ass. Rio squealed as discreetly as she could, having to turn her head back around and lay it on the desk so that she could concentrate on keeping her hips as still as possible as to not appear as desperate as she really was. Fuck, she was probably failing so badly. Agatha started to lightly pump Rio’s cock. “Now, how many strokes until you… Hmm, wait, I don’t want you to make a mess on my carpet, actually.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Agatha,” Rio cried, and she started to squirm, afraid of the thought of getting edged or denied an orgasm.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Stop whining,” Agatha ordered. “I’m not taking anything away from you.” Rio slumped, letting the desk hold most of her weight again. There was a shuffling noise. Agatha was still holding Rio, still massaging the hard cock in her hands. And then Agatha was sliding something onto her like a condom, but it was thicker and heavier.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Is that a <i>sock?</i>” Rio tried to stand as best she could without her arms to balance her. “Agatha, I’m not a fucking teenager.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Well, if you want to come, it’s this or nothing.” Agatha’s strokes got rougher and faster. “You want that, don’t you, baby?”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio felt tears prick in her eyes. She grit her teeth. The term of endearment felt like a knife poking her skin, ready to sink in. Agatha must have decided that Rio was taking too long to answer, because she suddenly wrapped her other hand around Rio’s waist and, while holding Rio’s dick in the other, took her palm and rubbed flat, tight circles around the head of Rio’s cock.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Even with a layer in between, Rio squealed embarrassingly, as the other option would have been a shriek. The words spilled out of her. “Okay, yes, yes sir, please let me come -”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>A deep rumble in Agatha’s chest. “You’re so easy. Pathetic.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>The insult rattled around in Rio’s brain momentarily before shooting straight to her core as she felt herself tumbling into an orgasm. She felt the warmth of it surround her, in the fucking sock of all places. She tried to hide facedown in the desk, her cheeks pink in humiliation, but Agatha instantly caught on and read her body language like a fluent speaker. Agatha tugged on Rio’s hair to keep her face up. Rio squeezed her eyes shut as her hips jerked and she throbbed in Agatha’s hold.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“I’m not done with you.” With one hand, Agatha undid the knot holding Rio’s hands together. “Turn around.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio got up on shaking legs and turned on her heel to face Agatha, who looked the same but sans one sock, one of her feet nestled in her slip-on loafers that probably cost the same as Rio’s monthly grocery bill. She cupped her soft crotch with both hands like she was in the locker room. “Um… what do you want me to do with the sock?”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Agatha said, “Keep it on, obviously. Now hop up on the desk.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio maneuvered herself onto the desk using only one arm out for balance. When Agatha inserted herself between Rio’s spread legs, Rio naturally wrapped her legs around Agatha’s hips.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Show me your hole, you slut,” Agatha ordered, wrenching Rio’s legs back apart. “I know you want to.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>And Agatha was right. Rio lifted her cock and ballsack back and up so Agatha had an unobstructed view.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“There we go.” Two of Agatha’s fingers lightly scraped the sensitive skin of Rio’s taint, and then, in a surprising and incredibly mean moment, Agatha took her forefinger and thumb and lightly pinched the area. Even with blunt, filed nails, the lightning strike of a sensation made Rio hiss in surprise as the elbow she had propped herself up on immediately failed in keeping her up. Her back hit the desk painfully.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Agatha tutted. “Don’t be dramatic.” Then she lifted one of her hands to her mouth and gently spit a large spurt of saliva onto her index and middle fingers. Putting her other hand on Rio’s stomach, Agatha started to massage the entrance of Rio’s pink, throbbing hole.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Oh my god,” Rio rushed out. She swore she could feel the air leave her lungs for good.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha muttered, and it didn’t take her too long to slip in her pointer finger to the first knuckle. “What a pitiful little toy, desperate to be used.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Yeah. Yeah, yes.” Rio wasted no time acting like Agatha had said anything wrong; she had no issue being humiliated if it meant pleasure. “Oh, fuck - you… you could put your other finger in.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“I’m going to paint a picture. You tell me if I’m wrong.” Agatha pumped her one finger in and out a few times before slipping her middle finger in comparatively easy, spreading Rio open. Rio’s throat tensed up with the hybrid moan-scream that was dying to catapult from her lips, dry from open-mouth panting for so long. She licked them, and Agatha’s eyes watched. Her eyes darkened, the kind of ocean storm where a lighthouse became mandatory for survival.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Agatha started. “I graciously gave you a few clothed strokes in the supply closet and you pathetically came in whatever clearance rack pants you’d worn to the department fresher. You left as quickly as socially acceptable and drove home all tense before finding the biggest cock in your toy collection so that you could impale yourself on it wishing it were me. You stretched your slutty pussy wishing I was there to talk you through it.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio had actually waited about 48 hours before lustful urgency had clouded any ounce of shame she’d worn, but other than that, Agatha had essentially gotten it correct. She felt a wet tear slide down her cheek.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Aww, poor baby. Embarrassed I read you like a book? Hope you don’t have a class after this.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio shook her head. Agatha had been her last stop of the day. She blurted out, “Harder.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Harder, <i>what?</i>”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio’s voice turned watery as she choked, “Harder, sir.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Agatha’s lips turned into a sharklike grin and she huffed humorously. She bent her wrist so that she could thrust her hips as momentum, curling her fingers inward. Rio whimpered and watched as Agatha took her other hand and positioned it to where she could rub her own clit as she pushed in and out.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Shit.” Agatha grunted. “You feel so fuckin’ good and tight. Wish I had something bigger to destroy your stupid cunt.” She massaged her fingers upwards, which got her to coax her prostate gland.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio squeaked as her body felt like it was light aflame. Agatha’s dirty talk was somehow both humiliating and euphoric. Her free hand stretched down to try and latch onto the end of Agatha’s blazer, but the older woman immediately smacked it away (“No wrinkling my clothes, pretty girl.”), so Rio instead clamped her hand onto her mouth so she could let out some of the moans bubbling uncomfortable in her chest.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Agatha grinned at the way Rio writhed and whimpered under her. She bent over the desk so her face was inches from Rio's and said, “You’re so cute when you cry like that, sweetheart. Why don’t you start stroking yourself for me?”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio could feel her cock was stiffer than it was a few minutes ago, ready to be touched again. She took herself in her hand, sock still covering, and began with small, slow movements. Her hips moved to the rhythm of Agatha’s fingers, which sped up as Agatha became more harsh and deep with her movements.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio felt something boiling inside her. Her thighs started to uncontrollably tremble. Her hand instinctively pumped faster as her heart stuck and bobbed around in her throat.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“I’m getting close,” she told Agatha.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Agatha stared down at her with wild eyes: the kind of sky meteorologists warned you about the weather for. “Me first.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>The way Agatha practically thrusted into her own hand to get some friction for herself meant that Rio felt that thrust, too. Two fingers certainly wasn’t the girthiest or longest thing Rio had taken, but the way Agatha was moving her fingers as if she knew the exact spot that made Rio thrash under the older professor.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio almost wept when Agatha’s movements became unrhythmic and jerkish, knowing she would get to come soon. She was practically windmilling on the edge of the cliff.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Even half-clothed, Agatha looked stunning as her body seized into orgasm. Her jaw tensed and she tilted her head back, showing off a neck Rio wished she had the privilege to mark as hers. A vein popped from it. Rio stroked herself faster, and her responding whimpers were loud enough that Agatha cracked her eyes open, and, through hooded lids, whispered, “There you go. You got it, sweet thing.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio’s legs clamped around Agatha’s hips and her climax tore through her. Her thighs burned. And then she felt the wool of the sock in her hand grow just not sticky, but <i>wet</i>, and that was when she realized this orgasm felt different. More powerful. It made Rio dizzy. Her cum wasn’t thick and sticky, but gushing and seeping through the sock as if she’d pissed herself. Agatha slowly pulled her fingers out, and Rio’s cheeks flamed as a sad cry slipped from her lips before she could stop it.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Agatha smirked, her own orgasm having receded enough that she gave Rio her undivided attention. Her eyes were practically boring into Rio’s trembling soul. “You squirt just for me?”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio tried to find her voice. Begged her vocal chords to work with her in this moment. “I -” Rio knew it was anatomically possible, especially when messing around with a prostate, but… “I’ve never actually done that before.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“Lucky me.” Agatha’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. She looked down to assess how Rio was physically faring. “You think you can sit up?”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“G-give me a second.” Rio needed to catch her breath. Her stomach was tied into so many knots. She realized she’d need both hands to get her body to follow her instructions, and so she peeled the sock off, hissing at how sensitive she still was. It wasn’t until this moment Rio even realized its color: a burnt sort of beige.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Spent, her dick was soft and wet. Setting the sock in her lap, Rio dazedly sat up and watched as Agatha took that as her signal to separate herself from Rio. Rio got to see Agatha’s bent over and bared ass for a few seconds before she shuffled her hipsters and pants back on, not even bothering to take her shoes off first.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Agatha then walked back over to Rio, noticed the sock, and swiped it, opening up her blazer jacket to gingerly place it in the interior pocket. “I’ll take that.”</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio stammered. “I mean… it <i>is</i> yours.” She had to carefully get off the desk and test one foot at a time to make sure she didn’t slip and fall. She felt the muscles in her calves and thighs twitching, but ignored them so she could start putting her shed clothes back on.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>A moment of quiet, and then:</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>“I’m gonna wash my hands,” Agatha announced, and to Rio it sounded too much like <i>I’m going to take a long time doing so, so be gone when I get back</i>.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio had to observe Agatha’s shoulders widen as she turned to leave the room yet again. She felt like her chest was being hollowed out with a paring knife. It hit her, then, that Agatha was always the one to end their conversation, their interaction. Maybe it was because Rio was the type to hold her hand over a flame until her skin blistered. The heat alone wasn’t enough; she had to feel the burn.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Was she stupid? Rio already knew the drill; she was going to drive home in uncomfortably tight pants and nurse a beer. She was going to tell herself this wouldn’t happen again, that next time Agatha propositioned her, she would either reject it or stop shoving her heart into the woodchipper. But then that time would come where Agatha would look at her with steel wool eyes and Rio would be helpless and hand Agatha her heart anyway.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Agatha was almost two decades older than her, completely stabilized in her career, and had that sort of butch swagger Rio was simultaneously hard for and jealous of. Meanwhile, Rio was just starting out and teaching kids practically the same generation as her, and she still felt immense guilt when having to tell the waitstaff they got her order wrong.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Logically, it made sense Agatha only saw her as a bit of stress relief, but it still ached. Rio still remembered waking up after that night at the hotel, instantly knowing she was going to be shattered by the way she woke up cold and in a dead silence. If she had been naive to think Agatha would want something then, Rio must be heartsickeningly dense now.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>Rio needed to be better. She felt smooth until she got around Agatha; then it was like she was flailing in the deep end, like the water was somehow getting into her ears and drowning her brain. She needed some time and fucking distance.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>She zipped the fly of her pants and kept the door to Agatha’s office door open, so Agatha wouldn’t even have to wonder if she’d stayed around or not. Why give Agatha a few seconds of anticipation, of an aching and scared heart having to push the door open herself.</i>
</i>
</p><p>
<i>
<i>No, Rio was nice enough to shoulder that burden for her.</i>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio tried to be good; she really did, but she kept having sex with Agatha.</p><p>It never took place in any sort of setting that could be considered intimate: the bathroom, either one of their offices— one very daring time in the park as Rio pretended to read a book under a tree, a blanket draped over her lap. It also never… well, got far enough to where Rio was properly inside Agatha again.</p><p>Agatha kept it to hand and mouth stuff— and Rio was fine with that. God, was she fine with that, if she ignored the ache deep inside her that wanted more. Not just physically, but emotionally, too. Because the more they hung out, even if it was under the pretenses of sex, the more Rio found out about Agatha. Her favorite band was The Cure. She jaywalked to an absurd concerning degree. She had the cilantro soap gene (this one made Rio’s heart sad).</p><p>Did Agatha find out little bits and pieces of Rio, too? Did she think about what Rio’s favorite color was? Did she try to guess - and was she correct?</p><p>There were a few times where Rio rejected Agatha, or stifled her own urges. She tried to find joy when Agatha’s eyes would widen in shock, and then say nothing. Like, <em>yeah, how about a taste of your own fuckin’ medicine</em>. But instead, Rio just felt empty. One can decide to play fewer rounds of Russian roulette, but they were still holding a loaded gun to their head.</p><p>It was the end of finals week. Mid-December. Rio felt like tearing her hair out. She had started grading the earliest final tests and essays from her students and wanted to be thankful ChatGPT spat out incorrect answers when her students inevitably asked it the fucking color of the sky instead of using their own eyes, or whatever - but she also wanted to make it legal for teachers to hit a certain amount of students per semester. They were adults. It was fine.</p><p>Her second-year students were better at not using it than her first-year students, but it made her exhausted and her mental wellbeing might as well have been a frayed rope trying to hold a two-ton weight attached to it. One of those cartoonish ones that would hit a Looney Tunes character on the head.</p><p>There was a department-wide meeting to discuss the textbook changes for next semester; not that it mattered to Rio since this was her first year, anyway, but she was forced to go.</p><p>They were in an unused classroom with some administrator Rio didn’t know explaining why they’d decided to change a few words in the textbook and switch a few of the chapters around.</p><p>“We’re not going to be teaching the 100-level classes in chronological order,” the lady explained, “but by location. Continents and such.”</p><p>Well that was fucking stupid, and Rio made a mental note to read the textbook over the break so that she could put things in the correct order. Great, more unnecessary work.</p><p>The woman in the front was also explaining that the textbooks were only available online now, and they were going to use a particular website to host the textbook because they’d done a business deal with the school.</p><p>“This is bullshit,” Agatha muttered, sitting at the table adjacent to Rio. Jen, who was sitting beside Agatha, glared with a <em>cut it out</em> expression.</p><p>But Rio liked the way Agatha had the ability to turn a spring breeze into a summer windstorm. “I agree,” she whispered, tilting her head just so. Agatha’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Who the hell orders something by location? What is this, Geoguessr?” Agatha tipped her chair back so Rio could hear her better. “I think we should take whatever corporate losers came up with this and toss ‘em into the ocean plank style.”</p><p>“Does someone have a question?” asked the woman at the front.</p><p>Agatha, never one to let bait linger, said more loudly, “Yeah, I was just wondering when this would be over ‘cause I have to use the bathroom.”</p><p>Rio held her head in her hands shamefully, and she spent the rest of the meeting with blood rushing in her ears.</p><p>When the presentation was over and the room broke off into smaller groups to talk, the first clear sentence Rio heard was Jen telling Agatha, “I can’t believe you, seriously.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha’s tone was dubiously innocent. “I actually did have to go.”</p><p>Rio dared to take a glance. Jen raised her eyebrow. “And?”</p><p>Agatha just shrugged. “I don’t have to go anymore.”</p><p>That’s when Jen noticed Rio eavesdropping. She pointed a finger. “And you.”</p><p>Rio pointed a finger right back. At her own self, that is. “Me?”</p><p>“Don’t egg her on.”</p><p>“I’m fairly certain she eggs herself on,” Rio joked.</p><p>“If y’all are gonna flirt…” Jen motioned to the two of them, “Then at least do it where I don’t have to see it.”</p><p>“Flirt?” Rio chuckled nervously just as Agatha gasped a dramatic, “<em>Perdón?</em> I’m a professional, thank you very much.”</p><p>“I’m going to see if anyone needs help putting the projector back up,” Rio said, as if that was a problem people could actually have.</p><p>She was halfway across the room to ask the woman - yes, Rio had forgotten her name, no judgement - when someone stopped her.</p><p>“Hey, Rio?” Rio turned around to see Lilia. “Haven’t seen you in a bit.”</p><p>“Yeah, classes keep me pretty busy.”</p><p>“I would much rather say this when it’s just the two of us, but I haven’t been able to catch you.” Lilia looked a bit perturbed. “I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t buy clothing on your university credit card. It’s meant for educational purposes and work travel expenses.” Lilia then shrugged noncommittally. “Or at least don’t be so obvious about it. I mean, sixty dollar socks?”</p><p>“What?” Rio blinked, her mind blank. She didn’t buy a pair of sixty dollar socks on her university credit card.</p><p>But then it hit her - there was someone who <em>would</em>. Someone who was in this room currently, even.</p><p>Not wanting to make a scene in front of Lilia, Rio just sighed. “Sorry. It was an honest mistake. I could pay you back if you think - ”</p><p>“Nah.” Lilia waved a hand. “Sixty bucks is pocket change, even to a school as small as this one. Just don’t make it a pattern. I just wanted to let you know it happened.”</p><p>Rio fought the blush creeping up her neck as Lilia marched along to go talk to someone else. And even though she’d just come up with a horribly executed excuse as to why she had to leave Agatha’s presence, she found herself pulled right back in, a stupid little moon revolving around its planet.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness.” Rio plastered on the fakest smile of her life. It was probably extremely obvious. “Can I talk to you for a second? In the hallway?”</p><p>“Sure thing.” Agatha grinned and sauntered into the much more secluded hallway.</p><p>The second she was sure they were out of earshot, Rio hissed, “Putting socks on my card? Seriously?”</p><p>Agatha just tilted her head condescendingly. “Well, you’re the one who ruined my sock. I can’t wash that out of wool.”</p><p>Rio’s teeth began to instinctively grind against each other. “And whose idea was that? How did you get my card, anyway?”</p><p>Agatha mimed zipping her lips and tossing the key behind her back. Rio growled and before she could stop herself, her hand shot out and grabbed Agatha’s wrist. Rio heard Agatha suck in a quick, quiet gasp, and her eyes naturally glanced towards Agatha’s lips. Did they somehow look fuller today, or was Rio just hallucinating her desired outcome? Agatha’s bottom lip then nestled itself between her teeth.</p><p>When Rio’s eyes tracked up to meet Agatha’s, Agatha wore a mirthful expression.</p><p>“Seriously, you two?” Jen’s voice echoed in the empty space, now occupied by three people.</p><p>Rio shoved her hands into her pants - the <em>pockets!</em> - and avoided eye contact.</p><p>“We were just discussing the textbook, <em>Kale</em>.” Agatha dusted off her lapels and flipped her long hair (yes, she was wearing it down today, much to Rio’s enjoyment) behind her shoulder.</p><p>“Well, maybe get a room,” Jen snarked.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Right. You know, I recall a budget meeting two years ago when I went to use the bathroom and walked into - ”</p><p>“Okay.” Jen held up her hand in defeat. “But seriously, have some fucking decorum.”</p><p>When it was just the two of them again, Agatha’s face turned mischievous as she asked, “Wanna go to your place and talk about what order we should teach this stupid textbook?”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio was a bit surprised.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Unless you have other plans.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Not really. Two people working on it will make it so much less work, anyway. Do you want me to text you my address?”</p><p>“Why don’t I just follow you?” And then Agatha purred, “I’m pretty good at following instructions.”</p><p>“No you aren’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth turned down. “Still… can’t be that hard. Seriously.”</p><p>The drive to Rio’s house was less than ten minutes, but it felt like thrice that length. Rio was so nervous she was using words like <em>thrice</em>. But thankfully, it was still a few hours before the traditional rush hour, so Rio was pulling up into the driveway to her townhouse in no time.</p><p>Her fingers fiddled on her steering wheel until she saw a pair of headlights in her rearview mirror. Agatha had been about two or three minutes behind her. Of course, Rio had to look at her car; even with the dim dusk sky, Rio could tell it was some sort of Mercedes. Of course. She got out of her car and manually locked her car, because fobs were for snobs.</p><p>When Agatha stepped out of her own vehicle, she raised an eyebrow. “Decided to wait for me?”</p><p>“You weren’t that far behind,” Rio countered.</p><p>“Hmm, okay.” Agatha motioned for Rio to lead.</p><p>It was almost odd, having Agatha behind her as Rio led her up to her front door. Rio was used to being the one following Agatha, usually to whatever sexcapade they had decided on moments prior.</p><p>Rio noticed something and turned back to Agatha. “You not gonna lock your car?”</p><p>“It automatically locks if the keys are a certain distance from it,” Agatha explained, and, oh yeah, they were in different tax brackets.</p><p>When Rio got to her door, she found the correct key on her carabiner and whipped her head around again as Agatha snickered. “Got something to say?”</p><p>Agatha pointed. “You’re gay.”</p><p>Rio just rolled her eyes and muttered, “Fuckin’ hope so.”</p><p>As they walked in, Rio was thankful her townhouse was tidy enough to be called “lived in” and not “fucking mess”. Mainly because she’d spent the last week stress cleaning.</p><p>“So.” Rio shut the door behind Agatha, locking it. “About the textbook reordering. I was thinking -”</p><p>Rio didn’t even get to finish before Agatha slammed her against the door and kissed her. They didn’t always kiss when hooking up, so it shocked Rio at first, and her instinct was to melt into the softness of Agatha’s lips. Her hands naturally found themselves gripping Agatha’s waist when Agatha bit down on Rio’s bottom lip.</p><p>Before Agatha could even think about shoving her tongue in Rio’s mouth, and therefore making Rio lose all motor functioning skills, she cupped Agatha’s face and slightly pushed it back so she had the ability to say, “Um, I thought we were going to discuss the order of the chapters like you said?”</p><p>“Darling, you can’t possibly think that’s why I wanted to come here.” Agatha stared into Rio’s eyes, which must be showing some degree of genuinity, because she chortled. A soft, almost undetectable snort. Rio’s heart swelled as Agatha smiled and stated, “No, I want to celebrate.”</p><p>“Oh. Did your students do well on their finals?”</p><p>Agatha actually laughed at that. “They did as they normally do. No, my mother died.”</p><p>The flippancy it was said with made Rio’s head spin. Now, she was like any other lesbian <em>and</em> transgender person and had a complex and multi-layered relationship with her parents. But at least her parents accepted her and wanted her to be happy at the end of the day.</p><p>Even with Rio’s social aptitude of a drunk lemur, she gathered why Agatha was grinning. “Was she a homophobic cunt or something?”</p><p>“Made Reagan look like RuPaul.” Agatha’s hand traveled to Rio’s pants, her fingers toying with the waistline. “And I figured, well, I might as well spend the day of her death having incredibly hot, lesbian sex.”</p><p>Rio’s mind whirred, both at Agatha’s words and her touch. “Wait, she died <em>today?</em>”</p><p>“At like four in the morning. In her sleep.” Agatha sighed. “I wish one of the nursing home employees had strangled her instead. She would’ve deserved it.” She stepped back a bit to give Rio a once-over, and then groaned. “God, I have got to suck you off.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio wasn’t complaining. “Yeah… fuck, okay.”</p><p>Agatha shucked Rio’s Carhartt jacket off, and Rio allowed it to fall to the floor without picking it up. Then, she quickly unbuttoned the patterned shirt Rio had worn to work that day and slid it off her shoulders, leaving Rio just in her sports bra waist-up.</p><p>That’s when Agatha got on her knees.</p><p>It was a pretty sight. Rio had never regretted not having a photographic memory more than in this moment. Agatha’s fingers brushed over Rio’s happy trail as she absentmindedly murmured, “You’re so hot.”</p><p>Rio’s abs tensed at that as her hips bucked, her body and mind both begging for more. Agatha shoved down Rio’s pants like they were personally offending her, and she pressed a kiss to Rio’s clothed cock tucked into her boxers.</p><p>Rio squirmed under the intimate action, not because she disliked it, but because she wanted more and knew how pathetic she would look if she asked for more. Agatha pulled down the boxers quickly and Rio’s length sprung free. She immediately grasped the hard cock in her hand and languidly stroked it languidly.</p><p>“Agatha, please,” Rio whined. “Don’t tease.”</p><p>Agatha let go of Rio’s cock and smirked as it jutted out painfully, ready to be encased by something - anything. Agatha took her two hands and set them at the tip and base, as if she were measuring a table, and then took that measurement and moved it so that it instead measured the length from her mouth and down most of her throat.</p><p>“What do you think?” she asked. “Accurate representation? Or maybe we should consider the curve of my esophagus…”</p><p>A snarl ripped its way from Rio’s chest as she grabbed the front curtain of Agatha’s long, unruly waves and pulled the older woman so that her nose was nestled in the crook of her crotch.</p><p>Agatha pressed a chaste kiss on Rio’s mons. “C’mon, sweetheart. You think I’m gonna suck your dick when you aren’t giving me any manners?”</p><p>“Please,” Rio spat out, not wanting to play the cat and mouse game. Or, more like she was completely willing to be the mouse rutting under the cat’s paw.</p><p>“And what will you say when I so graciously give your cock my mouth?” Agatha kneeled down low enough that her lips could brush the underside of Rio’s shaft.</p><p>“T-Thank you?” Rio knew she was right when Agatha hummed appreciatively, and then in a swift movement, began to take the length in her mouth. Rio groaned, letting the noise bounce around the confines of her home unabashedly, and thrust her hips in the direction of Agatha’s warm mouth. “Oh, f-fuck, Agatha, thank you.”</p><p>Agatha started off by using her hand to help her mouth, but soon she was able to take Rio’s dick down her throat with no trouble.</p><p>Rio grunted and took the hand holding Agatha’s hair to instead cradle her throat. She was able to feel the movement of herself, feel the expansion of Agatha’s throat as it worked to fit all of her. “Christ, you’re cock hungry.” Rio bit her bottom lip hard as Agatha moaned and the vibrations heightened the experience of her dick in the older woman’s mouth. Wanting more of it, she continued. “I think after this, I’ll stick four fingers in that handsome pussy of yours so that I can prepare you for my girth. How does that sound?”</p><p>Agatha grunted as her nose brushed the trimmed hairs of Rio’s pelvic mound. Rio can tell her jaw is as wide open as it could get without being unpleasantly painful, the both of them in agreement that Rio needed to be as deep in Agatha’s throat as possible. There was a shuffling, and Rio tutted when she realized what Agatha’s plans were.</p><p>“Don’t even think about touching yourself. I want to see both of your hands, now.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes glared at Rio, but it just made her look a little cutesy. Her finger brushed the tip of Agatha’s strong nose before, just for a couple seconds, she pinched Agatha’s nostrils so she had no way of breathing. Agatha sputtered and gasped around Rio’s cock in shock, not expecting her breathing pattern to be messed with.</p><p>When Rio let go of Agatha’s nose, both of Agatha’s hands shot up to clutch Rio’s thighs as her head bobbed up and down. Rio sighed contentedly, the power rushing through her. Sex with Agatha was magnetizing not just on a physical level, but the tug of war they experienced with who was “in charge” at the moment was exhilarating. Rio’s head leaned back on the door and her eyes slipped closed for a few moments.</p><p>That’s when the balance of things changed momentarily and Rio felt Agatha’s hand snake up her torso. Not realizing what was going on until it was too late, Rio yelped when Agatha twisted a nipple. Even over her sports bra, the pain radiated through Rio’s body and her hips jerked, causing her cock to go even further down Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Rio grunted and pushed Agatha’s head back until her throat and mouth became empty. Agatha looked confused until Rio pulled Agatha by the roots of her wild hair and dragged her until Agatha started to scoot to follow.</p><p>Rio tugged until Agatha was, still on her knees, up against the wall close to where Rio had just been. Rio took both of her hands and used them to grab Agatha’s wrists and pin them over her head. She was easily able to then transfer Agatha’s crossed wrists to one hand and tipped Agatha’s chin up with the fingers of the other.</p><p>“Bad dog,” Rio chastised, and Agatha growled at that. Rio just laughed. “Proving my point, <em>mocosito</em>.” That word must have been unfamiliar to Agatha, because her eyebrows knitted together in a cutely confused way as she mouthed out the word, as if repeating it would bring forth the meaning. And while Rio was tempted to keep her in the dark, she also knew how pleasing it would be to just tell her. “It means brat.”</p><p>At that, Agatha’s eyes grew dark with a delicious mixture of irritation and lust. She squirmed against Rio’s restraint, though Rio was sure if she really wanted to, Agatha could free herself.</p><p>Rio only smirked in response, and she took Agatha’s bottom lip between her thumb and forefinger, pulling. “Open your mouth. Tongue out.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and kept her mouth closed. Rio pulled at her lip more, until she could see the bottom row of Agatha’s teeth.</p><p>Rio just tilted her head pseudo-endearingly. “Thought you wanted my dick in your mouth? You not a slut anymore?” Feeling emboldened, she added, “I guess I could go get my dick wet elsewhere -”</p><p>Agatha still looked irritated, but her jaw dropped just enough that she could stick her tongue out like she was at the doctor.</p><p>“There we go.” Rio lightly gripped her cock in her hand to settle it on the pad of Agatha’s tongue. “Good boy.” Then she slid in. She rocked her hips back and forth gently, her free hand cupping Agatha’s jaw. “Fuck, your mouth feels amazing.”</p><p>Rio continued to slowly thrust her hips as she raptly watched her dick repeatedly slide against and in Agatha’s lips. The older woman’s tongue curled expertly, and Rio moaned at the way the back of Agatha’s throat felt against her tip when she’d periodically scrape the back of it. Agatha choked and gagged, but didn’t make any noise that would alert Rio to stop; in fact, after a while, she… chuckled?</p><p>Rio backed up a little, letting her cock fall out of Agatha’s wet and spit-stained mouth. As Agatha took in a deep breath, she exhaled in a breathy laugh, proving Rio had been correct in her assumption that Agatha had been fucking laughing with a cock in her mouth. Rio snapped out, “What’s so funny?”</p><p>“Is this the pace you want to go with?” Agatha dramatically sighed, then, and leaned back against the wall Rio had just pushed her up against. “I just presumed we’d be doing something a little more… titillating.”</p><p>A scowl formed on Rio’s face at those words. “Is that what you want? For me to fuck your face until you’re crying?” Agatha’s eyes lit up; of course they did. “God, you’re a whore.”</p><p>Rio stuck her cock back in Agatha’s mouth like she was sheathing a sword and not practically blocking Agatha’s airway. Agatha gasped and sputtered, and more spit spilled from her mouth and rolled down her neck. Even fully clothed, she looked like she was beginning to crumble.</p><p>The thing was, Agatha choking made Rio’s experience feel that much better; Agatha’s biological instincts fought against the way Rio would hammer herself in and fill Agatha’s throat with cock instead, the muscles in her throat would constrict, as if they’d have a chance of successfully blocking Rio from continuing, and it essentially squeezed Rio’s cock with every thrust. Her moans became loud, as if she’d just realized she could make all the noise she wanted instead of having to keep herself quiet out of the fear of someone busting in on them.</p><p>Rio began to quicken and deepen her thrusts, and she got to a point where she let go of Agatha’s wrists so both of her hands could cup Agatha’s cheeks and temples in an attempt to get a better angle. Agatha’s hands immediately latched onto Rio’s thighs, her blunt nails digging into Rio’s skin as Rio pumped her hips. Agatha’s face was turning red as Rio bobbed it up and down, moving Agatha’s head to her will as if she were stroking herself, not using a mouth.</p><p>Rio then took a moment to get as deep as possible, Agatha’s nose brushing her trimmed pubic hair, and she held Agatha’s head there. Not moving. Agatha’s jaw was hinged as open as it could be, and Rio felt the other woman’s throat spasming around Rio’s cock, begging for air.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t let up; she didn’t tap Rio’s thigh, just gargled. Rio wondered when and if Agatha would give in, but her incredibly stubborn ass just looked up at Rio, flame-faced, her bright blue eyes wide as tears poured down her face.</p><p>When Agatha’s face started to tinge unnaturally pale and her eyes fluttered and lost focus, Rio conceded and quickly slid herself out of Agatha’s mouth, opening up her wind pipes and allowing her lungs to finally expand in her ribcage. Agatha involuntarily heaved in a gasp as air entered her all at once. She leaned her head against the wall, her arms falling limply to her sides.</p><p>“You’re so slutty and stubborn,” Rio told her.</p><p>Still heaving, Agatha shot Rio a wet grin and hoarsely said, “Wuss.”</p><p>Flames angrily boiled Rio’s blood. Agatha’s tone was practically insulting, like <em>Silly Rio, what a pathetic loser for not letting me pass out.</em></p><p>Deciding to be impulsive, Rio quickly stroked her cock and felt her orgasm building. Seeing Agatha’s throat bulge as she refused to relinquish the taste of Rio did something for her.</p><p>“Rio -” Agatha started, but it was too late. Rio felt her release burst out of her. Her eyes squeezed shut, but she heard Agatha suck in a gasp and whine. “Hey! You fucking asshole. That almost got in my hair.” Rio then felt one of Agatha’s fingers swipe over the head of her already-sensitive cock and pinch her foreskin, thumbnail digging in slightly. Rio yelped and her hips bucked so violently she had to let go of herself to slam her palm into the wall for balance.</p><p>She opened her eyes to see Agatha glaring at her, Rio’s spunk having landed on her jawline, neck, and a little on her shirt. Maybe even a spot or two on her vest and blazer. Whoopsies. “I think it looks good on you,” Rio said.</p><p>“You wasted perfectly good cum, is what you did.”</p><p>Rio snickered, and she dragged two fingers across Agatha’s cheek and neck, scooping up the majority of her orgasm. “Here you go, darling. Eat up.”</p><p>“You’re paying for the dry cleaning.” Agatha snatched Rio’s wrist and took the fingers in her mouth; she must want to taste Rio more than she needed to say anything else snarky.</p><p>As Agatha suckled, Rio hummed. “I don’t think so. Don’t think I didn’t find out about your stunt. It was <em>your</em> idea for me to come in the sock. Let’s call it even.”</p><p>In response, Agatha bit down on Rio’s fingers. Rio had to practically pry Agatha’s jaw open to get her fingers back. “You’re such a fucking brat.”</p><p>“You like it.” Agatha got up. Her knees cracked, and Rio was nice enough not to crack (ha.) a joke at her age. Because, again, she is a fucking lady. Agatha looked less <em>at</em> Rio and more <em>through</em> Rio, like she was trying to find something. “Why else would you keep coming back?”</p><p>(Goldfish are considered to be an invasive species in North America. Many amateur pet owners think their fish is dead and they flush it down the toilet. At some point, flowing water will bring the presumably dead fish to an open source of water, like a pond. Since goldfish are not naturally from this continent, they end up stealing food and other resources from native species. Goldfish can also grow fairly large, larger than one would picture in a bowl tank, if they have the size and room to do so.</p><p>This was how Rio felt her relationship with Agatha was like. Presumably flushed and dead, now invading the little pond of Rio’s chest cavity. The one Agatha was currently staring into.</p><p>… Wow. This is a horrible metaphor. Rio made a mental note to never quit her day job.)</p><p>Now Rio felt embarrassingly mushy. Like a rotten banana one promised to make banana bread with but ended up abandoning.</p><p>Rio needed to pivot this conversation.</p><p>“You have too many clothes on,” Rio said.</p><p>And to be honest, Agatha usually <em>did</em> - at least now, the weather was cold enough to permit it. Rio still had her sports bra and socks on, but that was it. She worked with Agatha to take her blazer off, and then her vest, and then her belt and slacks and shirt… see point made above. Agatha was wearing a black tee-shirt bra that clasped in the front. Rio hungrily unlooped the hook and gravity pulled down Agatha’s breasts into their natural shape and slope as Rio pushed the bra off of her shoulders.</p><p>“Follow me,” Rio whispered, and tugged harshly on Agatha’s nipple as if she were pulling a miscreant by the ear. Agatha yelped, high-pitched and in shock, stumbling after Rio and following her to the bedroom.</p><p>“Get on the bed,” Rio then said, her hand gently pushing on the lower pouch of Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>Agatha, in only her black boxer briefs, backed up until the backs of her knees hit the bed and she sat down, arms spread out behind her. Rio took that moment to shrug off her bra, flinging it wherever. It was her own damn bedroom and house, anyway, who gave a fuck. Rio heard shuffling, and opened her eyes to see Agatha kicking off her boxers with a single leg. Now they were both nude. Agatha’s eyes instantly dropped to Rio’s tits, now fully visible and for her eyes to shamelessly devour.</p><p>Rio took pride in her tits. They were definitely on the smaller side, but they were all natural, and she can still remember what it felt like when she first saw the swell of them in the shirts she’d wear. A physical reminder of what she’d done to make her body feel more like a home.</p><p>And now Agatha was practically drooling over them. Rio felt her nipples harden— whether it was due to the wanton scrutinization, or their newly bared look, she didn't know. Maybe it was a combination of both.</p><p>Rio crawled onto the bed by pushing herself up on the foot of it, causing her view to mainly be Agatha’s back until Agatha’s head quickly turned around to keep Rio in her view of sight.</p><p>“Get up on your knees,” Rio said. Her voice was laced with lust, and maybe a little softer than intended, her racing thoughts having inadvertently changed her perspective. But she could bring herself to care when Agatha was literally nude in front of her. The first time since that night over five years ago. “Back up.”</p><p>When Agatha’s back brushed Rio’s nipples, she hissed in pleasure. Rio then pressed their bodies even closer together, one of her arms cupping Agatha by her ribcage. The other one explored— cupping Agatha’s breast and rolling a nipple between her fingers. Agatha whimpered, her body arching into Rio’s.</p><p>When Rio skirted her hand down Agatha’s stomach, past the velvet-like texture of her stretch marks and the unruly patch of wiry hair, she wasted no time in slipped her fingers between Agatha’s folds, her two middle fingers parting Agatha’s lips while her forefinger poked at Agatha’s clitoral piercing.</p><p>“Oh, sweetheart, you’re soaked.” Rio gathered some of the wetness pooling at Agatha’s entrance and started rubbing soft, gentle circles on her clit.</p><p>“Oh, fuck,” Agatha moaned. Loudly.</p><p>“It’s so nice to hear you.” <em>Again</em>, Rio thought. “Good boy.” When Agatha’s shoulders tensed, her fingers stilled. “Did I say something wrong?”</p><p>Rio could practically hear the cogs turning in Agatha’s head. Her voice was small when it spoke - maybe not small compared to how most people spoke, but Rio knew Agatha well enough at this point to realize it was small for <em>her</em>. “Is it not… a little silly to be called that as a forty-six year old woman?”</p><p>Rio’s hand exits Agatha’s folds, choosing instead to go up and rub at the soft pouch of her stomach. “Do you <em>like</em> to be called it?”</p><p>She knew the answer, and Agatha must know Rio knew, because she just tossed her head back into the crook of Rio’s neck and mumbled.</p><p>“Use your words, <em>lindo</em>.” Softer, Rio added, “There’s no wrong answer.”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha responded.</p><p>“Do we both not present to the world as a unique kind of woman, as one that forces people to face gender expectations?” Rio tilted her head to land a gentle, albeit a little awkwardly positioned, kiss on Agatha’s temple. “Why would it be any different in bed?”</p><p>“You said <em>we</em>, but you don’t use those terms,” Agatha pointed out.</p><p>Kindly, Rio stated, “Sure, but not everyone considers me a woman to begin with.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha bristle. “That’s not - ”</p><p>“Hey.” Rio soothingly rubbed up and down Agatha’s torso in long, slow motions. “I wasn’t accusing you of anything. Lay down for me?” They switched their positioning until Agatha’s head rested on Rio’s pillows (that she certainly did not plan to inhale deeply later, thank you very much) and Rio crouched above her. “I just mean that we both know what it’s like to not give a fuck what people think.” Curious, she asked, “Is there a reason why this is different for you?”</p><p>The look in Agatha’s eyes was scared; it was as if she knew the answer, but didn’t want to speak it. It was raw for only a second, before becoming more subdued and hidden. Like she thought it was gone, though Rio didn’t have the heart to tell her she knew how to read her microexpressions now.</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me,” is what Rio decided to say. Her hands squeezed Agatha’s thighs, trying to be comforting.</p><p>Agatha took it as an invitation. “God, just fucking touch me already.”</p><p>Rio let out a breathless laugh. Her fingers traveled back to Agatha’s pussy, again testing the older woman. “Still so wet for me. You think you’re ready for my fingers, pretty boy?” When Agatha whimpered at that, Rio hummed. “There we go, good boy. I want to hear you.”</p><p>She positioned herself so that she straddled one of Agatha’s thighs, her half-hard cock rubbing against Agatha’s stomach when she bent down to nibble at Agatha’s ear as she teased a finger at Agatha’s drooling entrance. “You like praise? It stroke that big ego of yours, handsome?”</p><p>Agatha’s responding chuckle sounded a little too pretentious for Rio’s liking, so she added her middle finger to her teasing and slid both of them in, though only barely past the tips before she stilled.</p><p>“More,” Agatha ordered, but it bordered on a whine. Her hands white-knuckled the sheets under her.</p><p>“Mmm, <em>pobrecito</em>,” Rio cooed. The dirtiest thing she could think of sat on the tip of her tongue before it escaped. “Your slutty boy pussy needs more than that?”</p><p>Agatha gasped, and Rio felt a surge of new wetness leak onto her fingers. “Rio, don’t fuck with me.”</p><p>Rio sheathed her fingers into Agatha until her innermost knuckles hit bone of Agatha’s pelvis. She pumped slowly a few times, letting Agatha get used to the feeling, before she quickened her pace.</p><p>“You look so fuckin’ good.” Rio watched Agatha’s eyes slip closed as she curled her fingers inside Agatha and scraped the spongy bit that had her thighs trembling. Even with two fingers, she was easily able to twist and move them inside Agatha. “Hmm, should I add more?”</p><p>“Yes!” Agatha gasped.</p><p>Rio almost emptied Agatha, tasting the older woman’s delicious whine before including her ring finger her next thrust in. Agatha’s cunt swallowed Rio’s fingers like it had been starving all day. Loud, broken moans escaped Agatha’s mouth unabashedly. Rio’s heart fluttered at that, and it was like she could physically feel it pumping blood to her dick.</p><p>“Christ, Agatha, I almost forgot how fuckin’ loud you are.” When Agatha’s response was a wet gasp, Rio continued, teasing her pinky near Agatha’s entrance, where the rest of her fingers were already nestled. “You wanna take my fucking hand? Hmm?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha practically sobbed. “Fuck, baby, I’ll take as much as you give.”</p><p>Rio rubbed her thumb in tight little circles around Agatha’s blood-engorged clit to make sure she was prepared enough. Agatha grunted, her hips gyrating to complement Rio’s own movements. When the squelching sound deriving from Agatha’s cunt sounded as if it were as loud as her moans, Rio inserted her pinky.</p><p>Agatha was clenching on her hand so harshly Rio practically felt the bones in her hand being crushed against each other. When she was all the way in, she could feel Agatha’s cervix; the older woman almost mewled every time Rio bumped up against it.</p><p>Rio was able to fit most of her hand in there, her knuckles all bunched up together and the only thing in Rio’s way being her thumb bone. It was her <em>VITA</em> hand - like she was fucking the literal life from Agatha. And while she certainly wanted to fist Agatha, Rio used her thumb to flick between Agatha’s clit and her piercing, creating the most salivating sounds, and Rio didn’t intend to make them stop.</p><p>She leaned over in Agatha’s ear, her jaw tense as her cock rubbed up against Agatha’s torso on her journey there, and she began to whisper. “You like being filled by me? Your greedy little boy cunt taking my hand like it was molded to fit me?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath was too ragged for her to speak. Instead, her noises got more high-pitched, more unrestrained as Rio realized she was getting close to her orgasm.</p><p>“Can I see your eyes?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha wrenched her eyes open. They looked like twin planets, cloudy and deep.</p><p>“There we go. Good boy. Come for me, <em>lindo</em>.” Rio drew back the hood of Agatha’s clit slightly with her thumb to get deeper into the areas where she’d come to learn Agatha was the most sensitive. She knew she’d gotten the right spot when a thick vein popped in Agatha’s neck and her body seized up. Agatha looked like she was about to cry. “Oh, you’re so handsome when you come for me. Don’t stop looking at me. <em>Muy guapo</em>.”</p><p>Agatha bit her pouty lip as she rode out her climax. When she was done, she shoved at Rio’s wrist, and Rio gingerly took her hand out. Agatha’s body sagged into the bed as she shuddered. Then - and Rio barely noticed - a terrified look flashed in Agatha’s eyes like a strike of lightning. She shielded her eyes with her forearm.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio questioned softly.</p><p>Agatha almost sprung up and swung her legs over the bed. “I…” She pressed her hand to her sternum and swallowed hard, jaw tense, like she was afraid of vomiting. “I have to go.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed, hurt. “Wait, what?”</p><p>Agatha leapt up from the bed and started looking around. She grumbled, and Rio noticed she’d decided to give up the search for her underwear as she scurried to the living room where the rest of her clothes are. Buttoned up her pants. Kept her shirt untucked.</p><p>“Are you leaving?”</p><p>Agatha glanced up at Rio, and Rio thought it was the guiltiest she’s ever appeared. “It’s not you.”</p><p>Rio felt her heart stop. She was so fucking embarrassed. She was <em>literally naked</em>. Emotionally, and her dick was also out. “Oh my fucking god.”</p><p>“I’m serious.” Agatha got stern.</p><p>“Did I do something wrong?” Rio threw her hands out. “Am I too young? Too stupid?”</p><p>A genuine look of confusion crossed Agatha’s face. “What?” And then her lips turned downward as she waved her hand flippantly. “No, not everything is about you.”</p><p>“It clearly is!” Rio’s voice wavered as it grew in volume; she was frustrated. “I clearly messed something up and you won’t tell me.”</p><p>“Has it ever just occurred to you that maybe I’m just fucked up?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Fine,” Rio snapped. “You left me the first time we fucked in a bed half a decade ago. Go on, do it again.” She sneered. “Or do you wanna fall asleep together first and do it while I can’t watch?”</p><p>Something in Agatha’s eyes shattered. “Fuck you,” she spat.</p><p>Rio had to laugh at that. “Fuck <em>me</em>? You fucking started it! Just go.”</p><p>Agatha at least had the decency to not slam the door too hard on her way out. It was a nice door, and Rio didn’t need the paint getting chipped.</p><p>She felt like shit. She stood in the shower, arms crossed, washing and cleaning nothing and just standing under the fire-hot water for probably thirty minutes, mind reeling, before she put on a pair of underwear, a tee shirt, and went to bed.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It took Rio about three days to find Agatha’s missing boxers. They’d been kicked enough under her dresser that she didn’t notice until she’d been picking something up. She turned them around in her hand; they were inside out, and because of their black color, Rio could still see the discoloration stains on the crotch.</p><p>The evil, horrible animal part of her brain wanted to snort the gusset like a line of coke, because of course Agatha would be the type to specifically buy women’s boxers. The more logical, upset and human part of Rio’s brain simply placed them on top of her dresser and stared at them for a minimum ten seconds forlornly every time she was in her bedroom like a woman waiting for her husband to return from war.</p><p>Which wasn’t fucking fair, because Rio had seriously done nothing wrong. Look, when Rio started fumbling around with Agatha, it’s not like she thought she was choosing the most emotionally mature middle-aged woman in the world. Certainly wasn’t even head over dick for one in the fiftieth percentile, either.</p><p>But it stung. It was hard to not blame herself, even just a little bit. Even if Agatha was right, and it was all her, there was a part of Rio - a small, scared part - that had wanted Agatha to open up to her. Maybe she just didn’t deserve it.</p><p>She spent a week grading final papers. Out of her seventy-something students, she only had to fail four; this was a success, frankly. She spent the next week in Houston where she slept in her childhood twin bed, posters of Avril Lavigne and Breaking Benjamin and My Chemical Romance stapled to the green walls, and did her absolute hardest to not wonder what Agatha was up to and who she was spending her time with.</p><p>It got easier the longer she stayed there - she drank a lot of beer and played a lot of dominos and realized she was a true adult when her <em>mami</em> put a two-pack of lint rollers in her stocking and she was actually happy to see them.</p><p>But at some point, she had to hug her parents and get on a plane. And she was fucking stupid and forgot when flying Southwest you had to check in for seating twenty-four hours before and she got stuck boarding when there were only center seats left. Eugh.</p><p>Rio was exhausted, emotionally and physically, when she got back to her apartment. Back in Massachusetts. A blue state, but she also had to own snow chains for her tires. The lord giveth and he taketh, et cetera. She spent the first day or so cat napping and checking on her plants (Alice was a local and checked on them while she’d been gone, a real friend) and eating dry cereal because she didn’t want to go grocery shopping yet.</p><p>When she texted Alice a thank you for looking at her plants, Alice responded with: <em>Sure! Hey, has Jen told you she throws a pretty fun New Years party? We get drunk, sing karaoke, pass out on the couch or in one of the bedrooms. It’s not too big, just about a dozen of us or so. You’re definitely invited.</em></p><p>Rio thought about it. Her own thoughts were eating at her like those nematodes in that one episode of Spongebob. And the fact that <em>that</em> was her go-to metaphor to use…</p><p>Maybe this party would be a good idea. However, she wasn’t stupid - Rio knew Agatha would be there. That made her gut turn anxiously. She hadn’t seen Agatha in about ten days, and before, Rio would just shamefully crave the older woman’s attention, but the last time they’d interacted, Agatha had rushed out with her tail between her legs.</p><p>Did the idea of getting even the tiniest bit serious with Rio really seem that horrible?</p><p>Rio took a deep breath. No, she was not the one at fault.</p><p>She would go to the party, she decided.</p><p>She would see Agatha there.</p><p>And she would be perfectly normal and fine.</p><p>She texted Alice <em>I’ll be there</em>.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Alice had said the theme of Jen’s party was themed off of the 80s - Rio guessed all of the flappers and Great Gatsby themes felt like old news now that they were ringing in 2026 - and so she wore a Memphis-patterned shirt, high-waisted leather pants, and high-top basketball shoes.</p><p>“Looking good, Vidal!” was the first thing Alice said when Rio walked into the house.</p><p>It was a damn nice house. It had a conversation pit and everything. “This is really nice.” Rio tried not to let too much shock lace her voice.</p><p>“Jen makes quite a bit as assistant dean,” Alice explained, “Also, my mom, y’know.” At Rio’s confused look, Alice said, “You don’t know my mom?”</p><p>“Should I?” Had she visited the university and Rio hadn’t realized?</p><p>“Dude, my mom is Lorna Wu.”</p><p>Rio gaped, and she tried not to drop the scoop-shaped tortilla chip she’d been holding. “Are you… serious?”</p><p>Alice motioned around. “My last name is literally Wu-Gulliver. Where do you think the Wu came from?”</p><p>“It’s a common enough name,” Rio protested. “There’s Wendy Wu, homecoming warrior.”</p><p>“Rio, that is a fictional character from a Disney Channel movie.”</p><p>“Oh!” Rio held up a finger. “And Constance Wu. Loved <em>Fresh Off The Boat</em>.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes. “Why did you think of the niche D-COM movie first?”</p><p>“I panicked,” Rio admitted. “I’ll just attribute it to being tipsy.”</p><p>Alice pointed at Rio’s lack of drink. “You’re fully sober right now.”</p><p>“Not for long, right?”</p><p>The party was smaller than expected. Barely a “party” even. There were Alice and Jen, of course, and Alice had told Rio the day before that a couple of people had rescinded their invitations to stay with family, or, in one person’s case, randomly backpack Europe at the worst possible time of year. But there was Carol, a faculty member at another small university in the area, with her wife, Maria. Valerie, someone Alice told Rio she’d met in the music scene a decade ago and even when they were both too old and creaky to mosh in the pits now, they were still good friends. There were a few redheads Rio saw, but hadn’t gotten the chance to speak to.</p><p>Rio was on her second cup of vodka and fruit juice (she’d decided to switch it up and try all of them, this time it was cranberry-grape) when Agatha strutted into the house like she fucking owned it. And she didn’t - Rio actually knew this for a fact.</p><p>“Fashionably late,” Jen teasingly snarked.</p><p>“I like to think so.”</p><p>Agatha was wearing one of those colorblock-styled windbreakers with the collar popped up with a white ribbed tank top underneath. Rio could see the outline of a sports bra. Also, even though it was very soon to be January, she was wearing jean shorts with those athletic calf-high socks and Skechers sneakers.</p><p>Rio scurried to the kitchen after that to fill up her plastic wine glass with more vodka. Why not start on her third drink early? Sure, she was going to be completely normal around Agatha, but it didn’t help to have just a smidgen more liquid courage in her.</p><p>Speak of the devil and she shall appear.</p><p>“I thought you were more of a dark liquor person,” was what Agatha greeted her with.</p><p>“I’m not picky.” Rio looked Agatha’s outfit up and down and she snarked, “You look like a Sears catalogue reject.”</p><p>Agatha just shrugged as if she was rolling Rio’s insult off her shoulders. “I guess I deserved that.”</p><p>“You deserve a lot worse,” Rio spat out. Agatha just held up her hands, defeated.</p><p>When nothing was said, Rio continued. “Why am I the first person you talk to?” she asked. “There’s about six other people here.”</p><p>“I was just grabbing a drink,” Agatha said. Rio glanced down at Agatha’s currently empty hand, and the older woman must have seen and understood what the look was about, because she quickly nabbed a red cup. She muttered, “This makes me feel like I’m at a college party.”</p><p>“Oh my god, <em>Agatha?</em>”</p><p>Rio whipped her head around to see one of the redheads she hadn’t yet gotten to meet. Out of her peripherals, she noticed Agatha’s eye twitch.</p><p>“Hey, Wanda.”</p><p>“How’s it been?” Wanda practically skipped up to give Agatha a hug, and if Rio thought she was stiff as a board when receiving <em>her</em> tough, she was straight marble with Wanda wrapped around her neck.</p><p>“I’m Rio,” Rio supplied helpfully.</p><p>“Oh!” Wanda stuck out her hand for a shake. Rio obliged, though she could tell the woman was a little tipsy. God, it was barely nine, have some fucking decorum. “Vidal, yeah? I’ve heard about you. Alice likes your taste in music. I currently work admin at Boston U.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, trying to decide if she liked Wanda or not. She nodded to Rio’s impeccable taste… but her hand was still around Agatha’s waist. But then Agatha tracked Rio’s eyes and, a little too politely, shoved Wanda’s hand off. Hmm.</p><p>“I do like to keep my ear to the ground,” was what Rio responded with.</p><p>“Hey, Ags.” Wanda turned to Agatha, whose eyebrows were sky high at the audacity of a nickname. Rio was inclined to agree. “Could I talk to you for a sec?”</p><p>“Uh, sure,” Agatha mumbled, and she avoided Rio’s stare as Wanda tugged on the sleeve of her jacket to find a secluded corner.</p><p>Rio had been born a rule follower until puberty hit, and she’d started feeling like an alien that had snuck onto Earth. When Rio was a teenager, she had not yet learned how to channel her anger, or even fully known what dysphoria was. That was where her punk rock phase came from, and she’d leaned heavily into the whole <em>breaking the status quo</em> schtick.</p><p>It was how she was able to convince her high school girlfriend, who was a part of student council at the time and <em>definitely</em>, unknowingly, a baby butch, to make their class’s senior prank lighting a firework under the principal’s car. Rio hadn’t known it would catch on fire, honest. But there had been a certain sort of joy and hunger that ate at Rio’s heart as she’d watched it catch aflame.</p><p>This was that same hunger.</p><p>Rio slunk back into the main room - not the living room, but the room with the conversation pit. That was not where Agatha had ended up. No, Agatha was in the corner sequestered between Wanda’s animated talking hands and bookshelves that were stuffed to the brim.</p><p>She strained her ear as best as she could, but she couldn’t hear a single thing that was being said. Which was crazy, considering how shrill Wanda’s voice was in the four words Rio had already heard her speak.</p><p>Rio got up from the conversation Alice and Carol were having; she hadn’t been participating much anyway. She pretended to be interested in the books Alice and Jen carried and started from one of the shelves further away from Agatha and Wanda’s discussion. Thankfully, she didn’t have to pretend too hard - Rio was actually curious about the collection as well as the categorizing of it. The science fiction section had to be Alice. The shelf dedicated to self help had Jen all over it.</p><p>Soon, Rio had naturally gravitated towards the real reason she’d gotten up to begin with. She tried to cobble together the context as she eavesdropped.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Wanda asked, voice lowering when she realized they had an audience. Luckily, Rio could still parse her words. “There’s a great coffee shop about fifteen minutes away from your university.”</p><p>Rio chose not to watch how Agatha reacted - she chose to act instead.</p><p>“<em>Why Fish Don’t Exist</em> by Lulu Miller,” she read aloud. And, fuck it, she picked the book out from its spot on the shelf and flipped it back to read the synopsis. “I dunno, I’ve seen a fish before. I’m fairly certain they exist.”</p><p>Rio could practically hear Agatha’s eye roll. “It’s about the taxonomy of fish,” she scoffed.</p><p>“Oh, so you’ve read it?” Rio dared a glance towards Agatha. “Nerd.”</p><p>“Um, do you mind?” Wanda was a little sharp in her delivery.</p><p>“No,” Rio said. “I don’t. You can continue.”</p><p>Rio saw something interesting twinkle in Agatha’s eye before she turned her gaze back to Wanda. “Look, Wanda, I’m not saying I regret… what happened. But I’m not really looking to date, right now.”</p><p>Wanda shot a glimpse at Rio. “Right. I’ll just… go get another drink, then.”</p><p>Rio waited until Wanda had completely disappeared, fire-hydrant reject hair and all, before she slid the book back into its correct spot on the shelf. “So. ‘What happened’?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Why do you care?”</p><p>Rio got in Agatha’s personal space - and she didn’t show it physically, but the mean part of her smiled when it made Agatha back into the corner a bit. Good. “Why do you think? When did you fuck her?”</p><p>“That’s not important,” Agatha snapped. “It’s not like we said we’d be exclusive.”</p><p>“It’s important if it was while <em>we</em> were fucking and I need to go get tested.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened marginally, and then she rolled them. Little blue planets spinning on their axis. “We didn’t… I haven’t been with anyone since we… started. We had a one nighter a few years ago.”</p><p>“She sounds obsessed,” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>Agatha looked bemused. “And what would you consider how you act?”</p><p>“Reasonable.” Rio leaned down to whisper in Agatha’s ear. “After all, I bet she can’t make you come like I can.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, and Rio watched as goosebumps appeared on the back of the other woman’s neck. “You’re very presumptuous.”</p><p>“Am I?” If Rio looked at the right angle, she could see down the tank top Agatha was wearing. By the way a light flush appeared on the bridge of Agatha’s nose and spread to her cheeks, she could tell what Rio was doing. Rio continued. “Why lie and act like you were seeing other people, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to answer. And luckily for her, she didn’t have to - a chime went off and both women jumped as Agatha patted her pants, trying to find her phone. When she read the text, her face lost a little color.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha hissed, and she stuffed her phone back into her pocket. She started walking away. “I have to go.”</p><p>Rio felt her drunken, metaphorical world crumble, and she followed Agatha a few steps behind like an imprinted kitten. “Wait, what?”</p><p>“Jen,” Agatha called out. “I gotta skedaddle.”</p><p>Jen, who had joined whatever Alice and Carol had been discussing, asked, “Is everything okay?”</p><p>Agatha just huffed. “Yeah, the sitter fucking cancelled mid-shift.” She then turned on a mocking tone and made a yapping motion with her hand. “‘My boyfriend wants me back because he doesn’t know what to make for dinner.’ Like that’s not a grown man. Use the air fryer, for fuck’s sake. This is the last time I hire a nineteen year old.”</p><p>“Be safe.” Jen and Agatha hugged.</p><p>Agatha could only look at Rio and say, “See you,” before heading out.</p><p>Rio blinked forlornly at her drink. It was just orange juice now - she’d finished the drink she had when Agatha arrived and had been sipping on soft drinks for the hour or so since then. Not <em>because</em> of Agatha - Rio heavily disliked the taste of alcohol and found it best to knock a few drinks back in the very beginning of any hang out and then coast the rest of the time the right amount of teetering between tipsy and drunk.</p><p>She gnawed on a toothpick worryingly. Why had Agatha left? Oh yeah. <em>A sitter?</em></p><p>Wait.</p><p>Rio felt her heart drop to her shoes so quickly it may or may not have splattered. Why the fuck would Agatha need someone to sit and presumably watch something?</p><p>Unless.</p><p>The comments over the past few months started to add up like a heartbreaking and anxiety-inducing math problem in her head. The weird looks Agatha would get when things felt too intimate - outside of one of them fingering the other, of-fucking-course. The refusal to talk about her private life. Rio had chalked it up to butch stoicism, but now with that sitter comment… was Agatha a <em>parent?</em></p><p>She would have mentioned something if it had been in Copenhagen. Right? Rio thought about the fear that struck her when the condom ripped, and Agatha had replied flippantly - no comments about how she already had a mouth to feed.</p><p>Rio needed answers. She very normally and stoically walked around the backyard and into the house until she found the food. Always having been a nervous snacker, she started to graze, an anxious little goat. That’s when Jen walked in, all by herself and practically begging for an attempt at an interrogation. Perfect.</p><p>“Hey, Jen.” Rio sounded incredibly nonchalant.</p><p>“What’s up?” Jen stacked her plate with fruit. You are what you eat, Rio mused.</p><p>“I just…” Might as well dive right in. Who gave a shit about dipping your toes beforehand? “Agatha’s made a few comments, and it got me wondering.” At Jen’s eyebrow raise, Rio asked, “Does she have a kid or something?”</p><p>Jen instantly looked uncomfortable. “Umm…”</p><p>Right. So, if Agatha didn’t have a child at home, that was not the sort of answer Jen would give. Rio felt another piece of the puzzle fit into place, and with it, a piece of her heart chip off with it. “I feel like that kind of gave it away.”</p><p>“Not really.” Jen avoided Rio’s intense stare. “It’s not really my business to share.”</p><p>“Can I at least talk to her about it?” Rio asked. “Can I have her number?”</p><p>“If she hasn’t given it to you, I’m not going to be the one to do it.”</p><p>“Her address?” Rio felt her voice crack.</p><p>“Rio, that’s <em>worse</em>.”</p><p>“Look, I know you said it wasn’t your business, but…” Rio felt herself splitting apart at the seams. “It could… possibly be mine.”</p><p>“In what way?” Now Jen sounded defensive. Of <em>Agatha</em>. Rio took quick mental note of that. “Just because you’re fucking her doesn’t mean you’re privy to her personal life.”</p><p>“Hey! Wait, how did you know that?” Rio shook her head, holding up her hand before Jen could answer. “No. I mean, sure, that’s part of it emotionally, but…” This was what Rio was afraid to say. Because if the words became real, the hypothetical did, too. Rio had been nineteen when she stupidly jumped over the warning rails on the Grand Canyon to get a closer and wilder look. This was somehow still the scariest thing Rio had experienced. “If she has a kid, it’s very possible it could be my business. And I know she’s not gonna answer her phone, Jen, I gotta ask her in person so she can’t run away.”</p><p>Something clicked in Jen’s eyes. She stared at Rio, and Rio felt like she was looking at her in a new light.</p><p>“Please.” Rio was just tipsy enough to not care about the desperation in her voice.</p><p>Jen finally found the words. “Oh my god, you’re <em>her</em>, aren’t you.”</p><p>“Her?” Rio echoed. The bass of the music from the living room made her chest feel tight.</p><p>“What does Copenhagen mean to you?” At Rio’s open and broken expression, Jen cursed. “Fuck. Fine, okay, I’ll text you her address.” She whipped out her phone and muttered, “Knew she was acting weird as fuck these past few months.”</p><p>“Wait, she told you about <em>that</em>, too?” Rio sputtered. “She acted like she was going to push me off a cliff for even insinuating I talked to anyone about it.”</p><p>“Sounds like her,” Jen said wryly. “Look, before I give you this, you have to promise me something.”</p><p>“What.”</p><p>“Don’t get too upset at her.” One could say Jen’s tone sounded soft.</p><p>“Only if there’s nothing worth getting upset over,” Rio snapped.</p><p>“Rio, I’m serious.” The look Jen gave Rio stilled a bit of the buzzing in her chest. “You can’t… She’s… She planned on telling you.”</p><p>“Telling me.” Rio felt sick. She felt her phone vibrate in her absurdly tight back pocket.</p><p>“Don’t tell her it was me.” That was the last thing Jen said before she walked away.</p><p>If it had been a normal night, Rio would not have driven. And in her defense, she hadn’t planned on doing so. But she hadn’t had a drink in two hours, and she’d eaten some of the cheese cubes and chips to soak anything up before turning her car on. Considering Jen didn’t stop her walking out the door and even gave her Agatha’s address, Rio felt like she was sober enough.</p><p>The map on her CarPlay was the only thing she paid attention to while Rio drove. Not the small comments Agatha would make that alone, were inconspicuous, but built a terrifying story together - the blank desk, the leaving places early, the refusal to properly fuck in a bed, the fucking <em>sitter comment</em>. That had been the last straw for Rio. What other reason could she have meant by that?</p><p>Rio felt her jaw tense. Maybe she adopted. Maybe she did in-vitro. Maybe she was married and became a step-mother and then her wife died and she was the only thing this child had left. But the sinking feeling in Rio’s gut told her those weren’t true. Her gut told her much worse.</p><p>Her hands were full-on shaking by the time she pulled up in Agatha’s driveway. Of course Agatha lived in a nice fucking colonial-style house. Fucking asshole. Rio barely felt her legs carry her to the door before she was smashing the doorbell and, when flames turned her impatience to ash, she started pounding on the door.</p><p>Rio heard a muffled, “Jesus <em>fuck</em>,” before the door swung open. Agatha was in pajamas and glasses already. “Oh.”</p><p>“Who did you think it was?” Rio snarled. “Especially after you saw I found out about them.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows knit together. “Who?”</p><p>“I’m not stupid.” Rio’s voice cracked. Fuck. “The sitter comment? You have a child?” Rio’s throat grew tight as she felt tears form in the back of her eyes. “Are they…”</p><p>“I don’t have a babysitter, Rio, I have a pet sitter.” Agatha sighed. “For my rabbit.”</p><p>Rio’s heart felt like it had been smashed through the windshield. “Wait, what?” Relief started to flood through her. “Oh.”</p><p>Agatha’s face still looked tight. It made Rio question if she should be feeling reprieve. “But you should still come in.”</p><p>“O…kay.” Rio, who had been so full of anger just seconds ago, now tentatively stepped through the door.</p><p>Agatha’s house was more cluttered than Rio expected. Lots of mugs. Even more books - she had so many bookshelves and yet she still had stacks of novels haphazardly in the corners. Rio wondered in that moment if there was some arbitrary number that officially made a book collection a “library”; Agatha probably met that number.</p><p>Dark jewel tones. Purple, blue, green. There was a sleeping bunny on the couch. Okay, so Agatha hadn’t been lying about that.</p><p>Rio had never seen Agatha look so scared. The older woman said, “Please don’t hate me.”</p><p>Now it was Rio’s turn to be confused. “Um, I don’t think I could.”</p><p>“You say that.” Agatha’s eyes grew wet, and Rio was startled. Her eyes widened. “But you don’t know. And I didn’t know how to tell you, but we were still - You’re not going to forgive me, Rio, you really aren’t. I’ll show you and then you’re free to leave.”</p><p>Rio’s heart was thudding so loud in her chest she felt like her ribcage was three seconds away from being torn apart like Edgar Allen Poe’s floorboards. “What the hell are you hiding?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She just started to walk up the stairs tiredly. Rio followed, not even bothering to take off her shoes, the leather squeaking as she climbed. Rio realized the house was even bigger when she got upstairs. There were a handful of bedrooms and a bathroom. Agatha stood in front of the closed door the furthest from the staircase.</p><p>“I chose to not change it,” she explained preemptively. “There are enough guestrooms, and… I wanted to keep it. I dust it.”</p><p>When Agatha nervously turned the knob and pushed the door open, Rio found out it was holding a nursery. It was ocean themed, the wallpaper consisting of whales and starfish and crabs and anemones. The crib and dresser and curtains were a deep blue. The crib's mattress had sheets on it, baby blue, that looked as if they'd been changed recently, but not been slept on.</p><p>“I…” Rio tried to say something. She really did. But she’d lost the ability to form words at that second. It was like her brain had rebooted and whatever section held her known vocabulary was now a blank slate.</p><p>She couldn’t even <em>think</em> properly, simply too overwhelmed for coherency.</p><p>She also noticed one of the drawers was halfway open, like it had been left that way absentmindedly. There were a handful of baby-sized onesies in there. Socks so small Rio probably couldn’t fit more than two fingers in them. Lots of blues, greens, and yellows, and even a few pinks in there.</p><p>It was when Agatha walked over to the dresser and picked up a shark figurine - glass, clear with bits of blue and purple and gray swirling around - that Rio’s curiosity peaked.</p><p>“What is that?” Rio croaked, referring to the glass Agatha was holding.</p><p>“I should’ve told you earlier.” Agatha cupped the figurine in her palms like it was something sacred. “But there was never a good time. We… I’m not good at emotions. More the physical stuff. And I didn’t want to tell you in public. Or in one of our offices. Felt weird.”</p><p>Rio glanced down and squinted to get a better look. It was engraved. It said <em>Nicholas Rhodes Harkness, 2020.</em></p><p>“I tried to find you.” It was like the words were now pouring out of Agatha, the dam having been smashed. “But I thought your name was Rio Rhodes, not Rosario Vidal. I…” She started shaking.</p><p>Wait. 2020. It clicked. In that moment, Rio’s entire world tilted on its axis. She could feel every single one of her organs. She wanted to vomit. “He…” Her voice barely worked. So she just said as much as she was able to and pointed a shaking finger to the glass figure. “Mine?”</p><p>Agatha let out a sob, and Rio held onto her wrists, for comfort, and also to keep the figurine in her hands from falling. Rio had to push out her next words. “What happened?”</p><p>“He had anencephaly. It’s essentially when the brain doesn’t develop. The doctor found it when he was 20 weeks.” Agatha’s face was wet enough that Rio felt a few drops of tears fall on her own wrists. Or maybe the tears were hers, too - she wasn’t entirely sure.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio murmured. But then that ugly part of her reared its head. “I wish I had known.”</p><p>Agatha sniffled. “At first, when I found out, I was horrified. And I didn’t exactly want to tell you because… you were young, and I felt like you deserved to be carefree. As time went by, I did try to find you. A part of me felt like you deserved to know, even though I’d decided by then I wasn’t going to try and get you for money or anything. And then I found out he was a boy and a week later found out he was never going to make it, anyway. At that point, I stopped searching as hard. I didn’t think you deserved to go through the grief.”</p><p>“I would’ve wanted to know,” Rio said.</p><p>“When I saw you that first day… and as I got to know you, I realized that.” Agatha squirmed a bit at the admission. “But I didn’t know how to tell you. How to absolutely break your fucking world like it broke mine.”</p><p>“So you waited until, what, I confronted you?”</p><p>“I know it seems like I’m combative, but I’m actually really horrible at confrontation,” Agatha explained, and Rio just shook her head. By the way they’d been having sex for the past few months, even without the now-added baggage, Agatha was not good at confronting the hard shit one single bit.</p><p>“We had a lot of sex, Agatha,” Rio stated. “And I’m not - I’m not accusing you of anything, it’s nothing like that, but that would’ve been really important emotional context.”</p><p>“I didn’t know how else to be close to you,” was Agatha’s hoarsely whispered response.</p><p>“I still would have wanted to.” As Rio spoke the words, she realized they were true, and not just a pity statement.</p><p>And of course Rio was angry. Angry that Agatha felt like Rio wouldn’t have wanted to take responsibility for something that was partially of her actions. Angry that, because of some miscommunication, Agatha wasn’t able to accurately find her. Angry that her son never grew past the size of an orange. Angry she never got to grieve when Agatha as it happened.</p><p>When Rio’s stewing presumably made Agatha nervous, she continued. “His ashes are in it. I got a local glassblower to make a custom piece. I thought about a necklace, or even an urn, but… all of the options, with what they had available…” Agatha chewed on her lip. “Everything was so small. It didn’t feel fair.”</p><p>Rio had grown into the type of person to let the past be the past. She had to be, after spending years wondering what she’d looked like if she’d started estrogen even two weeks earlier than she actually had. If she’d been one of those lucky ones who’d been able to go on puberty blockers at a young enough age - no, Rio already knew better than most that harping on events that had already happened, and were therefore out of her control, only caused more mental anguish.</p><p>So what Rio said was, “Can I hold him?”</p><p>Agatha sighed shakily. “Yeah. Yeah, of course.”</p><p>The shark figurine was clean. Rio stared at the name again. “You made his middle name Rhodes.”</p><p>“I thought it was your real name,” Agatha said. “I didn’t know it was a nickname until the day we met again.”</p><p>Rio blushed. “Yeah… from college.”</p><p>“How did they even get that from Rosario?”</p><p>Rio set the figurine down back on the dresser in its spot. She didn’t need to be holding it when she admitted this. “So… it’s after the Colossus of Rhodes, right?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “I… guess that makes sense. Historical wonder of the world.”</p><p>“And he’s a pretty big dude. Big statue.” Rio’s cheeks warmed. “So he’d, um… have, y’know…”</p><p>The pieces fell together in Agatha’s head. Rio could tell because she dug the heels of her palms into her eyes. “Rio. Do not tell me I named our son after a dick joke your fucking cohort gave you in grad school.”</p><p>The first time hearing <em>our son</em> and he’d never become something real and warm to hold. Just a glass sculpture. Rio felt her throat tighten, but she said, “Okay… I won’t tell you that, then.”</p><p>Agatha barked out an absurd laugh. “Jesus Christ.”</p><p>Rio had no idea how to respond, except with a possible comforting bit of humor of her own. “Well, if it makes you feel better, my dick determined the makeup of his chromosomes anyway…”</p><p>At Agatha’s second laugh, wetter this time, Rio’s shoulders sagged in relief. Agatha looked at Rio with watery eyes. “I need some fucking wine.”</p><p>A handful of minutes later, they were on Agatha’s couch, Rio’s shoes tossed on the floor and her sock-clad feet appropriately criss-cross applesauce. Agatha was slouched, her knees spread casually.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t even gotten glasses, just the bottle.</p><p>“<em>Barefoot</em>?” Rio questioned.</p><p>Agatha glared at Rio as she screwed the top off. “What’s wrong with my wine selection?”</p><p>“I just remember you complaining about the boxed wine,” Rio pointed out. “That’s box wine’s sister.”</p><p>“Her much prettier and better tasting sister.” Agatha took a swig of the bottle and then handed it to Rio. A gentlewoman.</p><p>They passed the bottle like two teenagers on a rooftop. A few sips in, Rio said, “Can I ask? About him?”</p><p>“You deserve to know,” was Agatha’s response.</p><p>“So…” Rio started picking at the cuticle of her thumb. “It was something called… ah-nen…”</p><p>“Anencephaly,” Agatha finished for her. “It means his brain didn’t really develop. There are some underlying causes, but the doctors told me I hadn’t done anything to cause it. It… just happened.” She sucked on her teeth. “I remember when my mother found out, she told me it happened because I wasn’t fit to be anyone’s mother. She told me he’d inherited my brains.”</p><p>“Fuck her,” Rio spat. Agatha startled at the harsh words, but scoffed in a slight smirk when she realized what they were for. Rio continued with, “If you hadn’t told me she’d died a week ago, I’d do it myself.”</p><p>“It’s a miracle I didn’t do it years and years before that comment.”</p><p>“I’ll go piss on her grave,” Rio said solemnly. “I’ll do it.”</p><p>“Oh, please.” Agatha waved a hand dismissively. “She’s getting what she deserves: I’m cremating her and tossing her ashes in the dumpsters of that one lesbian bar in East Boston. Should be another week or two… I dunno. Holidays and shit.”</p><p>“Well, good.” Rio’s brain felt fuzzy. The wine in her system was cancelling out all the good she’d done at Jen’s party. “And she’s wrong.”</p><p>“I know, like I don’t have a fuckin’ doctorate,” Agatha quipped. “I’m really fuckin’ smart. Stupid witch.”</p><p>“Not that,” Rio countered. Realizing how that sounded, she quickly tacked on, “Though that is true. You’re very intelligent. No, I meant you’re a good mother.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened at that, and her hand rested comfortingly on Rio’s thigh. When had she gotten that close? “Rio, you’re very sweet, but I’m not even a mother. And I’m officially menopausal as of my spring check up, so I never will be.”</p><p>“That’s not true,” Rio protested. “You came up with a really creative way to keep his memory. You still have his nursery.” She gestured with her hand for emphasis, as if to say, Look at what you’ve done. “You’re a wonderful mother.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha’s grip on her clothed thigh tighten. She was still in her leather pants, so there was an awkward squeaking sound. The tension in the room made it easy enough to ignore. “Rio, you can’t just say shit like that.”</p><p>A small ache wormed its way into Rio’s chest. She hadn’t thought she said anything wrong. Her brow furrowed. “Wait, why?”</p><p>“You’re the only other person who can understand what I’m going through.” Rio could hear how hard it was for Agatha to string her words together. Though whether due to trying to find the right ones or having to bare herself emotionally, that’s what Rio wasn’t able to figure out. “And it’s…”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes broke contact and dipped a few inches further downward. And when Rio self-consciously wet her bottom lip, she realized it made Agatha’s jaw tense. Oh, okay.</p><p>Neither of them were able to say something, though, as both of them jumped when a series of fireworks started. Agatha almost dropped the bottle of wine in surprise, and Rio had to reach over and steady it, her hands now clasped over Agatha’s.</p><p>“Is it midnight?” Rio wondered idly.</p><p>Agatha looked somewhere off to Rio’s right, maybe where a clock stood. “On the dot, it looks like.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio backed up a little, just enough to set the bottle of wine somewhere safe - the coffee table. “Well, Happy New Year, Agatha.”</p><p>They were still close enough that Rio could almost feel Agatha breathing. Agatha murmured, “You in for a little New Year’s tradition?”</p><p>“I usually do the grape thing,” Rio said. At Agatha’s bemused expression, she explained, “You eat twelve grapes at midnight for good luck.”</p><p>“Wine is made of grapes,” Agatha pointed out.</p><p>“It’s not exactly midnight anymore. You’re supposed to do it on the countdown.” Rio grabbed the bottle anyway. “We’re late.”</p><p>“Late luck is better than no luck at all, right?” Agatha nodded her head towards the bottle now in Rio’s grasp. “You first. One big drink probably equals twelve grapes. That feels right.”</p><p>Rio gulped down exactly four times before she set the bottle down, breathing heavily as the alcohol burned down her throat. Agatha followed her shortly after, and Rio stared as Agatha gripped the bottleneck and put the spout to her lips. Urgh.</p><p>Agatha practically slammed the bottle down, stretching over Rio to put it on her side of the coffee table even though there were closer spots to Agatha. Agatha looked at Rio with something heavy. It wasn’t until Agatha asked, “Any more traditions we need to cover?” when Rio realized that heavy thing was <em>want</em>.</p><p>Oh, yeah. People kissed on this holiday. At this moment, really. Rio barely had to tilt her chin up and her face was inches from Agatha’s - Agatha had scooted closer, and she balanced on her knees with one of her arms draped across the back of the sofa.</p><p>Agatha was breathing heavily, her eyes boring past Rio’s and essentially looking into the bared underbelly of her soul. Rio only had to instinctively bring her fingers up to Agatha’s cheek, brushing with the back of her knuckles, before Agatha dipped her chin down so that her nose wouldn’t bump against Rio’s as she pressed their lips together.</p><p>Rio cupped the back of Agatha’s neck and held onto it like a lifeline, fingers threaded through thick, wavy hair. The kiss was only chaste for a few moments - Rio found her tongue exploring the insides of Agatha’s mouth fairly quickly. And it was her first time truly <em>exploring</em> - compared to the other times, where she or Agatha would be trying to conquer each other.</p><p>The difference in tone, the prioritization of feeling rather than hunger, had Rio hearing things. Agatha’s soft breaths as she nipped at Rio’s bottom lip. The buzzing of the very nice fridge in the next room. The rubbing of her pants as Agatha put her warm weight on Rio, now straddling her.</p><p>Rio’s other hand flew to Agatha’s hip, not groping, just holding, like a reminder that Agatha was really there. Agatha didn’t grind her hips, exactly, but she moved enough that Rio felt herself harden under Agatha’s touch, even with the layers between them. When Agatha’s hand started to travel down Rio’s sternum and fiddle with one of her shirt buttons, Rio had to break the kiss.</p><p>“Agatha,” she panted. “I can’t… I can’t do this.” Agatha’s eyes looked like shattered windows, and her brows creased in a confused, hurt sort of anger. Rio backtracked, and she felt tears prick at the corner of her eyes. “I can’t just fuck you, Agatha, especially after what I learned tonight. I’m not… I’m not the type to have sex without feelings.” Rio shook like an anxious kitten. “I’m sorry, okay? I can leave - ”</p><p>“You think I don’t have feelings for you?” Agatha asked, shock laced in her voice.</p><p>“If you do, you sure have a funny way of showing it,” Rio muttered.</p><p>“I’m not the best with emotions.” Rio watched Agatha’s throat bob uncomfortably at the admission. “I’m sure you’ve at least partially figured that out.”</p><p>“How can you still like me?” Rio was crying now. “After I gave you the biggest tragedy of your life?”</p><p>“Rio, baby.” Agatha held Rio’s face in her hands. It made Rio’s heart quiver. Agatha’s thumb caught one of Rio’s tears in its track. “You’re blaming yourself for something you didn’t even know about until an hour ago.”</p><p>“But I don’t get it. How you can even stand to look at me.”</p><p>Agatha searched Rio’s face. God, it was probably blotchy. “You’re not too horrible to look at.”</p><p>“I don’t know how to do this,” Rio disclosed.</p><p>Agatha’s expression turned puzzled. “Have sex with me?”</p><p>“No.” Rio did let out a breathy chuckle at that, though. “Grieve.”</p><p>“I don’t know, either,” Agatha admitted. “I’m just as confused as you are.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hands. They were on Agatha’s hips - the older woman hummed at the touch, and Rio felt a touch guilty. She’d just been deep in thought; that hadn’t been her intended reaction. “But you’ve had years.”</p><p>“That’s the thing about grief, yeah?” Agatha sighed. She touched her forehead to Rio’s temple and relaxed her body, her thumb still brushing against Rio’s cheek. “It’s part of why I was so hesitant about telling you. It’s like being lost in a cave and I feel like I dropped you in here with me.”</p><p>“It’s not about what I do or don’t deserve,” Rio whispered. “I want to be here with you. We can navigate it all together, now.”</p><p>Agatha brought her head up to lock eyes with Rio. Rio felt the weight of it - as if she’d died and her heart was being compared to a feather. “It still bewilders me that you don’t hate me through all of this… And I feel so guilty for being grateful about that.”</p><p>Rio let a relieved sob escape her. “How do you think <em>I</em> feel?”</p><p>When Agatha’s lips were atoms apart from touching Rio’s again, Rio nodded and they shared a small kiss. Agatha resituated herself in Rio’s lap, which in turn made Rio groan.</p><p>Agatha must have known something was up, because she then whispered in Rio’s ear. “Tell me what you want.”</p><p>Rio’s nails dug into the soft silk of Agatha’s sleep shirt. “I… fuck, I want you. Is that bad? Considering the mood?”</p><p>“God, no.” Agatha delivered a soft kiss to the lobe of Rio’s ear, and then she gave it a little nibble. Rio felt the hairs on her arm stand up as a chill shot up her spine. And then Agatha asked, “Where do you want me?”</p><p>Anywhere? From the tone of Agatha’s voice, that’s what Rio was thinking she meant. “I… The… Your bedroom?”</p><p>Agatha just chuckled gently, and she looked Rio in the eye when she answered, “Yeah, Rio, you can take me to bed.”</p><p>Rio’s heart blossomed even though it was the dead of winter. She practically leapt up off the couch in excitement - and, of course, she’d slipped her hands underneath Agatha’s thighs to keep her in her arms as she did so. Agatha yelped in shock and her arms wrapped around Rio’s neck to steady her balance.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha sounded surprised, but a little giddy. Maybe turned on? “You don’t even know where the bedroom is. Let me down, please.”</p><p>“Since you said please.” Rio gingerly set Agatha down and gave her enough time to firmly plant her feet on the floor before fully letting go.</p><p>Agatha’s room was nicely decorated, with old and expensive-looking furniture. That’s about all Rio got in before she had to take off her leather pants. “These are getting way too fuckin’ tight,” she mumbled.</p><p>Agatha slipped the first button of her pajama shirt out when Rio stopped her. “No, I want to do that.” Agatha’s eyes widened, soft and vulnerable like a prey animal’s, as she crawled backwards onto her bed. Rio quickly followed, sans pants, until Agatha hit the headboard and Rio towered over her. She then bent down to nibble at Agatha’s earlobe; the older woman squirmed under her.</p><p>Rio just chuckled, her hand skirting up Agatha’s shirt. “You sensitive there, pretty boy?” She licked up the shell of Agatha’s ear and then blew on it. Agatha trembled and a loud moan ripped from her throat. “I bet if I touched your sweet cunt right now, it’d be weeping.”</p><p>Agatha growled as her hands fisted on either side of Rio’s shirt. And then Agatha yanked her arms apart - the first few buttons of Rio’s shirt popped off, flying somewhere over the edges of the bed and around the room.</p><p>“Hey!” Rio protested. “I bought this shirt specifically for the party.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Sucks.”</p><p>Rio harrumphed and, in response, sat back up so that she was straddling Agatha’s thighs before doing the same thing: taking the opening of Agatha’s soft sleep shirt and ripping it open.</p><p>“My shirt is <em>way</em> more expensive than yours!” Agatha complained.</p><p>“<em>Sucks</em>.” Now with Agatha’s shirt open, Rio started massaging Agatha’s nipples with her thumbs and forefingers.</p><p>Any smart-slack remark Agatha had on deck was swabbed away as she practically whimpered. “That… that feels good.”</p><p>“I bet.” Rio took her mouth to one and Agatha’s hand shot up to cradle Rio’s head as she suckled. Rio got to feel Agatha’s nipples pebble under her tongue. When she reached Agatha’s shorts, she kissed the other woman’s waistline.</p><p>“So handsome and strong,” Rio murmured, digging her fingers into the stretch marks that adorned Agatha’s stomach. “Especially here.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach tensed under Rio’s words and touch, a mix of desire and the lifting of a burden. “Rio,” she groaned out. “Don’t tease. Not… not tonight.” She licked her lips, nice enough to add on, “I won’t tease back, promise. Maybe.”</p><p>“<em>Mi corazón.</em>” Rio tugged under Agatha’s shorts and tugged them down. She chortled in not-really-shock when she saw Agatha wasn’t wearing anything under there, and she was in full view. Glistening bush and labia as pouty as the lips on her face. “Of course.”</p><p>“It’s hygienic,” Agatha pointed out. “You’re supposed to…to…” She stuttered as Rio brought her fingers to Agatha’s slit and gently brushed up and down. “Air out… Fuck.”</p><p>“No, continue.” Rio dipped into Agatha’s folds just a bit, and moaned when she realized just how wet Agatha was.</p><p>“Just eat me out,” Agatha cried, and she sounded so openly desperate Rio felt bad for the five seconds it took for the words to leave her mouth and for Rio to lie on her stomach and lick up to Agatha’s bejeweled clit. “Oh, fuck, just like that.” Agatha tugged on Rio’s hair as she lapped up the gathering wetness near Agatha’s entrance before she inserted a finger.</p><p>Rio knows she made Agatha come several times like this - the way Agatha’s body would seize momentarily or her walls would clench around Rio’s fingers. The way Rio would have more liquid desire to shamelessly slurp up. She felt her nose and chin get wet with it. Rio could truly go on for hours tasting Agatha, but at some point, the heel of Agatha’s palm dug into Rio’s temple and she was forced to come up for air.</p><p>“Wha - ?” Rio blinked to get her vision back into focus to see Agatha, flushed to her sternum, panting. Her face got cold, slick drying on her chin.</p><p>“You made me come at least three times,” Agatha gasped out. “I need a fuckin’ break. Come here.”</p><p>Rio crawled back up to Agatha and kissed her deeply. She shoved her tongue into Agatha’s mouth and let Agatha suck on it. And then she asked, “You taste good, right?”</p><p>“Mmm.” Agatha wriggled until she could easily tug her shirt off of her body, leaving her nude. “You’re wearing way too much, by the way.”</p><p>Rio shrugged her own shirt off, mewling when Agatha took advantage and started flicking her nipples. They grew puffy under Agatha’s touch.</p><p>Agatha murmured, “Now the underwear, sweetheart,” before a hand gently cupped her groin.</p><p>Rio wondered if that was the first time Agatha had ever used that term of endearment for her in any sort of serious way. Her breath hitched as her hips bucked into Agatha’s palm, though Agatha was at least kind enough to remove it so Rio could take her boxer briefs off. She sat straight up when she was done, and Agatha’s hands found themselves around Rio’s hips.</p><p>Rio was not the type of person to have wallowed in dysphoria after a certain point in her life. She became confident in the body she’d grown, and she pulled, dammit. Though the way Agatha was looking at her through hooded eyes had her feeling almost giddy.</p><p>“You’re blushing,” Agatha cooed, and she drew a line with her finger down Rio’s happy trail until she hit a thatch of trimmed hair. Rio’s blush then grew sweltering, the heat so intense on her face she had to breath slowly to actually feel any of the oxygen reaching her lungs.</p><p>Agatha’s finger traced up Rio’s hardening cock until it got to the frenum piercing; then, Agatha took it between her thumb and forefinger and began to wiggle it. Rio gasped. “Fuck,” Agatha said, “I need you inside me.”</p><p>Rio got overwhelmed thinking about that until a realization stopped her in her tracks. “I, um, didn’t really plan on this, so I don’t have any condoms on me.”</p><p>Suddenly, a part of Agatha turned shy, her hand leaving the most sensitive part of Rio’s body and moving back to her torso, fingers skirting along her abs: a safer place, maybe. “I… I don’t care, if you don’t.”</p><p>Rio hesitated. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“I - I promise you, the doctor diagnosed me with menopause at my check up before the semester.” Rio watched Agatha breathe deeply and slowly. Her chest was still flushed. “Though I get if you don’t want to waste your first time rawdogging it on me.” Agatha glanced to the side, breaking her eye contact. “Unless that’s already happened…?”</p><p>“It hasn’t,” Rio admitted. “I got pickier after Copenhagen, if I’m being honest.”</p><p>“In what way?”</p><p>Rio kneeled down so that her and Agatha’s faces were parallel. “I’d want to be exclusive.” She held Agatha’s face and gently pushed with her fingertips so that Agatha would be forced to look her in the eye again. “I’d… really want to care about her.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha’s eyes shone with unshed tears.</p><p>“I wanna be inside of you,” Rio rushed out. “I wanna be close to you.”</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha squeezed her eyes shut. “The thought of you coming inside me…”</p><p>Rio’s brain short circuited at that. “Don’t tell me too much or I might just come <em>outside</em> of you.”</p><p>“Hurry up then, cowgirl.” Agatha lifted her hips when Rio climbed off of her so that it could be Rio slotted inside Agatha’s legs. Rio took one of her hands and pressed against the back of Agatha’s thigh to lift it; Agatha sighed at the stretch.</p><p>Rio’s other hand took her now fully hard length, and then she realized something. “Um, do we need lube?”</p><p>“No, Christ, you’ve made me come enough times already.” Agatha practically ground the words out.</p><p>“Okay, okay.” Rio placed the head of her cock at Agatha’s clit, rubbing them softly together before dipping down and gathering the copious amounts of desire still leaking out of Agatha. The older woman groaned and one fist clenched the bedsheets - the other snaked up Rio’s neck and pushed her head down until their lips crashed together.</p><p>When Rio broke the kiss to suck on Agatha’s neck and give herself a breather, that’s when she guided herself in. The first thing she realized was just how <em>wet</em> Agatha was. Look, she’d fingered women before, and knew what the inside of a vagina felt like, but to feel it unrestricted with her cock? It was fucking mindblowing. Rio swore her and Agatha’s hearts were thrumming in a synchronous rhythm as she slowly inched herself in.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha grunted, and it made Rio pause. Agatha just responded with, “No, keep going. I forgot how thick you were.” A beat. “I can feel your fuckin’ smirk, jackass.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers drifted to Agatha’s clitoris when she didn’t have to hold her length anymore, giving it little flicks to ease the process. When Agatha moaned, it hit Rio right in the ear drum. Rio pressed her finger into Agatha’s jewelry before fully sheathing herself inside the older woman. Agatha’s response was a keening whimper, and she clenched. God, Rio had to hold in to not burst right then and there.</p><p>When Agatha snaked a hand down to twist at Rio’s nipple, Rio cried, delivering an unintentionally hard thrust that had Agatha shuddering. “Agatha, I… <em>Mierda</em>, you’re making this so hard.”</p><p>“Poor thing.” Rio growled at Agatha’s little taunt and kept up the pace, hammering her dick. She could feel her tip bump into Agatha’s cervix with every thrust, and Agatha openly panted at the feeling. “Fuck, that’s it. Fuck me just like that, pretty girl.”</p><p>Rio inched her knees towards Agatha to get a better angle and went for it. Her hand pressed down on Agatha’s stomach, and Agatha cried out at the fullness it made her feel. Rio’s thumb was still in position to give Agatha’s clit a little bit of attention here and there; her main focus was keeping upright to plow Agatha into next Tuesday.</p><p>She wavered when Agatha gripped her back and raked her nails down. Even with as blunt as they were, Rio relished in the sting they gave. She knew she’d be sporting angry red lines for at least a day or so.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whined. “Fuck, can I ride you?”</p><p>“Holy shit, yes, just…” Rio slowly exited Agatha, and both of them made noises of complaint at the loss of such sensitive contact.</p><p>Rio scrambled onto her back and watched as Agatha straddled her - and she couldn’t help but stare at her cock, angrily hard and red and covered in Agatha’s desire and previous orgasms. Agatha measured Rio’s cock against her stomach and then pumped once, twice. Her fingers skimmed their way to the tip and then gently pulled back at the foreskin until Rio winced.</p><p>“Ugh, fuck.” Agatha stood on her knees. “I can’t even tease you, I need this too fuckin’ badly.”</p><p>Rio got to experience entering Agatha all over again, though this time it happened much more quickly now that she’d handed over the reins to the pace. With Agatha’s weight now resting on her, that and the combination of actually feeling Agatha’s cunt had Rio feeling dizzy. Which meant she had no idea Agatha was going to pinch both of her nipples simultaneously until she actually did so - and Rio yelped.</p><p>“Spread my ass so you can get deeper,” Agatha ordered, and Rio used both of her hands to hold Agatha’s plush cheeks as she spread them apart. Agatha groaned and her hips gyrated, shamelessly grinding for her pleasure. “You think you can wait until I come first, pretty girl?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio admitted, trying not to sob. “I’m… I’m already kinda close.”</p><p>“Fuck, let me catch up then.” Agatha’s hand trailed down her stomach until she could rub at her clit.</p><p>“Can I do it?” Rio asked, mouth watering at the thought of touching Agatha’s cunt again.</p><p>“You keep your hands where I asked you to.” Agatha’s other hand rested above Rio’s sternum, her fingers lightly pressing just below Rio’s jawline.</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Rio squeaked out. Her orgasm started to boil in her gut. “A-Agatha, I - ”</p><p>She dug her nails into Agatha’s ass as her climax ripped through her. Her resulting moans were unrestrained and high-pitched - she’d never actually fully come inside someone before. Not on purpose, anyhow. And this was still different, as <em>that</em> time - the condom had broken, so she’d still had that layer between her and Agatha.</p><p>Her thighs shook as she felt herself spurt her release inside the other woman. She could feel the come around her, could feel Agatha clenching hard as Rio gave one last hard thrust inside her. It made Agatha collapse on top of Rio, presumably tumbling into her own orgasm. Rio’s vision went white.</p><p>Rio had to get her breathing under control before she fully came back.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha moaned, her nose in the crook of Rio’s neck.</p><p>Rio weakly smirked. “Not my name.”</p><p>Agatha, not even looking up, took Rio’s cheeks between her fingers and smushed them together, which made Rio look like a fish out of water. “Don’t get cocky.”</p><p><em>Cocky</em>. Rio hummed at that.</p><p>“That counts.”</p><p>Rio scoffed and decided to change the convo instead of taking the bait. “I could clean you up, if you want. With my mouth.”</p><p>“Christ, Rio. Fuck.” Agatha managed to get herself off of Rio’s dick - which had quickly softened - and Rio helped her get on her back.</p><p>“You’d just have to stay there,” Rio whispered. “I can take care of it.”</p><p>Agatha was extremely sensitive. Her labia were puffy and red, her clitoris angrily poking out against its jewelry. Even though Rio gave slow, tentative licks, Agatha cried or whimpered with the majority of them.</p><p>Rio spread Agatha’s inner lips out, watching as Agatha’s muscles had her clenching hard enough to push some cum out. By the looks of it, both of theirs. Rio licked her lips. “Got one more left in you?”</p><p>She heard Agatha’s breath hitch above her. “Rio.”</p><p>Rio kissed one of the dimples of Agatha’s inner thigh. “C’mon, I know you can.”</p><p>Rio knew that would get Agatha; she’d overstimulate herself out of spite. “Fine.”</p><p>“There we go, <em>guapito</em>.” Rio lapped at Agatha’s entrance while taking a careful thumb and scraping it over Agatha’s inflamed clit. The older woman keened, her thighs clamping against Rio’s head.</p><p>Rio was careful to not be too harsh in her ministrations. She kept to fiddling with Agatha’s piercing or making sure she didn’t peel the clitoral hood back, giving Agatha some buffer. She used stimulating Agatha’s clit to get the majority of her cum out. She realized her own cum tasted kind of salty. Did Agatha like that? Did she crave it in the way Rio craved Agatha’s taste?</p><p>When Agatha reached her slow, energy-sapping peak, Rio reached a mental peak of her own: she really liked Agatha Harkness.</p><p>No, fuck she <em>loved</em> her.</p><p>She couldn’t help but stare at Agatha as they both lay on their backs a few moments later. Agatha held her arm up to her forehead, which gave Rio a clean view of an unshaven armpit. Nice.</p><p>Rio then turned her head to look up at Agatha’s ceiling. It was filtered by moonlight, but Rio could tell Agatha was rich enough to own a house with no popcorn ceilings. “Can I ask a question?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“It’s kind of emotionally heavy.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose. “I figured.”</p><p>“Did you ever picture him? Like, imagine him?” Rio saw the shapes on the ceiling change as a small breeze ruffled whatever leaves were on the tree outside Agatha’s bedroom. “When you’ve been imagining him for all these years, how does he look to you?”</p><p>Agatha sat with those words for a minute before she responded. “You don’t want to come up with your own image?”</p><p>“I trust you,” Rio said. “And I want to imagine the same Nicholas you do.”</p><p>“Brown hair. A little dimple. I would’ve called him Nicky, I think, until he begged me to stop because he was too old.” Rio heard Agatha’s voice grow thick. “I didn’t even realize I was picturing him with your eyes until I ran into you again.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio felt her heart metaphorically expanding. Or maybe it was just a heart attack. She tried to sound nonchalant as she said, “You remembered my eyes?”</p><p>“Not subconsciously.” Rio’s sure Agatha was trying to sound witty, but she just sounded a bit whiny.</p><p>A moment of silence. Not an awkward one, but the kind that can be shared between two people who maybe don’t mind sharing space with each other. And then.</p><p>“Rio.” The voice was small, in a vulnerable, post-coital way. “I want to ask a question now.”</p><p>Rio turned on her side so she could look at Agatha better. “Yeah?”</p><p>Agatha looked off to the side, as if she didn’t want to look at Rio while she said it. “I… and don’t laugh at me.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed. She had no idea how Agatha came to the conclusion that she might do that. “Okay.”</p><p>“I just.” Agatha chewed on her lip before the words seemingly rushed out at once. “Is it bad if I’m falling in love with you?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped. It was like her response was gripping to her throat, clinging with all ten fingers and toes.</p><p>Agatha had fucking beaten her to the punch.</p><p>The silence must be long enough that Agatha whipped her head around so that she was looking Rio in the eye. “Don’t just say nothing.”</p><p>Rio begged the cogs in her brain to start whirring so she could get even half a sentence out. “That’s like. The best thing you could say to me.”</p><p>Rio got to watch Agatha’s blue eyes grow just a little hopeful in real time. “Really?”</p><p>“I can’t believe you told me first,” Rio admitted. “I figured I’d get a couple of weeks to tell you in a really nice way.”</p><p>“Well, too late.” Agatha smiled smugly, her eyes closing in a sense of justice. If she shifted closer to Rio so she could burrow into the depths of Rio’s body warmth, that was, presumably, for Agatha to know and for Rio to not snitch about. “I won.”</p><p>“Whatever makes you sleep at night,” Rio quipped.</p><p>“I think this will do just fine,” was what Agatha responded with, her head tucked into the crook of Rio’s neck.</p><p>Rio liked that - her chest fluttered when she realized she was going to get the privilege of getting to not just sleep, but <em>wake up</em> with Agatha. She succumbed to her dreams shamelessly cradling Agatha under her very nice and soft duvet.</p><p>(The morning after was sweet, but a reality check. “We have to tell the university,” Agatha had told her over what was probably expensive coffee and Rio’s French toast - as Agatha had horribly burned her own attempt and Rio had startled awake to the smoke alarm going off.</p><p>“That works,” Rio agreed, and Agatha had given her a peck on the corner of her lips. Rio then asked, “Does this make you my boyfriend?”</p><p>“Don’t push it,” Agatha teased.</p><p>Also, as Rio had prepared to leave, she’d learned the hard way Agatha’s little shit of a rabbit, Scratchy, had taken a dump in her shoes.)</p><p>And a few weeks later, when Rio walked up to Lilia a little nervously. Agatha was not there with her because, as she’d quoted, “Lilia is terrifying as fuck. You’re fresh meat, so she’ll be nicer to you.”</p><p>“Good morning, Mrs. Calderu.”</p><p>“It’s Ms.,” Lilia corrected. Okay, so Rio should just kill herself, then. “HR is on the fourth floor. Take the elevator, go down the hall, and make a right.”</p><p>“Okay, thanks.” Rio’s brain then caught up with what was said. “Wait, how did you know - ”</p><p>“You two are about as subtle as two dogs in heat being locked in a room together.” Rio at least had the decency to flush at that. “Tell Agatha she’s a coward for not coming with you.”</p><p>Rio nodded animatronically. “Gotcha. Um, have a good day?”</p><p>Lilia hummed and started clacking on her computer again as a sign that the conversation was over.</p><p>When Rio walked out that door, she certainly felt as embarrassed as all hell, but she was also a little relieved and nervously excited to see where this path with Agatha would take her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha was dreaming.</p><p>Of an enthusiastic wet mouth between her quaking thighs, tongue playing with her clit piercing in a way that set her nerves aflame and triggered her breath to catch in her throat. Her fingers were buried in her lover’s hair, forcing their lips down onto her pussy.</p><p>Fuzzy, as if underwater, they were purring to her in a deep, husky voice, <i>Yeah, you like that, cariño? Fuck, you’re so responsive, your legs are trembling, and you’re completely soaked. You needed this, didn’t you? Whimpering in your sleep ‘cus you’re dreaming about me fucking you. Keep moaning my name, sweetheart, gets me real fuckin’ hard.</i></p><p>It was when her clit piercing was clasped between her lover’s teeth and delicately tugged, that Agatha was jolted from unconsciousness with a wheezing gasp.</p><p>She was splayed out on her back in the center of the bed. Rumpled sheets were bunched around her waist. Weak dawn sunlight peeked through the gaps in the bedroom’s blinds and curtains, beams spilling onto the floor and the very end of the mattress.</p><p>Her legs were sore, thighs aching, from how they had been frog-tied the previous evening; now they had been pushed open, spread wide, in a lewd display. And right between the apex of her thighs, with the sheets covering them, there was a human-shaped lump, head bobbing as their mouth worshipped her cunt.</p><p>Blinking up at the ceiling, her lingering drowsiness rapidly dissipated. Her sleepiness was overwhelmed and replaced by desire and spine-tingling pleasure. Agatha felt two freezing cold fingertips hook into her entrance as if to peel her open to feast upon. The tongue curling around her piercing retreated, to lick a long, broad stripe over the length of her entrance before dipping inside.</p><p>Humming, Agatha pushed the sheets back. She chuckled when a pair of bright brown eyes peered up at her from between her legs, blinking owlishly and gleaming with mischief. “Good morning, you.”</p><p>“Morning,” Rio replied, although the word was garbled and barely intelligible because of how busy her mouth was.</p><p>“Couldn’t even wait until I woke up?” she said raspily, raking her fingers through her worshipper’s sweaty mop of dark hair.</p><p>“Since when have you known me to be patient?” Rio pouted, pausing in her licking. “Besides, I needed you. You know I’m addicted. Had to get a hit.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “You had your way with me last night, and even after I wrung you dry, you’re raring to go again, less than six hours later. You’re going to ruin your appetite for breakfast, you know, <i>mi amor</i>.”</p><p>Rio dragged her tongue slowly up Agatha’s slit before pulling away, although not without one last teasing flick against Agatha’s throbbing clit. Licking her wet lips clean of the older woman’s slick, her girlfriend propped her chin on top of Agatha’s mons pubis.</p><p>The younger woman smirked, rubbing her chin back and forth as if to enjoy the sensation of Agatha’s coarse hair against her skin; her bush had become more salt than pepper over the last few years, and her girlfriend was obsessed with it, twirling the curly hairs around her fingers and tugging on them playfully.</p><p>Rio looked far too pleased with herself as she licked her lips. “You and I <i>both</i> know that my breakfast consists of green tea and then a protein bar before my first lecture of the morning,” she replied. “And yours isn’t much better, Professor I-can-live-off-coffee-alone. You think you can survive on caffeine and one meal a day.”</p><p>“Hm, true,” Agatha murmured. “What’s the time?”</p><p>“Seis.”</p><p>Thirty minutes before their usual alarm. Rio planned this. Agatha didn’t respond verbally— simply grasped the back of Rio’s head and pushed it down, back towards her pussy. “You make me come in the next ten minutes, and you can fuck me before we need to shower.”</p><p>Rio dove back in eagerly, sucking and licking and swirling her tongue. Six minutes was all she needed to trigger an explosive orgasm, and it was with the excitement of a boisterous puppy that she sank her cock inside of Agatha and brought them to simultaneous completion again in only another seven.</p><p>Her girlfriend was quick to crawl back between her legs to clean her up with her mouth— once again making Agatha come undone, quivering from head to toe— before rolling onto her back with a contented sigh.</p><p>When she began to clamber out of bed, heaving herself up and grabbing Rio’s favorite sweater to pull over her head, her girlfriend peered up at her with a pout. She looked even more upset when Agatha shimmied a pair of lace black boxers up her legs, covering her favorite snack.</p><p>“Where are you going?” she asked.</p><p>“To start our coffee and tea,” Agatha chuckled, leaning in to kiss her. Rio’s mouth tasted like her pussy, and she savoured the kiss for as long as she could, before she had to breathe. “Go and shower, baby, so it’ll be brewed by the time you finish up.”</p><p>“Why don’t we shower together?” her girlfriend suggested, wiggling her eyebrows.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, tapping her cheek playfully. “You and I both know that’s a recipe for distraction, and I cannot afford to be late to work today.”</p><p>She ushered Rio off into the bathroom to wash. Fishing her glasses from the bedside table, she pushed them up her nose and stretched out her aching muscles, shivering.</p><p>It was chilly, and despite their townhouse having adequate heating, the cold was still able to seep through the old brownstone townhouse walls to induce a cool bite to the air. Agatha padded into the kitchen to brew tea and coffee, and feed her beloved elderly pet rabbit Scratchy.</p><p>She could scarcely believe it had been nearly ten years since she and Rio first met at that conference in Copenhagen, and the young woman had reoriented her entire existence. Five years since Rio joined the faculty at Salem University, since they started dating after that pivotal 80s-themed New Year's party, and she completely revolutionized Agatha’s life once again.</p><p>Now, she couldn’t imagine living without her.</p><p>In 2020, Rio had been a young, quick-witted, and somewhat cocky PhD student when Agatha had first argued with her over her keynote speech; now, in 2030, she was an Assistant Professor in her early thirties.</p><p>She was still just as sharp-mouthed and intelligent, and now only a single academic paper publication away from being eligible for tenure and a major senior position. She had charged along her tenure track and was thriving in terms of her career; she was publishing papers left and right, running her own modules, and mentoring students.</p><p>Agatha was settled in her position of Dean of the Liberal Arts Department. The department itself had changed drastically since Rio joined five years ago. Their colleagues and friends had moved on; Alice had taken on the Assistant Dean role at Northeastern, the same position her wife held at Salem; Sharon had retired to become a “full time wine connoisseur”; Wanda had joined the faculty to replace her, having married a computer science professor, and was now off for a year on maternity.</p><p>(Hilariously, Rio still held a miniature grudge against her because of how she and Agatha had hooked up in the long-ago past, and how she had flirted with her.</p><p>Rio had made it clear that she was more than happy that Wanda was off with her nerdy-ass husband, popping out babies, so she wasn’t anywhere near Agatha. As Rio reminded her often, Agatha was her boyfriend, thank you very much.)</p><p>Jennifer and Lilia had stayed, alongside Agatha and Rio, but new professors were joining and leaving the school all the time, as academic funding was slashed and reassigned.</p><p>Agatha had received countless offers herself over the past couple of years to head up the liberal arts and history departments of numerous universities, including Harvard at one point, but she’d turned all of them down.</p><p>Although she was not particularly attached to Salem as a place, she was attached firmly to Rio. More than anything, she enjoyed working alongside her girlfriend and the flexible schedule Salem U awarded her. Over the last year, since she turned fifty, she had been reflecting on what aspects of her life were the most important.</p><p>And the most important aspect? Her relationship.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze wandered over to the fridge, which was decorated with dozens upon dozens of Polaroids. Photos that Rio had taken with her beloved, practically ancient camera, candid shots that Agatha often didn’t even know were being taken. In the park, in cafes, in museums, in their offices, in their house.</p><p>Many of them were selfies, Rio beaming at the camera and managing to catch Agatha behind her, reading or doing paperwork or lying on the couch with Scratchy sleeping on her chest.</p><p>There was the occasional photo where Agatha had caught Rio snapping the Polaroid at the last second, and she looked like a deer in headlights, or was smiling exasperatedly, but also with an air of fondness.</p><p>It had at first seemed like a silly hobby to her, but soon Agatha was the one visiting the specialty photography shops to buy the film for Rio. She was even picking out adorable little bunny magnets so they could pin the photos to their fridge.</p><p>(The more… <i>revealing</i> ones, of which there were many, were kept in their bedroom safe. Although Agatha did have one in her wallet, of Rio lying naked on her front, splayed out on their bed with her head turned to smirk at the camera. She used it as a pick-me-up on slow days.)</p><p>The photos documented their life together. They were proof that despite all the suffering Agatha had gone through alone, losing their child and choosing to bear that burden herself, she had fought through it all.</p><p>She had survived, even though at times she’d wondered if life was truly worth living. Fate had pulled on that invisible string to ensure that she ultimately found herself back in Rio’s embrace in the end.</p><p>Which was where she stayed. Where she knew, without a doubt, she belonged.</p><p>She’d always known from the moment Rio re-entered her sphere of existence that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with her. Rio was undoubtedly the love of her life. She never, <i>ever</i> thought she would be the kind of woman to settle down, and certainly not with a woman seventeen years her junior— but it had happened.</p><p>She and Rio were in a long-term committed relationship. They lived and owned a home together now. It had been especially hard for Agatha to sell her colonial-style house, leaving Nicky’s nursery behind. It was only after extensive therapy that she’d felt comfortable enough to, her therapist having assured her that Nicky’s memory did not live in those four walls— the memory of him lived on inside of Agatha and Rio. Them moving to a different house, was not leaving him behind. It was reuniting the parts of him in their hearts and moving forward together in his honor.</p><p>And their new house was wonderful. An 18th century-style New England farmhouse on the outskirts of Salem, with an extensive lawn and vegetable garden, and a wildflower meadow that backed onto the woods. Nicky had a little corner in Agatha’s downstairs study, where his shark figurine was sat upon a corner table, along with a box containing his birth certificate and a tiny newborn onesie. There was a memorial stone in the meadow for him as well.</p><p>Agatha’s old house had been sold to a young lesbian couple who were expecting a baby by adoption; Agatha specifically chose them and gave them a lower price, even though a real estate developer offered her nearly 50k more. She wanted others to have a chance to raise a family in that house— a chance she never got.</p><p>So they now shared a house, a bedroom, and finances, and leaned on each other for emotional support. They were so sexually compatible that it was <i>insane</i>. The power struggles between them (especially those in the bedroom) had been ironed out, and their relationship was in a healthy, emotionally secure state. Hell, they’d gone to regular couples therapy together for three years, only stopping because their therapist moved out of state, but they'd felt settled enough to not need to go all that often after that.</p><p>They’d even had a conversation about kids. Agatha could no longer have them, of course, as she was medically confirmed menopausal. She also had no desire to carry again due to how traumatizing birthing a stillborn baby, alone in the middle of the pandemic, had been. But they’d discussed adoption; they ultimately decided that they currently didn’t have enough time to dedicate to a child, what with all their teaching obligations and constant trips abroad for research, and that they would reassess once Rio made tenure.</p><p>While a decade ago, all of those things would have terrified Agatha, they made her extremely happy now.</p><p>And Agatha had come to the recent realization that she had everything she could possibly want in life— wealth, job security, a mortgageless house, great friends and colleagues— except one thing.</p><p>She wanted Rio as her wife.</p><p>She wanted to marry her. And Agatha had been planning to propose to Rio for the last six months, on the ten year anniversary of their very first meeting. That day was rapidly approaching— Sunday, only a few days away.</p><p>She’d booked a private rooftop table at her girlfriend’s favorite authentic Puerto Rican restaurant, and convinced the curator at Salem U’s onsite historical and archeological museum to give her a key, so she could propose to Rio privately.</p><p>Agatha was simultaneously scared shitless… and the most excited she had ever been. While she was mostly confident Rio was going to say yes, there was still the teeniest, tiniest insecure voice at the back of her mind, asking <i>what if she says no?</i></p><p>Rio was still young. Hell, it still freaked Agatha out that she was millennial-Gen Z cusper. Rio might not want to tie herself in marriage to a woman in her fifties. <i>What if you lose her again?</i> Agatha’s brain screamed. It was unfathomable. Yet petrifying.</p><p>Shaking her head so that those thoughts dissolved, not wanting to get caught in an anxious spiral when the sun hadn’t even risen yet, Agatha poured boiled but partially cooled water over the coffee grounds in her French press, and then into the mug containing Rio’s loose green tea leaves in a tea infuser.</p><p>Waiting for their morning beverages to brew, she crossed over to the living room to release Scratchy from the indoor rabbit enclosure that Rio built for him from scratch.</p><p>“Good morning, <i>señor</i>,” she murmured, scooping him up into her arms for a nuzzle. After a moment, Scratchy pawed at her chest, head swivelling around searchingly. “She’ll be out soon, don’t worry.”</p><p>Her rabbit had formed an intensely strong attachment to Rio over the past few years. At first, he’d hated her; he’d pooped in her shoes, chewed holes through her discarded clothes, even actually bit her at one point. Rio used to insist that he was jealous and he didn’t want to share Agatha’s attention. But within six months of them moving in together, Scratchy was choosing to nap in Rio’s lap over Agatha’s, and was hopping around the house after her like an enamoured child.</p><p>Once lowered to the floor, the bunny slowly loped over to his bowl to munch on the freshly washed leafy greens and hay Agatha set out for him.</p><p>She was in the middle of removing the strainer full of soaked tea leaves from Rio’s mug when she felt her girlfriend press up behind her, grinding her crotch up against her ass and crowding Agatha up against the kitchen counter.</p><p>Her eyes slipped closed as Rio tenderly kissed the exposed side of her throat. Her hands wandered freely over her hips and around to cradle her belly beneath the stolen Berkeley sweater, the fingers branded VITA, <i>life</i>, caressing her stretch marks and scratching at her happy trail.</p><p>When Rio’s dominant hand started to slip lower, playing with the waistband of her boxers, Agatha tutted warningly. “Rio. Don’t start something that we won’t have time to finish. I still need to go and shower. Get Rhodes under control.”</p><p>“Rhodes wouldn’t be so rowdy if Dr Harkness wasn’t such a PILF.”</p><p>“A PILF?”</p><p>“Professor I love to fuck.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. Her girlfriend, the comedian. “Which you have already done this morning, twice.”</p><p>“Good things come in threes.”</p><p>“I already did, thanks to your generosity. Now settle down and give Rhodes a break. Poor guy’s gonna get chafed again.” Agatha reached behind her to pat over the younger woman’s crotch. “Calm down.”</p><p>Rio sighed heavily, as if it was a great personal hardship that she couldn’t fuck Agatha a third time that morning. “Fine,” she groaned. She planted one last kiss on her shoulder before retreating to go and greet Scratchy, who was thumping to get her attention.</p><p>She immediately started chatting to him in rapid Spanish, and although Agatha’s understanding of the language had improved massively, now at a C1 level, Rio was talking far too quickly and quietly for her to keep up.</p><p>She looked incredibly handsome; her wet hair was slicked back and she was dressed in a pair of dark brown pants and a cream short-sleeved shirt, which exposed her heavily tattooed arms.</p><p>When they’d met, Rio only had half sleeves. Now, she was close to fully covered, with only a couple of small gaps that Agatha had no doubt she had designs in mind to fill in. She knew that Rio would complete the look with a sweater of some kind, a belt, and her Timberlands or Docs.</p><p>Rio hip-checked her gently, taking over preparing their coffee and tea. “So I have a proposal,” she started off causally. “More like a request?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p><i>Proposal.</i></p><p>“Oh?” she said, as calmly as possible. “Is this going to be anything like your last request?”</p><p>“... Which one?”</p><p>“The Billy one.”</p><p>“Remind me of what that was again?”</p><p>“When you suggested that I let Billy cover one of my Medieval Europe seminars to give him teaching experience, and he decided to traumatize all the Undergrads by showing them extremely graphic bubonic plague photographs?”</p><p>Billy, Agatha’s chaotic past-Undergrad and Masters tutee, was now Rio’s PhD student, and he was just as big a pain in her ass now as he was five years ago.</p><p>“They asked that he come back to teach them again so clearly he did a good job… even if that one girl did faint and you had to fill out an incident report.” Rio shook her head. “Getting back on point— I was going to ask if you would give me feedback on my paper on ancient Scandinavian death rituals.”</p><p>Agatha glanced over at her, surprised. “The one where you discuss your theory about how the Asgardian folklore and myths influenced the culture surrounding ship burials?”</p><p>Rio had been working on it for months now on her own. Agatha had only caught glimpses of her writing it when she was curled up on their couch with her laptop on her knees, anxiously biting her nails and typing furiously.</p><p>Rio nodded, threading her hands together nervously. “Yeah. If this is going to be the paper that gets me awarded tenure… I need to know it’s solid before I submit it to a journal. I don’t want to go through months and months of revisions and peer review just because of stupid mistakes in my reasoning. You would be able to point anything like that out in seconds.”</p><p>She would. Agatha had a reputation for being so extremely thorough when examining dissertations and theses that her revisions would make students burst into tears. But she had never critiqued her girlfriend’s writing before.</p><p>People tended to take her corrections personally. Although she had faith Rio would understand that she was being meticulous to the point of ruthless, but objective, she was slightly worried that it may cause some tension between them.</p><p>“I would be harsh,” Agatha warned her, anxiously adjusting her glasses. “I would be as callous as any other peer reviewer. It’s likely I would tear apart your sentence structure and demand you delete and rewrite entire paragraphs.”</p><p>“That’s what I need,” Rio agreed. “I’m losing my mind just staring at the document day after day and wondering what it’s <i>missing</i>. You’ll be able to tell me… alongside ripping down my run-on sentences.”</p><p>“Then I’ll take a look tomorrow, if you’d like. I’m working from home. I think Lilia cancelled all my meetings, and my classes, strangely.”</p><p>“I think I will as well,” Rio replied, tilting her head thoughtfully. “I don’t have any classes, just essay grading and a student mentor meeting at 9am that I can do on Teams.” She paused and then added jokingly, “Hey, at least none of the students or other professors will see me cry when you break the news to me that it’s absolute shit.”</p><p>“You’re a great writer, darling. It may need some revisions and polishing, but it definitely will not be absolute shit.” Agatha softened. “Thank you for trusting me with it.”</p><p>“Nobody else I would trust my career with.” Rio threw her thumb back over her shoulder, towards the bedroom. “Your phone’s going crazy by the way. I put it on charge for you last night on my side of the bed, because you forgot.”</p><p>“It’s probably Jen,” Agatha grumbled, huddled into her girlfriend’s side. “There’s a budget meeting this morning and History 21, 22 and 23 are up on the chopping block because of lack of student engagement.”</p><p>“Aren’t those the History of Life Sciences courses?” Rio recalled from memory, looking concerned. “Jen leads those.”</p><p>“She does, but unfortunately, with the funding being slashed for the next academic year, at least ten of the upper division courses will have to be cancelled.” Agatha ran a hand over her face, shaking her head. It had been such an exhausting month already, and they were only just at the start of the second semester. “I told Jen to send me a plan to consolidate the three courses into one. But we’re going to have to make sacrifices.”</p><p>And while Agatha was known to be somewhat ruthless when it came to cutting courses that had low sign-up numbers, it did genuinely pain her to cut the courses of her closest friends and colleagues.</p><p>Rio raised Agatha’s hand to kiss her knuckles, pausing before she dropped one onto the dahlia tattoo decorating her inner wrist— a matching tattoo that she possessed as well. “Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help, okay? Might be able to help with some… stress relief.”</p><p>Agatha knew exactly what kind of stress relief Rio was talking about. It typically occurred in either one of their offices, with Agatha’s pants around her ankles, her underwear balled up in Rio’s pocket, and her girlfriend leaving her a thick, sticky mess in her pussy, that made it very awkward to teach students for the rest of the day.</p><p>Agatha was fairly certain that she had walked into important faculty meetings with a limp in her step, and given lectures in front of dozens of Undergrads before with Rio’s cum drenching the gusset of her panties and dribbling down her inner thighs.</p><p>“You think it’s hot when I’m frustrated,” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>“No… I think you’re hot <i>all</i> the time.”</p><p>“But especially when I get snappy and irritated. I mean, it’s what attracted you to me in the first place isn’t it? You enjoy it when I raise my voice and play rough with you.” She quirked an eyebrow. “Your degradation kink is showing,  <i>mi amor </i>.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, utterly shameless. “Yeah, and you enjoy putting me in my place, <i>querido</i>. You get off on being challenged, physically and intellectually. And I know that, because you,” she tapped Agatha lightly on her nose, with a teasing grin, “Soaked your underwear through on the first day we met, because an annoying but <i>very</i> smart PhD student dared to show you a little backbone.”</p><p>Touché.</p><p>Leaning in, Agatha whispered, “Yes, well, that annoying, smart PhD student was a pathetic little slut with a humiliation kink, who came in her pants in the middle of a bar from me stroking her thigh and making her beg.”</p><p>Rio whimpered. “<i>Your</i> pathetic little slut.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her sweetly, clawing at her chin to grasp and lift her head so their lips met. “Good girl.” Rio preened as Agatha stepped away, swallowing a few mouthfuls of her French press before checking the time. “Put my coffee in a travel cup and go defrost the car, will you, sweetheart? I need to shower.” They were in a time crunch now, and they needed to leave for work soon if they were going to beat the early morning traffic.</p><p>“It’s not that cold and there’s barely any ice, the car won’t need defrosting.”</p><p>“It absolutely will.”</p><p>“It won’t.”</p><p>Agatha quirked an eyebrow. “I’ll let you figure that one out then, while I’m in the bathroom. But if it’s not defrosted by the time we leave, I’m driving. And you won’t get head later.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped open in pure indignation.</p><p>“It’s your sex life on the line if you’re wrong.” Agatha backed away then, to shower and dress herself.</p><p>Smirking, Rio called after her, “Just remember this conversation, when you get super stressed out after your meeting today… because my office is only four doors down and I don’t have any lectures to give until this afternoon… if you need to <i>put your feet up</i>. In the air. Whilst you’re on your back, on top of your desk, with my fist inside your—”</p><p>“Sorry, can’t hear you,” Agatha shouted back, grinning widely as she slammed the bathroom door shut behind her.</p><p>“You totally can hear me.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I said you totally can hear—”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>She overheard Rio sigh loudly, but it was an amused, happy and wistful sound. “She’s ridiculous,” Agatha heard her tell Scratchy, her voice warm with fondness. “But that’s why we love her, right, <i>señor?</i>”</p><p>A beat of silence and then:</p><p>“Mierda, Agatha’s right, I gotta defrost the car.”</p><hr/><p>Salem U campus was a ghost town when they arrived. The majority of classes started at nine, and it was just past 8am. There were only a couple of students milling about, probably to snag the best spots in the library or grab breakfast from one of the cafeterias.</p><p>The staff parking lot had a separate entrance, and Rio pulled Agatha’s Lexus ES into their reserved parking spot before hopping out of the driver's seat and stalking around to the other side of the vehicle to open Agatha’s door on her behalf.</p><p>Agatha suppressed her smile; she had learned over the past four years that she quite enjoyed playing passenger princess for Rio, mostly because she found driving boring, but also because she got a kick out of her girlfriend acting so chivalrous.</p><p>Rio owned a second hand Jeep Compass that they’d bought for her 30th birthday. They utilized it mainly during the snowy Massachusetts winters (and Costco trips, and long, <i>long</i> drives down to her family home in Texas when they couldn’t arrange flights in time). Agatha’s hybrid Lexus was more eco-friendly for everyday commuting.</p><p>“I’ll see you later,” Agatha murmured, dragging Rio down by the neck of her sweater and her fist curled around her staff ID lanyard to kiss her. “And remember you’re covering that Senior Thesis tutorial for Jen at 4pm.”</p><p>“Remind me why I offered to cover that again?” she groaned.</p><p>“Because you’re a nice person.”</p><p>“Doesn’t sound like me. You sure you’ve got the right woman?” But then Rio’s expression shifted, into one of realization. “Wait, shit, is today Jen and Alice’s home study visit? Tell Jen I hope it goes well for them— I’ll text Alice and tell her the same.”</p><p>Their friends were in the middle of adopting a sweet little girl called Lorna. “Will do.” She smacked Rio on the ass firmly. “Now get.”</p><p>Rio darted forward for one last kiss, jostling Agatha’s glasses, before raising her hands. “I’m going, I’m going. Can’t let the students see us together and figure out that their professors are dating,” she said sarcastically.</p><p>Agatha snorted. “There’s enough gay drama within the department already, what with whatever weird ass pining Kate and Yelena have got going on.”</p><p>Those two PhD students had been dancing around each other since they met while studying for their Master’s, and they were oblivious to their reciprocated feelings towards each other.</p><p>Agatha and Rio had a bet on when they were finally going to get together. Rio said by their second year. Agatha said they wouldn’t realize until they submitted their theses.</p><p>“Last thing we need is any of them figuring out their two butch dyke professors are fucking, and then being forced to overhear their conversations contemplating our sex lives,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“I’ll make sure to throw some passive-aggressive comments into my lectures about you today, then, <i>mi vida</i>,” Rio winked, locking up the car and tossing Agatha the keys to clip to the carabiner on her belt. “Gotta keep up with the rival professors act. Can’t have them finding out that Dean Harkness is my boyfriend.”</p><p>“Will they actually be passive-aggressive, or are you going to get distracted and wax poetic to your students about ‘my stupid strong spindly hands and stupid forearms and biceps, and the stupid tight shirts I wear with the cuffs rolled up to show them off’?” she said dryly.</p><p>Rio flushed, pointing at her. “One time, Agatha! That was one time! Three years ago! And it was after that shitty university staff brunch where I had to drink four Bellinis to stop myself from whisking you off into the conference center bathroom, because you edged me with a handjob in the car and thought it would be funny if I had to hide a stiffie from the Vice Chancellor when we walked in!”</p><p>“It <i>was</i> funny. You were waddling like a penguin and had to tie your jacket around your waist,” Agatha cackled at the memory. “Lilia threatened to throw a glass of ice water on you.”</p><p>Rio grumbled, rolling her eyes, but it was clear from her grin that she wasn’t actually annoyed. “You suck.”</p><p>“And swallow,” Agatha quipped back.</p><p>“I’ll get you back for that one day.”</p><p>“And you always say that, darling.”</p><p>“Revenge is a dish best served cold.”</p><p>“It’s freezer burned at this point, love.”</p><p>“Yeah, well—”</p><p>Just when Rio was about to snark back, Agatha grasped hold of her sweater and blouse, lifting them up.</p><p>She was wearing a light sage green sports bra today, feeling comfortable enough that she didn’t feel the need to bind or tape herself.</p><p>Rio immediately fell silent, the gears in her head grinding to a halt as she stared. Her eyes zeroed in on Agatha’s boobs, as she intended, pupils dilating to the point of her brown irises being swallowed by black.</p><p>Agatha smirked when she spotted a small droplet of drool appear at the corner of Rio’s lips. As fast as she lifted her shirt and sweater, Agatha dropped them down again, smoothing them back into place, as if she had not just flashed her boobs at her girlfriend in a <i>very</i> public parking lot.</p><p>Rio whimpered in protest. “That’s so unfair,” she whined. “You <i>know</i> when you do that it fries my brain.” She shifted back and forth uncomfortably on her feet, obviously now sporting a bulge in her pants that was straining the front of the fabric. “Fuck.”</p><p>“Run along,” Agatha said sweetly. “Might want to duck into the pavilion and hide in bathroom for a while to <i>calm down</i> before you head over to History. I can’t imagine the rumours that would propagate if somebody were to see Professor Vidal hard as a rock this early in the morning while walking to her office.”</p><p>Rio tried to adjust her Salem U wax messenger bag so that it concealed her boner, which Agatha knew would not work at all, as it would bump up against her while in motion and make the situation hilariously worse.</p><p>“Well, I hope your budget meeting is <i>boring</i>,” Rio fired at her.</p><p>“Oh, ouch,” Agatha placed her hand over her heart, mock-wincing. “So cruel. You know, your comebacks have degraded in quality over the past four years.”</p><p>“And yet you are the one having to flash me to win arguments.” Rio stuck her tongue out at her childishly, her cheeks still a beautiful pink color, and then she called out, “<i>Te amo, te veo</i>,” <i>I love you, see you</i>, before hurrying off towards campus, because the gigantic lovergirl that she was refused to allow her to walk away from Agatha without telling her so.</p><p>The budget meeting was, rather unfortunately, very boring. Lilia narrowed her eyes at her as soon as she entered the conference room, nose wrinkling in that way it always did when she was somehow able to sense that Agatha was entering her presence freshly fucked.</p><p>Jen was already squaring off against the university’s financial team, her ire particularly directed towards a nervously sweating Dale, who had once accidentally hit on Alice when she was part of the senior faculty who attended these meetings.</p><p>Although they did manage to rescue Jen’s three scientific history classes from the cut by merging them into one comprehensive course, several others were unsaveable. Agatha was incensed by the finance team’s insistence on cancelling her seminar series focusing on the Salem Witch Trials; no amount of fighting that it was important and relevant to the history of the university was enough to convince them that it was worth keeping for the half a dozen or so students who subscribed to it every year.</p><p>She nearly lost it when the finance team suggested that they cut the number of lectures for History 101 and 102 by a third and switch those sections to reading assignments and independent study instead. Utter imbeciles.</p><p>By the time the meeting was over, Agatha was ready to commit murder, boiling with rage and despising the fact that her position as Dean meant she was forced to make decisions that could drastically affect her colleagues' salaries and the standard of teaching within her school.</p><p>The only saving grace was that coffee was provided, as well as little packets of Scottish shortbread. Agatha swept them all into her bag at the end of the meeting. Rio enjoyed them. She glared at everybody who looked as if they would dare to question the stealing cookies that she had personally ordered from catering, using her own money.</p><p>“If those idiots are <i>that</i> belligerent at the scholarships funding meeting, I’m going to demonstrate exactly how sharp the replica Nordic Bronze Age sword hung on my office wall is,” Agatha hissed.</p><p>She marched back towards the faculty office wing with Jen and Lilia following at her heels. Students jumped aside, lowering their eyes and scuttling away, not wanting to end up in the firing line.</p><p>“What did you expect? Salem U is becoming more and more like a for-profit corporation by the year. Finance don’t know a single thing about the structure of the school or the courses, Harkness,” Jen said in an irritated grumble. “All they care about is the money the students bring in, not their education.”</p><p>“Then they should stay in their lane and not try and dictate how we actually educate the students! The sheer <i>audacity</i> of those men to claim that the Women in History modules aren’t profitable enough and need to be ‘truncated’,” Agatha ranted. “It’s 20-<i>fuckin’</i>30 and misogyny and sexism are still rife in our academic system. I’ll show them the meaning of <i>truncated</i> when I swing my fucking sword at their fuckin’ di—”</p><p>“Hopefully,” Lilia interrupted her, before she could finish her threat, “Learning about the Shield Archeology Trust Oxford and Edinburgh exchange and training program will get them off your back. The news embargo about it lifts next week.”</p><p>Agatha stopped, turning back in confusion. “Yes, next Friday. The funding meeting is on Monday.” She’d checked her scrupulously maintained Outlook calendar just ten minutes ago.</p><p>“You’re not here, so there’s no point in going ahead with it. I requested they push it back a week. February 7th instead of the 29th,” Lilia responded.</p><p>Agatha blinked at her. “What do you mean I won’t be here?” she asked slowly.</p><p>“You’re on annual leave,” Jen said.</p><p>“I think I would know if I’d booked annual leave, Jennifer, since I have to book it at least six months in advance.”</p><p>Lilia and Jen went quiet. Lilia pursed her lips and glanced over at Jen, who appeared equally sheepish.</p><p>“One of you better start talking,” she snapped.</p><p>“Oh, look at the time.” Jen faked peering down at a non-existent watch on her wrist. “I have a lecture to give in 30 minutes that I haven’t prepped for yet.” She began to speedwalk away. “If I don’t see you again, happy birthday, you old crone.”</p><p>Agatha stared after her in disbelief, before turning to Lilia. “What’s going on?” she demanded.</p><p>“Talk to Rio,” was all Lilia told her nonchalantly with a shrug, before stepping past her and drifting off down the corridor.</p><p>Talk to Rio? What the hell did her girlfriend have to do with this? Unless… did Rio somehow book annual leave for her next week without informing her? It was her birthday week, with her birthday slap bang in the middle, on Thursday. Had Rio made secret plans for them?</p><p>Fuck, what if they interfered with her plans to propose to her on the anniversary of their first meeting? It wouldn’t be the end of the world, but given she had spent months organising everything to a T, the idea of that plan being disrupted threatened to send her into a mental tailspin.</p><p>She was angry, bewildered, and felt her sense of control slipping through her fingers. Usually, Agatha would try and rein that control back in so she could get back on top of everything, and overcompensate by micromanaging everything until her anxiety finally resolved.</p><p>But she had learned over the years that what she actually subconsciously craved in those kinds of moments was a release. The ability the let go and not have to think for a while, until her negative emotions died down and she could once again feel calm.</p><p>Agatha stormed down the corridor and knocked furiously on Rio’s office door. The blinds were down in the window, making it impossible to tell if her girlfriend was inside. There was no response, so she tried the handle. It swung open, unlocked, but the office was empty.</p><p>Yanking out her phone, Agatha checked Rio’s location on Find my iPhone, and then prowled through the corridors, students scattering as she stalked past them on the hunt. According to her phone’s location, Rio was currently at the student-run coffee stand in the center of Bishop’s Courtyard, out front of the building.</p><p>Stepping outside, Agatha didn’t bother descending the steps, spotting her girlfriend from forty metres away, iced matcha in hand and chatting to fucking <i>Jen</i>, who was <i>not</i> preparing for her lecture as she claimed.</p><p>“Vidal!” she yelled. Everybody in the courtyard froze, whipping around. Rio did not— she simply tossed Agatha a casual, cool look over her shoulder. “Office, now! You’ve got a lot to fucking answer for. We need to discuss that email you sent me this morning!”</p><p>There was no email. She just wanted an excuse to shout and then drag Rio somewhere private. Plus, if people thought Agatha was berating her, then they were highly unlikely to risk interrupting them— or coming anywhere near the faculty offices.</p><p>She was aiming to get her brains fucked out, not for a indecent exposure or public decency charge.</p><p>“What’s the matter, Dr. Harkness?” Rio called back, her voice tickled with mirth. She was playing along. “Can’t handle a little criticism of your syllabus? Did I hit a nerve when I said your sources are outdated?”</p><p>Stunned gasps sounded throughout the courtyard.</p><p>“Get your insolent ass inside, <i>now</i>,” Agatha growled. “You wanna keep your job, then you better have some evidence to back that up!”</p><p>“You need help reading the papers I cited in my email, <i>Professor?</i>” Rio retorted loudly, and then took a dramatic sip from her half-finished matcha.“Maybe you need to get some better glasses. Perfectly normal for your eyesight to deteriorate at your <i>old age</i>.”</p><p>More shocked gasps from all the students as Rio strode towards Agatha with her head held high, radiating confidence and bravado.</p><p>Jen, abandoned at the coffee cart, face-palmed. She’d been subjected to this aggressive form of mating dance between them for so long now, where they exchanged insults to build the sexual tension between them until they both snapped, that she understood what was about to happen.</p><p>Rio trailed behind Agatha up the stairs and through the corridors. She sipped at her matcha the entire journey, throwing the cup into the recycling and dusting her hands off before entwining her hands behind her back.</p><p>To all the students, it appeared as if she were being marched to her execution, given that Agatha was bristling and scowling. And yes, outwardly, Agatha was putting on an act of being ready to commit murder. But inwardly? Arousal was clouding her mind and coiling like a writhing snake in her lower abdomen, making her feel hot and fuzzy, itching to be filled by Rio’s fingers and cock.</p><p>Agatha chose Rio’s office, rather than her own, if only because it had been a while since they’d had a sneaky rendezvous in there. She kicked the door open and stood to the side to allow Rio to slink through the door after her.</p><p>As soon as the door shut behind them both, Agatha turned the lock in the door.</p><p>She wheeled around to find Rio standing directly behind her. She carefully reached up and removed Agatha’s glasses, placing them on the little side table next to the office door - a clear indicator that she planned to get rough, and didn’t want them to break.</p><p>The world went slightly blurry, but Agatha had grown used to it, and her prescription wasn’t so bad that it majorly affected her eyesight. Her girlfriend was still just as gorgeous.</p><p>Seconds later, Rio was slamming her up against the nearest wall. Pinning Agatha’s wrists above her head with one hand, her other grabbing her by the hip to secure her, Rio kissed Agatha ferociously.</p><p>Agatha moaned into her mouth, breathless and dizzy as her girlfriend’s tongue lanced into her mouth, asserting dominance by forcing her compliance. There was an obvious tent at the front of Rio’s pants, and she tried to lift her knee to brush over it teasingly, but Rio pressed her body more firmly into the wall, so that her legs were trapped.</p><p>When Rio reared back, her lips shiny with spit and her eyes dark with desire, the hand on Agatha’s hip trailed up her body to her neck. Her hand wrapped around her throat and pinched at her arteries to slightly restrict her airflow; fitting, that the fingers married MORT, <i>death</i>, were capable of bringing her so close that little death she craved just by squeezing and triggering a fuzzy euphoria to wash over her brain.</p><p>“Is this what you wanted, <i>guapito</i>?” she murmured. “Jen was telling me how angry you were after the budget meeting. About how tense you are. I told you this was gonna happen, I told you that you’d need some <i>stress relief</i>. You just wanna get thrown around and treated like my little plaything, don’t you? <i>¿Echamos un polvo?</i>” <i>You want to have sex?</i></p><p>“<i>Sí, señora,</i>” Agatha whimpered.</p><p>Typically, it was rare for her to submit to Rio, as she much preferred to power bottom, despite being a switch. Rio had joked before that she was a glorified pillow princess, but she identified as a service top-leaning switch, so it worked perfectly for them. But today, Agatha wanted to be <i>used</i>. And Rio seemed to be able to sense it.</p><p>“Fuckin’ desperate lil’ whore,” Rio snarled, and then attacked her throat, teeth scraping over her skin. “<i>Quiero que me la chupes.</i>” <i>I want you to suck me off.</i></p><p>Agatha’s knees shook, eyes fluttering shut. Yes, this was what she was craving. Rio savaged her neck like a lioness pouncing upon and sinking its fangs into a gazelle. Agatha would undoubtedly have dozens of screaming red hickies adorning her throat later, but that was what she kept spare concealer and a scarf in her desk drawer for.</p><p>Drawing back, Rio released Agatha’s arms and pulled her hand back from her throat, studying Agatha’s face for a moment; she was evidently attempting to gauge her emotional state. Agatha stared back, lowering her arms down to her sides, but remaining leaning back against the wall, her chest rising and falling rapidly.</p><p>“Is this a situation where you want me on my knees, or do you want to be?” Rio asked her carefully, taking hold of her dominant hand. Her thumb brushed over her dahlia tattoo.</p><p>Agatha exhaled tremulously. “Me. I need you to be rough. I just need to stop thinking,” she admitted, averting her gaze.</p><p>But Rio didn’t let her, one finger against her cheek encouraging her to turn back towards her to meet her eyes. She didn’t appear judgmental at all. “Usual safeword?” she checked.</p><p>“Yeah. Azaleas. Three taps if I can’t speak.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Good, okay. You want some degradation along with the praise?”</p><p>As she spoke, she took her lanyard off her neck, using it to tie Agatha’s hair back behind her head. She then reached over to remove Agatha’s as well… so she could wind it around Agatha’s wrists as improvised restraints.</p><p>Agatha tugged, testing Rio’s knots. They were tight, and didn’t give. “Sounds fuckin’ perfect.”</p><p>“And what precisely do you want?”</p><p>Licking her lips, Agatha murmured, “<i>Quiero que me hagas tuyo</i>.” <i>I want you to make me yours.</i></p><p>Learning Spanish so that she and Rio could shit talk the students behind their backs also had a spectacular secondary benefit: Agatha knew how to dirty talk, and hearing her say such filthy things in her mother tongue drove Rio feral.</p><p>Her girlfriend gave a curt nod, her eyes sharpening as she raked her eyes up and down Agatha as if to assess her. It made Agatha feel dirty, and small, and she fucking loved it, her panties drenching through.</p><p>Snatching hold of Agatha’s bound wrists, Rio dragged Agatha across her office, not caring how she nearly tripped over several times because she wasn’t expecting it, until they were standing next to her desk.</p><p>The pillow from the battered armchair in the corner was tossed onto the floor at her feet as Rio leaned back against her desk, spreading her legs.</p><p>“Down boy,” she ordered shortly, snapping her fingers.</p><p>Agatha collapsed to her knees in less than a heartbeat, thankful that the pillow was there to cushion her fall, because even though the floor was carpeted, her middle-aged knees would have bruised otherwise.</p><p>“Good boy,” Rio murmured, petting over her head mockingly.</p><p><i>Good boy</i>. That specific term of endearment tenderly caressed the part of Agatha’s brain that was tied so intrinsically to her sense of self that simply hearing it said triggered a gentle wave of contentment to wash through her, followed by desire.</p><p>Agatha’s arousal bloomed between her thighs, which she rubbed together to try and stimulate herself. Her clitoral piercing felt extra sensitive as her clit throbbed, her cunt aching terribly to be filled.</p><p>When Rio stripped off her sweater and began to undo the buttons of her pants, she felt herself begin to salivate. Her girlfriend didn’t even take her shirt off, simply hiking it up over her stomach and pushing her pants down to her ankles.</p><p>Agatha licked her lips in anticipation as she watched the younger woman pull herself out from the fly of her boxer briefs.</p><p>Holding her hand out, Rio raised an eyebrow. Agatha spat into it obediently, already knowing what she was asking for. Lips twitching up into a smirk, Rio slowly began to stroke her seven inches of semi-hard cock in her palm, using Agatha’s saliva as lube. The glistening pink head of her cock emerged from her foreskin with just a couple of pumps. Her frenum piercing, shiny and purple, glinted in the harsh office lights, and Agatha’s pussy clenched.</p><p>“What do you want, baby? C’mon, tell me what you need,” Rio prompted her.</p><p>Agatha leaned forward on her knees so that her girlfriend was draped over her face, mushroom head pulsing out pre-cum onto her forehead. Just the immense heat and weight of Rio had her mentally slipping downwards, her thoughts growing quiet as her submissive instincts overrode her stress.</p><p>“Want your cock,” she mumbled.</p><p>“Where? C’mon, Agatha, use your words. You usually have so many.”</p><p>“Mouth. Want your cock in my mouth,” she slurred, kitten-licking the base of the heavy length, moaning at the salty, musky taste of Rio’s clean skin. Because sometimes, when she got down into subspace… all Agatha wanted was to be used as Rio’s cocksleeve.</p><p>Rio chuckled. Her fingers raked through Agatha’s to grab at her ponytail, cupping the back of her head. “Yeah? You wanna suck me off, sweet boy?” she cooed.</p><p>Agatha’s face was smushed up against her shaft as a result. She tilted her head to the side so she had a better angle to lave her tongue up and down the younger woman’s length, flicking at her piercing to trigger Rio to release a breathy groan.</p><p>Her hand tightened around Agatha’s ponytail— not concerningly so, as she was always incredibly gentle when Agatha gave her a blowjob, but applying enough pressure to remind her that Rio was the one in control now.</p><p>“Please, ma’am,” she keened, batting her eyelids in that way she knew would make Rio instantly cave and give her what she wanted.</p><p>“Begging already, huh? Such a needy brat,” Rio said gruffly. Tapping her cock against Agatha’s cheeks one at a time teasingly, smearing them with pre-cum, she commanded, “Open wide, <i>guapito</i>, let me see those tonsils.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped open eagerly, and she tilted her head back and stuck her tongue out, wiggling it from side to side. Laughing, Rio pushed her cock down with her thumb so that it grazed over the wet muscle. Pre-cum splurted out and washed over her tastebuds, sweet like nectar.</p><p>“Go on, have a little nurse,” Rio husked.</p><p>She wasn’t going to pass up that opportunity. Agatha sucked her in, lips enveloping the head. Her tongue lashed at the delicate slit to lap up her pre-cum, and then dipped beneath to prod at her piercing.</p><p>Rio hissed through her teeth and rocked her hips forwards gently, so that her dick bobbed in her mouth, somehow growing even harder. Once she was comfortable with the stretch of her lips around Rio’s thick head, she began to gradually slide down, inch by inch, until she felt her brush against the back of her palate.</p><p>“That’s it, good boy, you get me all wet and slick so I’ll just slide on down your throat,” Rio groaned, hand cradling the back of her head very tenderly, helping her along. Her other hand wiped away the tears pricking Agatha’s eyes from the overwhelming stretch of her jaw, thumb stroking over her strained lips.</p><p>Her gag reflex was long gone, and so it was no trouble whatsoever for her to deepthroat her girlfriend, even faking a gag for Rio’s enjoyment. A rumbling moan of pleasure escaped her lips as she buried her nose in Rio’s bush, her bottom lip pressed up against her balls.</p><p>Rio’s hips were jerking, but she was restraining herself, trying not to block Agatha’s airway, although she was so long and girthy that it was almost inevitable.</p><p>But Rio was trying too hard to be gentle, stroking over her hair and murmuring a melody of <i>good boy</i> and <i>that’s it, take it</i> and <i>fuck, keep going</i>. Agatha needed her to be rough, to make her mouth ache, to use her like a toy.</p><p>Her pussy was absolutely desperate to be touched and soaking wet - so wet that Agatha was glad she was wearing black pants, since she was certain a damp spot would be visible otherwise.</p><p>She pulled back, coughing and clearing her throat, and then raised her bound hands to wrap her dominant one around Rio’s spit-slick cock, squeezing around the base. Rio wheezed, peering down at her with wide eyes.</p><p>“I told you I want your dick down my throat,” she said hoarsely, curling her up. “I don’t wanna be treated like some delicate fucking flower, Rio, I wanna get my <i>face fucked</i>.” And then, because Rio was frowning down at her, she lied, “This isn’t doing anything for me, you know. Either fuck my face, or sit back and let me fuck myself.”</p><p>Rio huffed at her attitude. “Fuckin’ brat. You wanna be treated like a slut? <i>Fine</i>.”</p><p>And this time, instead of carefully guiding Agatha’s mouth down her length, she shoved her head down, crooking her neck. She force-fed her cock into Agatha’s throat until the length of her was completely buried, constricted by rippling hot wet walls.</p><p>And then Rio <i>held</i> Agatha’s face down.</p><p>Agatha’s brain began to spin from the oxygen deprivation, and she grasped at Rio’s knees, eyes fluttering closed as she floated down into that beautiful, wonderful pool of mental silence. Tears were pouring down her face as she gurgled around her girlfriend’s cock, reveling in the sensation of Rio’s clipped, blunt fingernails piercing into her scalp.</p><p>Her frenum piercing scraped against her tongue, like a hot brand. Agatha breathed through her nose, and it was only once she felt the blackness creeping in that she squeezed Rio’s knee once, just to signal that she needed to come up for air.</p><p>Dragging Agatha’s head up, Rio allowed her to breathe, her chest heaving. “My handsome cockdrunk throat-whore. Gonna give you that nice facefucking you’ve been craving now.”</p><p>Agatha nodded eagerly, diving back down to deepthroat her once again. Rio’s hips began to move as she ground her dick into her mouth, humping at her face aggressively.</p><p>Agatha just swayed on her knees and <i>took it</i>, eyes rolling into the back of her head. Her lungs were screaming, her throat was uncomfortably stretched, and her knees and thighs were starting to burn, but the pain was <i>wonderful</i>.</p><p>“That’s it, good boy,” Rio grunted, her cock stiff and burning hot as it pulsated in her mouth. “Fuckin’ best throat I’ve ever fucked. Should’ve kicked your legs out from under you in front of all the students in the courtyard, made you walk on your knees, show everybody what a cum-hungry slut you are for me. Should’ve choked you out with your lanyard while you had my cock in your mouth, so they could all see how handsome you look gagging and drooling for more. Should’ve shown them all how thoroughly I own you.”</p><p>Agatha whined around her cock, the intense dirty talk making her thighs quake and her cunt feel so horrifically empty. She tried to shove her lanyard-bound hands down the front of her own hands to rub at her clit and shove her fingers into her drooling hole, but the bindings made it too difficult. Even trying to stimulate herself over her pants was too hard, as the fabric was too thick.</p><p>Then, she spotted it. Barely an arm’s length away, the weighted cylindrical door stopper that usually lived on the opposite side of the office was lying on its side, having rolled over from the door— likely from when Agatha kicked the door open early. It had rubber rings around it, which would be perfect for grinding up against.</p><p>She had to be sneaky about this. She didn’t want Rio to find out her plan, because she might punish her. Waiting for Rio to be distracted by her swallowing repeatedly around her cock, which always drove her completely crazy, Agatha faked a dramatic gag and yanked her head up.</p><p>Rio, thinking that she was panicking and needed air, released the back of her head and pushed her away, so that her dick emerged from Agatha’s lips with a wet <i>pop</i>.</p><p>Bowing at the waist, strategically pretending that she needed to gulp in oxygen, Agatha shuffled to the side just a couple of inches on the pillow so that when she bent down, she could quickly snatch up the door stopper and shove it between her thighs to hide it.</p><p>“Shit, are you okay?” Rio asked worriedly. “Was that too rough?”</p><p>Agatha answered using actions, rather than words. She pulled at Rio’s legs, whimpering pathetically, so that she scooted forward a little. It meant that Agatha no longer had to kneel upright, and could rest her ass on her knees, while sucking her off.</p><p>It also meant that Agatha could place the metal door stopper between her legs and grind her clit against it to get herself off while Rio’s cock was in her throat, which was promptly what she started to do as soon as Rio regained her confidence and began fucking her face again.</p><p>“God, you’re such a talented cocksucker, Agatha, look at you deepthroating my dick like a pro,” Rio said raggedly, staring down at her with black eyes that were gleaming with adoration and awe. “Want me to come down your tight little throat as you swallow around my cock, warm your belly with my cum?”</p><p>Agatha whined loudly, blinking up at her frantically, hoping that she conveyed her enthusiastic consent. “<i>Abajo mi garganta</i>,” she pleaded. <i>Down my throat.</i></p><p>“Don’t worry, <i>mi alma</i>, you’ll get that liquid lunch you want so badly,” Rio groaned, clutching her head as she drove her cock into her mouth.</p><p>She was speeding up, her thrusts growing irregular and her thigh muscles twitching, which were obvious signs that she was approaching orgasm.</p><p>“You better swallow down everything, Agatha. Don’t make a mess or you’ll be licking it outta the carpet.”</p><p>Agatha whined, pulling back to just hold the very tip of Rio in her mouth, tongue circling her frenum piercing.</p><p>“Gonna come. Gonna fuckin’ use you as my human cock sock.”</p><p><i>As a WHAT?</i></p><p>Agatha fell still. Jerked her head back, much to Rio’s dismay, and stared up at her with an expression of pure indignation. “Excuse me?” she spluttered raspily.</p><p>Rio cried out as if she had been shot. “Agatha! I was just about to—”</p><p>“No,” she said fiercely, grabbing hold of her cock in a strangling hold. Her fingers squeezed tightly around the base, acting as a cock ring and refusing to let Rio come. “Did you just call me a cock sock?”</p><p>Rio’s flushed face turns bone white. “<i>Mierda</i>, I’m sorry, is that going too far?”</p><p>“You can fuck my face and come down my throat all you like, but do <i>not</i> compare me to your crusty old wank sock.”</p><p>“My crusty old— it’s your sock, Agatha!” Rio protested, squirming as the older professor thumbed at the head of her dick, overstimulating her.</p><p>“No, it’s yours, remember. They went under your name for expenses.”</p><p>“Yeah, and Lilia nearly had my fuckin’ head for that! Sixty dollars for a pair of wool socks!”</p><p>“59.99, actually.” Agatha smiled winningly. That really was one of the most hilarious and diabolical petty pranks that she played on Rio during that first month she joined Salem U.</p><p>Rio was <i>not</i> amused, however, and growled like a feral dog, her eyes flashing. “Okay, I’m sorry for calling you my cock sock, now do you want me to come in your mouth or not?” she asked. “Because I can go take care of this myself, if you’re not amenable to—” She attempted to pry Agatha’s hand off her so she could stand.</p><p>Scoffing, Agatha shoved her back against the desk, and Rio’s hands scrambled for purchase to steady herself, swiping paperwork and a stack of folders to the floor, pencils going flying. “Don’t be absurd. You call <i>me</i> a brat, but threaten to waste perfectly good cum by jacking off over a fucking toilet, when I’m <i>right here</i>. Spit on my face, why don’t you?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Would you like me to?”</p><p>“I think <i>you</i> would like to.”</p><p>“You brought it up in the first place.”</p><p>“Don’t get sassy with me,” Agatha hissed, stroking her cock roughly with a harsh twist of her wrist, so that the younger woman released a mangled sound. “You come inside me. My mouth, my pussy, my ass— me and <i>only me</i>. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Rio choked out.</p><p>“Don’t think I’ve forgotten that I’m the first <i>and only</i> person you have ever come inside raw,” Agatha said triumphantly, voice laced with possessive pride. “Your cum belongs to me. You insult me if you waste it.”</p><p>A silent beat passed, the only audible noises being their rapid breathing, and then Rio hardened. She fisted her hand Agatha’s hair, re-asserting her dominance as she barked, “Yeah, and I’m the only person who has ever come inside <i>you</i>. And that makes you <i>mine</i>. You’re on your fuckin’ knees for <i>me</i> today. Now open your mouth.” Agatha did. Rio reached down and clasped her chin, snarling, “Wider.”</p><p>No sooner had Agatha unhinged her jaw as wide as she possibly could, tongue sticking out, than Rio had speared her dick down her throat. Her muscles worked to accommodate her immense length and girth, tongue lapping at the base.</p><p>Rio’s hands held the back of her head so that Agatha’s nose was pressed to her stomach, and her bunched-up, crumpled shirt slid down from where she had it tucked beneath her armpits, draping itself over Agatha’s face.</p><p>But Rio didn’t care to raise it; it made Agatha feel <i>filthy</i>, like a toy to be used.</p><p>Agatha’s mind grew pleasantly fuzzy as she lost herself in the sensation of Rio’s hand in her hair and her cock down her throat. Rio kept jerking her hips to slide her cock deeper and deeper, even though Agatha was struggling for oxygen.</p><p>Her eyes watered furiously, black spots appearing in her vision. Her lungs burned. She felt like she was dry-drowning.</p><p>She didn’t care though.</p><p>All she cared about was the euphoric expression on her girlfriend’s face.</p><p>“You look so fuckin’ gorgeous when you cry,” Rio said in a voice coarse with hunger, staring down at Agatha with pure lust in her eyes. “My greedy cum-hungry slutty boytoy.”</p><p>That triggered her to moan, frantically rutting up against the door stopper clenched between her thighs. Slick gushed from her pussy in a miniature orgasm.</p><p>The vibration of the moan was enough to make the younger woman snap.</p><p>“<i>Estoy por acabar</i>,” Rio warned breathlessly. <i>I’m about to come.</i></p><p>Her girlfriend grunted once, twice, and then her cock began jumping and pulsing inside of Agatha’s mouth, ropes of hot, thick cum spurting down her throat. Agatha closed her eyes, basking in the sensation of her girlfriend’s cum spilling down into her stomach, making her tingle all over. But before Rio finished completely, she shoved Agatha’s head back.</p><p>One splurt of cum landed directly on her tongue before Rio withdrew from her mouth entirely, frantically stroking herself. The last two streams of seed sprayed over her face, searing hot as they landed on her cheeks, lips, and chin in a white sticky mess.</p><p>Rio sank back against her desk with a satisfied groan, her cock— still shockingly hard— falling from her grip. She peered down at Agatha through half-lidded eyes with such abject affection that it made Agatha’s stomach somersault.</p><p>“Gave you a big load, there, didn’t I, Agatha? Go on, play with it, show me how much you love the taste of me. Your favorite mouthwash.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but obediently opened her mouth to show the cum that remained on her tongue, swirling her tongue around her mouth.</p><p>“Swallow,” Rio purred, and then, when she did so with an aggravated huff, her girlfriend demanded, “Show me.”</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to spit her cum out just to see Rio throw a tantrum. Ever since that night they’d spent together in that Copenhagen hotel room ten years ago, when Agatha <i>didn’t</i> swallow and surprised her now-girlfriend by shovelling her semen back into her mouth with her tongue, Rio had been ultra diligent in checking that Agatha did actually swallow when ordered.</p><p>Because she was a brat. And sometimes she disobeyed just for the fun of it.</p><p>But since she did swallow this time, she cracked her jaw open and stuck her tongue out to prove that she could be an obedient sub when she wanted to be.</p><p>Satisfied, Rio crooned, “Such a good, sweet boy.”</p><p>The praise was <i>nice</i>, but Agatha couldn’t help but feel irritated that Rio had pulled out to waste her semen by giving her a pathetic facial rather than finishing all the way down her throat. She tried to keep her face angled up, staring at the ceiling, so that none of the cum covering her cheeks slid off and dripped down onto her clothes— or the carpet.</p><p>“Did you really have to come on my face?” she sighed. “You’re such a messy girl, Rio.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “You don’t like a little donut glazing?”</p><p>“Not when it’s gonna stain the carpet,” Agatha griped. “There are only so many times we can report to the cleaners that you spilled ranch in here before they start to question who the hell consumes that much ranch and doesn’t get the shits after.”</p><p>Sinking down onto her knees next to Agatha, Rio said faux-apologetically, “Oh, I’m sorry, baby, let me clean you up.”</p><p>And instead of wiping away the cum on her face using a tissue, Rio leaned in to drag her tongue over Agatha’s cheeks, collecting her seed in her mouth and then kissing Agatha thoroughly. It was during this process that Rio moved close enough for her knee to bump against the door stop.</p><p>She broke the kiss just to blink down at it, baffled. “The hell is this?”</p><p>Busted.</p><p>“No clue,” Agatha lied, like a lying liar, heat flooding her cheeks.</p><p>Rio glanced between the door stop atop the pillow, Agatha’s red face, and the way that the older woman was pressing her thighs together. She giggled incredulously as realization dawned. “Holy fuck, were you grinding down on this while sucking me off?”</p><p>“You tied my hands together, and these pants are too thick to get off through,” Agatha tried to defend herself, raising her bound hands. “The fuck was I meant to do?”</p><p>Shaking her head, Rio tugged on the lanyard tying her wrists together— and the knot came undone fairly effortlessly. Agatha didn’t get any time to do anything with her freed hands, however, as Rio scooped her off the floor.</p><p>The younger woman kicked off her pants and underwear that were still miraculously hooked around one of her legs— her loafers still on— and then once Agatha was standing, she peeled off Agatha’s own pants and lace boxers, tossing the pants aside carefully but delicately collecting her panties— most likely to jerk off with later, the pervert.</p><p>Agatha’s arms flew to wrap around her neck, her legs clamping around Rio’s waist, as her girlfriend cradled her ass and carried her over to the armchair in the corner.</p><p>It was probably a good thing Rio was carrying her, because Agatha’s knees were <i>killing</i> her, and her thighs were sore as hell.</p><p>“So fuckin’ desperate for my fingers or cock inside your greedy cunt that you resorted to humping a fuckin’ <i>door stop?</i> You <i>slut</i>,” Rio husked directly into her ear, as she lowered herself onto the armchair with Agatha curled up on her lap, straddling her thighs. Her cock was compressed beneath Agatha’s cunt, rubbing up against her swollen lips and sensitive clit. “If you’re pathetic enough to ride a door stop, then you can put the effort in to ride me.”</p><p>Two of Rio’s fingers were swallowed up by Agatha’s pussy seconds later, <i>O</i> and <i>R</i>. Fitting, since the wooziness Agatha always felt whenever Rio crooked them up at that particular angle to stroke her G-spot, almost felt like going under general anesthesia.</p><p>When she tried to instinctively close her thighs, Rio tutted, “Ah, ah, keep yourself spread open, baby, you’ve still got more fingers to take.”</p><p>“H-how many more?”</p><p>“As many as I think can fit.”</p><p>Agatha moaned, head resting on Rio’s shoulder and teeth buried into her shirt to try and silence herself.</p><p>She wasn’t sure that the office’s soundproofing would be effective enough to muffle the screams she was stifling as Rio rubbed her fingers over her G-spot as if petting it affectionately, sending repetitive tidal waves of pleasure crashing through her nervous system.</p><p>“Shit, Agatha… fuck, you’re so wet. S’this all for me, baby? You that desperate for my cock inside of you that you’re dripping?”</p><p>Another finger wiggled inside alongside the other two, and Agatha keened and whimpered, trembling and panting.</p><p>And then another finger pressed in too, and Agatha choked out, “Oh fuck, Rio, <i>fuck</i>, so full.”</p><p>“Took four fingers like it’s nothing, I could get my whole fist up there with barely any work,” Rio rumbled. “Whiny puppy, riding my fingers like you’re a bitch in heat. Should put you in your collar and make you ride my shoe. Wrap my belt around your neck and use it like a leash. You that hungry for my cock?”</p><p>“Fuck me, fuck me, ma’am. Fuck me, please, ma’am, need you inside me, <i>métemela</i>,” Agatha pleaded, her voice slurred.</p><p>“Yeah, you put on that mask of being a strict, sarcastic bitch around everybody else, but the moment you want my cock, you pull out the manners and are ready to <i>beg</i> to be stuffed full like a whiny little sleeve, huh? Where do you want it, <i>guapito</i>, where’d you want my next load? Down your throat again?”</p><p>She was so dizzy, teetering on the edge of an orgasm that would undoubtedly cause her to squirt all over the armchair. So dizzy, in fact, that she was concerned about passing out, tears streaming down her face from frustration. She wanted more, <i>she needed more</i>.</p><p>“Please, inside me, <i>please</i>, need it hard and fast, Rio, god.”</p><p>“Aww, s’okay, baby, don’t cry,” Rio soothed her.</p><p>Rio wiped away the tears as her other hand notched her cock at Agatha’s weeping pussy, teasing her clit piercing with the tip. She tugged upwards on Agatha’s bush to stretch her entrance.</p><p>“Here you go, here’s what you want, <i>querido</i>.”</p><p>Despite having Rio inside her only that morning, it was a tight stretch, especially in this position, mounted on her lap.</p><p>She was soaked, and the minimal prep Rio had done with her fingers was more than enough to ensure Rio slid inside her cunt smoothly to the hilt. Gravity helped her along.</p><p>She was dripping wet and her pussy produced an obscenely loud squelching sound as it was split in two, that made her shiver from head to toe.</p><p>As soon as she was filled to the brim, quelling that aching empty feeling, Agatha instinctively found herself relaxing. She felt as if she were bursting at the seams. Her body fell limp as she slumped forward onto her girlfriend’s torso, dazed.</p><p>“Such a big fucking dick,” she mumbled, nuzzling into Rio’s throat. “God, I love it.”</p><p>“Yeah? I love your gorgeous boy pussy. <i>Look at you</i>, all pink and puffy and stretched around me,” Rio groaned, using her fingers to spread her lips apart and admire where her cock was buried inside her.</p><p>Agatha bit down on her lip hard enough to break skin, metallic blood on her tongue, when Rio placed her hands on her hips and started to rock her back and forth. The breath was stolen from her lungs as Rio began fucking her deeply so that her cockhead grazed her G-spot with every upwards stroke.</p><p>“You can handle it, can’t you, sweetheart? My filthy size king. You love being stuffed, filled up to your stomach. I’ve seen that dildo you have hidden in your sock drawer,” Rio teased her.</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, breath hitching. She thought that she was a genius, hiding it within a pair of socks. Rio didn’t falter in her thrusts, instead speeding up— she was driving her cock inside of her so deeply, at such force, that each lunge made Agatha see stars.</p><p>Rio’s voice was coarse, sweat dripping from her forehead down onto Agatha’s body as she growled, “Yeah, you thought that was a secret, didn’t you? You thought I wouldn’t find it?”</p><p>“You wouldn’t’ve if you hadn’t gone snooping,” Agatha managed to say.</p><p>Rio slapped her ass cheek for that, so hard that it left a delicious hot sting behind, which would undoubtedly result in a pink handprint.</p><p>“Wouldn’t have to snoop if you didn’t hide your sex toys from me like a dirty little boy. You did a good job concealing it, but I found it anyway. Don’t know how you fucking survive riding that thing. But I was inspired, and guess what— I bought a thigh harness.”</p><p><i>A thigh harness?</i> Oh fuck. Agatha mewled, head lolling forward as her eyes rolled.</p><p>“What I wouldn’t give you to watch you ride that monster on my thigh,” Rio continued in a rumbling growl. She was ravaging her, fucking into her at a punishing pace. “Three-fucking-inch diameter. Doesn’t hit your cervix like I do, I’d bet, but god, the way it must fill you up. You’d cry so pretty for me, split in half with it buried in your pussy. Do you think I’d fit in your ass alongside it in your little boy cunt?”</p><p>Grunting as she tried the best she could to bounce despite her thigh muscles being so strained that it physically hurt, Agatha spat out determinedly, “I could make you fit.”</p><p>She hadn’t told Rio yet about the dildo because she had been using it to train herself for double penetration, knowing that Rio had recently bought a strap harness that had an attachment point that meant somebody with a penis could also use it.</p><p>“You love a challenge, don’t you?” Rio chuckled darkly.</p><p>Agatha tossed her head, her hair slipping free of the improvised lanyard hair-tie and tumbling down her back. “When I know it’s one I can easily win, yeah.”</p><p>“Don’t know about easily, but I do believe you could manage it, if I fucked you to the point of wearing out your kegels beforehand. I’m gonna fuckin’ ruin you, wreck your pussy until you’re dripping my cum for days.”</p><p>Rio slipped a hand between her and Agatha’s bodies and began a full-out assault on her clit, at that point, strumming it viciously. Her fingers kept catching on her piercing and sending little ripples of pleasure that felt like lightning through her nerves.</p><p>“Oh, fuck, ma’am,” Agatha cried out hoarsely, trembling. “Fuck, god, <i>fuck</i>, you’re so deep.”</p><p>“Fucking the cum I gave you this morning deeper inside you,” Rio wheezed.</p><p>And wasn’t that a mind blowing thought.</p><p>Soon, Agatha was coming, again and again, chomping her teeth down onto her girlfriend’s shoulder so that people would not come running, thinking she was being murdered.</p><p>She <i>was</i> being murdered. Well, her pussy was. By Rio’s massive cock. But the other faculty members and students definitely did not need to know that.</p><p>Three orgasms later, Agatha’s cunt was desperately trying to milk Rio for her cum, twitching and contracting fiercely. One of them was a G-spot orgasm so intense that Agatha blacked out halfway through it and thought she was having a seizure.</p><p>The armchair and Rio’s lap were drenched in her slick and ejaculate from her squirting all over them, making it look as if she pissed herself.</p><p>Shuddering, Agatha whimpered, “Fuck, I’m gonna come again.”</p><p>“I’ll come with you,” Rio said raggedly, trapping her in a hug so she could rut up into her erratically. “Fill you with cum like the desperate cocksleeve you want to be. <i>Mierda</i>, Agatha, I’m— I’m so close.”</p><p>Upon hearing that, and knowing what Rio did the <i>last</i> time she came, Agatha felt a surge of disgruntlement mixed with wanton lust ignite the low flickering flame of dominance that she had been suppressing for Rio’s sake, so that she could fuck her effectively the way that Agatha wanted her to.</p><p>She grabbed at Rio’s throat, compressing it until her girlfriend wheezed. “You come inside me, or you’re <i>dead</i>,” Agatha bared her teeth. “If you don’t fuck your cum inside me as deep as physically fucking possible, I won’t let you have any access to my pussy for a month and see how you like not coming inside me at all. Don’t you <i>dare</i> pull out.”</p><p>“With my track record?” Rio choked.</p><p>Agatha had to snort a laugh at that, because it was true— Rio’s track record for pulling out was utterly abysmal. If she wasn’t coming inside Agatha after a few frantic strokes, she liked to squash Agatha down with her cock inside of her and refuse to pull out until Agatha had to tickle her to convince her to retreat.</p><p>And that was if Agatha wasn’t in the mood for more rounds, because sometimes Rio would come inside her again and again until she was literally drained dry, with Agatha hooking her legs around her waist so she couldn’t escape. Her cunt gripping onto her cock possessively, milking it for its cum.</p><p>“Oh, I <i>forgot</i>,” she sneered. “You’re <i>soooo</i> pathetic that you <i>can’t</i> pull out.”</p><p>“S’your fault it’s so hard, you know, you and your fuckin’ tight cunt,” Rio groaned.</p><p>“Oh, you poor thing,” Agatha said in a fake simpering voice.</p><p>She pinched at Rio’s flushed cheek as she sank down on her dick and then ground down, clenching her muscles rhythmically until the younger woman’s hips were stuttering.</p><p>“Is that my cunt <i>that</i> incredible that you can’t help but bust inside me? Even when you’re not meant to? Or maybe…” Agatha leaned in, rubbing her clit up against her girlfriend’s pelvis as she whispered, “Maybe it’s just because you wanna see your cum oozing out of my pussy so you can have an excuse to stick your tongue inside me and lick it out.” A pause, and then she hissed, “<i>You will always and forever be my bitch</i>.”</p><p>“<i>F-fuck</i>,” Rio stammered.</p><p>A tremor wracked her form, her cock swelling and firing streams of hot spunk to paint Agatha’s inner walls.</p><p>The sensation of the warm seed filling her triggered Agatha’s own spine-tingling orgasm, which slashed through her like a knife twisting in her uterus, and made her feel like she was exploding from the inside out. Agatha clung to Rio helplessly, shaking and panting, feeling like a wrung-out towel.</p><p>“Don’t pull out,” Agatha mumbled, when her girlfriend shifted beneath her. “Please, not yet. Like the feeling of you filling me up… your hot cum all plugged inside me.”</p><p>“My sweet boy,” Rio murmured affectionately, pressing a kiss to her hair. “So good for me, letting me use her and then so happy to warm my cock after.”</p><p>“Letting? I think you mean ordering,” she corrected, with a small smile. “Don’t forget who wears the pants here. And as if you could ever resist me.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, copper eyes gleaming. “Not when you’re so irresistible.”</p><p>“Don’t get corny with me now.”</p><p>“Can’t help it when the sex with you is so a-maize-ing.”</p><p>Agatha nipped her shoulder, making Rio jump and yelp, which of course jostled her cock to make her shudder. “Puns to a minimum while you’re still inside me, please.”</p><p>“So I can’t make a joke about you buttering my cob?”</p><p>“<i>Rio</i>.”</p><p>It took a while for them both to recover enough to ascend out of their post-coital hazes. They moved slowly, Rio lifting her up and then wheeling around to gently place her back down in the armchair.</p><p>As soon as she pulled out, globs of her cum began to seep out of her abused entrance in a river of white. Agatha spread it around, painting her folds and rubbing the seed into her piercing and bush with a pleased hum. Popped her fingers in and out of her entrance, licking at her fingertips. Rio paused briefly to watch with eyes so dark they looked like blackholes.</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha commanded, beckoning her over with glistening fingers. “Let me clean you up.”</p><p>Rio almost tripped over herself in her eagerness. Agatha accepted her soft, raw cock into her mouth, licking at her with an attentive, gentle tongue. She the tip of her tongue around Rio’s frenum piercing tenderly, aware of how hypersensitive it was. The tangy, salty combination of both their releases enveloped her palate, and Agatha had grown used to the taste over the years, so much so that she was practically addicted to it.</p><p>Suckling until her girlfriend’s length was pink and cleaned of their cum, Agatha drew back with one last kiss to Rio’s cock tip, sighing happily.</p><p>“My turn?” Rio whispered, beady eyes dropping to where Agatha was clenching her thighs shut, trying to keep her load contained within her thoroughly fucked, sore center.</p><p>Usually, Rio would drop to her knees to lick her clean, but after a glance at the clock, Agatha regretfully informed her, “We don’t have time for that, baby.” Mostly because it would lead to another round of sex.</p><p>“Just a taste?” Rio pleaded. “Please, sir.”</p><p>“Hm. Fingers only. No penetration. I know if you get your mouth and tongue down there we’ll be here for another hour.”</p><p>Rio’s knees hit the floor with dual <i>thuds</i> and she scooped the creamy cum lazily trailing out of Agatha’s hole, hugged by her puffy labia and still slightly open from having been stretched open. Sticking them into her mouth, she hummed appreciatively.</p><p>Repeating this several more times, until her fingers were starting to wander up to tease at her clit piercing, Rio only stopped when Agatha pushed her away with a playful scowl.</p><p>“Enough, you greedy cumslut,” Agatha ordered. “Clean up kit, now.” She snapped her fingers.</p><p>Rio pouted but obeyed, as she was wont to do.</p><p>The older professor plugged up her dripping pussy with her fingers— all the while wishing that she’d had the foresight to wash and bring along her vaginal plug— so that Rio could go and fetch the packet of emergency wet wipes they kept in her desk. She also collected Agatha’s glasses, now that there was no danger of them being crushed or snapped during sex.</p><p>This was not the first time things had gotten messy during a midday office fuck. They were pros at cleaning up after themselves, at this point. And frankly, they only really cared about taming their sex hair and covering up their hickies to stop any of the students noticing their midday dalliances; they didn’t give a flying fuck about any of the senior faculty.</p><p>Agatha actually enjoyed seeing the disgusted yet resigned looks that they received from the other professors.</p><p>It was as she licked her fingers clean and her girlfriend delicately wiped between her spread wet thighs with a make-up wipe, that Agatha remembered part of the reason why she was frustrated enough to track down Rio for a stress relief fuck.</p><p>She snapped her thighs shut, ensnaring Rio’s hand between them. The younger woman startled.</p><p>“So,” Agatha started conversationally, although she could tell from her girlfriend’s expression that her forced casual tone had put her on edge.</p><p>“So…?” Rio asked tentatively, wiggling her hand free.</p><p>Tilting her head, she continued, “Care to explain why Lilia told me I should ask <i>you</i> why annual leave has been mysteriously booked on my behalf for next week, and I am only just finding out about it now, my love?”</p><p>Rio paled. Turned away and cursed viciously in furious Spanish, muttering under her breath, “<i>Idiotas... ¿Por qué están arruinando la sorpresa? ¿No pudieron guardar el secreto por un día más?</i>” <i>Why are they ruining the surprise? Couldn’t they keep the secret for one more day?</i></p><p>She marched over to the garbage bin the corner of the room to dump the dirtied wet wipes, snatching up her boxer briefs and pants from the floor to begin redressing herself - wincing as she jostled her sensitive cock as she tucked it into her underwear. Her lanyard, a little battered, was scooped off the floor and slung back around her neck.</p><p>Agatha mentally translated what Rio said, and surged to her feet, not caring that she was padding around her office naked from the waist down. “What surprise?</p><p>Rio sighed defeatedly, running her fingers through her ruffled, birds-nest hair to try and smooth it back. “I was going to tell you over dinner tonight.”</p><p>“Tell me now,” Agatha demanded impatiently. Rolling her eyes, Rio did not reply, simply passing over her pants, which were horrifically creased from being thrown on the floor. “Oh, come <i>onnn</i>, Rio, it’s only six hours early,” she whinged, batting her arm like an annoyed puppy.</p><p>“Don’t get bratty with me after I just spent an hour fucking you to help you out with your stress.”</p><p>“But you like it when I get bratty.”</p><p>For a moment, it appeared as if Rio was going to keep her mouth shut, but then she caught sight of Agatha’s absolutely <i>devastating</i> pout… and she caved. “It’s… the ten year anniversary of when we first met, this weekend, and your birthday next week,” she explained. “We’ve both been working so hard this year— hell, you worked all the way through Thanksgiving and Christmas break, sorting out all the syllabus adjustments needed now Wanda is on maternity leave. We didn’t even really get a chance to celebrate our anniversary at New Years. So I just thought… we deserved a break. A proper vacation.”</p><p>“A vacation?” Agatha echoed, her heart pounding in her chest. “Where?”</p><p>“Where better than the city where we first met and fell in love?” Rio smiled softly. “Copenhagen, of course. For a week.”</p><p>A week? In Copenhagen? Just the two of them? No work… no lectures, no students, no essays to mark, or fuckass Teams meetings to attend?</p><p>It sounded too good to be true.</p><p>Her incredulity must’ve been visible, because Rio grinned victoriously, assuring her, “Lilia and Jen agreed we deserved to take a trip away to escape the academic monotony, so they helped me plan your annual leave, and Lilia re-arranged your entire schedule behind your back. And I mean, it was fairly easy to secretly save up the money needed since we have personal savings accounts.” She paused and then added, “The entire trip is planned and paid for. My gift, to you. You don’t have to worry about a single thing, <i>cariño</i>. All you have to do is trust me and enjoy it.”</p><p>“What about Scratchy—”</p><p>“Jen and Alice have volunteered to petsit him. They’re picking him up tomorrow morning. And yes, I gave them the care guide and made them buy the organic pesticide-free hay and veggies.”</p><p>Agatha just stood there silently in shock, with her pants dangling from her hands. “I can’t believe you organized an entire surprise vacation and managed to keep it a secret for… months?”</p><p>“Five months,” Rio said proudly.</p><p>“<i>How?</i> You would have had to use our Travel Rewards credit card to pay for the flights— I would have noticed.”</p><p>“Oh, I got Benito to use his instead. He didn’t mind since he got all the points.”</p><p>Of course Rio’s chaotic older brother was involved in her deception. Agatha snorted a laugh.</p><p>“I take it from your reaction that you’re happy?”</p><p>Agatha pretended to be thinking deeply, even though she was thrilled. “That depends.”</p><p>“On…?”</p><p>“If you forked out for business class on the flights, because I presume we’re flying direct from Boston with a layover at JFK,” she said nervously.</p><p>Agatha was not a big fan of flying. Hurtling through the air at 40,000 feet in a pressurized winged metal tube going 600mph made her feel extremely uneasy and nauseous, not to mention the part where she was confined in a seat surrounded by strangers. She could barely cope with the four hour flights to Dallas or San Juan when they visited Rio’s family.</p><p>Rio laughed. “I think you might actually implode if you had to sit in economy next to a screaming child or a manspreading asshole for eight hours, and I would rather the vacation be <i>relaxing</i> rather than land you in prison, so yes, we are flying business. I actually think the flight to JFK is first class. It’s a very short layover, but we’ll be escorted from gate to gate.” She bit her lip. “There’s just one tiny thing that might upset you.”</p><p>“We’re not sitting next to each other?” Agatha guessed, wilting.</p><p>“Oh, no, we are! We’re in row 10, it’s the most private section of business class. It’s just that— er— <i>we’reflyingouttomorrownight</i>,” Rio blurted out.</p><p>Agatha’s brain ground to a halt. “Excuse me?” she spluttered. “What do you mean <i>tomorrow night?</i>”</p><p>Rio was hastily straightening out all of her clothes and checking her phone, smiling sheepishly. “The flight from Boston is at 7 tomorrow evening, which is why Lilia cleared your schedule for tomorrow.” She leaned in to press a quick kiss to Agatha’s lips, which were agape with bewilderment. “Surprise! Don’t kill me, gotta go, I’ll see you later at home. <i>Te amo, adiós, querido</i>.”</p><p>And then she unlocked her office door and darted out into the corridor.</p><p>“Wha— Rio! <i>RIO!</i>” Agatha shouted. “You’ve got to be kidding!”</p><p>But her girlfriend was gone. And she couldn’t exactly pursue her, since she was standing there alone in Rio’s office, pantsless, like a dumb idiot.</p><p>“Goddamit it, Rosario Vidal,” she growled. “Urgh, I haven’t even <i>packed.</i>”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><i>Good evening, folks. Captain Rogers here. We are currently cruising at an altitude of 39,000 feet, at an airspeed of 560 miles per hour. Local New York time is 9.25pm, and time at our destination of Copenhagen, is 03:25am.</i></p><p><i>Our forecasted flight duration today is 7 hours and 45 mins. Weather looks favourable and with the tailwind on our side we are expecting to land in Copenhagen approximately ten minutes ahead of schedule.</i></p><p><i>The cabin crew will be coming around in about 10 minutes time to offer you your complementary evening meal, following which we will be dimming the lights and letting you get some sleep— we’ll try and keep the turbulence to a minimum for you! Seltbelt signs have been switched off, but please remember to keep your seatbelts on at all times for your own safety. Sit back, relax and enjoy the rest of the flight.</i></p><p>With a glass of white wine in one hand, and a glass of champagne in the other, Agatha kicked her legs up, finally able to relax now that the nervewracking part of flying was over. She rubbed her dry eyes gingerly, jostling her glasses, and heaved a sigh.</p><p>Packing earlier was incredibly stressful, as was the flight from Boston to JFK, as it was delayed because of a storm. Fortunately, their bags were picked up and rechecked onto their Copenhagen-bound flight for them, and their escort through JFK on a buggy meant they still ended up at the gate in time.</p><p>Upon boarding, Rio had immediately asked one of the flight attendants for a glass of wine and bar of dark chocolate for Agatha, using her charm and telling them that it was their anniversary.</p><p>They’d handed out champagne to everybody in business class as well, so now Agatha was double-fisting drinks, and was happy.</p><p>They were sitting next to each other, in the middle of row 10 with the barrier between them lowered. The seats in front and next to them were empty; their little section of business class only had one other passenger, a man in 9A who had practically passed out instantly upon taking his seat and had clearly taken a sedative.</p><p>Turned out not many people tended to fly to Copenhagen at 9pm on a weekday.</p><p>“What do you want for dinner?” Rio asked her, passing over the menu. “I’ll get whatever you don’t, so we can try two dishes.”</p><p>Agatha perused the menu, briefly putting down her champagne to push her glasses up her nose. “Hmm, you’ll want the chicken for your starter, so I’ll get the salmon.” The salmon dish had roe, which Rio couldn’t stand the texture of, and the only other option was a butternut squash salad with walnuts, which Rio always said tasted too bitter. She glanced over the mains. “I think I would prefer the braised short rib.”</p><p>“I’ll get the sea bass then,” Rio hummed. “We can both get the date-caramel apple pie and icecream for dessert.”</p><p>Stretching across the barrier between them, Agatha captured Rio’s hand in her own, squeezing it. “Thank you,” she said softly, “For organizing all of this for us. I really did desperately need a break from papers and lectures and arrogant, entitled students.”</p><p>“No problem,” Rio replied with a gentle grin, raising their entwined hands to kiss her knuckles. “And hey, your break hasn’t started quite yet— I distinctly remember you saying yesterday that you’d read over my paper for me. My laptop’s in my bag. We’ve got nearly eight hours to kill, so I’m expecting some ruthless feedback.”</p><p>“You want me to make you cry in front of everyone on this plane? Exhibitionist.”</p><p>“I wasn’t planning on crying, but now you saying that makes me think you <i>want</i> me to cry,” Rio whispered back. “Dacryphiliac.”</p><p>“Masochist.”</p><p>“Sadist.”</p><p>“Good evening, ladies!” the flight attendant interrupted chirply. Both of them flinched. “May I get you any drinks for you to enjoy with your meal? Oh, looks like you’re all set, ma’am!” she joked, spotting Agatha’s two alcoholic beverages.</p><p>When Agatha glared, Rio tried to diffuse the tension by saying politely, “I’ll have a glass of the Merlot, thanks, and my boyfriend will have another glass of the Sauvignon blanc.”</p><p>“Boyfriend?” the flight attendant echoed.</p><p>When Agatha simply stared at her blankly, internally gleeful when she saw panic flash in eyes. Agatha would not have been shocked if she had assumed that Agatha was Rio’s mom. Their age difference wasn’t as obvious now that Rio was in her thirties, but sometimes people made assumptions.</p><p>The boyfriend thing was most likely tripping the flight attendant up as well because Agatha was aware that despite her masc clothing, she did appear more feminine when she wore her hair down.</p><p>“Oh! Well. Uh. Um,” the flight attendant stammered. “Unfortunately, policy dictates that I can only serve each passenger one glass at a… time…”</p><p>She trailed off as Agatha threw back her half-finished glasses of champagne and wine and chugged them, one after the other. Then she grabbed Rio’s champagne glass as well, which only had a mouthful of alcohol left behind in it, and gulped that down too.</p><p>Rio watched her with eyes glimmering with amusement, but she maintained a comically blank expression. Once she was done, Agatha offered the three empty glasses to the flight attendant with a feral grin.</p><p>Clearing her throat, obviously intimidated, the woman announced, “Two glasses of wine coming right up!”</p><p>Agatha began to feel sleepy once she’d eaten and had yet another glass of wine. The food was fairly decent for plane fare; Rio’s sea bass was the tastiest dish out of all of them, buttery and flaky, although the roasted brussel spouts accompanying Agatha’s short rib were easily the best.</p><p>After gorging themselves on dessert— with the flight attendant even giving Rio an extra miniature tub of chocolate icecream— their chairs were set up to lay flat, blankets piled over them to create make-shift mattresses and proper down pillows offered.</p><p>Rio pulled out her laptop to work while Agatha napped, glasses tucked into her seat pocket. As she was falling asleep, she heard the clock of Rio’s Polaroid camera, and smiled, her eyes closed. She didn’t mind; she was very photogenic in her slumber.</p><p>She only managed to doze off for around an hour before light turbulence triggered her to stir awake. It was dark, the lights switched off, and it was eerily quiet apart from the rumbling of the plane engine. Rubbing her eyes and putting her glasses back on, Agatha yawned as she sat up.</p><p>“How’s it going?” she murmured, catching sight of Rio staring at her dimmed laptop screen with a dead expression.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio sighed. “I feel like I’m bashing my head against a brick wall with the discussion.” She shook her head, frustrated.</p><p>Agatha cocked her head to the side. “You want me to read it over?”</p><p>When Rio nodded, offering her the laptop, Agatha didn’t take it. Instead, she unclipped her seatbeat, circled their seats around the back, and then slipped onto Rio’s lap. Her girlfriend blinked, surprised, but shuffled back so that Agatha could get comfortable.</p><p>Flipping down the tray table in front of them, Agatha propped the laptop on it, scrolling back up to the top of the Word document.</p><p>“Do you want supportive boyfriend Agatha or paper reviewer Agatha?” she asked.</p><p>Rio bit her lip. “Paper reviewer. Better I think if you just give it to me straight.”</p><p>“Nothing I do is straight, darling.”</p><p>She huffed a laugh. “Then I want you to be brutally honest.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled and then exhaled slowly, wiggling back and forth on Rio’s lap. “Okay. So to start with, immediately, your sentences in your abstract are obscenely long. Christ, I think my lungs would end up as dry as the Sahara if I tried to speak these out loud. And the beginning of this introduction reads very flat— we both know why exactly you’re writing this paper and how important it is for the field, but you need to explain that to the audience better and introduce some tension here.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her, taken aback. Well, she asked Agatha not to hold back. “Right…” she said faintly.</p><p>She highlighted the next section as Rio rested her chin against her shoulder, peering over at the screen. “Now, this paragraph, it’s so flowery that it should be presented in a garden. This particular sentence here is so convoluted that readers will need a fucking GPS just to get to the end of it. It needs to be snappier…”</p><p>And for the next thirty minutes or so, Agatha continued to rip through Rio’s introduction. Rio, to her credit, listened attentively the whole time, nodding and occasionally wincing, but she didn’t appear to be taking any of her criticism personally.</p><p>It was after she had brutalized Rio’s methodology section and was beginning to make her through the long, <i>long</i> discussion, that she felt it. Something solid beneath her thigh.</p><p>Agatha shifted from side to side, thinking at first that it was the seatbelt… but then Rio released a stifled whimper against her skin and clutched at her hips as if to try and keep her still.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Yeah?” she squeaked.</p><p>“Are you hard right now?”</p><p>“You’re sitting on my lap grinding on me and you’re degrading me,” she whispered.</p><p>“You really can’t help yourself, can you?” Agatha scolded. But as she spoke, she squirmed atop Rio’s lap, which made her shudder and hide her face in her shoulder.  Chuckling, she reached up and behind her to stroke her fingers through her girlfriend’s hair. “My desperate sweet girl. So pathetic. So needy.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she whined quietly. “Look, just— I’ll calm down if you move back to your own seat. Give me the blanket and I’ll cover myself.” She paused and then added, embarrassed, “It’s either that or I go take care of myself in the bathroom.”</p><p>While part of Agatha did delight at the humiliation of Rio having to jerk herself off in an airplane bathroom just because she got too turned on by Agatha sitting in her lap, she did feel the tiniest bit guilty. But not guilty enough that when a rather sadistic idea popped into her head, she was dissuaded.</p><p>“I have a better idea,” she purred.</p><p>Glancing around to check that nobody was around to see them— the flight attendants were all up in the other upper section of business class, and the man in 9A was unconscious, dead to the world— Agatha stood.</p><p>Keeping the blanket wrapped around her waist, she subtly wriggled her leggings down to her knees. It exposed the black lace Calvin Klein bikini briefs she was wearing beneath.</p><p>Slipping her fingers beneath them, Agatha was pleased to find that she was already getting wet; rubbing quick, tight circles over her clit and tapping over her piercing helped increase her slickness within seconds.</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio gasped, scandalized. “What are you—”</p><p>“Shut up and keep quiet,” she hissed, and Rio instantly fell silent, her eyes as round as plates. “Good girl. Now pull yourself out your pants for me.”</p><p>Rio gulped. Cast a wary, searching look around, and once assured that they were as alone as they were probably going to get on the plane, her shoulders slumped. She relaxed and lowered her gaze submissively. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>It took some fumbling, but eventually Rio was able to covertly unzip the fly of the jeans she was wearing and fish her cock out of her underwear so that it poked through. Having been stimulated into stiffness by Agatha rocking back and forth on top of her, along with the additional glimpse of Agatha’s ass wrapped in black lace, her seven inches stood erect, the thick head already weeping with pre-cum. She spat into her palm and used it to stroke herself.</p><p>“We’re gonna need lube,” Rio mumbled.</p><p>“Check your satchel,” Agatha replied, perching on her knees for the time being. “Liquids bag.”</p><p>Rio frowned, but did as she suggested. She looked impressed when she managed to find the teensy little tin of coconut oil that Agatha had slipped into the inner pocket that morning.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, did you <i>plan</i> on us having covert public sex on the plane?” she said fiercely.</p><p>“You say that as if we have never had covert public sex before,” Agatha smirked. “I thought it best that we be prepared for anything and <i>everything</i>, dearest.”</p><p>Rio got herself slicked up with the coconut oil, which turned from solid to liquid in her palm with her body heat. She tried her hardest not to let it drip down onto her jeans, but she was by no means conservative with it, obviously wanting to ensure that she didn’t hurt Agatha with her sizable girth if she was too dry.</p><p>Which was not going to be an issue, because Agatha was now pumping her fingers inside herself to get herself warmed up, and she was already taking two digits effortlessly.</p><p>“Brace yourself, baby,” Agatha whispered with a warning wink, and then backed up, reached down between her legs to notch Rio at her entrance, and then sank down slowly.</p><p>Her girlfriend’s dick stretched her out, and the angle wasn’t the best, but she took Rio’s cock easily to the hilt. It satisfied that bone-deep cloying ache within her that demanded she be filled to bursting.</p><p>Exhaling breathily, Agatha clambered back onto Rio’s lap, mounted with her cock buried inside of her leaking cunt. She shivered at the sensation of Rio’s frenum piercing rubbing against her front wall, which electrified every cell in her lower body with arousal.</p><p>She arranged the plane blankets over them both on the lie-flat seat, so that if anybody were to walk past, they would just think that she was innocently sitting on her girlfriend’s lap.</p><p>Rubbing over her lower belly, she hummed happily, as when she pressed down firmly with her fingertips, she could feel the tip of Rio’s cock inside of her. “There we go, all safe and warm.” She squeezed her muscles so that they rippled around her the yonger woman’s length, adjusting to her intrusion.</p><p>“<i>¡Carajo!</i>” Rio wheezed, her arms winding around Agatha’s waist to hug her. “So fuckin’ tight, <i>querido, dios mío</i>.”</p><p>When her hips twitched upwards in a miniature thrust, Agatha tutted chastisingly. “Quieeeeeet. No moving. You’ll give us a way. Sit nice and still for me, baby. It’s been a while since we had a nice long cockwarming session. Now, let’s go through this discussion, shall we?”</p><p>Except Rio was struggling already, panting open-mouthed into her shoulder, kissing her neck. “Agatha, I’m gonna come.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled darkly. “Not even a single full thrust, and you’re already close? Ten years of developing your sexual stamina and you’re still a quick trigger. Such a pathetic little slut. If you come inside me before we finish going through your paper, you won’t come again until we re-enter American airspace. Show a modicum of self-control. <i>Do not disappoint me.</i>”</p><p>“Oh fuck,” Rio whimpered, but she somehow managed to get herself under control, kneading the knuckles branded MORT against the older woman’s waist, like a kitten self-soothing by making biscuits. “Yes, sir. I’m sorry, sir.”</p><p>“What are you sorry for?”</p><p>“For being a needy slut who needs to come the second I’m inside you,” Rio whispered, her face aflame but her eyes black. She was turned on.</p><p>“Ah, nah. Not <i>needs</i>. Wants,” Agatha reprimanded sharply, glancing back at her with her glasses slipping down her nose. “And you aren’t allowed to <i>want</i> when I’m in charge, are you, pet?”</p><p>Rio pouted. “No.”</p><p>“And why is that?”</p><p>“Because I’m a toy, for you to use,” she mumbled. “A… plaything. Your plaything, sir.”</p><p>“Yes, you are,” Agatha said, her voice dropping an octave. She deliberately contracted her pussy around Rio’s rock-hard length, hand trailing down her own body and beneath the blanket to flick over her clit. “And toys are controlled by their owners. So <i>sit still, do not move, do not come</i>. You let me use you like the pretty little human dildo you are to keep my cunt all stuffed and satisfied while we go through your discussion.”</p><p>“Will… will you let me come after?” she pleaded. “<i>Please?</i>”</p><p>“<i>If</i> you behave,” Agatha retorted.</p><p>“I can. I will.”</p><p>“We’ll see about that.”</p><p>Rio grumbled a little under her breath, but quickly shut up when Agatha pinched the back of her hand in warning. Agatha ground down so that her girlfriend’s cock was settled comfortably inside of her before turning back to the laptop, which was sitting precariously on the tray table with the screen dimmed.</p><p>They began to go through the discussion line by line, as it was arguably the most important part of Rio’s paper. Once they got halfway through it— and Agatha had essentially told Rio that she might have to rewrite the whole first half since new papers had since been published that she needed to address and cite— Rio was beginning to get antsy and impatient.</p><p>Her white-knuckled hands, MORS and VITA in vivid black in comparison, grasped onto Agatha’s waist as she breathed heavily. She was sweating as her cock throbbed where it was nestled in her cunt.</p><p>When they got to Rio’s conclusions, she started to get brave. Her hands wandered upwards to paw at Agatha’s boobs, little hitching breaths giving away exactly how affected she was by the cockwarming. Agatha slapped her hands down and away, grabbing them and forcing her to hold onto the seat’s armrests instead as a punishment.</p><p>Agatha could tell that Rio wanted to brat out and throw a tantrum over her treatment, but didn’t want to attract any attention. Instead, she was engaging in a small act of rebellion by faking coughs. Every cough allowed her to jerk her hips upwards to gain some stimulation. Agatha caught on fast, though.</p><p>“Oh, honey, you’re coughing so much,” she said sweetly. “Is your throat dry? Let’s get you some water.”</p><p>And then she pressed the call button.</p><p>Rio froze in stunned horror. “No.”</p><p>“Don’t you want some water for your cough, though, Rio? It sounds nasty.”</p><p>“Agatha, no, <i>no</i>, the flight attendant, she’ll— she’ll <i>notice</i>, you’re gonna get us kicked off the plane! Arrested for— for public indecency!” Rio whispered frantically. She tried to lift Agatha off her cock, but failed when Agatha reached down and dug her nails into her thighs.</p><p>“It thrills me to tell you this, baby, but you pass well enough as a cis woman that she definitely will not suspect that you have your dick inside me. She’ll just think that I’m curled up on your lap for a little nap,” Agatha replied, her voice smug. “Now be a good girl for me and behave.”</p><p>When the flight attendant eventually fluttered over to them a minute later, she eyed the two of them huddled beneath the blanket together, but beyond a slight furrow of her eyebrows, said nothing about it. Completely oblivious.</p><p>“Is there something I can get for you?”</p><p>“Some water, please,” Agatha requested with a too-bright, gleaming smile. “My girlfriend has a little tickle at the back of her throat that’s making her cough.” She clenched her cunt around Rio, which triggered her to burst out into a series of theatrical coughs to cover up her moan.</p><p>“Oh, of course. We have some honey cough drops as well, I’ll bring a couple,” she responded with a nod. She hesitated before turning around, saying cautiously, “Um, my apologies, sir, but we discourage seat-sharing due to aircraft safety protocols… I’m going to have to request that you return to your own seat.”</p><p><i>Sir</i>. Ha, probably because of how Rio called her ‘boyfriend’ earlier. “Oh, well, Maria,” Agatha said, spotting her name badge and switching on her super sickly, you-will-do-whatever-the-hell-I-say voice. “My girlfriend here, she has <i>terrible</i> flight anxiety, and earlier she was getting <i>so… worked up</i>, that I simply had to figure out a way to calm her down. And her therapist has prescribed her deep pressure therapy. Do you know what that is?”</p><p>The flight attendant shook her head. “Uh, no, sir, I don’t believe I do,” she said, looking awkward.</p><p>“It’s a form of therapy that involves applying firm pressure to your body. And usually, she would have her weighted blanket, but unfortunately it’s in our checked bag. The only other way to perform it, as her therapist advised, is if I lie on top of her,” Agatha lied flawlessly. Judging by the flight attendant’s sympathetic expression, she was lapping it up. “It’ll only be for the next… half an hour or so, and then I promise, I will return to my seat.”</p><p>“Half an hour?” Rio whispered in dread. “<i>Qué mierda de vida.</i>” <i>Fuck my life.</i></p><p>“I… I suppose then, that’s alright,” the flight attendant agreed somewhat reluctantly. “I’ll go and grab some water bottles and those cough drops for you.”</p><p>She hurried off, and as soon as she disappeared behind the curtain, Rio began to softly whimper in earnest, like a kicked puppy. She was rubbing her face up against Agatha’s shoulderblade, as if begging for mercy, while her cock, still rock hard, spasmed with pained desperation inside Agatha’s fluttering cunt.</p><p>“You… you’re joking, about the thirty minute thing, right?” Rio asked in a small voice. When Agatha merely glanced over her shoulder at her with quirked eyebrow, she begged, “Agatha, please, I won’t… can’t last another thirty minutes.”</p><p>“You can and you will,” Agatha asserted resolutely. “And because you misbehaved and tried to <i>take</i> more than allowed, you’re not allowed to come until you have made every single correction to this paper I have recommended.”</p><p>Rio’s expression creased into one of appalled anguish. “<i>Please</i>,” she tried again weakly. “Agatha…”</p><p>“What’s the safeword?”</p><p>“Azaleas.”</p><p>“Exactly. ‘Please’ is not the safeword. My name is not the safeword. So until you say azaleas or until all of your paper revisions are finished, you are not permitted to orgasm,” Agatha said sharply. “Is that understood, baby?”</p><p>A muffled sound that sounded like a cross between a despairing mewl and a mangled sob erupted from Rio’s throat, but she nodded. “Yes, sir.”</p><p>The flight attendant returned then, with a bottle of ice cold water dripping with condensation. and two individually packed honey and lemon throat lozenges. “Here’s your water, ma’am,” Maria said in a meek voice, passing them over to Rio, who thanked her with a strained smile. “Is there anything else I can get for you?”</p><p>“Yes, actually, I was wondering if the onboard wifi was included in our tickets,” Agatha drawled.</p><p>“You get an hour of free wifi in business class, but if you want it for the whole flight, it’ll be an additional charge. It’s only completely free for Special Members’ Reward Club patrons.” The attendant then began to ramble in a customer service type tone, “I’d be remiss if I didn't ask if either one of you is interested in signing up for the Special Members’ Reward Club, which gives you 20% extra air miles and discounts on all flights, from economy to business class, as well as free seat bookings, free wifi and a complementary teddy bear.”</p><p>“Ah, thank you, Maria, but we’re already looking at joining another Club,” Agatha said, flexing her kegel muscles while thinking, <i>the Mile High Club, in fact.</i></p><p>Evidently lesbian-to-lesbian telepathy was working perfectly, today, because Rio’s mind jumped to the same idea; her poor swollen, tortured cock pulsed inside of Agatha’s pussy as she muttered, “We’re joining it right now, actually.”</p><p>Maria appeared momentarily bewildered, but forced a brittle smile. “Please let me know if I can get either of you anything during the rest of the flight to make it more comfortable for you.”</p><p>“Oh, we will, Maria, thank you,” Agatha replied with a smirk, and peering back at Rio, leered, “Wouldn’t want to experience any <i>discomfort</i>, would we, darling?” while squeezing her vaginal muscles around her dick once again.</p><p>Ashen-faced, Rio managed to say, in a warbly, high-pitched voice, “No—ope.” Once the flight attendant disappeared, she murmured, “<i>¿Tratas de matarme? Mi polla va a explotar</i>.” <i>Are you trying to kill me? My dick’s about to explode.</i></p><p>“No hasta que yo lo diga,” Agatha bit at her. <i>Not until I say so</i>.</p><p>She moved the laptop from the tray table to the divider between their two seats, which they had previously lowered to create a flat surface, so that Rio could maneuver herself to be able to type.</p><p>“You have thirty minutes. If I don’t think you’ve done a decent enough job at the revisions when I re-read the paper after that… I’ll introduce you to my friend, Jaula.”</p><p>“Jaula?” Rio parroted, stiffening up. “Who the <i>fuck</i> is Jaula?”</p><p>There was an inflection of jealousy in her voice, and her hand grasped onto Agatha’s thigh over the top of the blanket, overprotective and possessive.</p><p>“<i>Jaula</i> is your anniversary present,” Agatha told her with a sadistic little grin.</p><p>She trailing her fingers down between her legs and strumming over her clit before dipping lower, pressing the pads of her fingers to the very base of Rio’s cock and where her labia were spread thin around her.</p><p>“Plastic purple cage… an unpickable locking mechanism… and a silicone ring that is a lot of fun to play with all by itself,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha witnessed it, the moment that realization dawned on Rio, and she translated <i>jaula</i> in her head: cage. A chastity cage.</p><p>She leaned back so that her spine pressed up against Rio’s front, to whisper, “I packed it in my suitcase when you weren’t looking.”</p><p>“Why?” Rio croaked.</p><p>“Why did I pack it or why is it your anniversary present?”</p><p>“B-Both.”</p><p>Agatha placed a hand over her heart, acting shocked. “Have you forgetten our most sacred anniversary tradition?” If possible, Rio’s face grew even more flushed. The ‘sacred’ tradition was anal sex. Usually, they switched who bottomed for it every year, and this year? It was Rio’s turn. Agatha planned to peg the shit out of her. “I thought I might introduce Jaula into our play might <i>spice</i> it up a little.”</p><p>“Sounds like Jaula is more a gift for you than it is for me,” Rio said bravely.</p><p>Agatha bared her teeth in a dangerous smile. “Maybe so, but you’ll be the one with your cock dressed up so prettily. You’ll become acquainted with Jaula the moment we pick up our luggage if you don’t <i>get to fucking work on your paper</i>.”</p><p>Rio yanked the laptop towards her, clearly daunted by the threat, and immediately started typing. Her fingers flew across the keyboard while Agatha lounged on top of her, speared over her girlfriend’s cock, lazily masturbating. Her bush was soaked through from her own slick and the coconut oil as she combed through it with her fingertips, circling her clit.</p><p>She wasn’t in any rush, but her orgasm crept up on her without warning, the pleasure enveloping and washing over her, like beach waves gently lapping and eroding sand. Agatha closed her eyes and breathed slowly through it, clenching her jaw shut so she didn’t moan aloud.</p><p>Rio, however, was an utter wreck in comparison, choking and shaking beneath her as Agatha’s pussy cramped tightly around her dick, massaging her. Whining quietly, like a cute little puppy.</p><p>“Oh, baby, you’re not doing so hot, are you?” Agatha teased with faux concern. “Is my sweet girl hurting from all the edging? Are you aching, <i>throbbing</i>, because you can’t handle me coming around you, my pussy <i>rippling</i> around your cock?”</p><p>“Sir, please, please, I’ve been a good girl,” Rio pleaded under her breath, squirming. “I’ve been such a good toy for you. Please let me come.”</p><p>“Hmm, well let’s see how well you fixed the issues in your paper, first,” Agatha hummed. She read over the paper slowly— more slowly than she actually needed to, just to drag time out and make Rio even more desperate. Eventually, she finished reading, and was pleased by the progress that her girlfriend had made on revising the manuscript. And decided to take pity on her. “You’ve done a good job. Good girl. You can come, baby.”</p><p>Practically instantly, as soon as the words uttering her permission left her lips, Rio busted. Her orgasm was explosive; ropes of cum fired off inside of Agatha at such force that Agatha swore she could actually feel each individual warm spray. By some miracle, Rio managed to stay completely silent apart from a single hiccuping breath which she exhaled into Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>The younger woman’s hips jerked uncontrollably beneath Agatha, almost bouncing her on Rio’s lap, as she attempted to bury her cock as deep inside her hot cunt as possible while spilling.  It caused the tip of her cock to graze against her cervix, and the sensation triggered Agatha to tumblr into her own intense orgasm. It ripped through her, and she had to raise her arm and bite down on it to muffle her own scream.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even give Rio time to recover before she carefully extracted herself from her lap, keeping the blanket wrapped around her waist. Rio hastily grabbed another one to cover herself, bright red and her chest heaving as she came down from her orgasmic high.</p><p>She squeezed her thighs together and contracted her kegels to try and keep as much as Rio’s seed inside of her as possible. Her bikini briefs snapped back into place and she pulled her leggings back up.</p><p>Agatha gave Rio an affectionate pat on her head as she turned around, bending down to press a tender kiss to her lips as she praised in a purr, “You did so wonderfully for me, <i>gatita</i>.”</p><p>Rio beamed at her. Her expression was mildly dazed and her pupils were still blown, an indicator that she was still mentally floating. “Yeah?” she said, adorably shy.</p><p>“Oh yes, you were perfect. Get yourself cleaned up for me with the makeup wipes in your bag. I’ll be back in five minutes.”</p><p>She headed to the plane bathroom, and was relieved to find that her underwear weren’t soiled too badly with Rio’s cum, having managed to keep the majority of it inside her in her short walk. She cleaned herself up, peed, and placed a pad in her underwear just in case she leaked more cum during the rest of the flight.</p><p>She picked up a little treat reward for Rio on her way back. When she returned to her seat, Rio had also tidied herself up, the only proof of their initiation into the Mile High Club being her flushed cheeks and chewed-swollen lips.</p><p>Agatha offered her the chocolate muffin. “Eat, and then take a nap,” she advised softly. She couldn’t exactly perform proper aftercare while they were in public on an airplane, but she could take care of Rio as best as she possibly could. “And drink some water as well, I don’t want you getting a headache later.”</p><p>Rio nodded, eagerly tearing into the muffin. She devoured it, despite only eating a short while ago, while sipping on her water. Agatha settled in her own seat, resting her hand on the divider between them so that when Rio was finished eating, she could reach out and hold her hand.</p><p>Her girlfriend was flagging, growing tired, with yawns cracking her jaw. She always got hot when she slept, so she removed her hoodie and handed it over to the older professor, who pulled it on herself, as the recirculating plane air was cold.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio murmured, curled up in her seat and blinking at her sleepily.</p><p>“Yes, love?”</p><p>“I’m really glad we’re going on vacation together,” Rio said quietly.</p><p>“Me too,” Agatha smiled.</p><p>As Rio fell asleep, breathing growing even and slow as she relaxed on her lie-down seat, Agatha watched her, her heart swelling and thumping powerfully within her chest. The love she felt for the younger woman was so overwhelming that it brought her to the verge of tears.</p><p>She pulled her messenger bag up from beneath the seat in front of her onto her lap, digging out her notebook and pen.</p><p>It was one she had kept a secret for months now, containing her own writing— her own drafts. She had guarded it with her life, making absolute certain that Rio never had access to it or even knew about its existence.</p><p>Adjusting her glasses, she glanced over at her napping girlfriend to make sure that she was actually asleep.</p><p>Once she was reassured, Agatha held her breath and flicked the notebook open, to the dogearred page she was seeking.</p><p><i>Proposal speech draft #13</i><br/>
<i>Copenhagen version— anniversary proposal</i></p><p><i>Rio. My love. It’s taken me months to gather the courage for this moment. But considering it’s taken us ten years to get here, five of those years spent apart, with grief and loss threatening to shatter us when we found each other again, I feel like we have earned it.</i></p><p><i>A decade ago in this city, I met the hottest, most frustrating, audacious PhD student I would ever encounter. Little did I know that her standing up at the end of my keynote, and having the fucking balls to disagree with me, would ultimately result in me falling in love with her…</i></p><hr/><p>Copenhagen was a historian’s playground, originally established in the 10th century as a Viking fishing village. It was Scandinavia's largest city and the capital of what was thought to be the oldest kingdom in the world.</p><p>When Agatha and Rio had last visited, they hadn’t managed to explore the city much outside the convention center part from in the evenings, when the majority of tourist attractions were shut to the public. Now they had the opportunity to visit all the museums and cultural spots that they desired.</p><p>Their first day, they traipsed over to Rosenborg Castle, Frederik’s Church, and Amalienborg Palace, which were all within walking distance of their hotel and each other; they stopped by small bakeries along the way, consuming caffeine to help get over their jet-jag, with Rio practically eating her weight in kanelsnegle cinnamon rolls.</p><p>She brought along her polaroid camera and was snapping photos of everything and anything to document their trip: selfies of them eating pastries, photos of Agatha reading exhibition signs, even sneaky pictures of Agatha’s ass when she was bending over to tie her shoelaces, which earned her a smack over the head and a laugh.</p><p>They had a picnic in the Palace gardens for lunch, with smørrebrød open-faced sandwiches and even more pastries, and ate so much that they ended up skipping dinner entirely, heading back to their hotel— 5-stars, Rio really didn’t spare any expense— and sleeping off the rest of their jetlag.</p><p>The next day, they headed north of the city on a daytrip, taking the train out to Kronburg Castle in Helsingør. They ended up going on a private guided tour. And it was probably best that it was private, because both of them would interrupt their guide every so often to correct them on the history.</p><p>The other tourists appeared amused by their half-hearted academic bickering as they argued about date specificity, with Rio insisting that she had read a paper once proposing that the Tesseract, Agatha’s main focus of her research, had actually been hidden in the Kronburg Castle catacombs, with Agatha groaning and telling her it made no sense in the current established timeline. But they kissed and made up after Rio surrendered and admitted that Agatha was right; Agatha was unfathomably smug and gleeful the rest of the evening.</p><p>On the day of their anniversary, Agatha was awoken by her body thrumming delightfully, her nervous system tingling with velvet-smooth pleasure.</p><p>She could immediately tell that she had been gently led to orgasm in her sleep. She was wearing a lace pair of boy shorts… and nothing else. Her underwear were soaked through, and her nipples were hard and worked raw, having obviously been sucked.</p><p>Rio was lying on her front between her thighs, resting her head on her belly and happily playing with the fine hairs of her happy trail with wet fingers.</p><p>Agatha reached down and raked her hand through Rio’s short hair, petting her. Rio peered up at her with sleep-encrusted but bright brown puppy dog eyes.</p><p>“Good morning,” Agatha husked.</p><p>“Good morning. You enjoy your wake up call?”</p><p>“Wasn’t exactly awake for it, but I do feel amazing, so thank you,” she said. Cupping her girlfriend’s cheek, she murmured, “Happy anniversary, <i>mi amor</i>.”</p><p>Rio smiled warmly back at her, clambering onto her hands and knees and hovering over Agatha’s body as she leaned down to press a delicate, sweet kiss to her lips.</p><p>That kiss very rapidly escalated into what could only be described as a sloppy, messy make-out session, Rio plastered on top of her and moaning into her mouth. Agatha eventually had to push Rio off of her to gasp in a breath.</p><p>“Happy analversary,” her girlfriend replied, with a devious little grin, sticking her tongue into the side of her cheek.</p><p>Agatha’s mind was still muddled by sleep, so the slight alteration to the word didn’t click with her immediately. When she did pick up on it, though, she grabbed one of the pillows on the other side of the bed and whacked Rio in the head with it, shaking her head amusedly as her girlfriend laughed.</p><p>“You’re ridiculous,” she said. “It’s eight am, let’s not talk sex plans until I’ve at least had a cup of coffee.”</p><p>“Hey, you’re the one who called it our <i>sacred anniversary tradition</i>,” Rio snickered. “Which makes it sound as if we only ever do anal on special occasions, which let’s be real— we <i>definitely</i> do it far more often than other couples.”</p><p>“Because you’re an anal whore,” Agatha snorted. She nudged Rio aside, rolling off the bed and standing to stretch. Her feet were slightly sore from all their walking recently, her back aching as well from the unfamiliar bed, but a hot shower would fix that. “Want to shower together and then get breakfast?”</p><p>Rio perked up like a dog being offered a treat. Except it wasn’t the promise of food at breakfast that had her excited. “When you say shower together, do you mean…”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Agatha had her back to Rio, as she was rifling through her suitcase to find her toiletries bag, but she caught sight, out of the corner of her eye, of Rio punching the air joyfully.</p><p>Rio trotted like a preening show pony into the bathroom after Agatha, her cock hard and bobbing against her belly. Agatha rolled her eyes, but her girlfriend’s happiness was infectious, so she couldn’t help but smile.</p><p>After wasting far too much hot water, nearly slipping several times over the conditioner Agatha accidentally spilled on the floor, they dressed and got ready for the day; Agatha elected for jeans, a sweater, and navy overcoat. since the weather was somewhat unreliable on the coast. She chose to wear contacts for the day and tied her hair up into a loose ponytail.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, was dressed smarter than usual, in black pants, a shirt, turtleneck and a grey peacoat; she ran her fingers through her damp hair to slick it back.</p><p>When she emerged from the bathroom, Agatha was waiting for her, gift wrapped in recyclable brown paper in hand. Rio immediately went on the alert, perking up like a pointer dog catching the scent of prey. She approached tentatively, intrigued.</p><p>“Happy anniversary, <i>mi corazón</i>,” Agatha smirked, tossing her the small box.</p><p>Rio yelped and dove to catch it before it could drop to the group, scrambling with it for a moment before shooting her a glare. “Hey, testing my hand-eye coordination before I’ve had any caffeine is a recipe for disaster, you know that!”</p><p>She eagerly ripped apart the paper to reveal her gift though. Opening the flat velvet box, she blinked down at the pair of ruby larkspur-shaped cufflinks.</p><p>“Rubies. Larkspur,” Rio murmured. “That’s…” She peered up at Agatha, a question in her eyes.</p><p>Agatha nodded. Ruby was Nicky’s birthstone, larkspur his birth month flower. It was a personal gift, and a practical one, because she knew that Rio would wear them— but she was also not at all surprised that Rio looked a little bit deflated. Rio was not the sort of person who liked receiving jewelry as gifts; she always said jewelry, cufflinks especially, was a cop-out because it was easy, and didn’t require much thought.</p><p>“Thank you, they’re beautiful,” the younger professor said, kissing her gently.</p><p>It triggered Agatha to bark out a laugh. “Well, I couldn’t fit the seven thousand plus piece Millennium Falcon Lego set in my suitcase, could I?” she said dryly.</p><p>Rio actually dropped the cufflinks in shock. She looked like a little kid who had just been told that Christmas had come early. She adored Lego, although didn’t have many sets just because of how expensive they were. “You’re kidding.”</p><p>“Do I look like I’m kidding?”</p><p>“But that’s— Agatha, that’s part of the Ultimate Collector Series, it’s like seven hundred dollars! You should not be spending that much money on me!”</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. “You just spent thousands of dollars on an anniversary and birthday trip to visit Copenhagen. Pot, kettle, black.”</p><p>“Yeah, but this trip is for <i>both</i> of us to enjoy,” Rio spluttered.</p><p>“And I’ll enjoy watching you build your Lego set while I re-read <i>The Iliad</i> for the tenth time and annotate the new copy you got me for Christmas, with all my updated analyses and thoughts, in complete silence.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip, bouncing on her heels with excitement. “So when we get back—”</p><p>“Yes, baby, the Millennium Falcon will be there. It was delivered yesterday, Alice texted me to confirm and has put it in our office,” Agatha rolled her eyes fondly. What a dork.</p><p>Rio squealed and threw herself into Agatha’s arms, hugging her happily and kissing all over her face. Scooping the cufflinks off the floor, she popped them into her shirt cuffs. “I do really love the cufflinks too, by the way.”</p><p>They enjoyed a traditional Danish breakfast spread down in the hotel’s restaurant, consisting of rundstykker bread rolls, cold cuts, cheese and soft-boiled eggs. Agatha also had a small bowl of porridge with dried fruits and nuts, and Rio had a couple more of the pastries that she was becoming addicted to.</p><p>“You’ve made plans for the day, then?” Agatha asked, nursing her cup of take-out coffee as they exited the hotel onto the Copenhagen streets. “Is there any negotiable time, because I’d really like to vicit the Garden of the Royal Library this afternoon.” It was where she planned to propose to Rio.</p><p>“We could squeeze it in,” Rio mused, checking her camera to make sure she had enough film, before putting it safely back in her bag. “But I do have plans. Your anniversary gift, actually. How would you feel about visiting the National Museum of Denmark this morning… and getting a personal tour from Professor Sylvie Laufeydottir, and behind the scenes access to the archives?”</p><p>Agatha came to an abrupt stop, amazed. “You got in contact with <i>who?</i> You’re kidding.”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“That woman’s the most irritatingly evasive expert on ancient Nordic Seiðr practices in the world. What the hell is she doing in Copenhagen? Doesn’t she work at the University of Oslo? Wait, how the fuck do you know her?”</p><p>Rio looked triumphant, like a cat who caught a canary. “She’s collaborating with the University at Copenhagen to study their collection of Völva staffs. And I know her because guess what, <i>Agatha</i>, Sylvie also believes in the existence of Asgardians.”</p><p>“No, she does not.”</p><p>“Yes, she does. We met at a conference in Glasgow, in 2023, and we email each other newly published archeological papers that we think could be evidence of Asgardian material culture.”</p><p>Agatha threw her now empty cup of coffee into the trash, scowling, “Oh for fuck’s sake—”</p><p>“<i>BUTTTT</i>,” Rio cut her off, before Agatha could go off on a rant again about pseudoarcheology and its catastrophic effects on historical understanding. “She’s hoping to talk to you about the Tesseract being used as a ceremonial relic by Old Norse S​​eiðkona.” Rio winked. “Happy anniversary, honey.”</p><p>Agatha had spent years waiting for this groundbreaking opportunity. And Rio had arranged it for her because she knew just how important it would be for her research. God, she’d never wanted to marry her more than this moment.</p><p>She threw herself into Rio’s arms and hugged her, kissing all over her face. “Thank you, thank you, thank you,” she breathed. Squeezing her hand, she tugged her along the sidewalk. “I’m gonna get you as many pastries as you fucking want, without complaint, from now on.”</p><p>They spent their entire morning at the museum, and part of the early afternoon down in the archives with Sylvie, who was enthusiastic about Agatha’s thoughts on some of the artifacts down there.</p><p>Rio snapped photos on her phone, beaming when Sylvie complimented her Cowboy Snoopy phone case. She took pictures of items in the archives that Agatha had never seen before and there weren’t pictures of online, teasing her that she should be happy about her ‘obsessive hobby’.</p><p>Rio insisted on taking photos of them wearing the replica Viking helmets as payment, which Agatha at first flat out refused, but Sylvie thought was hilarious. The Norwegian ended up snapping the pictures on Rio’s behalf, laughing at how Agatha looked like a grumpy kid stifling a smile..</p><p>By the time they finished up, they were both starving. Agatha bought them both some books that weren’t available in America at the gift shop while Rio chose some magnets so that they could stick their polaroid photos on their fridge at home.</p><p>Rio also picked out a soft tawny ballerina rabbit toy for Scratchy, insisting that he needed a gift to apologize for leaving him behind with Jen and Alice. They grabbed a late lunch at a little cafe next to the museum, and by the time they left, it was 4pm.</p><p>“Fancy a drink?” Rio asked with a sly smile, leading her by the hand across the street.</p><p>“As if I would ever say ‘no’ to that question.”</p><p>“Good, because there’s a certain pub with a bar that’s only a five minute walk from here that I want to re-visit, that holds a <i>lot</i> of significant memories for us.”</p><p>She had to be referring to The Black Dog. “Significant?” Agatha repeated dryly. “You would call me humiliating you and stroking your cock through your clothes, and making you come in your pants in public, before declining your hotel hook-up invitation… <i>significant?</i>”</p><p>Rio released a dreamy sigh. “My pants were permanently ruined after that. You changed my life forever. Unlocked my humiliation and degradation kinks. I have so much to thank that bar for.”</p><p>“You sound so wistful,” Agatha laughed. “Want us to recreate that moment?”</p><p>Her girlfriend glanced over at her, lip curling up. “Not what I was implying, but I’m game if you are.”</p><p>“Hmm, we have plans tonight, can’t have you soiling your pants now.” Agatha was not going to propose to Rio while she had a dark, damp stain at her crotch from her cum.</p><p>The Black Dog was open when they arrived, and despite it only being 4pm, it was bustling, patrons everywhere and creating an incredible atmosphere that reminded Agatha of what it was like the night that they drank together at the bar.</p><p>Rio went to get drinks for them while Agatha hunted down an empty table; the only one available was in the very center of the room, so they definitely wouldn’t be getting up to anything naughty.</p><p>“Whiskey, Macallan, neat, three fingers,” Rio announced, placing the glass in front of her.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “You remember the exact drink I had ten years ago?” she asked, touched.</p><p>“S’not that hard,” Rio shrugged.</p><p>“I don’t even drink whiskey anymore. I stopped after—” She cut herself off, mid sentence. Her hand went to cover the dahlia tattoo on her wrist.</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened. She bent down to brush a kiss over her forehead. “I know, baby. But I thought, considering the occasion, it would be appropriate.” She took her seat opposite and held her drink out; it looked to be the same fruity monstrosity she’d ordered a decade ago. “Happy anniversary, <i>cariño</i>. Cheers.”</p><p>“Cheers.”</p><p>They clinked glasses. Agatha took a long draw from her chilled glass, humming in appreciation at the smooth burn of the whiskey slipping down her throat. Rio necked half her drink at once, licking the traces of it off her lips.</p><p>They fell into an easy discussion, debating the best artifacts in the museum and talking about how Sylvie would be a great reviewer for Rio’s paper, when she submitted it,</p><p>Perhaps it was the alcohol giving her liquid confidence, but after a few minutes of making idle conversation, Agatha scrounged up the courage to admit suddenly, “I’ve been thinking about him a lot, lately.”</p><p>Rio fell silent, staring at her. “Nicholas?” she asked tentatively.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>And wow, what a fucking bummer to bring up their dead son on their anniversary while they were in a pub drinking together, and Agatha was planning to drop to one knee later.</p><p>“Oh.” Rio’s eyes fell to the table only momentarily before she raised her gaze again to meet Agatha’s, clearly understanding that eye contact was going to be vital for this. “I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I’ve been thinking about him recently too… while planning this trip. I mean… this is where he started.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “That’s true.”</p><p>“Are you…” Rio paused. Gathered her thoughts. “Have you been upset, thinking about him?”</p><p>“Yes. No. Maybe.” She took a deep breath. “It’s not even… truly about him. I’ve just been reflecting on my life a lot, this past year. And I couldn’t help but wonder… what would have happened. If I hadn’t slipped out of the hotel that night we hooked up, if I’d stayed and we’d gone for breakfast pastries that next morning… if we’d exchanged numbers. So that I could have contacted you immediately when I found out about the pregnancy. So that… we could have found each other sooner. So much sooner.” She threw back the rest of her whiskey, shuddering. “It’s stupid.”</p><p>“It’s human,” Rio countered softly. “To wonder about the ‘what if’s.”</p><p>“But changes nothing. Wouldn’t have changed anything for him. He had anencephaly, his brain wasn’t developing properly and he was never gonna make it,” Agatha angrily wiped at her eyes, refusing to let her tears fall. “But at least we would have had each other. I wouldn’t… I wouldn’t have been alone. I don’t know. Like I said, stupid. It was ten years ago.”</p><p>“Doesn’t make him any less real.” Rio’s hand snaked over the tabletop to press her fingertips against Agatha’s tattoo. “Doesn’t make him any less our son. And doesn’t make the loss we experienced, and the love we feel for him and each other, less real either.”</p><p>Agatha brushed her own thumb over the carbon copy flower tattoo on her girlfriend’s own wrist.</p><p>Dahlia 'Nicholas'.</p><p>Their own personal way of remembering and paying homage to their little boy who never got to take breath.</p><p>They’d got them done together, on the anniversary of the day that Nicholas was stillborn, that first year that they were together. It had been Rio’s idea, and she’d found a local artist she trusted. Agatha was numb when the needle hit her skin, and cried silently. Rio held her other hand the entire time, while another artist tattooed her.</p><p>That day had been rough, utterly exhausting, but Agatha had felt lighter than she had in years after.</p><p>“Agatha?” She glanced over at Rio, stilling when she saw how serious her expression was. “I’ve been reflecting on my life a lot too recently. And I just want to say… I don’t regret anything. I’ve loved every second that I’ve ever spent at your side. And I love you. So much. More than anything.”</p><p>“I love you too,” Agatha murmured. The fact she was able to say that out loud without any hesitation was enough proof that her heart, which had been suffering for so long carrying the weight of grief and loss, was healing.</p><p>Rio entwined their fingers together. “And I love Nicky, even though we never got to raise him. And I know everything that’s happened, us moving house and talking about kids, has been scary, and you in particular have been feeling about… leaving him behind. Disrespecting him, somehow.”</p><p>Agatha nodded numbly, feeling cold. “I just… I’m terrified of the idea that one day, I might just… not think about him as much. That there’ll be a day in the future that I just… <i>forget</i> to think about him. That the grief will have faded to the point where it doesn’t even hurt anymore.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t think that grief ever disappears, it just evolves. And I don’t think it’s an inherently bad thing… for it to hurt less. It just means you’re learning to live with the loss rather than being overwhelmed by it,” Rio murmured. She squeezed Agatha’s hand to help ground her, tightly enough that her knuckles ached. “Nicky wouldn’t want you to be in pain, Agatha. And I think that the best way we can honor his memory is by looking forward, to our future together. I think… I think he would have wanted that. For us to be happy.”</p><p>Agatha managed a watery smile. “Me too.”</p><p><i>Our future together.</i></p><p><i>For us to be happy.</i></p><p>Slipping her hand into her pants’ pocket, Agatha’s fingers closed around the folded sheet of paper she’d ripped out from her notebook, containing her proposal speech. Agatha was definitely going to marry her.</p><p>They drank a little more after that, Agatha having another two double whiskeys and Rio having another fruity drink loaded with vodka. They poured out of the bar tipsy and loose, in good spirits. It was early evening, the sun setting and darkness threatening to engulf the sky. Agatha tried to insist they walk over to the Royal Library Gardens, but Rio said that she had another surprise.</p><p>It was only as they were approaching the Copenhagen conference center that Agatha realized what they were doing.</p><p>“Are we breaking in!?” she asked in astonishment. It appeared empty, no events currently being hosted. “Good lord, five years into a relationship with you and you have me trespassing and breaking and entering as your accomplice now. And I always thought that if I went to jail it would be for murdering that misogynistic racist asshole from the Anthropology department, the one who’s secretly a Young Earth creationist.”</p><p>“Nah, we’re not doing anything <i>too</i> illegal,” Rio said with a grin, dragging her towards a maintenance door. “I snuck out of the museum while you and Sylvie were mid argument about rune stones, and bribed the security guard.” She nudged the fire exit door with her foot— and it opened, revealing it had been propped open with a two by four. “After you, my lady.”</p><p>The lights all switched on automatically as they snuck through the corridors into the inner circle of conference rooms. It was eerily quiet, and Agatha couldn’t believe how huge the building actually was, and how creepy it seemed when it wasn’t teeming with people.</p><p>She had no clue where Rio was taking her, the alcohol having gone to her head a little and making her feel light and care-free, stifling her giggles as Rio kept checking the numbers on the walls, muttering in furious Spanish about the place being a maze.</p><p>Eventually, they reached their destination. Rio pushed the door open and ushered Agatha inside. As the lights slowly flickered to life, illuminating the space, Agatha instantly recognized it, her eyes widening. The auditorium was far less intimidating when it wasn’t filled with Gen Z and millennial students all staring at her like a zoo animal they wanted to poke with a stick.</p><p>She approached the small stage, shaking her head dazedly as the memories washed over her. “Holy shit. This is—”</p><p>“Where you gave your keynote ten years ago?” Rio finished. She grabbed a chair from where they were stacked up against the wall, throwing their bags onto the floor so she could set it up directly in front of the stage. “Yup. Except this time, I’m sitting in the front row, rather than at the back. How about you give me a repeat performance, baby? I promise I’ll be a <i>very</i> attentive one-person audience.”</p><p>Agatha was buzzed just enough to think it was a hilarious suggestion, and so, ignoring the stairs to the side, she clambered up onto the stage on her hands and knees, standing and then whirling around.</p><p>“Hello, everybody, I’m Dr. Agatha Harkness. Professor of History at Salem University, and I’m gonna be talking about a big blue space cube to you today,” she announced with a flourish, grinning when she heard Rio laugh outrageously.</p><p>“Hey, stop laughing,” she said with a snap of her fingers, which only made Rio laugh harder. “This is gonna be the most riveting speech <i>ever</i> and I’m not pulling up a slime video or Subway Surfers screen behind me to keep your attention!”</p><p>“It tends to be cooking videos or Minecraft clips these days,” Rio shouted up to her, cupping her hands around her mouth so her voice was projected.”</p><p>“Yeah? Well I’m gonna chat shit about a different type of cube. I’m the only one who can be bothered to track where the hell it’s travelled to throughout history because let me tell you, this bitch? Is a <i>SLUT</i>. It gets around a <i>LOT</i>.”</p><p>Okay, so maybe she was a tad past tipsy and was borderline drunk.</p><p>“So sit back and enjoy the ride, because this cube’s old as fuck and has been fondled by a lot of people. I’m gonna give you a comprehensive Epstein-style Tesseract list for you to write notes on and then throw in the trash later, just like the government did.”</p><p>There was a handy-dandy whiteboard currently set up that had previously been abandoned by whoever last presented in this room, with a whiteboard marker attached with a magnet, and so Agatha began to draw out a rough timeline, rambling off all the names and placed where the Tesseract had ended up.</p><p>She mispelt a lot of the names which made Rio crack up, but Agatha was a little bit too drunk to be able to spell the ridiculously long Nordic names.</p><p>“And then, finally, the Americans did what Americans do best, and they stormed in, fished it out of the ocean, claimed it as their own and stole the fucking thing,” she finally ended her long speech on. “Although I guess the British have them beat on ancient artifact theft. And now it’s locked up in a big ass vault by the government in a ‘super secret location’ which any idiot could easily tell you is probably the Smithsonian.” She drew a very crude sun inside of a circle in a mockery of the Smithsonian Institute logo. “And that’s it. Cube history over. Any questions!?”</p><p>“I have one,” the love of her life’s voice called out from behind her.</p><p>Agatha wheeled around, wielding the whiteboard marker in her hand as a sword as she pointed it at Rio. “And let me guess, you’re gonna ask about whether a fictional race that is peddled by every conspiracy theorist from here to Atlantis ever got… their hands… on…” Agatha trailed off, her voice dying from pure stupefaction.</p><p>Rio was kneeling on the floor.</p><p>On one knee.</p><p><i>On one fucking knee.</i></p><p>With a ring box in hand.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw hit the floor.</p><p>There was a bashful yet adoring smile on Rio’s face as she looked up at her with an expression of sheer devotion. “Agatha—” Rio started to say.</p><p>“No,” Agatha interrupted her.</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Time stood still.</p><p>The silence was so fucking heavy that it felt as if it was crushing her lungs in her chest.</p><p>“No?” Rio echoed, her eyes wide.</p><p>“No, no, no, no, this can’t be happening,” Agatha began to mutter, pacing back and forth on the stage with her head in her hand.</p><p>She felt dizzy. The alcohol was not helping her think straight, because all she could focus on was <i>I was meant to be the one proposing!</i></p><p>“Are you kidding, are you fucking kidding, this <i>so isn’t fair</i>, godDAMN you, Rosario Vidal! Why would you do this to me?”</p><p>Rio looked utterly terrified. “Because… I love you? And want you to marry me?” she replied hopelessly, snapping the ring box shut and staggering to her feet. “Agatha, I’m <i>so sorry</i>, I really thought that— I was so sure that today would be perfect, I mean, I was originally going to do it on your birthday, but—”</p><p>“That makes it worse!” Agatha cried out, throwing her hands in the air.</p><p>She was aware that she was drunk, overreacting, and basically stomping her foot on the ground like a tantruming toddler, but <i>godfuckingdammit</i>, she had been planning her proposal to Rio for <i>months</i>, and Rio had to go and beat her to it.</p><p>She dug her crumpled proposal plan out of her pocket, balled it up, and threw it at Rio with an aggravated sigh. Rio caught it out of midair and, sticking the ringbox back into her jacket, carefully began to unravel it so she could read it.</p><p>As soon as her eyes started skimming Agatha’s handwriting, she broke into a massive relieved grin. “Oh.”</p><p>“You had to fucking beat me to it!” Agatha complained, sitting down on the edge of the stage. “See the number at the top of that paper!? Draft 13! Number FUCKING THIRTEEN. I have been planning my proposal to you on this anniversary for <i>MONTHS</i>. I was gonna propose to you today, in the Royal Library Gardens!”</p><p>Rio started to laugh so hard that she couldn’t breathe, and actually fell back onto the chair she was sitting on before. “And I insisted we come here instead and overrode your proposal plan,” she wheezed.</p><p>“I cannot <i>believe</i> I called you patient in draft 8! Oh, and in draft 10, when I said that you have never overstepped!” she ranted, swinging her legs back and forth where they were dangling off the stage. “Well that’s out the fucking window now, isn’t it!?</p><p>Shaking her head, Rio somehow managed to climb back to her feet, slinking forwards until she reached Agatha. She rubbed over her knees comfortingly. “Would it make you feel better if you read it to me now, baby?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled out of her nose slowly. Calmed herself down, smoothed her hair back. “I should probably let you finish yours first, since I cut you off.” She sighed heavily. “I’m sorry. God, that was childish of me.”</p><p>“You’re drunk, honey, it’s okay,” Rio chuckled. “I mean, technically speaking, you <i>were</i> the one to confess your feelings and tell me that you love me first, five years ago, so you’ll always have me one-upped in that regard.”</p><p>“Hm, true. I won that battle. And I very much relished the surprise on your face. You can finish proposing to me now.”</p><p>“Oh, thanks for giving me permission,” Rio joked. She fished the ring box out of her jacket, and pressed it into Agatha’s hands. “I’m not getting back onto one knee, because for the sake of full transparancy, I think it nearly gave out on me last time. And… my brain isn’t working properly so the speech I had planned is completely gone. So I guess I’ll just say… Agatha Harkness. You are, and will always be, the love of my life. I cannot imagine my existence without you.”</p><p>She opened the ring box to reveal a simple gold band, with a trio of precious stones inlaid in a line in the center. A ruby, flanked by two diamonds. Nicky’s birthstone, the same as in the cufflinks that Agatha had gifted her this morning.</p><p>“Please, my love. Will you marry me?” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha hopped off the stage, her shoes clapping loudly and echoing as they struck the floor. She cautiously extracted the ring from its box, being careful not to drop it because of how sweaty her fingertips were… and she slid the ring onto her finger.</p><p>“Congratulations, my love,” she whispered, cupping Rio’s cheeks gently. “You’ve got yourself a husband.”</p><hr/><p>After sneaking back out of the conference center, with Rio tipping the security guard who locked the door behind them on their way out to thank him, they walked back to their hotel together, hand in hand, with Agatha feeling as if she was on cloud nine.</p><p>The walk helped her sober back up, but she was still stumbling as they crossed roads and navigated the sidewalks, because she was so entranced by the ring on her finger, in disbelief that she was wearing it. Rio had to partially steer her.</p><p>She insisted on holding Agatha’s hand, arguing that it was ‘too heavy’ with the weight of her ring, and Agatha catered her desire, if only to see her smile so widely with that adorable tooth gap.</p><p>It was probably a good thing, in reality, that Rio had beaten her to proposing, because Agatha didn’t have a ring for Rio. She had expressed over the years whenever their colleagues had gotten married that she didn’t want an engagement band, as she thought they were a waste of money.</p><p>Rio explained as they walked, however, that Agatha’s engagement ring was forged from recycled gold and diamonds from family heirloom jewelry that Rio’s mother had gifted her, telling her sternly that she needed a ring to propose; Rio had contacted and commissioned one of their previous students, Nate Richards, who had a historical blacksmithing hobby.</p><p>Rio called her mom as they strolled, and as soon as her mother picked up, Rio gushed out, “<i>Agatha dijo que sí, Mami. Todo salió a la perfección.</i>” <i>Agatha said yes, Mom. It all went perfectly.</i></p><p>Agatha laughed when Rio’s mom began to screech with joy down the line— “<i>¡Por fin tengo otra hija guapa! Estará maravillosa con un traje blanco en tu boda.</i>” <i>I finally have another handsome daughter! She’ll look wonderful in a white suit at your wedding.</i> Her voice was so loud that Agatha could hear her, even though the phone wasn’t on speaker phone.</p><p>Rio’s family adored Agatha and treated her like one of their own. Although Agatha was wary at first of Rio’s parents, and thought their kind words and open arms were charades— given that her own mother, may she burn eternally in hell, was a <i>demon</i> of a woma— she had warmed and come to trust them, after spending several holidays with them over the years.</p><p>Hell, she’d jokingly told Rio that she was the favorite child now.</p><p>Rio’s older brother Benito had become like an irritating younger sibling to her; he teased her relentlessly and called her Langosta because of how easily she burnt in the Texan summer sun.</p><p>(“It’s a good thing lobster’s one of my favorite things to eat,” Rio had said slyly, prompting Agatha to whack her arm.)</p><p>Her younger brother, Mateo, was now studying Vet Science at Texas A&amp;M on a football scholarship; their team name was, hilariously, the Texas Aggies, and he had declared Agatha an honorary Aggie just because of her name.</p><p>They’d spent week-long summer vacations out in Puerto Rico with Rio’s aunts and uncles, and they practically had permanent rooms in Rio’s grandmother’s house in PR and family home in Texas, just because of how welcoming they were.</p><p>She was all too happy to marry into the Vidal family, especially when she knew how supportive they were of Rio’s transition and their relationship.</p><p>When they arrived back at the hotel, Agatha checked the time, and realized they had an hour until their dinner booking. They’d decided, this morning, to revisit the waterfront restaurant <i>Alchemist</i>, which they’d previously been to their last trip to the city. The menu had recently been updated.</p><p>They had a robust wine list, which Agatha heartily approved of, and the hosts were all too happy to accommodate their late booking when they’d heard it was to celebrate their anniversary.</p><p><i>Alchemist</i> held a fond place in Agatha’s heart. Yes, last time they’d gone there, Agatha hadn’t partaken in any of the banquet-style food, in fear of getting food poisoning before her flight… but it was the restaurant that Rio had punched her old U-Mass asshole of a colleague John Walker in the face, in her defence.</p><p>Agatha had been so aroused by Rio’s protectiveness that she’d accompanied her back to her hotel, for some of the hottest sex she had ever experienced. And tonight, they would definitely be doing the same thing.</p><p>Rio took a suspiciously long time in the bathroom while Agatha dried her hair and picked clothes. The restaurant required formal wear, which fortunately she had packed; she dressed herself in a royal indigo suit with a blazer, white shirt and thin purple tie.</p><p>And, knowing what they were going to get up to tonight… she slipped a soft packer into the front of her pants.</p><p>When Rio finally emerged from the bathroom with flushed cheeks, she was oddly stiff in her movements as she dressed herself in a dark ivy green pants and vest. She was also wearing a choker around her neck. Thin black leather, not so noticeable that people would suspect it to be a collar, although that very much was what it symbolized.</p><p>When her eyes landed on the bulge in Agatha’s pants, her face promptly began to resemble a tomato. “Fuck,” she mumbled, palming her crotch. “You look so hot.”</p><p>“You gonna be able to get through dinner without spontaneously combusting?” Agatha’s gaze lowered. “Or more accurately, busting in your pants?”</p><p>“I… I can resist.”</p><p>The staff at the restaurant gushed over the ring, happily took photos of the pair at their table, and gifted them a free bottle of either champagne or wine. Rio pushed Agatha to select one, claiming the older woman’s taste in wine was much better than her own. She chose a red wine that paired perfectly with her baked camembert, fig and prosciutto starter.</p><p>“Enjoying the food?” Rio asked, smirking. “Since you’re actually eating here, this time.”</p><p>“This might be the best cheese I’ve ever had. Missing some entertainment though. Last time I was here, this spunky PhD student assaulted a sexist pig-headed mouthbreather of a man to defend my honour.” Agatha leaned in and whispered, “And then she spilled her spunk inside of me after.”</p><p>“Lucky girl,” Rio said, her eyes sparkling.</p><p>“Oh, the luckiest. Especially since she’s somehow managed to convince me to marry her, ten years later.”</p><p>“I don’t think it took that much convincing.”</p><p>“She bribed her way into a locked building, and dragged me along with her, to force me to become an accessory to breaking and entering. I was practically held hostage.”</p><p>“Is somebody still miffed I beat her to dropping to one knee?” Rio teased.</p><p>Agatha pointed her fork at her threateningly. “Eat your fucking pea soup.”</p><p>Their entrées arrived shortly after they finished their starters; Agatha had ordered the ribeye with roast potatoes and broccolini, while Rio selected the winter vegetable and barley salad. Agatha chose.</p><p>It was only as Agatha was scraping her plate clean and Rio was spearing the last few shavings of raw carrot to pop into her mouth, that she realized Rio was choosing odd dishes for herself. She usually enjoyed eating steak, so it would have made sense for her to also order the ribeye… and yet, she’d purposefully picked out vegetarian options.</p><p>It was unusual behavior.</p><p>There was also the fact that Rio had been squirming in her seat like a kid hyped up on Haribos for their entire meal.</p><p>Agatha watched her carefully from across the table. She reached over and snagged her hand holding her fork, pinning her wrist to the dining table. The engagement ring glinted in the candlelight.</p><p>“Is there something you want to tell me, <i>amor</i>?” she asked pointedly. “Because you’ve been fidgeting all night and you’ve chosen dishes that are <i>all</i> vegetables.” Meaning they were high in fibre and easily digestible.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, heat erupting in her cheeks. “Everything’s fine,” she said.</p><p>“Oh really?” Agatha lifted her foot, dragging the toe of her Oxford up the side of Rio’s calf teasingly.</p><p>She jumped, blushing an even deeper red, and then winced before quickly schooling her expression. Smirking, Agatha lowered her foot. She was beginning to suspect what was going on. What Rio had done.</p><p>“You’ve been restless and jumpy ever since stepped out of the bathroom at the hotel earlier.”</p><p>“Have I?” Rio averted her eyes cagily. “I’d have to disagree, I don’t think I’ve been fidgeting.”</p><p>And then she shifted back and forth gingerly on her chair.</p><p>Agatha chuckled deeply. “Oh, <i>guapa</i>, you <i>are</i>, and you know exactly why.”</p><p>“Do I?”</p><p>“Hm-hmm,” Agatha hummed, trailing her fingers over her girlfriend— her <i>fiancee’s</i>— pulse. It was racing.</p><p>Leaning over the table, she curled a finger, motioning for Rio to come closer. She visibly gulped as she bent her head obediently, turning her head slightly to the side so she could hear Agatha’s whisper amongst the buzz of the restaurant.</p><p>“You, pretty girl, are wearing a shiny princess plug in that tight little cunt of yours,” she murmured in seductive purr, hand wrapped around Rio’s wrist possessively. “And judging by how much you’re wriggling around an adorable whiny puppy desperate to piddle… I’d bet it’s a big one. Am I right?”</p><p>Rio swallowed nervously. “Yes,” she confessed.</p><p>“Are you that eager for me to stuff my cock up your sweet little hole, baby? Did you stretch yourself out with your fingers in the shower earlier, because you’re so excited about me fucking you on your hands and knees like a bitch in heat tonight? Tell me, Rio, how badly do you want it?”</p><p>Rio whimpered. She always got so worked up whenever Agatha referred to her ass as a cunt and a hole. “Want you to fuck me so bad, sir,” she whispered. “Agatha, I— I will be such a good girl for you.” She was breathing raggedly at just the thought, her eyes black as she chewed on her lip. “Please, I’ll beg for you if you want me to.”</p><p>Agatha was secretly thrilled, Rio’s instinctive submission causing her dominant side to rear its head like a race horse champing at the bit.</p><p>“Would you get down on your knees in the middle of this fucking restaurant if I wanted?” Agatha asked lowly. “Would you beg for me to fuck your cunt in front of all these people like the needy little slut you are at heart? Would you nuzzle my cock through my pants and make a show of panting and whining?”</p><p>“Do you want me to?” Rio said breathlessly.</p><p>“And what if I do?”</p><p>Swallowing nervously, Rio slowly began to rise to her feet, glancing around anxiously. Agatha quickly tugged her back down into her chair by her wrist, stunned and <i>incredibly</i> turned on that the younger woman was apparently <i>so</i> desperate to get ass-fucked that she was willing to humiliate herself in front of strangers to please Agatha.</p><p>Shit, Agatha wanted to strip off her tie and wrap it around Rio’s neck as a make-shift leash for everybody to witness.</p><p>“Color?” she asked in a low voice.</p><p>“Green,” Rio breathed, her pupils so dilated they looked like black holes. “Safeword is azaleas. I want to play, Agatha. You have my full consent for the scene.”</p><p>Agatha nodded sharply and raised her hand to signal for one of the waiters. “Sorry, we’ve had something very urgent come up,” she said, as soon as they came over to check on them. “We’ll need the check as soon as possible.”</p><p>“Would you like to order dessert to go?” the waitor asked politely. “We can box it up for you.”</p><p>Agatha glanced back over at Rio ravenously. “Dessert’s sorted for the night, so no, thank you.”</p><p>The waiter nodded and walked away. When Rio opened her mouth to ask what she was doing, Agatha hit her with a stern, strict look.</p><p>“<i>You</i>, don’t speak a single word until we get back to the hotel. If you’re obedient, you’ll be rewarded. If not, you’ll be edged into oblivion, do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Rio replied, bowing her head meekly.</p><p>Not twenty minutes later, Rio was naked as the day she was born, kneeling on the bed with her knees spread shoulder width apart and face buried in the pillows. The choker around her neck had been replaced with a much thicker, gaudier dark purple collar, a metal plaque attached that said <i>If lost, return to Agatha Harkness</i>. No proper leash, as Agatha had unfortunately forgotten to pack it.</p><p>“Present,” Agatha ordered sharply.</p><p>Rio’s hands reached back behind her to grasp her asscheeks and pull them apart, revealing the purple jewel metallic butt plug buried inside of her.</p><p>Her cock was hanging down between her legs, dripping copious pre-cum onto the sheets. She was utterly silent, just as Agatha ordered her to be, waiting in anticipation for her next instruction.</p><p>Agatha had stripped off slower, taking her time to admire how Rio’s back was arched so prettily and how the plug bobbed in her ass as she clenched around it greedily, hungry to be filled with more than just the metal bulb.</p><p>She had to scrounge around in her suitcase to find her strap and harness, as well as the cock ring for the chastity cage she’d brought along and their sex toy soap.</p><p>“Stay right there, gorgeous,” she purred, stroking her hand up and down Rio’s spine.</p><p>She followed the center stem of the large monochrome orchid tattoo that blanketed her back, trailing down to where the flowers’ roots spiderwebbed over her asscheeks. Rio shuddered at her touch, her back muscles flexing and contracting, making the orchid petals on her skin ripple, as if they were being rustled by the wind.</p><p>The older professor tapped on the purple jewel of the plug teasingly. “You’ve waited so patiently for me, such a good girl. You’ll get what you want soon, I promise.”</p><p>She ducked into the bathroom to wash her strap and the cock ring. No boiling water, but hot water plus the toy soap gave her peace of mind. When she returned, she sighed in exasperation. Rio had pulled one of the pillows between her legs and was humping at it desperately, whimpering as she tried to stimulate herself.</p><p>“Bad girl,” Agatha snapped, slapping her on the asscheek so hard that Rio yelped, cringing. Yanking the pillow out from beneath her, she scoffed when she saw the wet stain from Rio’s pre-cum. “Dirty fucking sloppy slut. Your cunt’s leaking everywhere. Making a mess on the sheets and pillows.”</p><p>“M’sorry, m’sorry, ‘m just really hard. It hurts, sir,” Rio whined.</p><p>“Oh, it hurts?” Agatha mocked. “Does the poor leaking whore need to come?”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” Rio breathed.</p><p>Agatha swiped her fingers between her thighs and folds, where she was already slippery with arousal. She wormed that slick hand beneath Rio’s torso, palming at her flushed cock, playing with the swollen tip and her frenum piercing.</p><p>“Does my sweet girl want me to fill up her pretty cunt with my thick cock and make her squirt all over the bed while I use her as my fleshlight?”</p><p>Rio was slipping down into the beautiful haze of subspace, slurring out, “Yessir, please use me to get off, sir.”</p><p>Grinning sadistically, Agatha wrenched Rio’s head off the mattress by her collar, and shoved her face back down again so her nose was buried in the damp cum stain on the pillow. “Why don’t you clean that pillowcase with your tongue, hmm? Suck your filthy pre-cum out of it while I get myself all nice and slick so I can slide into your precious little hole.”</p><p>Rio obeyed without question, to her delight, licking stripes across the pillowcase and moaning as the taste of her own salty sweet pre-cum struck her tongue.</p><p>“Fuck, that’s so hot, baby,” Agatha mumbled to herself, hand dropping to her clit, where she found herself throbbing and already sensitive.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed upwards and she whimpered at the sight of Agatha masturbating, getting herself off the sight of her sucking her pre-cum out of the pillowcase fabric.</p><p>“Keep going, <i>amor</i>,” Agatha ordered, withdrawing her wet fingers to force Rio’s face down again. “Imagine that it’s my pussy filled with your cum, show me what a greedy desperate bitch you are for me.”</p><p>Rio moaned and resumed her enthusiastic licking of the pillow.</p><p>While her fiancée was occupied, Agatha stepped into her harness and got strapped up, slicking up her seven inch black cock— a dildo that was the perfect mold of Rio’s own when erect, with anatomically accurate veins and all.</p><p>It even had its own little silicone knob where her piercing was located, which was fantastic for laying an assault against Rio’s prostate. It was girthy, so thick that Agatha couldn’t close her thumb and forefinger around it; it would create a delicious burn when stretching Rio out.</p><p>She slapped and then rubbed a hand over Rio’s ass, where a beautiful pink handprint was starting to blossom over the orchid root tattoos. Rio once again arched her back to push her ass up into her palm with a depraved groan.</p><p>“So gorgeous,” Agatha praised, twirling the ass plug inside Rio’s tight sphincter, smirking when she saw the muscle twitch. “How many fingers did you prep yourself with in the shower, baby? One? Two?”</p><p>“Four,” Rio moaned into the pillow, sweat-soaked and shaking.</p><p>“Fuck, baby, you must’ve been gaping. Bet your cunt was swallowing them up by the time you worked yourself up to four, bet this plug just slipped right on in.” Agatha tugged on it experimentally. It must have been one of their larger ones, because it moved just a tad, but was pretty wedged in. “Did you come?”</p><p>Rio hesitated to respond. Because she knew that if she lied, Agatha would be able to tell… and she knew that if she told the truth, which Agatha knew was her admitting she <i>did</i> orgasm, it would earn her a punishment.</p><p>“Yeah,” she finally confessed, letting go of her asscheeks to return to an all fours position. “Came all over the shower wall… I washed it all off with your shampoo.”</p><p>Agatha tutted. “Came without my permission, <i>and</i> you used my shampoo to clean up your mess after? When you know that shampoo costs more than a week of groceries? Naughty girl. I have half a mind not to let you come again this evening. And actually…” Agatha twirled the cock ring around her finger, before dropping it on the bedside table. “How about we make it so that the only orgasm you’re allowed has to be from my cock inside you?”</p><p>The noise that escaped Rio’s throat was so vulgar that it made a shiver run down Agatha’s spine. “Please, yes, please, make me come around your dick,” she keened. “Please, sir, fuck me, lock up my cock and fuck me like a pathetic slut.”</p><p>Sliding over to the front of the bed, kneeling in front of Rio now, Agatha grabbed a fistful of her hair and without any warning, forced her cock down her throat. “C’mon, <i>bonita cosita</i>, get my dick all nice and wet so it’s ready to slide into your tight little cunt.”</p><p>Rio gagged, if only because she wasn’t expecting the thick intrusion. Agatha waited patiently, not moving, until she relaxed her jaw and angled her head back to open her airway, to allow her girlfriend to fuck her face. Which Agatha did so, with enthusiasm. Strangled gurgling noises erupted from Rio’s stuffed throat, drool spilling out between her stretched lips. The strap caused her throat to bulge obscenely, tightening the collar around her neck.</p><p>“So fucking beautiful, choking on my fat cock,” Agatha groaned, her nails scratching the back of her scalp to praise her.</p><p>Agatha collected her spit to paint her cheeks with it, thumbing affectionately at the stretched corners of her lips around her length. Rio’s nose bumped her pubic nose several times. Her eyes were watering, but she remained still and submissive, bobbing obediently.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha withdrew, leaving Rio heaving for oxygen. Dizzy and fuzzy-headed, Rio fell back down onto her front, stretching her arms above her head to grab hold of the headboard bars, to ground herself. Her hips were twitching, the tip of her cock rubbing against the sheets and leaking pre-cum everywhere.</p><p>Agatha swiped up the cock ring from the bedside table. She knew from their previous discussion about this scene that Rio consented to wearing the cock ring and chastity cage— although her cock was so engorged with blood and hard that getting the cage onto her was impossible, so the ring would have to do.</p><p>And speaking of rings…</p><p>“Eyes on me,” she demanded. Rio craned her neck to blink at her through her tears. “Good girl,” Agatha praised. “It’s time I ask you a <i>very</i> important question, baby, and I want a serious answer.”</p><p>“O-okay?” Rio said, confused.</p><p>Smirking, Agatha asked teasingly, “Will you marry me?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flitted down to the engagement ring adorning the older professor’s hand. “I think the ring on your finger already answers that question,” she replied.</p><p>“But you’re not wearing one… and I think we should change that.” She held out the cock ring. “I’d get down on one knee…” She climbed onto the bed, kneeling behind her and palming her ass with her free hand. “But I think you prefer this kind, hmm?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened the pretty blush decorating her cheeks spread down her body. “<i>Mierda</i>,” she muttered.</p><p>“I need an answer, Rio.”</p><p>“Yes,” she whispered. “Yes, I’ll marry you… and I’ll wear your ring.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her shoulder affectionately. “Good girl. Now stay very still, we don’t want to pinch anything, do we?”</p><p>The cock ring was silicone, and stretched just enough when pulled apart with force that Agatha was able to slip it down Rio’s length and then gently pull her balls through, so that when she released it, it constricted around the base of her cock.</p><p>It wouldn’t cut off circulation completely, but it would keep her cock plump and full of blood; she would find it extremely hard to come without some extraordinary stimulation.</p><p>Rio’s restrained, drooling cock twitched helplessly as Agatha fondled it like a play toy. She chuckled darkly at how stiff she was, knowing that she would remain that way for the rest of the evening until Agatha finally allowed her to come.</p><p>“I think it’s time I fuck you, darling, don’t you?” she drawled, twisting her wrist with every downwards stroke towards her tip. “Ten years in the making, this day. Last time we were in Copenhagen… in this very hotel, actually, I told you that if I had my cock, you’d be the one about to take it in your cunt.”</p><p>“And you said next time,” Rio mumbled.</p><p>Yes, she had. While knowing that she wasn’t planning on there being a next time. And then she had walked out on Rio, leaving her to wake up alone in that cold hotel bed the next morning. Agatha had suppressed and buried her guilt about her actions for years.</p><p>After she had decided to stop searching for Rio, it had festered away inside of her like an infected wound. That scar only beginning to heal after Rio took her position at Salem, and Agatha had the chance to apologize. It had been a short apology, curt and stilted, but it had been so immensely relieving.</p><p>“I made you wait for so long, didn’t I, darling?” she crooned. “And today… you’ve been anticipating this moment since this morning, haven’t you? So patient. So obedient. Like a loyal border collie, so eager to please. Can you forgive me, for teasing you at the restaurant?” Gripping onto the anal plug, Agatha slowly began to pull, extracting it. “Color, baby?”</p><p>“Oh fuck,” Rio squeaked. “Yes, I forgive you, green. Please, <i>please</i>, fuck me.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and pushed the plug back in, angling it so that it stroked against Rio’s walls. A strangled sound emerged from Rio’s chest, her thighs trembling.</p><p>Agatha was light-headed with exhilaration, riding the high of holding Rio’s reins. It was additive, fucking her with the plug and listening to the squelch of the lube stuffed inside of her. When it popped free, the lube began to dribble out of Rio’s winking brown star.</p><p>“Oh, sweetheart, you’re so wet for me,” Agatha moaned.</p><p>She fingered the lube back inside with two fingers in casual ownership, curling them upwards. Rio shook from head to toe, face buried in the pillow.</p><p>“Fuck, I need to be inside of you.” Licking her lips, she notched the head of her spit-slick strap at Rio’s entrance, prodding gently. “Just <i>relax</i>, <i>gatita</i>. Let me use you, and Daddy’s gonna give you what you need, gonna give you a big fuckin’ load in your tight pussy.”</p><p>Rio moaned so loudly at that, Agatha was sure that the hotel guests on either side of their room… and probably above and below as well, would be able to figure out exactly what they were doing.</p><p>“You like that?” she purred.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio croaked. “Wouldn’t have pegged you for someone with a daddy kink.”</p><p>“I think you’ll find I’m the one doing the pegging tonight, sweetheart.”</p><p>Suddenly, she wanted to fuck Rio so roughly that she would start to cry and scream, so that Agatha could smother her with a pillow to shut her up.</p><p>“Relax,” she reminded her softly, and then, spreading Rio’s cheeks, she pushed forward, breaching the tight muscles of Rio’s ass with her strap.</p><p>Rio’s ass was <i>greedy</i>, and swallowed the first few inches of her strap effortlessly, the saliva and lube easing her entry. She petted over Rio’s ass as she slowly thrust into her, and gave her asscheeks little slaps, so that the gentle burn would ease the discomfort of her being stuffed.</p><p>Rio began to choke, shuddering and murmuring in a slurred voice, “<i>Mierda, eres tan grande</i>.” <i>Shit, you’re so big.</i></p><p>When Agatha finally sank in to the hilt, stroking up and down her spine possessively and brushing her fingers over her collar, Rio started to whimper uncontrollably. Her head was tilted to the side, resting against the pillow as she panted frantically.</p><p>There were already tears welling in her eyes, which were rolling back into her head. “<i>Dios mío, voy a morir, eres enorme.</i>” <i>Oh god, I’m going to die, you’re huge.</i></p><p>“Oh baby, am I too big for you?” Agatha laughed cruelly. She withdrew just an inch and slammed her hips forward, so that the head of the strap bumped against Rio’s prostate, which made her screech like a banshee, fingers clawing at the sheets. “Are you struggling to take Daddy’s cock, babygirl? This one’s a mold of your own… Can’t handle your own dick inside your girl hole?”</p><p>“<i>Daddy</i>,” Rio sobbed. Another brutal thrust of Agatha’s hips, skimming her strap’s tip over her fiancée’s prostate once again, triggered those tears to spill. “S’too big, daddy, please, I can’t.”</p><p>Fuck, that revved Agatha’s engines like an injection of pure adrenline in her veins. Gathering dripping lube that was being dislodged from Rio’s ass on her fingers, she briefly released her waist to rub it over her sensitive nipples.</p><p>“Too big? But this is a mold of <i>your</i> cock, cutie. I remember you bragging about taking seven and a half inches in your cunt, in the past, and I thought you were <i>only</i> seven inches. What are the tears for?”</p><p>“G-give me time to adjust, please,” Rio gasped, more tears pricking the corners of her eyes. “M’not used to something that big.”</p><p>“I take your cock up my ass no problem… you can dish it out, but you can't take it, huh?” Agatha sneered. “I thought you were gonna be an eager little slut for me.”</p><p>“I will, I will, I want to be. Green, I’m so green. But please, be gentle,” Rio begged.</p><p>“Oh, baby, but I don’t <i>want</i> to be gentle,” Agatha whispered, clenching her fingers into Rio’s hips in preparation of giving her a hard pounding. “And who said any of this is for <i>your</i> enjoyment? This is all for me, <i>gatita</i>. You told me you were gonna be a good girl for me… you said that you wanted me to use you to get off. So that’s what I’m gonna do.”</p><p>Agatha began to fuck her in a manner that could only be described as vicious, jacknifing her strap into her without mercy. The base of the strap rubbed up against her clit wonderfully, igniting sparks of pleasure that crackled through her body like lightning, energising her. Rio’s ass was stretched wide now, the muscles loosened enough for Agatha to plow into her much easier.</p><p>“Fuck, yeah, that’s it, baby, take my cock.”</p><p>“<i>Mierda</i>,” the younger woman whimpered. “Fuck—you’re— so huge, shit— feels <i>amazing</i>.”</p><p>There was the pain whore Agatha knew and loved. Agatha was a proud size king because she adored the challenge and the satisfaction of being filled to the brim; that sensation was often accompanied by the biting discomfort of being stretched so much that it felt as if she was being fisted (which Agatha also enjoyed).</p><p><i>Rio</i>, on the other hand, was a masochist through and through, deriving orgasmic euphoria from the pain.</p><p>“There we go, good fuckin’ girl,” she snarled. “Taking me so beautifully, yeah, keep milking my cock with your cunt just like that.”</p><p>Agatha dug her nails into Rio’s skin to leave crescent indents, scratching down her sides. Rio’s entire body was being rocked with each slam of Agatha’s hips, the bed shaking and banging up against the wall.</p><p>Rio’s poor restrained cock was flopping below her; hard as diamond because of the cock ring, it was so long that each thrust caused it to graze over the bed, her frenum piercing catching on the rumpled sheets.</p><p>It was clearly driving Rio absolutely insane from overstimulation, because Rio’s knees collapsed beneath her, so she was lying flat on the bed like a limp, wet noodle. Agatha’s strap slipped out of her with a wet slurp, and she was forced to climb up and over Rio’s legs, straddling the backs of her thighs, in order to shove back in. This new angle meant that Agatha could hunch over her fiancée, braced against her back, and put even more power behind her thrusts.</p><p>“Oh fuck, Agatha, fuck!” she cried out, sobbing hysterically. “Fuck, it’s so good, sir, keep going! Harder, please, <i>daddy</i>, harder!”</p><p>“Shut the fuck up!” Agatha barked, reaching over Rio’s back to grab a fistful of her sweat-slick short hair. She forced her face down onto the pillow to muffle her crying. “You’re distracting me with all your pathetic weeping.”</p><p>“Is it h-hard to concentrate ‘cus you’re so turned on by it?” Rio said hoarsely. A snort, muffled by the pillow, and then a muttered, “Dacryphiliac.”</p><p>Oh, so Rio wanted to be <i>smart</i> with her, huh? “I’ll show you hard, sweetheart,” Agatha hissed.</p><p>She jabbed her hips forward, angling down; at the same time as her strap spearing Rio so deeply that she struck her prostate head on, Agatha wrestled Rio’s arm behind her back to pin her down against the bed— wrenching her shoulder in the process.</p><p>Rio howled like a puppy whose tail got stepped on… but Agatha could see her ass clenching wildly around the girth of her strap, as she ground her hips down against the bed, desperate for stimulation on her cinched throbbing cock.</p><p>Snagging a handful of the younger woman’s hair with her spare hand, Agatha jerked her head up briefly to order her through gritted teeth, “You’re not allowed to say anything from now on except when you’re getting close, or to say your color or the safeword. <i>¿Entendido?</i>” <i>Understand?</i></p><p>“<i>Sí, sí, lo pillo</i>,” Rio gasped. “<i>Estoy verde. Voy a seguirle el juego.</i>” <i>I get it. I’m green. I’ll play along.</i></p><p>“Play along, huh? Now that’s an idea. Let’s play a game,” Agatha laughed. “It’s called, ‘an edge for every year of our relationship’.”</p><p>Rio released a sound that could only be described as one of gutteral horror. “<i>Puta madre</i>.”</p><p>“Shut it,” Agatha snapped, tugging on her hair punishingly.</p><p>Pumping into Rio, she abruptly stopped, then held perfectly still, buried to the hilt, as she released her hair… only to wrap her hand around her throat and drag her upwards, so that Rio was kneeling with her back pressed to the older woman’s front.</p><p>Her other hand drifted up from her hip to her nipples, plucking and pinching at them in a way that trigger Rio to writhe, which forced Agatha’s strap to slide even deeper inside of her. Agatha knew from the experience of having Rio’s cock up her ass that this angle would make Rio feel like she was about to burst at the seams.</p><p>Based on the shift in her breathing pattern, as it shallowed and became rapid and thready, and adding on the way her thigh muscles and cock were twitching, Agatha could sense that Rio was on the precipice of coming. She pulled out, until just the tip of her strap was inside Rio’s hole.</p><p>Rio cried out in disappointment.</p><p>“Oh, baby, did you think I was joking?” Agatha cooed. “I said an edge for every year. Do you know how to count? You’ve got four more to go, honey, before I even <i>consider</i> letting you come.”</p><p>She slapped her cock, hard enough that she knew it would sting. Rio squeaked, but she remained obediently silent otherwise, even as she began to cant her hips back, trying to desperately fuck herself.</p><p>“And I told you to fuckin’ tell me when you’re close,” she growled. “Now play the game properly, or you won’t get your reward at the end.”</p><p>Rio nodded shakily. Once Agatha was certain that she’d backed off that ledge and her need to come had died down, she began to fuck her again, grinding the strap up into her ass. She shoved her fiancée back down onto the bed to lie on the bed with her ass in the air, while Agatha lunged into her with abandon.</p><p>The strap base rubbing against her clit brought her to orgasm quickly, especially listening to Rio’s raspy little cries. “Oh <i>fuck, baby, fuck</i>,” she stuttered, half-collapsing as the sharp knife of pleasure stabbed into her lower belly and twisted. The powerful sensation sent her tumbling off the cliff of orgasmic delight, light flashing behind her eyes as her entire body felt fuzzy and floaty.</p><p>Exhaling, Agatha flipped her hair back over her shoulder. God, that was wonderful.</p><p>Her strap was half stuck inside Rio’s ass, and once she had calmed down enough, she picked up her pace again. A strained, overwhelmed noise ripped from Rio’s collared throat when Agatha trailed her fingers downwards and gently took hold of her cock— just grasping it tenderly, not squeezing or stroking or providing any other stimulation.</p><p>“Close,” Rio mumbled.</p><p>Just from Agatha touching her? She halted mid-thrust again, much to her fiancée’s frustration. “Good girl for telling me. God, I fucking love your cunt,” she murmured, spreading Rio’s cheeks to admire the sight of her ass clamping around her cock, covered in slick lube. “Look at you, such a greedy, stretched-out little hole. Glorious.” She wiggled one finger in alongside her strap, grinning when Rio wheezed pitifully, her ass clenching around the intrusion. “Fuck, baby, you’re gonna be such a sloppy mess after this, dripping with my load. I’ll fuckin’ plug it all up inside of you after I’m finished with you.”</p><p>This routine repeated twice more. Agatha would fuck into Rio brutally, at a hard but leisurely pace, bringing herself to orgasm and moaning loudly about loading her up with cum; she enjoyed watching the younger woman struggle and tremble and silently plead to come using just her body language.</p><p>Whenever Rio got close and told Agatha so, she would cease all movement and wait until she was no longer on the verge of orgasm before starting to fuck her again. It brought her immense joy to listen to the younger woman’s frantic whimpers and stifled needy sobs, especially when Rio tried to quiet herself by covering her mouth with her hand.</p><p>For the very last edge, Agatha wanted a fresh view. She pulled out of Rio completely, spanking her ass roughly when she whined in protest.</p><p>“Roll over,” she commanded huskily. “On your back. I wanna look into your eyes as I edge you one final time, before I finally let you come. I wanna see my pretty girl squirt all over her stomach and paint me a masterpiece.”</p><p>As Rio slowly pushed herself on the bed, panting, to roll over onto her back, Agatha slipped off the mattress to snag her tie, abandoned on the floor. She could have gagged her with it earlier, or used it to tie her to the bed, but she had a better idea for it.</p><p>When she clambered back up, Agatha raked her gaze hungrily over the younger woman. Rio was lying supine, legs spread to allow Agatha to kneel between them, her hard cock curving up towards her belly.</p><p>“Who do you belong to, baby?” Agatha rasped, measuring her strap over Rio’s stomach. It reached up to her belly button, and spread slick all over her abdomen. “Who owns your pretty cock, your sweet tight little hole? Whose collar do you wear? Whose toy are you, to play with, and break, and put back together and again? Who decides when you get to come? Who gets to decide if you’ve <i>earned</i> the right to orgasm?”</p><p>“You,” Rio whimpered. “You, Agatha, you, I’m yours.”</p><p>“Mm, not what I want to hear. What’s my name?” Agatha prompted.</p><p>“Sir.”</p><p>“Wrong again. That’s your second strike, <i>mocosa</i>, better not get a third. Three strikes and you’re out. And <i>I’ll</i> pull out before you come.”</p><p>Rio exhaled shakily. “<i>Daddy.</i>”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t resist kissing Rio when she was so beautifully flushed and limp and submissive, blinking blearily at her as if she was a goddess to be worshipped. She leaned forward, hands braced above Rio’s shoulders, to gently press her lips to hers.</p><p>“Good girl,” she murmured against her mouth. “Such a sweet obedient pet. So well trained. God, fuck, I love you, <i>amorcita</i>. You’re nearly there, just one more edge for Daddy and I’ll make you feel so good. One more, and I’ll fill your pussy with cum like you want.”</p><p>Rio was pliant beneath her, parting her lips obediently when Agatha pressed against them with her tongue. She only got fussy once Agatha withdrew, leaving her lips kiss-swollen and sensitive, with her strap poking at Rio’s thigh.</p><p>“Ah! Did I say you could touch me? No. Hands above your head,” she ordered tersely, when Rio attempted to be sneaky and cop a feel of her breasts, skimming her thumbs over her pert nipples.</p><p>Rio looked lost. So lost that Agatha’s words went in one ear and out the other, because she didn’t stop, which ultimately resulted in Agatha smacking her hands away with a growl. “But—” she said feebly.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked up from where she was fiddling with the tie in her hands, glaring at her. “<i>But?</i>” she repeated in a low, dangerous tone. “Did you just say but? To <i>me?</i>” Her eyes wide, Rio shook her head, raising her hands and fisting the sheets above her. “That’s what I thought. My sweet girl would <i>never</i> backtalk me, would she?”</p><p>Rio shook her head again, more urgently this time. “<i>Verde</i>,” she whispered, already anticipating what Agatha’s next question would likely be. <i>Green</i>.</p><p>She rested her strap on top of Rio’s swollen, almost purple dick, which was still achingly stiff and dripping despite all of the painful edges she’d suffered through. The tip of her strap brushed up against Rio’s shiny, raw, weeping cockhead, triggering a tiny little splurt of pre-cum to escape.</p><p>“Gonna make our cocks kiss, baby,” she purred, reaching up to caress Rio’s torso, down her sternum and then to her stomach, nails scoring thin red lines over her skin. “Tie them together with a pretty bow.”</p><p>She wrapped the tie around their lengths, loose enough that she would be able to thrust, but tight enough that she wouldn’t have to worry about the loops of fabric coming loose. Rocking her hips forward, she began to jerk their cocks off inside of the silk tie’s bindings— all while using her spare hand to slide her four fingers inside Rio’s hot ass.</p><p>They were gobbled up by her greedy ass easily, and soon her hand was stuffed inside all the way up to her knuckles, her thumb tucked out of the way. If she were feeling particularly sadistic, she would have forced her entire fist inside of her, but given how Rio was already seizing on the bed with a strangled yowl, she reckoned that might be going too far.</p><p>“Much better than a sock, isn’t it? Are you gonna come for me, <i>amorcita</i>?” Agatha said teasingly. “You gonna come for Daddy? While I’ve got nearly my whole hand up your pussy and our cocks are having a sweet little make-out session? Filthy girl, getting my tie all dirty and nasty. Should I make you suck your cum out of it later, like the pillow earlier? Would you like that, being forced to lick up your mess?”</p><p>When Agatha curled her fingertips up to press against her prostate, simulatuously gliding her strap up against Rio’s restrained cock inside their silk prison, Rio yelled, “<i>Estoy por acabar</i>,” in a broken voice, her eyes screwed shut. <i>I’m about to come.</i></p><p>Not on her watch. Agatha withdrew her fingers instantly, and unwound the tie to lift her strap off of Rio’s cock as well. Her orgasm ruined and stolen from her for the <i>fifth</i> time, Rio turned her head to scream into a pillow in frustration.</p><p>She tore at the sheets with such force that the fabric ripped. She tried to wrap her legs around Agatha to cage her in, which failed, promptly triggering her to slam her fist on the mattress as tears flooded down her face.</p><p>“Color?” she asked calmly.</p><p>“You’re so mean.”</p><p>“Do you mean green?”</p><p>“<i>¡A la mierda! El más verde</i>,” Rio spat at her through her sobs. <i>Fuck it! The greenest.</i></p><p>It was as close to a crash out as Agatha had ever seen from her fiancée. Waiting patiently for her to calm down, because she knew she would, Agatha sat back on her haunches, content to watch Rio’s chest heave as she threw her little tantrum. She ran the tie between her fingers in the meantime, smirking when she spotted an opaque stain on it from Rio’s pre-cum.</p><p>“Speak,” she ordered, when her fiancée mewled.</p><p>Sniffling, Rio pouted at her through her tears. “Please may I come now, sir?” she asked in a gurgling voice.</p><p>Agatha stroked over her abs, fingers brushing over her rock-hard cock, purring, “Do you think you’ve earned it, baby?” When Rio hesitated to answer, clearly unsure what she wanted to hear, Agatha pressed, “You survived all five edges, didn’t you? With very minimal complaining. And you cried so adorably while I had my cock and fingers stuffed inside your pretty girl hole. You were a good girl for me, were you not, <i>gatita</i>?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replied shyly, her dick twitching against her belly. “I was a good girl. I’ve… I’ve earned it, Daddy.”</p><p>Oh, she was adorable when she was so bashful and meek, all red tear-stained cheeks and lowered puffy eyes, and oh-so-willing to do anything to please her.</p><p>Normally? Agatha would take advantage of Rio’s increased sensitivity after what had now been nearly an hour of edging to overstimulate her to the point of forcing an orgasm, dragging it from her trembling, exhausted body.</p><p>Smiling at her, Agatha slid her strap all the way inside of her until she was seated deep within her, pressed up against her prostate firmly. She leaned up and over Rio’s torso to capture her lips in a gentle kiss. “You can come, my love,” she whispered, fingers wrapping around her cock— not to apply any pressure, but simply to help her aim.</p><p>A single thrust angled up so that the strap’s tip struck Rio’s prostate triggered her to erupt immediately, a choked sob bursting free from her lips. She shook with the intensity of her orgasm, it likely being immensely more powerful than usual due to the cock ring.</p><p>White ropes of cock streaked her stomach and chest and even a couple hit her chin, painting her collar. She looked so utterly stunning, falling to bits beneath Agatha as ecstasy slammed into her like a freight train.</p><p>The constant bashing of Agatha’s strap into her prostate had another unexpected consequence.</p><p>Shortly after finishing, Rio slumped, boneless, her eyelids fluttering. She was in such deep subspace that she was barely conscious, and as Agatha blanketed her body protectively to help her feel safe and secure… wet warmth began to spread between their bodies.</p><p>Rio whimpered, squirming; Agatha shushed her and stroked her fingers through her hair, soothing the younger woman as she involuntarily began to piss herself, drenching their lower halves.</p><p>Agatha was no stranger to wetting herself during sex— she had done it many times— but it was a very rare occurrence for Rio. It only ever happened when her prostate was bruised and she was completely wrung out after sex, relaxed and high on the endorphins.</p><p>But Agatha had anticipated something like this happening, because it was more likely to occur after Rio was pegged. She’d found a waterproof covering in the hotel room closet and put it behind the sheets while Rio was showering earlier before dinner. She’d requested extra sheets and blankets from housekeeping as well, bribing them to keep them quiet. There was already a laundry bag hidden in the bathroom cabinet for the dirty bedding, and a towel tucked beneath the bed to clean them up.</p><p>Eventually, when Rio’s cock was left shriveled and soft against her thigh, she began to softly cry again, hands covering her face. She cringed when Agatha gently removed the cock ring from her wilted length and balls, releasing a pathetic sound.</p><p>“Oh, <i>mi amor</i>. Are you embarrassed?” Agatha tsked, patting her thigh sympathetically. “It’s okay. You couldn’t help it, I just fucked you too good. If it makes you feel better, I can sit on your face and piss myself too. Would you like that?”</p><p>Rio just whined, still trying to hide behind her hands, mortified. Her heart so full that it hurt, Agatha nudged them away so she could kiss her again in awe, plastering little kisses all over her face and neck.</p><p>“God, don’t feel self-conscious, baby, that was fucking magnificent,” she murmured. “Fuck, Rio, that was so hot. Look at you, all sticky and wet with your own piss and seed.”</p><p>She dragged her fingers over her sternum, collecting some strands of cum on them and offering them. Rio sucked them into her mouth without a second’s hesitatation, tongue swirling around them to lick them clean.</p><p>Agatha continued to feed Rio her own spend until there was only traces of it left— and she desperately wanted a taste of it herself, so bend her head to lick broad stripes over her chest and stomach, rumbling in appreciation as the last salty, musky drops hit her tongue.</p><p>“Good girl, such a good little wife for me. I love you so much, baby.”</p><p>Rio was too fucked out to respond verbally, but she blinked slowly at Agatha like a cat silently showing affection. Four times. And Agatha understood instantly what she meant.</p><p><i>I.        Love.     You.       Too.</i></p><p>When Agatha began to pull out, Rio clung onto her, moaning as she shook her head. Agatha knew all too well that the sudden sensation of being empty was one that was uncomfortable and disconcerting.</p><p>Agatha remained buried inside of her as she slowly began to unclip the harness from around her waist, leaving the strap inside of Rio’s ass as she withdrew. She ducked down to lean over the side of the bed and scoop up the towel beneath, using it to delicately wipe them both off and absorb the majority of the remaining liquid.</p><p>She was extremely close to coming again herself. All it took was half a minute of her straddling Rio’s thigh and grinding her soaking wet, swollen cunt against her heated skin for her orgasm to rush through her, tingling heat surging through her veins.</p><p>“Shit,” she sighed, rolling off Rio and collapsing at her side. She kept one arm draped over her belly, knowing that her touch would help her feel grounded in her post-coital state. “I knew the engagement celebratory sex would be amazing, but I think it actually broke something in my brain.”</p><p>“I think you broke <i>me</i>,” Rio murmured, eyes closed. She tried to move, but hissed when it caused her red raw cock to bounce on her thigh. “Fuck, and Rhodes too.”</p><p>“He’ll recover,” Agatha chuckled. She kissed her future wife’s shoulder and then sat up, swinging her legs off the bed. “Shall we keep with tradition and take some lovely photos to remember the occasion by?”</p><p>Rio shuddered. “Fuck yes.”</p><p>Crossing the room and digging through Rio’s bag, Agatha returned with the Polaroid camera (having used a wet wipe on her hands to clean them before handling it). Tongue sticking out in concentration, she arranged Rio artfully on her side with her knees tucked up, her soft cock arranged to lie up against her belly. Rio peered up at the lens with half-lidded, dazed eyes, looking beautifully flushed and fucked out, surrounded by her mess.</p><p>A few photos from behind followed, of Agatha’s hand possessively grabbing her ass, spreading her cheeks apart to expose her strap-stuffed asshole. She slid the strap out ever so slightly to show the girth of it, hand wrapped around the exposed length to show thick it was and how it stretched open Rio’s hole, before Agatha slipped it back inside.</p><p>A couple more photos were taken selfie-style, of her curled up next to Rio, and also with her draped over her lap— Agatha’s hand splayed over her throat, showing off the collar, while holding her cock.</p><p>Once the photoshoot was over, Agatha set the camera aside safely and stroked through her girlfriend’s hair, smiling at how Rio arched her head into her touch, like a border collie begging for attention.</p><p>Unbuckling the collar, she carefully removed it, and set it aside on the bedside table, admiring the faint pink ring left around her girlfriend’s throat.</p><p>“No, keep it on,” Rio tried to protest, her voice weak and feeble, but Agatha shushed her gently.</p><p>“Let’s get you to the shower to wash off, honey. Do you need some help walking?”</p><p>“Your strap’s still inside me,” Rio rasped.</p><p>“So that’s a yes.”</p><p>“Carry me?”</p><p>“Sweetheart, I can barely feel my legs myself, you’ll end up on the floor if I try. Let’s just take it slow together, hm?”</p><p>They made the journey to the bathroom, with Rio hobbling along, half her weight leaning on Agatha. The strap slipped free from her asshole with a wicked squelching sound, and she carried it along with the harness over her arm as they trekked to the shower at a snail’s pace.</p><p>They took their time going to the toilet and cleaning each other thoroughly; Agatha supported Rio when her legs nearly gave out beneath her, aiding her in washing her hair when she was too sore to lift her arms.</p><p>While Rio was sitting on the toilet seat swallowing down the pills she would need with one of the little bathroom water glasses, Agatha stripped and remade the bed with fresh, clean sheets. All the dirty ones were dumped in the laundry hamper, which was sealed closed and left by the door.</p><p>Once they were back in bed, they curled up together, hydrating by drinking from water bottles and snacking on candy to get their sugar levels back up. All Rio really wanted for her aftercare was to be held and reassured that she did well, and Agatha was content to give her all the cuddles she wanted.</p><p>Rio started to laugh under her breath, prompting Agatha to glance at her, raising an eyebrow. “Care to tell me what’s so funny?”</p><p>“People are gonna want to know our engagement story when we get back to Salem,” Rio said, amused. “I was just thinking it would probably be for the best if we just told them we went for a romantic dinner after, and omitted everything else.”</p><p>“Oh, you don’t want the senior facility to hear all about you taking it up the ass on our engagement night and anniversary?” Agatha said sarcastically. “For shame, Rio, do you have no <i>pride</i> in our beautiful love story?”</p><p>“Too much, I think.” She turned her face into Agatha’s shoulder, snuggling up against her. “Today was just for us. Don’t need or want anybody else to hear about it. This night is ours.”</p><p>“Ours,” Agatha echoed quietly, twirling her engagement ring around her finger. She placed that hand over Rio’s heart, so her ring rested directly over it. “Mine.”</p><p>“Yours,” Rio agreed. She nuzzled her skin, kissing her arm sleepily. She was beginning to fade, her energy depleted. “<i>Ahora y para siempre nos pertenecemos la una a la otra</i>.” <i>Now and forever, we belong to each other.</i></p><p>“<i>Juntos</i>,” Agatha corrected. <i>Together.</i></p><p>Rio was asleep within minutes, snoring silently.</p><p>Agatha remained coiled up by her side, watching her slumber peacefully. She stroked her thumb over her future wife’s cheeks, and her finger down her nose.</p><p><i>Future wife.</i></p><p>And to think… ten years ago, near enough to the exact day, she had abandoned Rio alone in a cold bed, in this very hotel, after a night of intense passion, jumping on a plane and planning to never contact her again.</p><p>Thinking that it would be better for the both of them, if they were to part ways and never see each other again.</p><p>Now, she was engaged to the woman with the shining copper eyes, a cheeky crooked grin, and smile lines that made her look like sunshine incarnate, whom she had walked out on.</p><p>And now…</p><p>Now Agatha couldn’t imagine herself anywhere else except right here. Lying in bed with Rio beside her, and a ring on her finger that featured their matching birthstones, along with their dear beloved lost son’s.</p><p>An engagement ring. A promise.</p><p>To spend the rest of their lives together.</p><p>Never parted again.</p><p>And to think… None of this ever would have happened if Rio hadn’t been courageous enough to raise her hand and voice after Agatha’s keynote speech and issue a challenge, disagreeing with her using an argument based on stupid folklore stories and conspiracies.</p><p>And yet… those stupid folklore stories and conspiracy theories brought her Rio Vidal.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut and she crawled under the blankets and onto her fiancée, head pillowed on her chest and ear resting over her heart; the faint, rhythmic <i>thump thump, thump thump</i> of her future wife’s heartbeat was the most comforting lullaby, lulling her to sleep.</p><p>One last thought drifted through her mind before the darkness overtook her:</p><p>Thank God for the Asgardians.</p>
