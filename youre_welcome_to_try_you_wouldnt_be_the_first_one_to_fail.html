<div class="userstuff">
<p>“If you moved any slower we’d need a hearse,” Rio hears from across the staff break room. She doesn’t have to look to know who said it. The words and the voice belong to Agatha Harkness, one of the special ed teachers. Rio has never had a confrontation with her directly – Agatha doesn’t usually use the staff break room and their classrooms are on opposite sides of the building – but she’s heard enough insults thrown around to know who’s speaking.</p><p>“Just go around him,” someone else says.</p><p>“I would if your ass wasn’t blocking the way,” Agatha snarls.</p><p>Rio’s eyes go wide and she bites her cheek to keep from saying something. She can’t imagine being so rude to anyone, let alone an elderly gentleman that teaches children for a living.</p><p>“If your mother wasn’t superint—”</p><p>“Move!” Agatha barks, and Rio glances over out of the corner of her eye in time to see Agatha actually shove the woman aside and step around the older gentleman, knocking his mug out of the way so she can fill her own with coffee. “I don’t have time for this shit.”</p><p>Rio’s secondhand embarrassment flares hot and she’s humiliated on Agatha’s behalf.</p><p>Fortunately, Agatha leaves the break room as soon as her mug is full.</p><p>Nobody even says anything about it, they all just act like nothing happened and go back to whatever they were doing. Well, fine. If they don’t want to stand up for themselves, Rio isn’t going to do it for them. She likes her job.</p><p>She does idly wonder why Agatha suddenly needed coffee from the staff break room, though. It’s the first time all year she’s seen that happen. Maybe the bitch got banned from every coffee shop in a ten-mile radius.</p><p>That thought makes Rio intensely amused. She tries not to think about how satisfying it would be to slap Agatha Harkness across the face. That road would only lead to her own ruin, she’s sure.</p><p>--</p><p>The next morning, Agatha’s in the staff break room again. Rio is grading some papers before school starts, and she gasps as creamer splashes onto her hand and her work. Thank God it wasn’t hot coffee.</p><p>“Shit,” she says, reaching for a napkin and trying in vain to save the math test she was marking. But it’s too soggy and the paper just rips when she swipes the napkin over it to dry it off. “Shit!” she says again. “Who the fuck--?” But of course there’s only one person in the entire school that would spill creamer on someone’s papers and not apologize, so she knows exactly who she’ll see when she looks up.</p><p>Agatha is stirring the creamer into her coffee and doesn’t even glance at Rio on her way out the door.</p><p>Rio is half tempted to go after her but ultimately it wouldn’t be worth it. She knows Agatha heard her cuss, despite the lack of response.</p><p>--</p><p>The first all-staff meeting of the year is on a Friday afternoon in mid-October. Rio is seated next to one of the teachers she gets along with, and they’re talking quietly when the principal calls the meeting to order.</p><p>He gives the welcome back speech, cliched and unoriginal, and Rio’s head snaps toward the back of the room when she hears fake snoring.</p><p>Instead of reprimanding Agatha, the principal just laughs. “I think Mrs. Harkness is trying to tell me my speech is boring,” he says jovially.</p><p>“<em>Ms</em>. Harkness,” Agatha says icily. “And yes, it is.”</p><p>He laughs again, as if she’s the funniest asshole in the world. “All right, moving on, then. Good idea, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>Rio almost throws up in her mouth. The nepotism in school districts is revolting.</p><p>“We have some new faces this year, so why don’t those of you new to the school introduce yourselves and tell us what grade you teach,” the principal goes on.</p><p>Rio hates being in the spotlight.</p><p>Luckily, someone else goes first. Agatha interrupts before the woman is finished saying her last name.</p><p>“I didn’t come here for a meet and greet,” Agatha says. “If you’ll excuse me, I have better things to do with my time.” She nudges past the people between her and the doors.</p><p>When she hears the doors click, Rio speaks up. “Someone should really teach her some manners.”</p><p>The principal’s face is stricken.</p><p>“You’re welcome to try,” Rio hears from behind her.</p><p>Her face burns hotter than the flames of hell and she doesn’t dare turn around. The doors must have clicked because someone else came in, not because Agatha was all the way out.</p><p>“You wouldn’t be the first one to fail.”</p><p>The doors click again and Rio wishes she could literally disappear. <em>Everyone</em> is staring at her.</p><p>--</p><p>The next morning, Rio’s a nervous wreck. Agatha, of course, doesn’t show up in the break room. So Rio has to go to Agatha’s classroom if she wants to find out whether she still has a job.</p><p>The sounds of screaming reach her ears well before she gets to the classroom door. She cracks it open and peers inside, eyes scanning the room. When her gaze lands on Agatha, her breath catches at the sight.</p><p>Amidst the chaos of running, screaming, and flying objects being managed by the aides in the room, Agatha is sitting on the floor bouncing a little boy on her knee, singing the ABCs with a smile on her face. The boy isn’t singing along, but he’s clapping to his own rhythm and squealing with obvious delight, and Rio’s eyes prick with tears.</p><p>When the song is over, Agatha sets him gently on the floor and gets up, brushing off her pants. When she sees Rio her face completely closes off, eyes narrowing, jaw clenching, and she strides to the door and snaps. “What do you want?”</p><p>The sudden change is jarring at best and leaves Rio stuttering. “I—I—I was—”</p><p>“Spit it out, I don’t have all day!”</p><p>Rio blinks, unable to believe that someone so gentle with children could be so abrasive and heartless with others, but the evidence is literally staring her in the face and ringing in her ears. “Are you going to have me fired?” she finally blurts out.</p><p>Agatha’s face is unreadable except for disdain. “You think your opinion means enough to me to have my mother fire you? Get out.”</p><p>Obviously used to being instantly obeyed without question, Agatha turns away to go back to her students.</p><p>“Hang on,” Rio says, leaning on the door frame.</p><p>Agatha turns back around, eyes slightly wide. “Get out of my classroom,” she repeats.</p><p>“You said I’m welcome to try.”</p><p>The briefest, most microscopic flash of surprise lights on Agatha’s face before the scowl overtakes it once more. “I say a lot of things.” She lowers her voice and leans closer. “Get the <em>fuck</em> out of my classroom.”</p><p>Rio’s irritation brushes the edge of her tolerance. “No,” she says, tilting her head, regarding Agatha coolly.</p><p>Agatha reaches out with the clear intent to shove her, and the moment hands make contact with her shoulders, Rio snatches Agatha by the wrists and pulls her out into the hallway, using their natural momentum to her advantage.</p><p>Fuming, Agatha shakes free of Rio’s grip. “Don’t you dare fucking touch me,” she downright hisses.</p><p>“Lay a hand on me again,” Rio says calmly. “You’ll get the same result.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t appear to know what to do with that response and she growls, retreating back into the classroom and slamming the door.</p><p>Rio’s had enough and she figures what she’s already done is cause for Agatha to get her fired, so why not push it? She opens the door and steps inside, aware of all the aides’ eyes on her, and she can practically feel the hair on the back of Agatha’s neck stand up at her audacity to come back into the room.</p><p>Agatha is stopped a few steps away from the door and Rio calmly walks up behind her without touching her. “The <em>right</em> way to end an interaction is to say goodbye and hold the door open while the guest leaves,” she whispers.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t move a muscle.</p><p>“I’m not naïve enough to think that’s what I’m going to get, but you <em>will</em> let me leave of my own accord.”</p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha breathes, barely audible.</p><p>But she doesn’t move.</p><p>Rio counts it as a victory and turns, leaving the classroom, shutting the door at a normal volume behind her.</p><p>--</p><p>At the end of the day, she almost runs straight into Agatha on her way out of her classroom, not expecting anyone to be blocking the doorway when she pulls open the door.</p><p>Agatha looks agitated, but in a different way than her usual resting bitch face. “You really want to try?”</p><p>Rio gets the impression that Agatha isn’t actually sure she wants to be asking. “Do you want me to try?”</p><p>“Do you always ask stupid questions?”</p><p>Rio doesn’t miss a beat. “It’s a perfectly valid question. Answer it.”</p><p>“I’ll enjoy watching you fail.”</p><p>The sneer on Agatha’s face only hardens Rio’s resolve. “What makes you so sure I’ll fail? I’ve got you at <em>my</em> classroom after school.”</p><p>The sneer darkens to a storm and Agatha snarls like a wounded animal, turns and walks away.</p><p>Rio counts it as another victory.</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha is sitting on the hood of her car when she approaches. She ignores the other woman and unlocks the doors, opening the driver’s side.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha says, sliding off the car onto her feet. “Don’t fucking ignore people. It’s rude.”</p><p>“What’s <em>rude</em> is cutting in the coffee line because you think your time is more important than everyone else’s. What’s <em>rude</em> is telling another teacher her ass is blocking the way. What’s <em>rude</em> is commandeering a staff meeting and then walking out in the middle of it. What’s <em>rude</em> is—”</p><p>“Blah, blah, blah,” Agatha interrupts.</p><p>Rio continues, undaunted. “What’s <em>rude</em> is interrupting. Stop doing it.”</p><p>“Or what, you’ll spank me?”</p><p>Rio laughs. “Why would I reward you for being rude?”</p><p>“<em>Reward</em>?”</p><p>“You’re not mysterious, Agatha. You’re the most disrespectful, hateful person I’ve ever had the displeasure of working with, but you’re not mysterious. Good night.”</p><p>She gets in the car, but when she tries to shut the door, Agatha’s hand wrapped around the top of it prevents her. She’s about to be annoyed, but when she looks up, something shifts at the expression on Agatha’s face. It’s still unreadable, but there’s an undercurrent of longing behind whatever’s clouding her eyes.</p><p>“What do you <em>want</em>?” she finally asks, trying not to sound exasperated.</p><p>The longing vanishes and the cloudiness in Agatha’s eyes turns sharp again. “Absolutely nothing,” she spits.</p><p>It’s getting old, the back and forth. “Agatha,” she says.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha mocks.</p><p>Whatever she had been planning to say is knocked out by the fact that Agatha knows her name. “Get in the car.”</p><p>“Make me.”</p><p>Rio pops the trunk. “What’s your safeword?”</p><p>She sees Agatha’s eyes dart briefly toward the sound of the trunk popping. “You’re the one that’s going to need a safeword.”</p><p>“Mine is witch,” Rio says without hesitation. “What’s yours?” She can tell Agatha doesn’t have one yet.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes burn into hers, and just when Rio thinks she’s going to walk away, she answers. “Witch killer.”</p><p>She doesn’t let it show on her face, but that hits Rio in all the right places. Witch killer? Honestly? What a sarcastic asshole. The entire interaction is lighting a fire deep inside, where the darkest parts of her are buried. “Do you know how to use it?”</p><p>“You’re about to find out if you don’t get less boring,” Agatha sneers.</p><p>Rio is unimpressed. “Do you know how to use it?” she repeats.</p><p>“You’re so fucking stupid,” Agatha says and walks away.</p><p>It’s obvious she expects Rio to follow her; to do something. The only thing Rio is going to do without a serious answer to her question is drive herself home. She shuts the car door and starts the engine.</p><p>Agatha spins around in a fury, stalking back to the car and wrenching the door open.</p><p>Rio allows it because she’s not going to get into a physical battle with Agatha until she gets confirmation that Agatha knows how to use a safeword.</p><p>Agatha reaches for her and Rio slams the car into reverse, backing up just enough for the door to knock Agatha on her ass.</p><p>“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Agatha shrieks, shooting back to her feet, but, Rio notes, placing herself out of reach of the car door should Rio back up any further.</p><p>Rio shuts the door and Agatha jerks it open again, screaming at her.</p><p>“Yes! Fuck! I know how to use a goddamn fucking piece of shit fucking safeword!”</p><p>Rio is out of the car in under two seconds, slamming her shoulder into Agatha’s hips and lifting her easily like a sack of potatoes.</p><p>Agatha goes feral, snarling and kicking and scratching, and she gets one good slice with her fingernails before Rio’s at the trunk and literally throws her into it.</p><p>“What the FUCK are you—”</p><p>Rio shuts the trunk, and when she’s out of Agatha’s sight, she slumps over the back of the car, sucking in a calming breath.</p><p>Agatha is pounding on the trunk, probably kicking it as well, and calling Rio every name in the book.</p><p>Rio takes her time calming down and then drives to her house, backs into the garage, and shuts the garage door. She goes inside and brings out a chair, setting it next to the trunk, and sits. “The most basic manners of all are please and thank you. We’ll start with please.”</p><p>“Fuck you, you goddamn lunatic! Let me out of this trunk or I’ll wring your fucking neck!”</p><p>Unbothered, Rio informs Agatha of the situation. “I’m sitting on a chair in the garage, but I can easily go inside and get a book to read while I wait. I’m a very patient person and you’re not getting out of that trunk until you say please.”</p><p>“Eat a cock!”</p><p>“You won’t hear another sound from me, but I’ll be here waiting.”</p><p>“You can wait ‘til your tits fall off for all I care! You’re not getting shit from me.”</p><p>True to her word, Rio doesn’t answer.</p><p>She doesn’t answer any of Agatha’s insults. And they go on for a long, long time.</p><p>It’s been two hours, and Agatha changes her angle of attack. “I have to go to the bathroom.”</p><p>Rio smirks to herself but doesn’t respond out loud.</p><p>“Did you hear me? I said I have to go to the fucking bathroom!” Agatha yells.</p><p>Rio opens up a game on her phone and starts playing while she waits. She has no doubt that Agatha will say please, she just doesn’t know when.</p><p>Three hours later, Agatha has been quiet for about a half hour, and Rio wonders if she’s asleep. But then a sudden, desperate banging rings out accompanied by the shouted word.</p><p>“<em>Please</em>!”</p><p>She reaches over and opens the trunk.</p><p>Agatha climbs out and runs her fingers through her sweaty hair, and then promptly tackles Rio out of the chair, screaming in her face, and spits at her.</p><p>The cement under her back makes her grunt in pain, and when Agatha spits at her she turns her face so it lands on her cheek and easily maneuvers out from under the enraged woman. She grabs Agatha by the hair and the waist of her pants and hauls her back into the trunk, slamming it shut.</p><p>She wipes the spit from her cheek with her sleeve and sits back in the chair, breathing hard, a little pissed off, and more determined than ever. “Since you decided to assault me, now we can add saying sorry to the basic manners we’re learning tonight. Unless you’d like to sleep in my trunk.”</p><p>Agatha is screaming and kicking at the car and issuing threats that make Rio’s blood boil, but she doesn’t respond.</p><p>“I’ll slit your fucking throat! Open the goddamn trunk!”</p><p>Rio goes back to her game. She’s actually won twenty bucks playing solitaire. She’ll have to thank Agatha later.</p><p>It’s one o’clock in the morning before Agatha apologizes. And it’s the most insincere thing Rio has ever heard in her life.</p><p>“I’m so terribly sorry, Your Highness,” Agatha says with an umpteenth kick to Rio’s car.</p><p>“That takes care of saying sorry. You still need to say please if you want out of the trunk. And if you put your hands on me again you won’t get a third chance.”</p><p>It’s stone silent for several long, tense minutes. Then Rio hears, “my legs are cramping.”</p><p>“Then stop kicking my car.”</p><p>“I can’t stretch out in here.”</p><p>“Then use your newly acquired manners to get out.”</p><p>She hears a grating sigh and prepares for anything.</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>It hits her in the cunt and she squeezes her thighs together, but she’s not done pushing. “Please what?”</p><p>“Oh come on!”</p><p>Another kick.</p><p>Another few minutes of tense silence.</p><p>“Please let me out.”</p><p>When Rio opens the trunk, Agatha sits up and punches her square in the face.</p><p>Rio wrestles her back into the trunk, shuts it, gets in the car, opens the garage door, and drives back to the school.</p><p>When she gets there she leaves the car running, not even putting it in park, keeps her doors locked, and pops the trunk with the lever on the floor by her feet.</p><p>When she sees Agatha get out of the car in her rearview mirror, she punches the gas and drives off, heading back home. Agatha will learn that Rio means what she says. The insufferable bitch is not getting a third chance to attack her.</p><p>--</p><p>She doesn’t know what to expect at work Monday morning, but flowers on her desk isn’t it.</p><p>She plucks the card from where it’s nestled between two sprigs of baby’s breath and reads it.</p><p><em>Could’ve gone a little better. But not bad, don’t you think? -AH</em></p><p>Rio stands there trying to decide whether Agatha is mocking her or just that clueless. Either way, she’s not accepting the fucking flowers.</p><p>The kids won’t be arriving for another fifteen minutes, so now is the time to respond. She picks up the vase and stalks to Agatha’s classroom, not bothering to knock.</p><p>Agatha is sitting at her desk looking absolutely fucking flawless, and Rio hates how turned on it makes her to look at the woman. Ruffle-sleeved satin blouse, dark purple, with wide blue eyes and unruly, untamable hair falling over her shoulders in a tangled mess.</p><p>“You got my flow—”</p><p>Agatha stops talking when Rio holds up the vase between her thumb and forefinger and drops it into the trash can by the door.</p><p>The flicker of hurt that passes over Agatha’s face for an infinitesimal amount of time is confusing and disorienting, and Rio doesn’t want to reflect on the way it twists her heart in her chest. She leaves, letting the door swing shut behind her, and heads to the staff break room for coffee.</p><p>She shouldn’t be surprised that Agatha walks in thirty seconds later, but somehow she is. They’re alone in the room at the moment, and that doesn’t bode well. If she has to physically defend herself at work, she’s not going to be happy.</p><p>“Why did you do that?”</p><p>It’s the first civil thing Rio has heard out of Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>“Being spit on and punched in the face isn’t funny.”</p><p>“I never said it was,” Agatha snaps.</p><p>“You didn’t have to say it. Your card made a joke out of it. I don’t appreciate it. Get out of my way.”</p><p>To her astonishment, Agatha moves aside to let her pass. Her step falters at the lack of resistance or insult, but she makes a quick recovery and walks past. She’s at the door when Agatha next speaks.</p><p>“Will you try again?”</p><p>Rio marshals her patience and turns around. “I told you. You won’t get a third chance to assault me. No, I won’t try again.”</p><p>“Please?” Agatha says. “See? I learned.”</p><p>Rio wants to slap her and kiss her in the same breath. “It’s too much of a risk,” she says, shaking her head.</p><p>“I won’t spit,” Agatha says, and it’s a thousand times more sincere than her bullshit apology from last night.</p><p>The door opens and a couple of first-grade teachers walk in, mid-conversation with each other. Rio takes a step sideways to let them through.</p><p>Agatha transforms right in front of Rio’s eyes, her face going from plaintive to snarling in a split second. “Can’t you see the room is in use, you fucking cunts?” she nearly shouts as she pushes between them and past Rio out the door.</p><p>“It’s a staff room, Agatha! Not your royal bedchamber!” Rio calls after her on instinct, annoyed.</p><p>She turns when she feels eyes on her to see both of the other teachers staring at her like she’s either the dumbest creature alive or an actual real-life superhero.</p><p>“What?” she says, trying not to sound sheepish. “You shouldn’t let her treat you that way, no matter who her mother is.”</p><p>“Maybe you can afford to lose your job, but I can’t,” one of them says.</p><p>“Bullies only win when you let them,” Rio replies, skirting out the door. She doesn’t have time to get coffee now. Another offense on Agatha’s lengthy list.</p><p>Agatha is in her classroom when she reaches it. She’s only got two minutes until the kids start coming in. “If you’re still in this room when the students come in, I’ll file a complaint.”</p><p>“What? For what?” Agatha asks, flustered. “I just—”</p><p>Rio stops right in front of her, close enough that Agatha can easily see the makeup-covered bruise if she bothers to look where Rio’s pointing.</p><p>Agatha actually looks ashamed, and Rio’s heart skips. “They’ll be here in under two minutes and I don’t make idle threats.”</p><p>The shame morphs into anger once again and Agatha growls, hands clenched into fists at her sides, and storms out of the room.</p><p>Rio relaxes marginally. At least that confrontation didn’t escalate. She moves to the door and puts a smile on her face, ready to greet her students. She knows her reprieve from sparring with Agatha will only last until after school, but she’ll take the seven hours.</p><p>--</p><p>As expected, Agatha comes into her classroom again when all the students have left the building, either on their vans, buses, or with their guardians.</p><p>This time she shuts and locks the door behind her.</p><p>“No,” Rio says, shaking her head and waving a finger at the door. “We’re not doing that. Unlock the door, right now.”</p><p>“Can I have five minutes?”</p><p>“Unlock the door.”</p><p>Agatha flips over the nearest desk, sending books and pencils and crayons skittering across the floor, and Rio can see her cringe, like she’d done it without being able to control herself.</p><p>And then, to her utter surprise, Agatha unlocks the door and picks up the desk, then starts retrieving the spilled materials from around the room. She just watches in fascinated silence.</p><p>When she has cleaned up the entirety of her mess, Agatha approaches Rio’s desk. “You’re the only person who’s ever matched my crazy,” she says. “Don’t give up.” She rocks back and forth on the balls of her feet and seems to remember her newly-learned manners at the last second. “Please, I mean. Please don’t give up. I won’t spit and I won’t punch.”</p><p>Rio’s heart is hammering so hard it’s uncomfortable. Her pulse is rushing in her ears. She wants nothing more than to take this unhinged woman in hand and dominate the ever-loving fuck out of her until she’s a writhing, begging mess on the floor. She just knows she shouldn’t. But she also knows herself, and if Agatha keeps the promise not to spit or punch her…</p><p>“You won’t kick.” Shit. That’s not what she should’ve said.</p><p>Agatha’s nostrils flare and it’s hard to tell if it’s out of annoyance or exhilaration. Those wicked hands are clenched into fists at her sides again and that wicked mouth is pressed into a tight line. Rio wants her so badly.</p><p>“I won’t kick you.”</p><p>Her breathy voice tells Rio that the flared nostrils were from exhilaration. Agatha’s not annoyed.</p><p>“Get on your knees.”</p><p>She watches Agatha’s knees bend a fraction of a fraction before they straighten rigidly. “I’m not going to do that.”</p><p>Interesting. “I have questions. Answer yes or no and say nothing else. If you lie, I’m truly done.”</p><p>Agatha tenses visibly but stays put, so Rio continues.</p><p>“A part of you wanted to kneel.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flush. She struggles obviously with the answer. Her voice is very, very quiet. “Yes.”</p><p>“You can’t make yourself obey.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You want to be good, but something gets in the way.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You’re angry at me.”</p><p>“No.” Agatha’s voice goes from quiet to a normal volume, her expression confused.</p><p>Rio nods. “Some of your answers will be no,” she explains, and the confusion on Agatha’s face fades away. “You’re irritated a lot of the time.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You’re irritated right now.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“You’re happy right now.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“You’re attracted to me.”</p><p>Agatha flushes again and looks at the floor. But she answers. “Yes.” Her voice is very quiet again.</p><p>Rio stands up from her desk and steps around it. She’s a few feet away from Agatha now. “You’re embarrassed to admit anything I’m asking.”</p><p>Agatha exhales slowly and nods.</p><p>Rio closes the distance and lightly touches the underside of Agatha’s chin with one fingertip to get her to look up. “Yes or no,” she reminds when Agatha lifts her head.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio’s drawn in by the blown pupils and unsteady breaths. “You want me to force you to obey until you can do it by yourself.”</p><p>Agatha actually fucking whimpers and it’s the single most delicious, stimulating sound Rio has ever heard.</p><p>“Ye-yes.”</p><p>Rio fights a shudder. She places her hands on Agatha’s shoulders and applies pressure.</p><p>The confused expression returns… until it doesn’t, and she steps back out of Rio’s reach, shaking her head.</p><p>“We’re not going to continue until you’re on your knees,” Rio states matter-of-factly. “You can get there by yourself or with my help. Alternatively, you can remain standing, in which case this conversation is over.”</p><p>Agatha’s face twists into her patented snarl and she starts for the door.</p><p>“The first time you walk out on me will be the only time,” Rio says, and Agatha stops in her tracks.</p><p>“You’re making this impossible!” she shouts.</p><p>“Then talk to me,” Rio says.</p><p>Agatha turns with a pained expression. “I can’t do this here.”</p><p>Rio takes the few steps to close the newly-created distance and ducks her head to catch Agatha’s eyes. When she has the other woman’s gaze, she prompts gently, “then what do you need to say?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrows in frustration and Rio can see her thinking, trying to figure out what in the fuck she’s supposed to say, and getting more and more agitated when she can’t understand, until suddenly it clicks and Agatha’s breath rushes out, her eyes closing and her features smoothing, no longer plagued by confusion. “Witch killer.”</p><p>Rio’s eyelids flutter and she chokes back her own sound of longing to deliver quiet praise. “Good girl.” Now she knows Agatha really does know how to use a safeword. And she can teach her the difference between not being okay with something and throwing a fit about it.</p><p>Agatha’s knees wobble and she grabs Rio’s arm for support. “What?” she asks in a ghost of a whisper. She probably hasn’t been called a good girl very often, if ever.</p><p>“Walking out on me is being an asshole. Safewording is communicating,” Rio explains. “Do you understand?” She runs her fingers through Agatha’s hair, pleased when the other woman leans into the touch.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says.</p><p>“Tell me what you understand about it,” Rio counters, letting her hand fall back to her side to remove distraction.</p><p>“Walking out on you is being an asshole. Safewording is communicating,” Agatha repeats.</p><p>“I don’t want you to repeat it,” Rio clarifies, her voice full of kindness so Agatha doesn’t think she’s being scolded. “I want to know what it means to you. Tell me why walking out is being an asshole and why safewording is communicating.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrows again and Rio watches a whole slew of emotions play across her face. Finally she snaps, “this is stupid.”</p><p>Rio bristles slightly but remains patient, because this time the issue is quite obvious and easily fixable. “Agatha,” she says, putting a soft edge into her voice. “If you don’t know, tell me you don’t know. It’s okay not to know.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks are dusted pink and she shoves her hands in her pants pockets. “I don’t know,” she says, not calm but not quite angry either.</p><p>“Walking out on me means you’re not willing to express limits; not willing to share your thoughts or feelings. It’s disrespectful and it tells me you have no regard for me or what I want. It tells me you can’t be bothered to work things out. That you’ll disappear at the slightest inconvenience. That I don’t mean enough for you to put any effort into anything. Is that what you meant to convey?”</p><p>Agatha’s face twists. “Of course not,” she snaps.</p><p>“Safewording tells me the opposite. It says you are comfortable enough to let me know when something isn’t okay, or you feel uneasy or unsafe. Stating a limit is never disrespectful. It helps me understand what I can and cannot do with you. It says you respect me enough to tell me no so I don’t cross a line and do damage that can’t be undone. If I force you to do something that’s genuinely against your will, that makes you feel afraid or unsafe, that’s something I wouldn’t recover from. Do you understand?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes find hers, wide and raptly focused. She can see the rapid rise and fall of the other woman’s chest that signals labored breathing. “I think so,” Agatha offers hoarsely.</p><p>“There’s a difference between being embarrassed and feeling bad about yourself. I will embarrass and humiliate you until you can’t think straight, but I never want to make you feel bad about yourself. Learning from me should be enjoyable to you, even if it’s on a subconscious or deeply hidden level. If the enjoyment isn’t there at all, it’s not something I would want to force you to do. There has to be something in it for you, in everything we do.”</p><p>Agatha breathes out and nods her head. “I understand. I… appreciate that.”</p><p>Rio lets a tiny smirk pull at the corner of her mouth. “Are you trying to say thank you, Agatha? Because that would be <em>such</em> good manners.”</p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha says, closing off completely. “I said I appreciated it. That wasn’t good enough?”</p><p>Rio raises her eyebrows at the whiplash, but truth be told, it’s not very surprising that someone like Agatha would switch on and off so quickly. Rio needs to get her somewhere else. Somewhere she can put her hands on the brat. “Let’s go,” she says, and walks out the door before Agatha has a chance to respond. She’ll either follow and go home with Rio, or she won’t.</p>

<p>Rio doesn’t look back until she’s at her car, though she knows Agatha is following her pretty closely. Which means there wasn’t hesitation about leaving with her. Which makes Rio feverish. She turns around as she opens the driver’s door and jumps to see Agatha literally in her space bubble, less than a foot away, about to crash into her.</p><p>Agatha stops and braces herself on the window, then takes a step back. “I forgot this was your car. I was still walking when you stopped.”</p><p>Rio looks around. “It’s the only car left in the lot.”</p><p>Agatha glances around as well and ducks her head. “Oh.”</p><p>She’s embarrassed, and it’s so fucking cute that Rio has to forcibly resist touching her in some way. She shakes out her hands to keep them to herself. “It’s okay, honey,” she says, and grits her teeth, annoyed at letting the term of endearment slip out before she’s fully ready to use it. Before Agatha is likely ready to hear it.</p><p>Agatha rears back and looks like she’s about to run.</p><p>“Shit,” Rio says. “Don’t run. I make mistakes too.”</p><p>The crazed, fearful look in Agatha’s eyes settles into something less volatile, and over the next thirty seconds, it fades entirely, replaced by a tiny smirk. “You mean you’re not perfect?”</p><p>Rio exhales, not realizing she’d been holding her breath. “Not by a long shot.” She grins at Agatha, then changes her mind. “Actually, I take that back. I’m pretty close to perfect.”</p><p>Agatha snorts out a laugh and the tension is properly diffused. “Whatever you say.”</p><p>“Are you going to ride in the front this time?” She gets in the car without waiting for an answer and unlocks the rest of the doors with the button on her armrest.</p><p>Agatha opens the back door and slides into the seat behind her.</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows raise of their own accord. “I’m not your chauffeur.”</p><p>“I don’t deserve to sit next to you,” Agatha says, shutting the door.</p><p>Rio turns in her seat like lightning. “Hang on. Does it turn you on to sit behind me like you don’t deserve it, or do you <em>actually</em> think you don’t deserve to sit next to me?”</p><p>“What’s the difference?”</p><p>“There’s a huge, vast galaxy of a difference,” Rio says. “Your body will tell you the answer. Pay attention to it. If you feel tingly and on the edge of something, if you get wet when you think about sitting in the back seat, if it makes you want to behave and earn the privilege of sitting next to me, then sit back there. If it makes you want to shrink into yourself, hide your face, not look me in the eye, or you think you’ll never earn the privilege of sitting next to me, then get out of the car and come around the front.”</p><p>Agatha gets out and goes around the car to sit in the front.</p><p>Rio wonders if it’s a trauma response, to feel like she doesn’t deserve to be an equal, or if it’s just inexperience. She can’t look at Agatha or she’ll do something mushy and sloppy like fawn over her and kiss her shoulder. So she reaches one finger across the divide and runs it down Agatha’s arm, then starts the car. “Good girl.”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>,” Agatha says, and Rio can hear her drop her head back against the headrest.</p><p>“I’m going to ask you some more yes or no questions during the drive,” Rio says and pulls out of the parking lot. Yes or no answers are going to be the easiest for Agatha at this point. “Do you like the idea of being physically restrained?”</p><p>Rio hears the seatbelt buckle. “Yes.”</p><p>“With rope?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“With handcuffs?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“With zip ties?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>Rio almost stops the car to kiss her for remembering to say she doesn’t know something instead of throwing a fit or claiming the question is stupid. She controls herself and keeps driving. “Have you been physically restrained with any of those items before?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Was it done safely?”</p><p>There’s a hesitation before the answer. “I don’t know.”</p><p>Rio nods and moves on. “Do you like the idea of being choked?”</p><p>Agatha gasps. “<em>Yes</em>.”</p><p>“Have you ever been choked?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>They’re almost to Rio’s house.</p><p>“Do you like the idea of being spanked?”</p><p>“You already—” Agatha stops herself and clears her throat. “Yes.”</p><p>Rio gives a soft growl at the deviation from the allowed responses, but she’s pleased that Agatha self-corrects. “What do you say for speaking out of turn?”</p><p>She can <em>feel</em> how badly that prickles Agatha’s pride and wonders if she’s going to regret saying it while driving and unable to act.</p><p>“That you shouldn’t waste time asking questions you already know the answer to,” Agatha growls back.</p><p>Rio pulls the car to the side of the road and puts it in park, turning to look at Agatha. “Should I take us back to the school?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says instantly. “Please don’t.”</p><p>Rio is profoundly turned on by how easily Agatha has already come to use the word please. But it’s not enough. She puts a finger under Agatha’s chin and urges the other woman to look at her.</p><p>Agatha does.</p><p>“Then what do you say for speaking out of turn?”</p><p>Agatha swallows and closes her eyes, and Rio allows it for now.</p><p>“Sorry,” she whispers. It’s not insincere but it’s not… truly regretful. That’s all right with Rio.</p><p>Rio strokes her cheek. “Very good,” she praises. “Please try not to do it again, at least while I’m driving. I don’t like having to pull over.”</p><p>Agatha leans into the gentle touch and nods her head. “I’m sorry,” she breathes more sincerely. “I’m sorry, Rio.”</p><p>Rio shivers and keeps stroking Agatha’s cheek with her thumb. “Thank you,” she murmurs.</p><p>Agatha opens her eyes. Rio can read the surprise at being thanked.</p><p>“I’m always going to be grateful when you’re a good girl, or when you obey me, or when you’re sincere using your manners,” she explains, because she thinks Agatha needs an explanation. “You deserve gratitude for behaving, and I deserve gratitude for giving you guidance.”</p><p>The blue of Agatha’s eyes is almost enveloped completely by blown pupils, but what little remains is glassy and wet. It’s the deepest into subspace Rio has gotten her, and she wants to keep her there. Even if they have to stay parked on the side of the road all night.</p><p>She leans over the console and turns her head slightly, sliding her thumb down Agatha’s jaw and then using her forefinger to tap her own cheek. If Agatha doesn’t get the implication, she’ll speak, but if there’s no need to break the silence, she won’t.</p><p>She hears the unsteady intake of breath at her actions and feels Agatha shift in her seat. She can see Agatha’s head come off the headrest out of the corner of her eye, and she knows her request was understood.</p><p>Lips press to her cheek, and Agatha is shaking.</p><p>When Agatha doesn’t attempt to take any liberties, Rio turns just enough to kiss her.</p><p>The moan loosed from Agatha’s throat is almost enough to make Rio shove her hand down her pants and fuck herself right there. She wrangles her libido under control and keeps the kiss soft; chaste even, and pulls back slowly. “Can you be good for the rest of the drive?” she asks, her breath ghosting over Agatha’s parted lips.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says without hesitation. “<em>Yes</em>, I’ll be good.”</p><p>Physical contact seems to help Agatha stay in the moment, so Rio puts a hand on her knee while she pulls the car back onto the road. “We’re only a few minutes out,” she says quietly.</p><p>When Agatha stays quiet down the block, Rio squeezes her knee, reassuring and gentle.</p><p>Agatha moans like she’s just been stroked between her legs and Rio wonders how long she’s been touch starved.</p><p>Two more minutes and they’re in the garage, the door grinding shut as Rio puts the car in park. She squeezes Agatha’s knee again. “You were so good,” she praises. “Thank you, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha whimpers and squirms in her seat. “Do I say you’re welcome?”</p><p>Jesus Christ, her voice is dripping with submission and Rio isn’t sure she’s going to come out of this alive. “You don’t have to, but anything polite you ever want to say will always be appreciated,” she says honestly.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha nods, breathless.</p><p>Rio keeps her hand on Agatha’s knee and beckons with her other one, crooking a finger. “Come here.”</p><p>Agatha immediately leans toward her as far as the seatbelt will allow.</p><p>“Would you like me to kiss you again?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>.” It’s winded and desperate and perfect.</p><p>Rio leans a bit closer. “Can you say please for me?”</p><p>Agatha says it almost before Rio’s even done asking. “Please.”</p><p>Rio closes the rest of the gap and fits her mouth over Agatha’s. It’s not chaste this time. She sucks and nibbles and pushes her tongue against Agatha’s teeth, sliding past, licking inside.</p><p>Agatha starts rutting her hips against the seatbelt and grabs up fistfuls of her pants. The noises coming out of her are needy and feral and stuttered, but they’re quiet.</p><p>Agatha’s entire reaction feeds Rio’s dominant urges like a wolf at slaughter. She’s careful not to give too much or reveal how affected she is this early on. She’s so fucking wet she’s surprised she can’t hear her cunt squelching when she moves.</p><p>When she breaks the kiss, Agatha mewls in protest. Rio unbuckles the seatbelt for her and takes her hand, not wanting to lose contact while they get out of the car. “Let’s go inside,” she says, and backs out of the driver’s door, tugging Agatha’s hand, and Agatha crawls across the seats to get out without letting go.</p><p>Rio nudges the car door shut with her hip and leads Agatha into the house.</p><p>They can do a tour later. For now she brings Agatha to the living room and sits on the sofa, patting her lap.</p><p>Agatha’s breath catches and she tries to pull her hand out of Rio’s.</p><p>Rio realizes the issue immediately and holds fast, shaking her head. “I just want you to sit on my lap,” she assures the retreating woman.</p><p>Agatha stops pulling and Rio can see the relief in her eyes, the sharpness fading to glassy once again as she lowers herself to sit.</p><p>Rio thoroughly enjoys Agatha’s weight on her thighs and wraps an arm around her middle, giving a squeeze. “I’m sorry,” she offers, letting go of Agatha’s hand to tuck some hair behind a blushing ear. “I should’ve been clear about what I wanted. You have been so good. I would never punish you for no reason or without discussing it with you first.”</p><p>Agatha nods but doesn’t say anything.</p><p>“That is what you thought, right?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha admits softly. “I thought maybe for yesterday. Or for flipping the desk. Or a million other things I’ve done every other day of my life.”</p><p>Rio urges her to relax and Agatha obeys, curling into her and resting her head in the crook of Rio’s neck.</p><p>“I’m not going to lie and say you don’t deserve to be punished for some of those things. But not tonight. Tonight you’ve been a good girl, Agatha, and you’ve learned. You’ve shown me how much you’ve learned. I want to keep focused on that tonight. I want you to keep practicing your manners and I want to keep rewarding you for using them. Does that sound like something you can handle for the next few hours?”</p><p>Agatha lets out a shuddering breath and nods against Rio’s neck. “Yes.” And after a beat, she adds, “Thank you.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio purrs, stroking Agatha’s head. “Is it okay with you if I say I’m proud of you?” It might seem like a silly question, but some people get embarrassed by that kind of praise or find it condescending, and Rio does not want to do anything to jar Agatha out of subspace.</p><p>Agatha’s breath gets faster. “Yes.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio says, running her fingers through Agatha’s hair now. “Because I am. Very proud of you. You’ve learned so much in such a short time. You can be such a good, smart girl.”</p><p>Agatha presses her forehead hard into Rio’s neck.</p><p>“Do you like that? Being called smart?”</p><p>Agatha pants softly against her skin. “Yes.”</p><p>“What about pretty?”</p><p>Agatha fairly moans. “Yes.”</p><p>“I want to get away from the yes or no questions for a few minutes. But if you don’t have an answer for anything I ask, it’s always okay. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha nods.</p><p>“Can you tell me some other things you might like to be called? You can take as much time as you want to think about it. We have all night.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything at first, but she doesn’t tense up, so Rio just waits. After a few minutes she feels a fingertip tracing patterns on her arm, and her skin burns even through her sleeve.</p><p>“Sweet.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice is raspy and extremely hesitant, like she thinks Rio is going to object, or possibly even mock her.</p><p>“I can most definitely do that,” Rio says softly.</p><p>Agatha shifts in her lap but stays curled up. “Naughty,” she whispers.</p><p>Rio licks her lips. “Naughty when you’re good, or naughty for misbehavior?”</p><p>The patterns on her arm stop for a second while Agatha considers, and then continue. “I don’t know.”</p><p>Rio nods and kisses her forehead. “We’ll explore it.”</p><p>“Are you attracted to me?” Agatha blurts out suddenly, the patterns stopping again.</p><p>Rio is a bit stunned that she has to ask. “Very.”</p><p>She feels warm breath on her neck as Agatha exhales, and the patterns start up again.</p><p>“Is there anything you know you don’t want to be called?”</p><p>“Evil.”</p><p>The assurance with which Agatha says it tells Rio it’s something she’s been called before, and while Agatha is definitely an asshole, it pisses her off that someone would call her evil, in a way that has obviously stayed with her and made a lasting impact. “That’s not the kind of thing I would ever say, even if I was upset. Are you okay with being called bad if you misbehave?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shine and her jaw works silently for a second before she answers, but the word comes with confidence. “Yes.”</p><p>“Is there anything else you <em>don’t</em> want to be called?”</p><p>Agatha hesitates. “Yes.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows lift. “Okay. What is it?”</p><p>Agatha shifts restlessly and drops her hand completely away from Rio’s arm. “I didn’t like it when you called me hateful.”</p><p>Rio loses her breath, a dizzying wave of nausea rolling through her. “I’m so sorry,” she breathes.</p><p>It’s clearly not the reaction Agatha had been fearing, and Rio feels tension easing out of the woman in her lap. “It’s okay,” Agatha promises. “It didn’t scar me, not like being called evil. I just didn’t like it, and you want me to be honest, so I thought I should tell you even though I don’t think you would say it again, but I—”</p><p>“Breathe,” Rio interrupts her adorable rambling. “I’m not upset at you for bringing it up. I do always want you to be honest, and I’m proud of you for telling me something that couldn’t have been easy to tell me, sweet girl.”</p><p>Agatha groans into her neck.</p><p>“What should you say?” Rio tuts.</p><p>Lips on her neck distract her for a second, and when Agatha doesn’t answer and keeps trying to kiss closer to her face, Rio puts her hands on Agatha’s shoulders and firmly pushes her back, dislodging the misbehaving brat’s mouth from her neck.</p><p>“Agatha,” she scolds, and waits to see if that’s going to be enough to get them back on track.</p><p>Agatha grunts and leans into Rio’s hands, trying to get her mouth back where it was.</p><p>“That’s enough,” Rio says, voice gaining an edge.</p><p>Agatha growls and brings her arms up between Rio’s, using her forearms to push outward, trying to remove Rio’s hands from her shoulders.</p><p>“This is not going to end the way you want it to,” Rio warns. “Stop.”</p><p>“I want to touch you,” Agatha insists.</p><p>“That’s something you have to earn. Stop fighting, or I’m going to put you on your knees instead of letting you sit in my lap.”</p><p>That seems to piss Agatha off more than anything, because she throws her arms more forcefully outwards, knocking Rio’s hands from her shoulders so she can lean in and mold herself against Rio’s body again. She keeps her mouth to herself, but Rio is still not going to let this kind of behavior happen without immediate consequence.</p><p>She slides completely out from under Agatha and stands. “On your knees.”</p><p>Agatha remains seated on the couch, eyes blazing. “No.”</p><p>Rio drags her from the couch with a snatched up handful of hair at the top of her head and uses the momentum to toss her onto her hands and knees.</p><p>Agatha scrambles to her feet the second her knees hit the floor. Rio spins her around with hands on her shoulders and kicks the back of her calves, sending her to her knees again with a thud, and grabs her by the ear so she can’t get back up without losing it.</p><p>Agatha is effectively kept down while Rio has hold of her ear, but Rio can see she’s not going to stay there on her own. Not yet. So she keeps hold of Agatha’s ear with one hand and delivers a stinging slap to her face with the other at the same time she reprimands her with one word. “<em>Bad</em>.”</p><p>Agatha cries out at the slap, one hand flying to cover the glaring red mark on her face, and she looks up at Rio, wounded. “No,” she whines, face twisting. “I’m <em>not</em> being bad. You just don’t know how to manage me.”</p><p>Rio slaps her again and Agatha has the audacity to look stunned. So she slaps her <em>again</em>. “Don’t ever speak to me like that,” she says calmly. “You <em>are</em> being bad, Agatha. <em>Very</em> bad. And just five minutes ago I was so proud… you were being <em>so</em> good. Now I have to keep you on your knees by your ear. I don’t like having to do that.”</p><p>Agatha’s vitriol falters for a second before her face hardens again. “Maybe you don’t deserve for me to listen.”</p><p>That… is one thing that Rio is not going to tolerate. She releases Agatha’s ear and steps back as the other woman gets to her feet, advancing.</p><p>Rio needs a minute to calm down and she ducks into the bathroom, locking the door.</p><p>“Rio?” she hears immediately, and Agatha’s voice has gone from scathing to panicked.</p><p>“I need a minute,” she snaps out.</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Maybe she shouldn’t say that, but she’s trembling with rage. She knows enough to separate herself from Agatha until she calms, but she’s not entirely in control of her words at the moment.</p><p>“I’m—”</p><p>“I said SHUT UP!” She pounds on the door with her fist, fuming.</p><p>When no further sounds come from the other side of the barrier, she sinks down to sit against the wall and puts her head on drawn-up knees to breathe.</p>

<p>Rio attunes her senses to the rise and fall of her own chest until the adrenaline starts to leave her body. When it’s gone, it leaves her feeling bereft and disappointed in herself. She knows better than to be so invested that something a submissive says to her can get under her skin like that. But with Agatha, there’s no way to stop it. She’ll try, but she’s not hopeful.</p><p>She uses her hands to push herself up and gets to her feet, and takes one more deep breath before unlocking and opening the door.</p><p>Agatha is pacing back and forth in front of the couch, wringing her hands. When she sees Rio emerge from the bathroom she halts the pacing and takes a step closer, but stops, and Rio thinks the step was involuntary. “I’m sorry,” she says with worried eyes. There are so many things she could be thinking. Rio will get into them all, after she course corrects.</p><p>“On your knees,” she says, snapping and pointing at the floor.</p><p>Agatha drops like a bomb.</p><p>Rio tests the waters. “You’re going to be punished.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t argue. She bows her head and puts her hands behind her back.</p><p>So far so good. “Undo your pants.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands come around front and fumble with the catch of her slacks until she gets it undone, and then she lowers the zipper.</p><p>“Push them down.”</p><p>Agatha pushes and the slacks pool around her knees.</p><p>“Underwear down.”</p><p>Agatha’s face turns bright red but she obeys without question and pushes her underwear down around her knees to join her pants.</p><p>“Lean forward and brace your hands on the floor.”</p><p>Agatha bends forward and settles her hands on the carpet, letting her head drop between her elbows.</p><p>Rio moves behind her and slaps her ass, hard. “What did you do that was bad?”</p><p>Agatha yelps and rocks forward, then back into place. “I tried to kiss you without permission.”</p><p>Rio slaps the other cheek and enjoys Agatha’s whimper. “That was naughty. What did you do that was <em>bad</em>?”</p><p>“I… I said no?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t know what she did to piss Rio off. That makes Rio’s inappropriate reaction even worse. “Saying no is also naughty.” She spanks Agatha again, in the same spot as the last hit. “Do you need me to tell you what was bad?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha sniffs. “Pl—please.”</p><p>Rio brings her hand down with less force, because Agatha sounds like she might be crying. It’s probably not from the spanking, because she’s only been smacked a few times, but that emotional distress can make everything feel so much more intense than it is, so she backs off a little. “You said I don’t deserve for you to listen.”</p><p>Agatha drops down to her elbows and buries her face in her hands. She’s definitely crying. Her shoulders are shaking with the subtlest of movements. “You walked out on me.”</p><p>Rio freezes, her hand mid-air, about to deliver the fifth and final blow of the punishment, when Agatha’s words pummel her in the chest. “I went into the bathroom to take a minute,” she explains, her arm dropping to her side.</p><p>“You walked out on me,” Agatha says again. “That means you’re not willing to express limits or share thoughts and feelings, and--and you can’t be bothered to work things out, and you’ll disappear at any inconvenience, and I—I don’t mean enough for you to put any effort into anything. That’s what you told me that walking out on you means.”</p><p>Rio has to sit down. She sits on the floor behind Agatha before she can lose her resolve to stand and end up falling. So many things are running through her head, assaulting her from all sides, her aggrieved brain pelting insults at her and telling her she’s not good enough and she’s a terrible dominant because she’s just done the exact thing she told Agatha <em>never</em> to do. And made her sub <em>cry</em>. Made Agatha think Rio is not willing to communicate or put in any effort. Made Agatha think she doesn’t mean enough and that Rio will disappear any time things get rough.</p><p>“I was—” she chokes out. “I just needed a minute.” She’s trying to justify her actions and she knows it’s not right, but she can’t help it. She <em>wasn’t</em> walking out on Agatha, she honestly wasn’t, she was just taking space to keep them both safe. But from Agatha’s point of view, she absolutely, one hundred percent walked out. She should’ve said what she was doing <em>before</em> Agatha had to ask. She should have safeworded. “I swear to you, Agatha, I was not walking out on you. But I did things wrong. I should have safeworded so you understood.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean to make you so angry,” Agatha admits, defeated. “I thought—I thought you could handle it.”</p><p>Rio pulls up Agatha’s underwear and fits them around her hips, then does the same with her pants. “Will you let me explain myself or do you need me to take you home?”</p><p>Agatha turns around and drops her head into Rio’s lap. “Don’t take me home. Please.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Rio promises, instantly stroking her hair. “I don’t want you to leave. But I need you to know that you can if <em>you</em> want to.”</p><p>“I don’t,” Agatha reiterates. “I’m sorry I messed up so badly.”</p><p>“You didn’t, really,” Rio says, running fingers through messy, sweaty hair. She tries to remember the exact sequence of things that happened so she can help Agatha understand exactly where the bratty behavior went from tolerable to intolerable. The line is fine and faint, and easy to miss for both sides. “What you said was bratty, and rude, but you had no way of knowing it would violate one of my limits. That’s on me, not on you. I should have safeworded to communicate the seriousness of my feelings with you. I’m sorry I didn’t.”</p><p>Agatha seems to find it awkward when Rio apologizes to her, but not unpleasant, because she doesn’t tense up, she just fiddles with her hands. “So it was saying you don’t deserve me to listen that upset you, right? Not the other misbehavior?”</p><p>“The other misbehavior didn’t please me,” Rio says archly, “but you’re correct. It didn’t upset me. I can handle noncompliance and response refusal.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes go wide and she looks up at Rio, jaw dropped. “How do you know those terms?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“You teach general ed.”</p><p>“How did we get on the subject of our careers?”</p><p>“Noncompliance and response refusal. Those are special education terms.”</p><p>Rio blinks at her. “They are?” Admittedly, she knows little to nothing about special education.</p><p>“Where did you learn them?”</p><p>“From the people who introduced me to this lifestyle…”</p><p>“Were they special education teachers?”</p><p>“Not in the slightest.”</p><p>“Huh. Maybe they’re more generalized behavior terms, rather than specifically special education terms,” Agatha surmises. “I guess if you really think about it, BDSM does involve behavior management. I never had a reason to think of it that way before.”</p><p>Rio’s brain is broken. “You should never use any of the methods I’m going to use with you on any children,” she says with a frown.</p><p>“God! Don’t be ridiculous!” Agatha exclaims, horrified. “There are an infinite number of reinforcers and punishments. Just because the science overlaps between the two fields doesn’t mean the methods of managing behavior overlap.” She snorts. “I hadn’t pegged you as stupid, but—” She cuts herself off and grimaces. “Oh no. I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Insulting people just comes so naturally to you, doesn’t it?” Rio asks, amused. She’ll let this one go because she knows Agatha’s trying.</p><p>Agatha pouts, and it’s the cutest thing Rio can imagine looking at, with her lower lip sticking slightly out and her eyes pleading not to be punished. “Yes,” she admits, lowering her pleading eyes to the floor. “I’ve been doing it unchecked for so long.”</p><p>“No one wants to challenge you because your mother’s the superintendent.”</p><p>“Would it surprise you to know that the only people I’ve ever gotten fired were for legitimate reasons and I didn’t go through my mother at all?”</p><p>“I think that would surprise anyone that’s ever met you. Why does everyone think you snap your fingers and your mother fires poor innocent souls?”</p><p>“I let them assume. It makes my life easier.”</p><p>Rio tilts her chin up so they can look at each other. “Your life just got a whole lot more complicated.”</p><p>Agatha shudders and drops her eyes again. “I want you so fucking badly.”</p><p>“Ohh,” Rio says, thrilled. “Then I guess you’d better be good. And if I tell you no, you stop what you’re doing. You don’t push. You don’t argue. You don’t disrespect me.”</p><p>Agatha scoots closer so she can lightly head butt Rio’s stomach. “Do you promise to safeword instead of walking out on me if I make a mistake?”</p><p>Rio’s heart flutters and she stands up. “I promise. Now get on your knees.”</p><p>Agatha uses her hands to help her push up, and she kneels in front of Rio.</p><p>Rio closes a fist in Agatha’s hair. “I want to take us back. You said you don’t like to be called hateful. I praised you for telling me. Do you remember?”</p><p>“Yes. You called me a sweet girl,” Agatha says, flushing.</p><p>“I did,” Rio agrees that their memories of the exchange match up. “Now… what should you say?”</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha breathes.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Rio says, lightly tugging on the fistful of hair she holds. “Are you ready to practice some more manners?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are starting to go glassy again and she bites her lip, nodding. “Mhmm.”</p><p>“Can I get words, please? Are you ready?”</p><p>Agatha releases her lip and breathes through her nose. “Yes.”</p><p>“Good girl. I like you like this, Agatha. On your knees, being good for me. It turns me on.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands clutch at the air. “Can I—”</p><p>“No,” Rio interrupts. “Don’t ask again.”</p><p>Agatha sinks back to sit on her heels but doesn’t fight or pout.</p><p>“Up,” Rio says, tugging her hair, and Agatha raises back up to her knees. “I like you on your knees, being good for me,” Rio repeats. “It turns me on.”</p><p>She watches Agatha struggle. Watches her nostrils flare, her jaw clench and her thighs press together. She listens to the harsh inhale and exhale before Agatha speaks. “What would you like me to say, Rio?”</p><p>It’s not sassy. It’s a genuine question. It reaches down Rio’s throat and twists her stomach into a knot that pumps slick between her legs. It’s fucking perfect.</p><p>“I want you to tell me how badly you want me, without asking for or demanding anything.” Her voice is hoarse. She’s a split second away from putting her hand in Agatha’s open pants.</p><p>Agatha whimpers. “More than I’ve ever wanted anyone,” she confesses. “From the first time I saw you. I never get my coffee from the school. I went into the staff room because I wanted to look at you. I spilled creamer on your papers to get your attention. I’ve been desperate for you to notice me since school started, but you never spoke to me, so I… my behavior escalated.”</p><p>Rio is staring, open mouthed, by the time Agatha stops talking. “Are you fucking kidding me?” she says after she gets over her stunned silence. “You—w—I—why on Earth would I have ever talked to you with the way you talk to people?” She’s still turning the words over and over, unable to believe that Agatha was in the break room because of <em>her</em>, and not because of getting banned from every coffee shop in the area. What in the actual <em>fuck</em>.</p><p>Agatha shuffles backwards a few inches on her knees as if she thinks Rio’s going to slap her.</p><p>Rio snaps and points to the floor, and she shivers when Agatha immediately shuffles back to where she had been.</p><p>“Are you upset?”</p><p>“You—” Rio takes a slow breath and runs her hands over her face. “You know who should be upset? Tucker Cannon, the kid who had to re-take that test you ruined with your motherfucking creamer instead of saying hello like a functioning adult!”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip and rubs her palms up and down her thighs, shifting nervously. “Am I in trouble?” She sounds like she knows the answer. “I’m sorry I ruined his test, I didn’t mean to do that. I just wanted your attention.”</p><p>Rio grabs her by the back of her neck and shoves a hand down the front of her pants, grabbing her cunt through her underwear. “For every fucked up thing you’ve said or done since you first stepped foot in that break room, I’m going to fuck you to the edge and back you off without letting you come.”</p><p>Agatha keens at the hand gripping her cunt, and Rio sees the moment her words sink in because Agatha’s expression hits a wall, leaving her looking dazed. “You’re going to what?”</p><p>“Are you asking because you don’t understand what I mean or because you’re questioning my decision?” Rio says sharply. She won’t let herself get distracted by the hot, wet fabric pressing against her fingertips. Agatha is drenched.</p><p>“Neither,” she says, grinding down on Rio’s hand. “I just don’t know if I heard you right. You’re going to edge me once for everything I’ve said or done since last Tuesday morning?”</p><p>“You heard me right,” Rio says, curling her fingers to press the fabric upward between Agatha’s lips.</p><p>“Then yeah, I’m questioning your decision,” Agatha pants, throwing her head back. “You’ll kill me.”</p><p>Rio smirks, biting the exposed column of Agatha’s throat. “You’ll survive.”</p><p>“I’ve never been edged <em>once</em>, let alone fifteen thousand times. I’ll die.”</p><p>“Stop being dramatic.” Rio pulls her hand out of Agatha’s pants and lightly slaps her pussy. “On your feet.”</p><p>Agatha shrieks even though it’s basically nothing more than a tap, but she stands as commanded.</p><p>“Take your clothes off.”</p><p>“All of them?”</p><p>Rio slaps her face and Agatha’s head snaps to the side from the force. She breathes out heavy and starts undoing her blouse, head bowed in obvious deferral to the discipline.</p><p>Rio loves to see her this way – flushed, panting, <em>compliant</em>.</p><p>The blouse hits the floor and a few seconds later Agatha’s pants join it. Rio watches her push her panties down, pulling her feet out of them one after the other, and out of her heeled pumps at the same time. She sheds her bra, toes off her stockings, and finally looks up at Rio. “Jewelry too?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes are glued to the black metal rings decorating Agatha’s nipples. “No,” she chokes. “Leave the jewelry.”</p><p>“Sure you don’t want to let me come?” Agatha purrs, clocking Rio’s focus.</p><p>Rio snaps out of it and grabs her by the throat. “Shut up.”</p><p>Agatha goes spineless the second Rio’s hand closes around her throat, eyes glassing over, lips parted in a wordless whine.</p><p>Rio puts her face close and makes sure she has Agatha’s undivided attention. “Crawl behind me.”</p><p>Agatha shudders and nods.</p><p>Satisfied that she understands, Rio releases her throat, watching her reaction closely. There’s a brief struggle to breathe in, almost as if she has to kickstart her motor functions again, and then she’s okay, breathing normally, and Rio turns to walk to the bedroom.</p><p>She knows Agatha gets onto her hands and knees by the quiet creak of the floorboards under the carpet. Her nerves are on fucking fire. Every step she takes toward the bedroom, toward Agatha’s agonizing fate for the evening, sparks another inferno. She’s soaked through her pants without an ounce of physical stimulation and it’s utterly ridiculous. Her hands are shaking as she opens the bedroom door, and she makes the mistake of turning around to look at Agatha before she goes in, and ends up standing in the doorway, staring.</p><p>God, she’s magnificent. Naked, on her hands and knees, head dropped forward so her hair lingers on the dark green carpet, the colors in sharp contrast even in the dim hallway lighting. Her back is slightly arched, muscles rippling with the effort to keep herself still. Her skin is so smooth, flawless even where tiny scars litter the expanse. Rio wants her mouth everywhere on Agatha’s body. The level of temptation she feels to drag her tongue over every inch rivals the level of temptation for food when she’s starving.</p><p>It's too much. She forces herself to look away and enter the bedroom, and Agatha obediently follows.</p>

<p>The fact that she doesn’t have to give any corrections during the trip to the bedroom (even when she’d stopped to stare) is a boon to Rio’s pride and she wants to praise Agatha, but she holds off. Not yet. The thread of compliance is too tentative. One wrong move and it snaps.</p><p>The dark green carpet continues, wall to wall in her private space, and she kicks off her shoes to enjoy the plush feeling on her feet. They thud one at a time up against her bureau and come to rest in an X shape, one half on top of the other. She’s not sure why she’s paying attention to how her shoes land after she kicks them off, but the X shape is strangely satisfying and one corner of her mouth tugs up in a smile.</p><p>Focus back to Agatha, who is still behaving perfectly, waiting on her hands and knees with her head bowed, and Rio licks her lips to wet them. She’s unbelievably hot under the collar and thirsty in more ways than one.</p><p>That will have to wait, because she’s not leaving Agatha alone like this. She already made that mistake once tonight, she won’t lapse in her tightly-woven ethics again for anything. “Up,” she says, and snaps her fingers near her chest.</p><p>Agatha rises to her knees, swaying off balance, and Rio steps to her, cradling the back of her head as she pulls Agatha’s face against her thighs. The movement helps to steady the swaying, and a moment later Agatha is still.</p><p>The warm breath on her thighs is deeply arousing in a soft, tender way, and Rio breathes out slowly. It’s definitely time for praise now. “Good girl,” she croons, and feels Agatha’s moan against her skin though the sound doesn’t reach her ears.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha whispers, and her voice is wispy even for a whisper.</p><p>She hopes she can trust Agatha to stay in subspace and answer seriously when she asks what she needs to ask. “Do you need anything, pretty girl?”</p><p>She hears the moan this time and Agatha nods against her. “Water. Please.”</p><p>Rio strokes her hair and squeezes. “Me too. Crawl behind me.”</p><p>They’ll just have to go together. Because Rio may be willing to forego her own need for water until a more convenient time, but not Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha drops back to her hands and knees when Rio steps away and follows her to the kitchen. It only takes about a minute, actually, for her to grab two bottles of water from the fridge and get them back to the bedroom.</p><p>She tosses her own bottle over to the bed and opens Agatha’s. “Up,” she says again, and Agatha raises up. “Open.”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth.</p><p>Rio carefully rests the flimsy plastic on Agatha’s bottom lip and tilts it to pour a bit of water into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha lets the water pool in her mouth, unmoving, and Rio almost drops the bottle. “Swallow,” she forces out, barely able to speak.</p><p>Agatha swallows the water with a blissful look on her face.</p><p>Those cloudy, shining, almost-black eyes are going to be the death of Rio. “More?”</p><p>“Yes please.” Agatha’s voice is thick and slow.</p><p>Rio pours a bit more water into her mouth. “Swallow.”</p><p>Agatha does.</p><p>“More?”</p><p>“No thank you.”</p><p>Rio caps the bottle and tosses it over to join her own on the bed. “Down.”</p><p>She watches Agatha go back down to all fours.</p><p>“Follow.”</p><p>She walks across the room to the bed, Agatha following closely.</p><p>“Are you able to follow more complex instructions?” Rio checks in, keeping her voice low to protect the shared intimacy of the last five minutes.</p><p>Agatha turns her head to the side, listening. “Yes.”</p><p>“I want you to climb onto the bed and lay on your back in the middle of it, with your head on my pillows, your hands wrapped around the headboard, your knees bent and your legs spread for me. Do you need me to repeat it?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Agatha is so far down in subspace that the ring around her blown pupils is a dark, stormy blue; a shade removed from her usual vibrant color. Rio needs to check she’s all there.</p><p>“Tell me your name, pretty girl.”</p><p>Agatha looks up at her and she can see the cognizance struggling to emerge. When it does, Agatha raises up to her knees and wraps her fingers urgently around the waistband of Rio’s pants.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio soothes, petting her hair. “Tell me your name, honey.”</p><p>Agatha chokes on a strangled sound and clings tighter to Rio’s pants. “Agatha,” she says shakily.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio praises in a voice meant for talking down scared animals. “And my name?”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha says, pressing her face into Rio’s stomach.</p><p>“Very good. And where are we?”</p><p>“At your house. In your bedroom,” Agatha says, starting to calm. Her fingers loosen around Rio’s waistband but she keeps them curled into it.</p><p>“Good girl. One more question. What’s about to happen?”</p><p>Agatha’s fully back to herself and groans, but not in a flippant, sassy way. She’s still down where Rio wants her to be. She’s just not dangerously dissociated. “You’re going to punish me. You’re going to edge me fifteen thousand times,” she says, her eyelids fluttering.</p><p>Rio’s satisfied she can continue now. “Damn right I am,” she purrs. “Do you deserve it?”</p><p>Agatha drops her hands to her sides and backs off to a respectable few inches away. “Unfortunately, yes,” she says with a resigned sigh. “Thank you for… whatever that was.”</p><p>“Are you okay if we talk about it after we’re finished?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says agreeably. “I just… thank you.”</p><p>Rio tilts her chin up with a fingertip. “I will always put your safety and your needs before <em>anything</em> else.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes glisten with unspoken emotion. Not quite tears, but something heavy. She gives a barely perceptible nod of her head in acknowledgement, clearly not trusting herself to speak on the subject.</p><p>“Okay. Now, do you remember how I told you I want you on the bed?”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to answer but stalls, and her face screws up. “No,” she breathes. “I remember you telling me, but I don’t remember what you said.” She looks up fearfully. “I’m sorry, Rio, I—”</p><p>“Shh,” Rio says, shaking her head. “It’s okay. You didn’t do anything wrong. Sometimes we dissociate a little. I pulled you back from it, so it makes sense you don’t remember exactly what I said.”</p><p>Agatha visibly relaxes. “Oh,” she says. “I almost had a cardiac event.”</p><p>Rio runs her fingers through Agatha’s wild hair. “I will always be fair with you. That falls under the realm of putting your safety and needs before anything else. Are you okay to continue or do you need a break?”</p><p>“I’m okay to continue,” Agatha says. “Please.” And then she can’t seem to help blurting out, “are you going to touch me at all?”</p><p>Rio puffs her cheeks up in an attempt not to laugh and fails, letting out an airy chuckle. “Oh yes. Many times. How else would I get you to the edge over and over?”</p><p>Agatha grimaces, and Rio thinks she probably wishes she hadn’t asked. “If I die…”</p><p>“I swear on my own life, you won’t die,” Rio says.</p><p>“I’ll haunt you forever,” Agatha says dubiously.</p><p>“I’d expect nothing less. Climb up on the bed and lay on your back in the middle of it. Head on the pillows, hands around the headboard, knees bent, legs spread for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s face turns bright red but she gets on the bed, on her back. As she settles into the fluffy pillows, she glances behind her before reaching up to wrap her hands around the thin, spiral iron bars of the headboard. She settles again, looking at the ceiling, and slowly draws her knees up, letting her legs fall open.</p><p>Rio crawls after her and gives her no time to prepare, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s thighs and burying her face between them. The first lick makes her moan into Agatha’s pussy.</p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha yells, hips bucking.</p><p>Rio tightens her arms to keep Agatha’s hips in place, keeping her eyes on the other woman’s face, and doubles down with her tongue, flicking and circling Agatha’s dripping hole and pushing the tip inside.</p><p>“Oh my God,” Agatha half complains, tossing her head to the side. “What are you—ahhh—”</p><p>Rio smirks and wiggles the tip of her tongue inside, then pushes until her jaw aches.</p><p>Agatha’s hands come off the headboard, but Rio gives one thigh a sharp pinch and she puts them right back.</p><p>Rio slides her tongue around, then out, and sucks on Agatha’s clit with a strong, pulsing rhythm. When she hears Agatha’s breathing change, she rides it out for a few more seconds, and when Agatha’s about to come, she slowly eases off.</p><p>Agatha cries out in protest, though honestly she knew it was coming so Rio doesn’t see the point. “Don’t complain. You earned it,” she says harshly.</p><p>“It’s frustrating,” Agatha says, winded. “I can’t help making noises.” She starts to sit up, but Rio unwinds her arms and puts a hand on her chest to push her back down.</p><p>“That one was for the hearse comment. The next one will be for the ass comment.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her, horrified. “You’re actually going to do this to me for every comment?”</p><p>“I told you I don’t make idle threats,” Rio says. “Buckle up.”</p><p>She slips her fingers into Agatha without warning, curling and pressing and lightly scratching, building her back up to the point she’s rocking her hips and moaning with every thrust. She’s so hot and wet it’s almost a crime not to make her come, but that ship has sailed for tonight and Rio’s no wuss when it comes to following through with punishments.</p><p>When Agatha’s thighs start to tremble and her back arches, Rio slides her fingers out and puts them in her mouth to watch the fallout from edge number two.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fly open, her hips chasing Rio’s fingers, and she slams them back down to the bed with a ridiculous whine. “No!” she shouts. “Come on!”</p><p>Rio leans down to kiss her hip. “The next one’s for purposely spilling your creamer on my papers.”</p><p>“This isn’t fair,” Agatha says. “My clit hurts.”</p><p>Rio licks it and makes Agatha twitch. She slides down the bed a little so she can lay between Agatha’s legs, and casually attaches her mouth to the inside of one thigh, sucking a dark bruise onto the pale skin.</p><p>Agatha squirms and whimpers and angles her hips toward Rio’s mouth. “Please,” she tries.</p><p>“Turn over,” Rio says, sitting up.</p><p>Agatha flips onto her stomach and takes hold of the headboard again without being asked. She’s trying to earn points, but there are no points to be earned.</p><p>“Get your knees under you and lift up so I can see your pretty little asshole,” Rio says.</p><p>“Oh my God,” Agatha squeaks, and Rio’s glad she found something that surprises the formidable woman.</p><p>It’s a slow process aided by lack of coordination, but Agatha pulls her knees under herself so she can raise her hips and show off her ass.</p><p>Rio slaps it. The fifth stroke from earlier. And then she gathers slick on one finger and pushes it into Agatha’s asshole.</p><p>Agatha shrieks and shakes the headboard, which rattles the iron bedframe, but a second later she’s pushing back for more contact and Rio grins to herself. She drops her other hand to rub across Agatha’s flank, her hip, the front of her thigh, and between her legs to tweak and pull at her sensitive clit.</p><p>Agatha’s instantly on the verge, panting and grunting, trying to draw Rio’s finger further into her ass and further onto her clit at the same time.</p><p>Rio waits until Agatha is truly about to drop off the edge, then abruptly removes all touch, and Agatha screams in frustration and stretches out on her stomach, in tears.</p><p>“Please!” she sobs, shaking the headboard again, kicking her feet and then curling into a ball, covering her face with her hands.</p><p>It tugs at Rio’s heart, but Agatha deserves to be punished for the way she treats people, and there are very few things she expects would make Agatha feel genuinely punished. This is one of them. “The next one is for pretending to snore during a staff meeting.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha cries, shaking her head, still covering her face. “I can’t, please, Rio I can’t take it, please, no more…”</p><p>Rio strokes up and down her back, moving over her, kissing the side of her face just beyond where her hands are hiding it. “You can take it, sweet girl,” she says, kissing Agatha’s temple again. “You’ve been so good for me. You can do this, Agatha. You can take your punishment like a good naughty girl. Open your legs, honey. Let me between them. Let me touch you.”</p><p>Agatha is breathing hard and shaking, but she rolls onto her back and parts her legs a few inches.</p><p>It’s good enough for Rio. It shows effort and intent to behave. She rubs her palm in firm circles over Agatha’s lower belly, trying to coax her into relaxing, and Agatha’s legs fall open a little bit more. “There you go,” Rio preens. “So good. That’s my girl.” She slides her hand lower and closes her eyes at the slick heat that wets her fingertips. She draws tiny patterns around Agatha’s clit, not yet touching, just stimulating and bringing it back to attention.</p><p>When Agatha’s hips start weakly seeking her hand, she pushes two fingers gently into Agatha’s cunt and closes her mouth over one pierced nipple, flicking the ring with her tongue.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha keens, still crying, her back arching into Rio’s mouth. “Oh God… your mouth… your fingers… I can’t—I can’t…” She’s tossing her head side to side, but her hands are no longer covering her face.</p><p>“Don’t resist letting me take you to the edge,” Rio scolds softly. “This is your punishment. Don’t hold back. Give me everything.”</p><p>She feels the tension leave Agatha’s body, feels Agatha give in to her and start to climb toward oblivion, no longer trying to protect herself.</p><p>“Good,” she says, pushing her fingers in harder, scraping over Agatha’s clit with her thumb. She once again brings her to the very edge of the edge, letting her start to tip over this time before she withdraws, and the feral scream from Agatha’s throat is startling and heartbreaking.</p><p>“No!” Agatha wails, and Rio understands, because even though Agatha’s brain knows she wasn’t going to be allowed to come, her body has no idea. The shut down is devastating and painful.</p><p>Rio knows it hurts.</p><p>Agatha flips over and sobs brokenly into the pillows, pulling her knees underneath her and pressing her stomach down against them, and Rio can feel how tightly she’s tensed up. She’s afraid Agatha is going to pull a muscle if she keeps that up.</p><p>“You’re okay,” she hums, pressing little kisses up and down Agatha’s spine until the tension starts to ease. She taps on Agatha’s knees. “Stretch out, sweet girl. We don’t want you getting a pulled muscle, okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s still sobbing, face pressed into the pillows, but she listens to Rio and inches her way back onto her stomach with a little stretch.</p><p>“The next one is for walking out of the staff meeting after insulting everyone in the room by saying you weren’t there for a meet and greet.”</p><p>Agatha sobs harder, her words muffled by the pillows. “Rio, please, no more, <em>please</em>! I’ll do anything! I swear, I’ll do anything! I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!”</p><p>Rio is so turned on by the desperate pleading that she has to watch herself. She would never damage Agatha no matter how hot she gets, but sometimes in topspace she gets… cocky. And she doesn’t want this to go that way. She wants to be gentle and understanding, the entire time. “I know you’re sorry,” she says after calming her raging libido. “My good girl. I know you’re sorry, and you’re going to do better from now on, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Yes!” Agatha swears. “I will, I promise, just please, no more… It hurts so much… I can’t—I can’t take it, I really can’t.”</p><p>“You can take as much as I give you, honey, I know you can,” Rio says, stroking Agatha’s back and shoulders. “But my hand’s getting tired so I’m going to have to use my strap.”</p><p>“No!” Agatha howls. “I’ll come and ruin everything! I can’t take a strap without coming, I can’t do it—”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says in warning.</p><p>“Witch killer,” Agatha says and covers her face again. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, please stop, I—”</p><p>“Shh,” Rio says, immediately laying down next to her. “Don’t apologize for safewording, ever.” She tries to pull Agatha into her arms but Agatha resists. “Don’t be sorry. Come here, let me hold you.”</p><p>“But I—”</p><p>“You stated a limit. You’re a good girl for doing that. You communicated perfectly.”</p><p>Agatha lets Rio pull her in and snuggles up to her. “You’re not upset I didn’t make it all the way through?”</p><p>“First of all, safewording will never upset me as long as I live,” Rio says. “And secondly, you made it a lot farther than I would have. You did amazing, honey. I’m so proud.”</p><p>Agatha seems to finally believe her and relaxes fully against her, burying her face into Rio’s neck. “You are so good at this,” she breathes after a minute.</p><p>Rio’s ego flares and she shoves it down. “Good at what, exactly?” she asks for clarification. Agatha could mean any number of things.</p><p>“Everything. All of it. Praising me. Punishing me. Teaching me. You’re good at edging, at spanking, at calling me on my bullshit, at making me feel sorry for the <em>bad</em> things I’ve said and done. You’re patient and kind but you don’t let me walk all over you. You apologize when you make mistakes, and it helps me apologize when I make them too. You’re good at sex. And snuggling. And coaxing me into accepting what I deserve, whether it’s comfort or punishment.” She stops to take a breath and tilts her head back to look at Rio. “And you’re good at being so fucking hot that I can’t count the amount of times I’ve gotten myself off just thinking about you over the last two months.”</p><p>Rio stares at her. “Jesus,” she finally whispers when Agatha stops listing all the things she’s good at. “I mean tha—thank you, but… Jesus.” She runs a hand through her hair and exhales through her nose. “I’m—yeah.”</p><p>“Speechless? Tongue tied? Stunned stupid?”</p><p>Rio feels her mouth pull into a grin. “All of the above.”</p>

<p>A few minutes of comfortable silence later, Rio reaches over and grabs one of the water bottles, taking a long drink, and then offers it to Agatha.</p><p>“I’m not thirsty.”</p><p>“Please drink at least a few sips. It’s important.”</p><p>Agatha nods and takes it, finishing off the rest of the water and stretching her arm to set the empty bottle on the nightstand. She then immediately curls back up against Rio.</p><p>Rio could get used to the weight of Agatha’s head on her chest. She slips her right arm under Agatha’s neck to hold her more easily and pulls one of Agatha’s legs over her hips. Yeah, she could definitely get used to this. Especially when Agatha drapes an arm over her middle, hand resting on her side.</p><p>“Are you ready to talk?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says, scratching lightly at Rio’s side.</p><p>“Can you hold your hand still for me until we’re done talking? I don’t want to be distracted.”</p><p>Agatha’s motions stop.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio says, kissing the top of her head. Even Agatha’s fucking <em>hair</em> tastes good. How is that even—ugh. No distractions. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>“Physically or emotionally?”</p><p>“Either one. We’ll discuss both.”</p><p>“Physically… tired out. Sore almost everywhere. From tensing up so much, I think. I—I know you tried to help me not do that. I couldn’t—”</p><p>“It’s okay, honey,” Rio interrupts, giving her neck a gentle squeeze. “You don’t have to explain yourself. Just share with me how you’re feeling. Any and every thing you feel is valid.”</p><p>Agatha tightens herself around Rio. “Okay,” she says. “Tired out, sore, aching, and uh, my clit still hurts a little, but it’s getting better.”</p><p>Rio glances down to see Agatha blushing. She’ll never tire of the sight. “It’ll fade soon,” she says. “Thank you for telling me. And emotionally?”</p><p>“Drained,” Agatha starts off. “H-------appy? I think? I don’t know. I think I’m happy. I’m—” She looks up at Rio, and the adoration in her gaze almost steals Rio’s breath. “I feel… cared for. Uh… important, I think.” She starts to scratch at Rio’s side again and quickly stops herself. “Safe. And… relaxed, maybe.”</p><p>Rio smiles down at her and presses her lips to Agatha’s forehead for a very long moment. She’s about to ask something else when Agatha speaks again.</p><p>“What about you?”</p><p>If Rio’s eyebrows could leave her body, they’d shoot off her face and stick to the ceiling. “What?”</p><p>“Your feelings,” Agatha explains, as if Rio’s stunned exclamation was a request for clarification and not a protest of what she found to be a very unexpected question. “Is it—am I not supposed to ask that?”</p><p>“No, it’s okay, it’s just… different,” Rio says. “No one’s ever asked me that in this situation before.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrows. “And people think <em>I’m</em> selfish.”</p><p>Rio snorts out a soft laugh and strokes the back of Agatha’s neck almost absently as she thinks. “Physically, I’m comfortable. Your head on my chest feels very nice, like it’s—” <em>Meant to be there? Come on, Rio</em>. “With your arm and your leg draped over me too it’s like a weighted blanket.” Hopefully Agatha won’t notice the bizarre chopping block her sentence landed on. “Emotionally, I guess I’m also comfortable. I’m grateful for the trust you gave me and are continuing to give me. I feel… protective.” <em>Rio, shut up</em>. “I’m happy. Very content, you know. And still a little turned on, but no you can’t touch me tonight.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t groan or complain or say something sassy like Rio expects. “Protective? Like you have to protect yourself from me?”</p><p>Oh God oh God oh God. Agatha’s interpretation of the word is even worse than the embarrassing way Rio meant it. And now she has to explain it because she can’t let Agatha think that. “No,” she says quickly. “I meant protective over you. We’ve gone through the gauntlet of emotions together the past week and I... well, we can add embarrassed to my list of feelings.”</p><p>“What would you need to protect me from?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Anything. <em>Everything</em>. “Sorry, that’s weird.”</p><p>“It’s not,” Agatha says, sounding urgent. “It’s not weird.”</p><p>Rio looks down and Agatha’s eyes are filled with tears. Her heart catches in her chest and she slides her free hand over Agatha’s cheek. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“I’m so sorry I hit you,” Agatha breathes. “I’ll never do it again, I swear. You didn’t deserve that, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>The tears leak out.</p><p>“Hey, shh,” Rio says, holding her tighter. “It’s okay, honey.”</p><p>“And sp—spitting, I—” She slides her hand up from Rio’s side to grab the collar of her blouse. “There’s no—it’s disgusting and there’s no excuse for it and I’m so, so sorry,” she whispers, the tears continuing to fall.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio says again and holds her while she cries.</p><p>A few minutes later Agatha sniffs and wipes her face on Rio’s sleeve.</p><p>Rio’s mouth quirks up on one side. “I think you just used my blouse as a face cloth.”</p><p>“At least I didn’t blow my nose on it. Do you have any tissues?”</p><p>“On the nightstand you put the empty water bottle on.”</p><p>Agatha turns over and reaches for a tissue, blows her nose, and drops it in the trash can between the bed and the stand.</p><p>When she turns back over, Rio kisses her.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes go wide, then hooded, and she melts into the kiss.</p><p>She’s so fucking <em>pliant</em>. Rio slides a hand into her hair to control her head, holding Agatha’s mouth against hers as she claims it.</p><p>She can feel Agatha shudder everywhere they’re touching. “Okay, I shouldn’t be doing that right now,” she says when she pulls back. “We’re supposed to talk and process, not get worked back up.”</p><p>It says something about how tired Agatha is that she doesn’t even whine. She just nods and curls up against Rio again, draping her arm back where it had been.</p><p>“We’ll talk a little more and then I’ll give you a bath, okay? Get you cleaned up?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingernails dig into her side. “You don’t have to do that.”</p><p>Rio puts a hand over Agatha’s, bringing the other woman’s attention to the fact that she’s digging her nails in, and Agatha relaxes her hand.</p><p>“Talk to me,” Rio prompts her. “What just happened?”</p><p>“It just sounds like a lot of work for you after you already put in a lot of work, and I can bathe myself.”</p><p>Rio hears what isn’t being said. “So you’re afraid of being a burden.”</p><p>“I don’t want you to have to work that hard the whole time you’re with me.”</p><p>“You’re afraid I’ll get burnt out.”</p><p>“I don’t deserve you to be so good to me after everything I’ve put you through.”</p><p>“You’re afraid I’ll decide you’re not worth it.”</p><p>The way Agatha stares anywhere but at Rio and the way she doesn’t argue paints a clear picture.</p><p>“Agatha, look at me.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head but it’s not defiance, it’s shame.</p><p>“Look at me,” Rio says again. “If you can’t look at me right now, I’ll wait until you can.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes find hers.</p><p>“Doms like to take care of their submissives. It makes us feel good, and powerful, and important. Providing aftercare is not a <em>burden</em>, it’s a valued routine. It’s not hard work, honey. I enjoy it. And you deserve every single thing I want to give you, whether it’s comfort, punishment, intimacy, or care. Have I made my position on this perfectly clear to you?”</p><p>“You have,” Agatha whispers.</p><p>“And do you believe me?”</p><p>Agatha nods. “Yes.”</p><p>“Good. So are you ready for a bath?”</p><p>“It sounds perfect.”</p><p>“Come on then.”</p><p>Rio hops off the bed and heads for the bathroom, stopping when she hears Agatha’s knees hit the floor. She turns and shakes her head. “You don’t need to crawl right now. Walk with me.”</p><p>Looking a little dazed, Agatha gets to her feet and walks with Rio to the bathroom.</p><p>Rio busies herself running a bath while Agatha stands behind her, waiting. “How hot do you like the water?” She turns her head in time to see Agatha shrug.</p><p>Somehow, she thinks Agatha is still skirting subspace. Maybe the bath will help her come safely out of it. Rio won’t do anything to force her out.</p><p>Unless Agatha wants twenty-four/seven D/s, which is a whole other monster entirely. She’ll see what happens after the bath, and they can cross that bridge if they come to it.</p><p>She adjusts the water to be warm but not hot and lets it fill the rest of the way up, then shuts off the tap and stands up, stroking Agatha’s cheek. “Climb in.”</p><p>Agatha bends her face to the touch and steps into the bath at the instruction, and Rio helps her settle down into the water.</p><p>“Warm enough?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha hums. “Thank you.”</p><p>Kneeling next to the tub, Rio swirls her hand in the water and scoops some up to drop over Agatha’s neck and chest. “What are you thinking?” she asks, resting her forearms on the tub’s rim and just looking at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s hazy eyes slowly find Rio’s. “How beautiful you are,” she whispers.</p><p>It’s so sincere, so heartfelt, that Rio feels a flush to her cheeks that she hasn’t felt in a very long time. She’s not easily embarrassed. “Thank you,” she says, scratching at the side of her nose just for something to do to distract herself from the warmth in her face.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Agatha says, and Rio catches her gliding a hand up her thigh, its intent obvious.</p><p>She reaches down and takes hold of Agatha’s wrist, gently. “Honey, no,” she says. “First of all, you’re too sensitive, and second of all, you’re not allowed to come tonight.”</p><p>“But I took my punishment,” Agatha says, her voice pleading, not abrasive.</p><p>But Rio knows it can be flipped like a switch. She treads carefully. “You did,” she agrees. “You took it very well, and you were so good and desperate and perfect for me. Can you be good for just a little while longer, please? It’ll make me so proud of you.” She can tell she’s drawn Agatha in to the idea of behaving just a bit longer. “Can you do that for me, sweet girl?”</p><p>The last part seems to tip Agatha over and she relaxes her wrist in Rio’s grip, closes her eyes and nods her head. “Yes, Rio.”</p><p>Rio breathes an internal sigh of relief. “Thank you,” she says, and reaches for the body wash.</p><p>She is careful but thorough as she cleans Agatha up, and she knows Agatha has safely emerged from subspace when she finishes washing and is met with a smirk.</p><p>“What?” she asks warily.</p><p>“I made you blush.”</p><p>“Congratulations,” she mumbles.</p><p>Agatha throws her head back and cackles. “Thank you,” she says, an obvious and sarcastic misuse of her new manners. “Towel?”</p><p>Rio holds out a towel and Agatha climbs into it, letting Rio wrap her up and start to dry her off.</p><p>“Listen,” she says suddenly. “I’ve never gotten this far with anyone. Or… they’ve never gotten this far with me. What do we do now? I’m guessing I don’t sleep here? My clothes are in the living room, so I’ll just go get dressed and you can take me back to the school? Unless you don’t feel like driving and I can call an Uber or a—”</p><p>Rio stops her with a finger over her lips, and Agatha quiets, but in true Agatha fashion, she sucks Rio’s fingertip into her mouth.</p><p>Rio pulls it away instantly and strokes Agatha’s cheek instead. “I’ll drive you back to the school if that’s what you want, but you <em>are</em> welcome to sleep here.” God, Rio wants her to sleep here.</p><p>“Oh, I can’t,” Agatha says casually. Too casually.</p><p>Rio understands and tries to sound casual too. “Yeah yeah, I’ll drive you back.”</p><p>“Yeah. I’ll just…” Agatha gestures over her shoulder toward the bathroom door but doesn’t move toward it.</p><p>“Right. Your clothes. They’re in the…” Rio doesn’t move either.</p><p>“The living room,” Agatha finishes for her, and after another minute of staring at each other, Agatha finally moves.</p><p>Rio blows out a frustrated breath and flicks the lever on the drain to let the water out of the bathtub. She runs her hands over her face and steels herself to let Agatha go home when all she wants is to hold her the whole night.</p><p>“I’m dressed, you can come out,” Agatha calls in a teasing voice.</p><p>Rio shakes herself into gear and joins Agatha in the living room. They don’t talk on their way to the car, or on the drive to the school. But when Agatha goes to get out of the car without speaking, Rio grabs her elbow. “Hey.”</p><p>Agatha looks at her with an unreadable expression.</p><p>“You’re not going to say good night?”</p><p>“Good night,” Agatha says, but it’s detached. Guarded. Walled off. And Rio already misses the intimacy of having Agatha on her knees. Figuratively, for the most part, but literally was also fucking great.</p><p>“Where’s your car?” The lot is empty.</p><p>“I park in the front.”</p><p>“Of course you do. I’ll drive you around.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says, detaching further as she gets out of the car. “It’s a short walk. Good night.” She shuts the door, and she hasn’t slammed it or been rude, but Rio feels it like a sucker punch anyway. Not because of the way it’s <em>done</em>, but because of the way it isn’t.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio lays in bed after she gets back from dropping Agatha at the school. She needs to be asleep now, she has to get up for work in the morning, but she can’t sleep. She’s too busy obsessing over the sweet submissive moments when she had Agatha down in subspace and wondering what to expect in the morning.</p><p>Should she go to Agatha’s classroom to say hi? Is that what people do after they spend most of the night denying their co-worker orgasms? They go out of their way to say hello the next morning? It’s probably a bad idea. She should just go to her own classroom. Not do anything different. Not set herself up for an awkward interaction. If they see each other naturally during the day, it won’t be awkward. If Rio seeks her out deliberately, it could even trigger Agatha to pull further away.</p><p>What is she supposed to fucking do? It’s torture. She wants Agatha next to her in bed. She wants to feel Agatha’s hair under her hands and Agatha’s breath against her neck, Agatha’s weight on her again when they were tangled together and draped around each other.</p><p>“Fuck!” she shouts at the ceiling.</p><p>And why hadn’t she gotten Agatha’s phone number?!</p><p>--</p><p>Rio is sluggish as she drags herself into work in the morning. She hadn’t fallen asleep until after three o’clock. Her final decision is to go about her day the way she would have before things happened with Agatha.</p><p>And then she goes to the copy room during her lunch break to pick up the afternoon’s worksheets, but they’re not on the printer. “What the hell?”</p><p>She goes back to her classroom and double checks that she sent the job to the right printer. She did. So where are her worksheets?</p><p>She sends the job to the printer again and goes to retrieve her materials, but again they’re not printed.</p><p>She checks to make sure the machine has paper in all of the trays, and it does. “What the fuck!” she swears just as one of the other teachers comes in.</p><p>“Job missing?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says. “I tried it twice. There’s paper in all the trays and I verified I sent it to this printer.”</p><p>“Yeah, good luck. Between twelve and two, everyone knows not to use this machine because Harkness overrides everyone’s jobs so she can print her progress monitoring data.”</p><p>“Are you f—” Rio stops herself, because she doesn’t know why she’s surprised. She runs her hands over her face and fairly storms out of the copy room, toward Agatha’s classroom.</p><p>When she gets there she takes a deep breath, then goes in without knocking.</p><p>Agatha is standing at the back of the room leaning over one of her students, explaining something she’s pointing to on the table in front of them.</p><p>Rio stands and watches, marveling at the softness on Agatha’s face when she talks to her student; the relaxed body language. And she’s afraid what she’s going to see on Agatha’s face when the other woman looks up and finds her in the doorway.</p><p>So she interrupts, to avoid experiencing that moment. “Excuse me, Agatha, I need a moment.”</p><p>Agatha looks up with a feral snarl, teeth bared, and it takes a concerted effort for Rio not to back out of the room.</p><p>“It’ll have to wait, because—”</p><p>Rio interrupts again. “It won’t wait. I need to speak to you in the hall. Now.”</p><p>Agatha stalks over to her, clearly trying to intimidate her out of the room, but Rio only sidesteps, she doesn’t back away.</p><p>“What could be so goddamn important that you’re interrupting my class?” Agatha says, eyes narrowed.</p><p>“In the hall, please,” Rio insists. She’s not going to manhandle Agatha in front of her classroom aides. Who are all sneaking glances their way in between whatever they’re working on with the students.</p><p>“I’m not about to leave my cl—”</p><p>“Get in the fucking hallway,” Rio hisses so violently that Agatha actually backs away from her and steps into the hallway.</p><p>Thank fucking God.</p><p>Rio follows and when the door is shut, she says, “If you don’t want the cameras to see me grab you by the ear and frog march you to the nearest staff bathroom, you’d better walk there on your own right now.”</p><p>Agatha growls like a caged beast, but, Rio notes, she starts walking toward the nearest set of bathrooms.</p><p>There are maybe five or six male staff members as opposed to a few dozen females, so Rio nods toward the men’s room. “In there.”</p><p>“I’m not going in the—”</p><p>Rio reaches around her to open the door and body checks her inside, then flicks the lock when it shuts behind them. “You override everyone else’s print and copy jobs between twelve and two pm?”</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrow and she puts her hands on her hips. “Everyone knows that. Why did you bring me into a men’s fucking bathroom to talk about it?”</p><p>Rio grabs her around the back of the neck and bends her over the sink, then hauls off and slaps her ass.</p><p>Agatha shrieks and struggles against the hold, but Rio has enough leverage to keep her there.</p><p>“Get your pants undone and I swear to fucking God if you make me say it again.”</p><p>“This is—this is—” Agatha stutters, but her hands disappear underneath her and Rio sees the pants loosen.</p><p>She grabs them with her free hand and yanks them down, along with Agatha’s underwear – purple lace, incidentally, and very sexy. There’s a red mark from the first slap and Rio wastes no time bringing her palm to bear over and over and over, until Agatha stops fighting her hold and just lays over the sink breathing heavily.</p><p>“Stay,” Rio commands, and when Agatha just whimpers in response, she lifts her hand from the other woman’s neck to undo her belt.</p><p>She frees it from her belt loops in one second flat and folds it in half, then cracks it across the middle of Agatha’s rosy ass cheeks.</p><p>Agatha yelps and starts to stand up, but Rio growls “down”, and to her unhinged pleasure, Agatha obeys.</p><p>After that, Rio whips the belt with unyielding strength, hitting the same spot multiple times in a row with the folded tip until Agatha’s red skin starts to bruise purple, then switches cheeks and does the same to the other.</p><p>“Shit, Rio, stop, wait, I’m sorry, fuck, fuck! Rio, Rio, Rio, please!”</p><p>Agatha chanting her name like a prayer cuts something deep inside her and bleeds it dry.</p><p>“Rio Rio please,” Agatha says again, and Rio can hear the tears in her voice.</p><p>Rio stops but doesn’t put her belt back on. “Why did you shut me out last night?”</p><p>Agatha looks over her shoulder with a pained expression and the tears tracking down her cheeks make Rio’s chest tighten along with her cunt. “I—I didn’t,” Agatha lies.</p><p>Rio’s beyond irritated that Agatha’s blatantly fucking lying to her. She drops the belt to grab a handful of unruly hair and pumps soap onto the index finger of her other hand, forcing it into Agatha’s mouth and swiping along the back of her teeth.</p><p>Agatha splutters and gags and looks like she’s about to spit.</p><p>“If you spit that out I will give you a mouthful,” Rio promises. “Swallow it.”</p><p>Agatha is a writhing, choking mess at this point and she slides off the sink to kneel in front of Rio, hands clutching desperately at Rio’s pants. She swallows the soap and dry heaves for a few seconds, then buries her face against Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“Please please please, I’m sorry,” she begs. “I was protecting myself,” she finally admits when Rio doesn’t respond to the begging.</p><p>“Why? What reason did I give you to need to do that?”</p><p>“You didn’t,” Agatha says, sniffing and wiping her face on Rio’s pants. Luckily they’re black.</p><p>“Then why?” She’s not speaking as harshly anymore but she’s still not ready to let her guard back down.</p><p>“I don’t want to get attached,” Agatha says after kneeling there in silence for several moments.</p><p>Rio’s heart skips. “Why not?”</p><p>“Because chances are this is just some fun for you,” Agatha says quietly. “Tame the beast. Put me down and move on to the next pathetic asshole that needs your services.”</p><p>“How fucking dare you?” Rio breathes, pulling Agatha away from her by the hair.</p><p>“No, no,” Agatha whines, trying to hide her face in Rio’s thighs again.</p><p>“You think that little of me? That I would <em>use</em> you to get myself off and then be done? All the effort I put in to ensuring your emotional safety, that means what? Nothing? Was I faking it?”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha whispers, and her eyes fill with tears again. “I don’t know how to do this.”</p><p>“To do what? Be a human being? Climb off of that pedestal you’re always standing on?”</p><p>“Let someone close,” Agatha says shakily.</p><p>The wind sort of whooshes out of Rio’s sails at that and she sighs, letting go of Agatha’s hair, and Agatha immediately presses her face into Rio’s thighs. “Did you ever think of having a fucking conversation with me about it? Maybe asking me what my intentions are?”</p><p>“I’m not brave enough for that,” Agatha says, muffled against her pants. “Is that why you spanked me? Because of last night?”</p><p>“No, I spanked you because you said you were going to do better and yet here you are, overriding everyone else’s print jobs to serve your own needs. Like a selfish, spoiled brat.”</p><p>Agatha looks up at her, jaw dropped. “You were serious about that? You actually expect me to change the way I treat <em>everyone</em>? Not just you?”</p><p>Rio stares. She can’t really believe what she’s hearing. Agatha thought she was joking? About teaching her manners? That it was all a game? “It’s not a game,” she says tersely, and feels Agatha tense up.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha says in a rush. “<em>Rio</em>.” She sounds broken. “Please don’t give up.”</p><p>“I’m not going to,” Rio says, finally letting some emotion other than anger back into her voice. “But it’s not a game, do you understand that now? I’m a person with feelings too. I don’t just throw my weight around dominating every pretty girl with a bad attitude. Who I choose to give my time to means something to me.”</p><p>“I didn’t know,” Agatha whispers.</p><p>Rio grabs her by the jaw and squeezes. “You should’ve asked.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyelids flutter and she pants softly. “I should have.”</p><p>“You will ask.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks go red. “Is this just fun for you?” she asks, averting her eyes.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio tosses her the most basic of praises and closes a hand lightly over her throat, watching her eyes roll back. “It is not <em>just</em> fun,” she says, voice authoritative and smooth. “It is fun, of course, but it means something, too. A part of me is invested, so when you shut me out, it’s hurtful.”</p><p>Agatha whimpers and shrinks into herself a little. “I didn’t mean to,” she manages, trembling. “I don’t want to hurt you. You’re the first person to ever put me on my knees, in any sense. I don’t want to hurt you, Rio. I don’t want to hurt you, ever.”</p><p>Rio lets go of her throat. “You won’t,” she says, and it’s very clearly an order as well as reassurance that she believes in Agatha.</p><p>“Do you really want more than one night with me?” Agatha asks after they’re silent for a few seconds. “You’re not sick of my attitude already?”</p><p>“I’m entirely sick of your attitude, but not in any way that would make me stop wanting to beat and choke and fuck it out of you.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a strangled sound of longing and leans her head back, baring her throat, which Rio drags her nails over, leaving parallel welts.</p><p>The strangled sound forms more fully into a moan. “Oh God. Please. Everyone’s going to see that.”</p><p>“Are you complaining or thanking me?” Rio asks, an eyebrow lifting. Fuck, Agatha is beautiful. Flushed and messy and wrecked, kneeling on the bathroom floor at her feet.</p><p>“Both,” Agatha whines, quiet.</p><p>“You’re not going to override a single print or copy job from this moment forward, correct?” Rio asks, because they really do have to get the fuck out of this bathroom and go back to work.</p><p>“But I have to print my progress monitoring data…”</p><p>Rio’s eyes bug. “Then you can fucking wait your turn like everyone else! You’re not the only teacher in this building, Agatha! Get up. Get back over the sink.”</p><p>“What? Oh, fuck. Rio, please. I’ll never override a job, I swear. Please, please, it still hurts so fucking much. I can’t—”</p><p>“Bend. Over,” Rio says, refusing to give an inch. Agatha’s response, especially after everything that just happened, was ridiculous. “If I have to force you again I’ll pick that belt back up.”</p><p>Agatha scrambles to her feet and bends over the sink, her eyes screwed shut, her lower lip worried between her teeth.</p><p>Rio pops her a few times over the bruises and then pulls her clothes back into place. “Fix your pants.”</p><p>Agatha mewls in protest at the slaps, but at the demand she complies quickly, doing up the button and zipper in record time. She probably thinks that will save her from any more punishment.</p><p>“Look here.”</p><p>Agatha turns her face to Rio and Rio gets a wet paper towel to clean her smeared makeup and erase the dried tears from her cheeks. There’s nothing to be done for the welts on her throat, though, and that’s fine with Rio.</p><p>“Come to my classroom after school.”</p><p>Agatha exhales and nods. “I’ll be there as soon as my kids are on their vans.”</p><p>Rio nods and shakes off the emotional turmoil of the last however many hours, unlocks the door, and opens it.</p><p>The principal’s wife is standing in the hallway and looks over when they emerge. “What were you doing in the men’s bathroom together?” she asks.</p><p>“Blowing your husband, you nosy old hag,” Agatha snaps.</p><p>OhmyGod. “I—Mrs. Hart, would you excuse us please?” Rio says, her face bright red as she ushers Agatha back into the bathroom and locks the door. “Are you fucking kidding me? Are you kidding me?”</p><p>Agatha cringes. “Shit.”</p><p>“You have two options. Would you like to hear them?” Rio asks tightly.</p><p>Agatha’s still grimacing as she nods.</p><p>“One, go back out there and apologize. Two, get a mouthful of soap, then go back out there and apologize.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes go glassy and wide. “I can’t apologize,” she says, horrified.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Rio says in a low, dangerous voice.</p><p>It has the intended effect. Agatha is instantly cowed and bows her head. “I’ll apologize.”</p><p>Rio is so fucking wet. Just from those two words and that bowed head. “Turn around and get your body out into that hallway, apologize to Mrs. Hart, and get back to work.”</p><p>Agatha is so hasty to comply that she tries to get out the locked door, flustered when it won’t open, and pulls on it three times before she reaches up to unlock it and yanks it open.</p><p>Mrs. Hart is standing with her arms crossed over her chest, looking unimpressed. But Rio can see the twinkle in her eye. She probably heard at least some of what was said.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat and puffs up her chest, running a hand through her hair. “Sorry about that,” she says, and to her credit, it sounds half sincere, so Rio doesn’t comment. She just walks away, heading to her classroom to print her worksheets for the <em>third</em> time.</p>

<p>Rio finally gets her worksheets printed and is able to focus for the rest of the afternoon on teaching her lesson plans. The nagging feeling that’s been there since last night is gone after her chat with Agatha in the bathroom, although she still doesn’t know what to expect after school. Whether Agatha will show up of her own accord or Rio will have to track her down. What Agatha’s attitude will be like if and when she does show up. It’s been a roller coaster of a week, more so than she has ever experienced, including finals week in college.</p><p>Agatha shows up in the doorway about five minutes after the last bell, leaning on the frame, wearing a jacket and sunglasses like she’s ready to head out. “I thought I’d go for a drive up the coast. Join me?”</p><p>“Do you recognize and follow the authority of stop signs and traffic lights?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs one shoulder. “More or less.”</p><p>Rio grimaces but agrees, and follows Agatha out to the parking lot. “I thought you parked in the front,” she says as Agatha stops and unlocks a sleek purple sports car.</p><p>She can see the pink tinge to Agatha’s cheeks as she opens the driver’s door. “I moved the car after the printer conversation. I didn’t want another ‘selfish, spoiled brat’ incident.”</p><p>Rio freezes, her breath catching. “You moved the car so I wouldn’t call you selfish?”</p><p>Agatha repeats what she’d said about traffic laws and seems unwilling to discuss it further. “More or less.”</p><p>Rio wants more information but doesn’t push. She goes around the car and gets into the passenger seat. The interior is smooth grey leather, softer than any leather Rio’s ever touched. She buckles her seatbelt and glances over at Agatha, watching her prepare to drive. The way she adjusts the rearview mirror a fraction of an inch, squirms in her seat, and checks the side mirrors.</p><p>“Are we going anywhere specific, or just for a drive?”</p><p>“There’s a spot I like,” Agatha says, pulling out of the parking lot and heading for the highway.</p><p>Rio wonders why she’s been asked along on the drive, and spends the next fifteen minutes thinking of every possible reason Agatha would drive her up the coast.</p><p>The fifteen minutes after that she spends appreciating the view and the wind in her hair when they roll the windows down.</p><p>Soon after that, Agatha pulls over into an unofficial parking lot of sand and gravel, and shuts off the car.</p><p>She leads Rio up a set of stone stairs in the side of a hill, then up and around a hiking trail until they’re at the top of a cliff overlooking the water.</p><p>Agatha sits on the edge with her feet dangling over, and Rio sits next to her, mimicking the position.</p><p>Agatha looks so fucking beautiful in the setting sunlight, staring out at the water, it takes Rio’s breath away.</p><p>After they sit in silence for a long, long time, she finally speaks. “I didn’t like being disciplined at work.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw drops, her calm all but shattered, though she tries to hold onto it. “You didn’t safeword,” she whispers, a wave of nausea rolling through.</p><p>Agatha stares at her hands, which are in her lap, fiddling with the hem of her blouse. “I shouldn’t have to.”</p><p>The nausea gets stronger and Rio can feel bile rising in the back of her throat. She—she—what— “But I—”</p><p>“It wasn’t fair,” Agatha interrupts, her voice less hesitant.</p><p>Rio’s face screws up, and she wants to argue, or get up and run until she has a handle on herself, but instead she just listens. And thinks. And when she listens and thinks, the cold thread of truth snakes around her consciousness and she deflates completely, because Agatha is right. She had done something unfair because her feelings were hurt. Because she was in unfamiliar territory and lost her footing, and did what she had to do to gain it back.</p><p>“Shit,” she says, staring up at the sky. “You’re right.”</p><p>She can see Agatha out of the corner of her eye so she doesn’t miss the surprised expression.</p><p>“I should have waited.” She lifts her head to stare forward for a few seconds before turning to face Agatha. “Did I ruin it? Ruin everything, I mean?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says, and the answer is quick enough and forceful enough that Rio believes it.</p><p>“I felt out of control and took it back in the wrong way,” Rio admits. “I’m really sorry, Agatha. If you give me another chance, I’ll do better.”</p><p>“I’m not telling you this because I plan on ending our… arrangement,” Agatha says. “I’m telling you this because I desperately want to continue. But I don’t want to be dominated at work. If you need to punish me for something I’ve done at work, I’ll accept it later on when we’re alone.”</p><p>Rio feels so much all at once that she doesn’t know what to do with herself. “That’s fair,” she whispers. “It’ll never happen again.”</p><p>“Can you… why did you feel so out of control?” Agatha asks, biting her lip, which only makes Rio feel <em>more</em> of everything.</p><p>“Because you shut me out. I shouldn’t have demanded answers when I had you bent over, I should have told you how I felt and asked you to do the same. And if you refused, I should have accepted it like an adult.”</p><p>“Just to be clear,” Agatha says, scooting back from the edge of the cliff and pulling on Rio’s sleeve to get her to follow, “I liked what you did. I just didn’t like where and when you did it.”</p><p>Rio moves back at the tug on her sleeve, and at Agatha’s words, she nods. “I understand, and I really am sorry. Can I ask why you let me, though? Without sounding like I’m saying it’s not my fault? Because I accept the fault, I just… I think it’s important for me to know why you let me.”</p><p>Agatha breathes in through her nose and out through her mouth. “Because you’re very good at what you do. You make it easier to fall under your spell than I would ever have thought possible for myself.”</p><p>Rio feels tears threatening, starting at the back of her throat. She does her best to push them down. “Like being intoxicated,” she says quietly. “Impaired.” She puts her elbows on her knees and her head in her hands. Shit. She knows all this, intellectually. She’s known it since she was learning the ropes with her kinky friends over a decade ago. So why did she do it? Maybe that’s a truth she’s not ready to explore yet. The reason that Agatha shutting her out affected her so deeply after basically one night together. She knows her reaction was not the right size for the problem. And deep down she knows what it means, she just doesn’t want to admit that Agatha is already under her skin.</p><p>She feels a hand over one of hers and shakes herself out of her thoughts.</p><p>“Is there any way to recover from here?” She dares to turn her head and look at Agatha.</p><p>“If there wasn’t, I wouldn’t have brought you here. I would’ve told you where to shove it and how far. Just don’t ever put me in that position again and I will let you make me your bitch so hard your head will spin.”</p><p>Rio groans and flops backward into the dirt. “Fucking hell, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha cackles and gets to her feet. “You’re welcome.” She reaches down to help Rio up and Rio brushes off the back of her pants, then lets Agatha dust off the back of her blouse for her.</p><p>They walk next to each other but not touching, and when they reach the car, Rio’s about to get in when she can feel Agatha behind her, so she stops and turns, leaning back against the door. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha says, and her eyes are nearly crackling with electricity. “I just… want you to invite me over tonight.”</p><p>Rio’s cunt pulses and she grabs Agatha by the hips, squeezing. “I think we should wait until tomorrow, as much as I don’t want to. You’ve already been through the ringer today and came out with regret. I don’t want to move too fast. I mean I <em>do</em> want to move too fast, but I don’t.”</p><p>Agatha drops her head and tucks it against Rio’s neck. “Please?”</p><p>Rio’s entire body is on high alert and she wants to give in so badly, but the entire conversation they’ve just had is more important than what her clit wants, so she stays firm. “Tomorrow night, Agatha. Please?”</p><p>Agatha seems to register how serious Rio is and she stops pouting, straightens up and kisses Rio on the cheek. “Tomorrow night.”</p><p>--</p><p>The next day at work Agatha is extremely abrasive and rude, and Rio wonders if it’s a test to make sure she’ll keep her word, or if Agatha is just in a horrible mood. Either way, she doesn’t even look twice at the forest fire sweeping the school. She minds her business, teaches her class, and keeps a tally of Agatha’s offenses in her head, the most grievous of which was taking the coffeemaker from the staff break room to her own classroom first thing in the morning.</p><p>So Rio has gone without coffee, because she’s not going to risk a confrontation by going to take the machine back. She darts out to the closest coffee shop on her lunch break, which is annoying, because she doesn’t have time to sit and relax.</p><p>The other notable offenses of the day are taking all of the extra bags of chips from the cafeteria for her students when they’re supposed to be for any of the kids that forget to bring a snack from home, commandeering the printer again from twelve to two, asking Mr. Edelburg if he was born before Jesus, commenting on Mrs. Antonelli’s haircut by pretending to be electrocuted, and telling Rio she looked like a Bratz doll in her colorful jacket.</p><p>Rio files everything away for later, when she has Agatha at her mercy.</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha is standing in her doorway five minutes after the bell, just like yesterday, but without the jacket and sunglasses.</p><p>“I’ll meet you at my car,” Rio says dismissively, and watches her go.</p><p>She makes Agatha wait for her in the cool fall weather for fifteen minutes while she returns the coffeemaker to its rightful location, takes an armful of chip bags from Agatha’s classroom stash back to the cafeteria, goes to the bathroom, and straightens up her desk.</p><p>When she reaches the car, Agatha’s body language is tense and her voice is annoyed. “What the fuck were you doing in there?”</p><p>Rio ignores her and gets in the car, then reaches over and opens the passenger door.</p><p>Agatha kicks it shut.</p><p>So they’re doing this again, then.</p><p>Rio starts the car and shifts into drive, and Agatha’s in the passenger seat before she takes her foot off the brake.</p><p>“You made me stand in the cold for fifteen minutes waiting for you,” Agatha snaps. “Not exactly the kind of treatment I expect from a responsible dom.”</p><p>Rio flicks on the heater and drives. “I was returning your contraband to its rightful locations. And I’m not your dom until you’re inside my car.”</p><p>“I’ll take back what I want in the morning,” Agatha says petulantly and says nothing about the rest of it.</p><p>“We’ll see,” Rio says with a snort.</p><p>“I really fucking hate that jacket,” Agatha seethes.</p><p>“Good thing it’s not yours,” Rio says.</p><p>Agatha seems to run out of things to complain about for the moment and sits staring out the window for the rest of the drive.</p><p>--</p><p>When they’re in the house, Rio hangs up her keys and drops her purse in the entryway, then gives Agatha a nudge. “Go into the living room.”</p><p>Agatha takes her time waltzing to the requested room and stands looking bored, inspecting her fingernails.</p><p>“Take your shoes off,” Rio says, coming to stand in front of her.</p><p>“I can’t take you seriously in that jacket,” Agatha chortles.</p><p>Rio slaps her so hard she loses her balance and stumbles, and has to grab onto the arm of the sofa to keep from falling. When she stands back up, her pupils are blown and there’s a glaring red handprint on her face.</p><p>“Take your shoes off,” Rio repeats, and Agatha kicks them off. “You are not in charge of what I wear. If you have something you’d like to see me in, you can submit a request in writing to be reviewed at my convenience. Other than that, you have no bearing on my choice of clothing and will not comment on it, is that clear?”</p><p>Agatha’s breathing hard, standing perfectly still. “It’s clear,” she says, her voice choked, a shadow of the antagonistic snarl from a minute ago.</p><p>“Apologize.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Again.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath catches. “I’m sorry,” she repeats, air whooshing out of her lungs in the wake of the words.</p><p>“<em>Again</em>,” Rio snaps.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are swimming. “I’m sorry for commenting on your choice of clothing,” she finally says. “It’s none of my business.”</p><p>“That’s better,” Rio says, still not entirely impressed but willing to let it go. She’s wanted Agatha in her clutches since they left each other at the school last night. “Sit down.”</p><p>Agatha moves toward the sofa but Rio snaps and points at the floor, and after a slightly indignant look, she sinks down to sit cross-legged on the carpet.</p><p>“I’m going to list the offenses I catalogued today and you’re going to say yes or no.”</p><p>Agatha grimaces.</p><p>“Did you ask Mr. Edelburg if he was born before Jesus?”</p><p>Agatha laughs. “Yes.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t respond to the laugh because it’s not what she wants to focus on at the moment. “Did you pretend to be electrocuted when you saw Mrs. Antonelli’s haircut?”</p><p>“Did you see it? It looked like—”</p><p>“Yes or no,” Rio reminds her calmly, refusing to let Agatha take this off track.</p><p>“Yes,” she snorts.</p><p>“Did you take the coffeemaker from the staff room into your classroom?”</p><p>Agatha has apparently given up trying to steer Rio off course. “Yes.”</p><p>“Did you commandeer the printer from twelve to two?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Did you call me a Bratz doll?” Rio drops her voice on this one to let Agatha know she doesn’t find it in any way funny.</p><p>Agatha looks at the floor. “Yes.” Her voice is amused but Rio can tell she’s trying to behave. For the most part.</p><p>“You think it’s funny,” she says.</p><p>Agatha keeps looking at the floor. “Yes,” she admits.</p><p>Rio crouches down in front of her and puts a gentle finger under her chin. “Look at me, honey.”</p><p>Agatha gasps and raises her eyes, the amusement already gone from her body.</p><p>Rio strokes her cheek and rubs a thumb over her lips. “You think it’s funny to say hurtful things?”</p><p>Agatha’s next breath comes labored. “I—”</p><p>“To people who are meant to be your colleagues?”</p><p>“I—”</p><p>“To me?”</p><p>The last is delivered in a tiny whisper as Rio pushes her thumb into Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>Agatha sucks on it desperately and shakes her head.</p><p>Rio withdraws her thumb and traces saliva across Agatha’s jaw. “Answer me.”</p><p>“I thought it was funny before, and now I don’t,” Agatha says sincerely.</p><p>“What changed your mind?”</p><p>“You said… hurtful,” Agatha says, drawing in on herself. “I don’t want to hurt you.”</p><p>“Just me?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“You think it’s okay, or it’s funny, to hurt an elderly gentleman who’s spent his lifetime teaching even though he could have retired twenty years ago?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says quickly, her voice strained.</p><p>“You think that making a joke about his age is acceptable because he doesn’t move as quickly as you can?”</p><p>Agatha tries to grab Rio’s pants but she steps back out of reach. “Answer me.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says, still strained, grabbing handfuls of her own pants instead. “It’s not acceptable.”</p><p>“What about a woman who has never said an unkind word to anyone in the two months I’ve known her? Is it okay, or funny, to make her feel self-conscious about the way her hair looks?”</p><p>Agatha stares at the floor again and shakes her head. “No,” she whispers.</p><p>“Did you know she was already upset at having to cut her hair? One of the kids in her class got gum in it and it wouldn’t come out.”</p><p>Agatha looks up sharply, her eyes filled with tears. “Stop, I—I—” she stutters out. “I didn’t—”</p><p>“Didn’t think about anyone but yourself?” Rio asks, tilting her head.</p><p>Agatha raises up onto her knees, shuffles forward, and reaches for Rio’s pants again, and this time Rio lets her. She curls her fingers around the waistband like she usually does when she’s upset and needs guidance or comfort. (It’s only been twice they’ve done this and Rio already knows what Agatha usually does when she’s upset. Hm.)</p><p>“Punish me, please,” Agatha asks, cheek pressed to Rio’s stomach.</p><p>“Not yet, honey,” Rio says, stroking fingers through her hair. “I need you to be patient. We’re not done talking. Can you be a good, patient girl for me please?”</p><p>Agatha shivers and nods against her stomach.</p><p>“Thank you. Sit back down.”</p><p>Agatha whimpers brokenly at having to detach, but she doesn’t argue, she just backs up and sits cross legged on the carpet again.</p><p>“How many staff would you guess are in the building?” Rio asks when she’s settled.</p><p>“I don’t know. Maybe forty people?”</p><p>“I would guess the same. And how many of those staff are in your classroom?”</p><p>“Four.”</p><p>“Do you think it makes sense to have a coffeemaker where ten percent of the staff can use it?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flush. “No.”</p><p>“Why did you take it?”</p><p>The flush darkens. “To see what you’d do.”</p><p>“You felt the need to test me after I swore that what happened yesterday would never happen again?”</p><p>Agatha squirms. “Yes.”</p><p>Rio’s not going to be upset with her for that. “Okay, that’s fair, thank you for being honest,” she says, and clocks the surprise on Agatha’s face. “Is that why you overrode everyone’s print jobs again too?”</p><p>“Yeah. Yes.”</p><p>“Did I pass your test?”</p><p>Agatha’s face is bright red at this point. “Yes.”</p><p>“Will there be any further tests of that particular nature?”</p><p>“Tests to see if you’ll keep your word? No, there will not,” Agatha answers.</p><p>“I’m not going to punish you for the two things that were tests of whether you were safe around me,” Rio tells her after a few seconds of quiet. “But the things you said today… they were uncalled for, and they were mean, honey.”</p><p>“Yes, I know,” Agatha says, subdued again, the blush gone from her cheeks, her pallor going in the opposite direction. “I thought I was being clever and funny. And rude, but… I didn’t think about how hurtful my words could be. I—I guess I never have. I just figured people would think I’m an asshole and stay away from me, not be hurt and actually care what I say.”</p><p>That actually makes a lot of sense to Rio. “Your words matter because you matter,” she says.</p><p>It’s obvious Agatha doesn’t know what to do with that, because she hides her face in her hands. “Please, I can’t. I need punished.”</p><p>“I’m going to punish you,” Rio promises. “Take your hands away from your face.”</p><p>Agatha drops her hands but her eyes are closed.</p><p>“Open your eyes.”</p><p>“I can’t,” Agatha says, and it’s not defiant, it’s pleading. “I can’t look at you.”</p><p>Rio opts for gentleness to deal with Agatha’s shame. “I’m looking at <em>you</em>. You’re beautiful and ashamed for me, and I promise to punish you until you can look yourself in the mirror, but you <em>can</em> look at me. And you will. Right now please.”</p><p>Agatha lets her eyes flutter open, and the deep swirling storm in her irises tells Rio how badly she feels.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio says, stepping forward and pulling Agatha’s head toward her thighs.</p><p>Agatha buries her face gratefully and wraps her arms around Rio’s knees. “I’m sorry,” she says.</p><p>“I know, honey. You can show me how sorry you are by being good for your punishment.”</p><p>“I will, I swear,” Agatha says eagerly. “I’ll make you proud of me.”</p><p>“I am proud of you,” Rio assures her, scratching lightly at her scalp. “There are things I’m unhappy about, but that doesn’t take away from the things I’m proud of you for.”</p><p>Agatha holds her tighter. “I don’t want there to be anything you’re unhappy about,” she confesses. “I’ll be better, I—I’ll be nicer.”</p><p>Rio’s heart pounds and she has to remind herself that Agatha has promised this before. It might be sincere now, but that doesn’t mean it will carry over into the outside world. She inches over to the couch and sits down, disentangling herself from Agatha’s grip, and pats her lap. “Come sit.”</p><p>Agatha slinks onto her lap and curls up instantly, face pressed into the side of her neck. The transformation from volatile to submissive never ceases to amaze. It turns Rio on every single time. Knowing she is the one to put Agatha in this state of mind; she is the one Agatha will <em>allow</em> to put her in this state of mind. It’s so profoundly arousing that Rio can say with utter certainty she’s never felt anything like it.</p><p>“Honey,” she says, her tone not quite scolding but not quite permissive. “You’ve made that promise before, and you didn’t follow through with it.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha whines.</p><p>“It doesn’t need an apology,” Rio explains gently. “I’m not saying it to make you feel bad. I’m saying it because I want you to know that you’ll have to prove that promise to me before I accept it. Okay?”</p><p>“No, I’m sorry,” Agatha whines again, pressing her forehead almost painfully into Rio’s neck. “I’m sorry for being bad. Please teach me a lesson.”</p><p>“That’s what I am doing,” Rio says. “I’m letting you know that when you make a promise and don’t keep it, you have to work extra hard to prove it the next time. That is a lesson worth learning. Are we clear?”</p><p>Agatha stops whining and relaxes the force against Rio’s neck. “Please believe me,” she begs. “I didn’t keep the promise before because I didn’t know you were serious. Rio please. Please believe me.”</p><p>She’s verging on panicked now so Rio chooses her words carefully. “I believe that you mean what you’re saying,” she murmurs, kissing the top of Agatha’s head. “And after tomorrow, when I see how you treat the people around us, we will both know how well you keep your promise. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha clings to her, but that seems to be an acceptable compromise, because there’s no more protesting.</p><p>“Did you have any trouble sitting today?”</p><p>Rio knows immediately that it’s the wrong thing to ask, because Agatha rockets out of subspace – Rio can almost <em>hear</em> her brain hitting a wall – and sits up with a smirk. “No. I didn’t even have trouble sitting yesterday. You don’t hit very hard.”</p><p>“We were in a—” No. She stops herself, because a battle is what Agatha wants. She’s trying to rile Rio up by insulting her strength and style, and Rio should not let it work. She doesn’t need to make excuses or entertain the statement at all. Whether Agatha thinks she hits very hard is irrelevant.</p><p>She takes a steadying breath.</p><p>“Are we back at square one?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs. “It’s not my fault you don’t know how to give a spanking.”</p><p>“Witch,” Rio says, because trying to pretend it doesn’t bother her isn’t working, and she’s not going to walk out on Agatha again to take some space.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes go wide. “I’m sorry,” she says right away.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio says, breathing a sigh of relief. “Can we continue without you insulting my skills as a dom? It puts me in a bad headspace and makes me feel like I’m not going to be able to give you a good enough or satisfying enough experience. I don’t mind dealing with anything else. But telling me I don’t deserve something or saying I don’t know how to do something right… my ego isn’t gigantic or anything but that really fucks with the little amount that I do have.”</p><p>“Yes, I’m sorry. I won’t do it again,” Agatha says, taking Rio’s face in her hands. “Thank you for not walking out.”</p><p>“Thank you for respecting my safeword.”</p><p>“The spanking did hurt, and I know you know how to give one,” Agatha continues. “But I’m fine to have another one, if that’s what you were trying to ask.”</p><p>“It is.” Rio kisses her softly, and when Agatha starts to lean into it, she breaks it off to avoid getting too sidetracked. “Are you ready?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Show me by taking your pants off and going to the bedroom.”</p><p>Agatha gets her pants off in about two seconds and turns, walking ahead of Rio to the bedroom. When Rio catches up, she’s standing just inside the doorway.</p><p>“Bend over the end of the bed and pull your underwear down.”</p><p>Agatha walks the few feet to the bed and does as she’s told, bending over and sliding her panties down her legs.</p><p>“Good,” Rio says. “Wait quietly while I get my paddle.”</p><p>Agatha makes some kind of squeaking groan that sounds involuntary, and then she’s quiet.</p><p>Rio actually has two paddles. She chooses the medium-weight wooden one, because the light padded leather one is for good girls.</p><p>She walks over to the bed and holds the paddle up so Agatha can see it. “This paddle is for bad behavior,” she announces. “I have a nicer one for another night when you’ve been good.”</p><p>Agatha’s breathing through her mouth, her eyes glassy. She doesn’t speak.</p><p>“Are you still here with me?” Rio checks in.</p><p>“Yes, Rio,” Agatha moans. “God, please.”</p><p>Not dissociated. Good to know. “What is this paddle for?” Rio asks.</p><p>“Bad behavior,” Agatha answers. She sounds sinful and decadent, like a pretty little whore laid out in a meadow instead of a sarcastic little asshole bent over Rio’s bed. But Rio’s glad for the reality. She likes having this sarcastic little asshole bent over her bed, ready to be paddled for her sins.</p><p>“Count.”</p><p>“Yes, Rio.”</p><p>She moves to the end of the bed, standing just to the side so she can reach Agatha’s ass easily with her forehand swing. She touches the paddle to the middle of Agatha’s cheeks, then draws back and cracks it forward.</p><p>Agatha yelps and fists the blankets. “One.”</p><p>“Good girl.” She swings again, the sound like a gunshot, echoing between her legs.</p><p>Agatha cries out and buries her face until she’s able to speak. “Two,” she croaks.</p><p>Rio gives her a few more seconds to adjust, then cracks the paddle lower, where her ass meets her thighs. Agatha’s answering sound of discomfort is such a turn on that she immediately does it again and gets the same reward.</p><p>“Th—three. Four,” Agatha says, shaky.</p><p>“One to ten, how much does it hurt?” Rio asks, rubbing Agatha’s back with her left hand.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha rushes.</p><p>“Take your time, I need to know,” Rio insists, rubbing her left hand in gentle circles.</p><p>“It’s—ugh.” Agatha pulls on the blankets several times in a row, then grinds her hips into the mattress. “Four, I think.”</p><p>“Good girl. Try to relax. We have all the time in the world,” Rio says. She rests the paddle on Agatha’s backside, then cracks it down, putting more strength into it. The impact makes her bite her lip, and Agatha’s cry makes her wetter than she already was.</p><p>“Five,” Agatha whimpers. “Number five, I mean. Five swats.”</p><p>“Don’t think so hard,” Rio shushes her. “I’ll figure out what you mean. You just do what you’re told, honey. You’re being so good.”</p><p>Agatha mewls and nods and snuggles the blankets into her chest.</p><p>She’s absolutely fucking adorable, and Rio can’t pretend she’s not having feelings. But that’s a conversation for a moment they’re not exchanging power.</p><p>“You’re turning nice and red for me,” Rio purrs, aiming higher up and smacking Agatha’s cheeks across the middle, harder than the rest of the strikes.</p><p>Agatha howls and grabs a pillow to put over her head, squeezing it around her ears. “Six,” comes out muffled.</p><p>“Take the pillow off,” Rio instructs, rubbing Agatha’s back again. “It’s blocking your air flow.”</p><p>Agatha tosses the pillow aside, squirming around until Rio presses down on her back to still her.</p><p>And then Rio delivers two stinging blows in a row to the backs of Agatha’s thighs, and the dam breaks.</p><p>Agatha sobs into the blankets, her fists uncurling, hands laying limply next to her head. “Se-ven, eight,” she recites obediently through her tears.</p><p>Rio sets the paddle aside for the moment and climbs onto the bed, laying with her feet by the headboard so she can put her face close to Agatha’s and stroke her hair. “Such a good girl,” she croons, just loud enough to be heard over Agatha’s crying. “One to ten, how much does it hurt now, honey?” She keeps her fingers crawling through Agatha’s hair on repeat.</p><p>“It’s—I don’t—It’s like a seven, maybe, or an eight,” she bawls. “I’m sorry I was hurtful! I’m sorry for everything! I just want you to be proud of me, please Rio…”</p><p>“I am so proud,” Rio says, Agatha’s pleas tugging at her heart. God, she’s wet, but she’s also… having a hard time seeing Agatha in pain. “Can we have a little check-in?”</p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p>“You can cry as long as you need to, but when you can, could you tell me how you feel about being paddled like this? Emotionally? I really need to know where your head’s at.”</p><p>She strokes Agatha’s hair and kisses her face until the crying slows down enough for Agatha to answer.</p><p>“I feel… it makes me feel… like my words matter, like you told me earlier. That you care enough to punish me even though it’s hard for you to see me cry…”</p><p>Rio has to force her eyebrows not to raise, because how could Agatha possibly know that?</p><p>“I feel cared for, and like I’ll get another chance to be good for you when my punishment is over, and… the way you handle me makes me so wet and wrecked, and ruined for anyone else to ever try for the rest of my life, because nobody could ever handle me as good as you do, you make me so submissive, Rio, and I want to be like that, but nobody has ever been patient enough or persistent enough to put me down into that headspace. You get me there so easily. I want to please you so fucking badly, to make you happy with me… and my fucking attitude gets in the way and I’m so afraid you’re going to walk away, to get tired of it, and I don’t want that, so I’ll try so hard to behave better for you.”</p><p>Rio is stunned. Her heart is beating so fast she can actually feel it in her chest. “I won’t walk away,” she says in awe. “You’re afraid I’m going to walk away?”</p><p>“I’ve never been so afraid of something,” Agatha says. “I don’t know how other people handle multiple daily fears. This is my only one and it’s crippling.”</p><p>“I won’t walk away,” Rio tries to reassure her. “I might get tired of your attitude sometimes, but that’s what punishments are for. I won’t walk away. You don’t have to try any harder than you want to, okay? Don’t try to behave better because you think I’ll leave. Try to behave better if you want to behave better.”</p><p>Agatha looks… hopeful, Rio thinks. “I do want to behave better for you. It kills me in the best way when you praise me. When I earn that from you. I’ve never wanted that from anyone before. When I’m a good enough girl for you that you comment on it, it takes me apart.”</p><p>“When you’re a good girl for me it takes <em>me</em> apart,” Rio says. “I can’t think of anything better. But when you’re not good, it’s okay. It doesn’t make me want to back out of the… arrangement. It just makes me want to do really awful things to you. Within reason.”</p><p>Agatha laughs a little and rests her cheek on the blankets, and Rio adores the happy look in her eyes.</p><p>“Thank you for sharing your feelings,” she says after a minute. “Now… you’ve had eight hits with the paddle for bad behavior. I like multiples of ten. Can you be good for two more? Can you take that for me, sweet girl? If you can’t, that’s all right, just tell me politely and we’ll be all done with your spanking.” She knows it’s a hard request, because Agatha will want to take it, but also want to be all done. So she adds before Agatha can answer, “either way, you’re a good girl, okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyelids flutter and she shifts her hips against the edge of the mattress. “I can take it. I want to take it for you.”</p><p>“Are you sure, honey? They’re going to hurt more than the others because you’ve had time to relax in between.”</p><p>“I’m sure,” Agatha says, and Rio can read the decisiveness in her voice and the determined body language. She’s gearing up and settling down at the same time. “Please.”</p><p>Rio nods and kisses the side of her face, then slides off the bed and picks up the paddle, moving back into place. Agatha’s behind is still bright red, with a bit of mottled purple starting to bleed through. She’ll give the last two spanks a lot softer, but like she told Agatha, she knows it’ll really hurt. It makes her feel some type of way that Agatha wants to take it for her.</p><p>She rests the paddle on the least-marked area and swats Agatha with minimal force.</p><p>Agatha grits her teeth and hisses in a breath, her body tensing for a few seconds, then relaxing. “Nine.” She turns her head to look over her shoulder. “Rio?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Did you pull the last one?”</p><p>“Yes I did.”</p><p>Agatha looks conflicted. “Is it disrespectful to ask why?”</p><p>Rio lays her free hand on Agatha’s hip and gives an encouraging squeeze. “It’s not,” she says. “I pulled it because you’re already bruising. Punishment is supposed to hurt, but it’s not supposed to risk injury. This is a moderately heavy wooden paddle, and it could injure you if I don’t use it right. Hitting you any more at full force right now would be irresponsible.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha says, her cheeks dusted pink, and she lays her head back down.</p><p>Rio can’t help smiling to herself, and she leans down to kiss the spot on Agatha’s hip where her hand was, then lines up the paddle and swats Agatha’s perfect ass one last time.</p><p>Agatha hisses again, but it’s nothing dramatic, and wiggles over the bed. “Ten.”</p><p>Rio sets the paddle aside and carefully runs her fingertips up and down over the marks. “All done,” she murmurs, entranced by the warmth under her fingers. Agatha’s skin is on fire. “Do you know how good you were for me?”</p><p>Agatha whimpers at the touch. Or the words, Rio can’t quite tell. “I tried to be…”</p><p>Rio crawls onto the bed, hovering over Agatha on her hands and knees, bending her elbows to whisper against the back of Agatha’s neck. “You were so fucking good, Agatha.” She kisses, then bites, and Agatha moans. “I had more punishment planned, but you’ve been such a good girl I think I’d rather reward you instead. What do you think about that?”</p><p>“Oh, <em>fuck</em>,” Agatha gasps. “Fuck, fuck, fuck. Please. Yes, please Rio. Please.” Her hips are seeking friction already and Rio’s not even touching her.</p><p>“I’m gonna make you come all over my face, and then you’re gonna warm my strap if you want me to fuck you with it.”</p><p>“Warm your—I don’t—” Agatha’s squirming all over the place now and Rio closes her knees in tighter to keep her somewhat still.</p><p>“You’ve never warmed a strap before?”</p><p>“I’ve never let anyone near me with a strap. When I said I can’t take it without coming, I only know that because I’ve fucked myself with toys so many times…”</p><p>The idea of Agatha using toys on herself nearly sends Rio’s brain into orbit. She grinds hard into the middle of Agatha’s back and bites into the flesh between her neck and shoulder, just hard enough to subdue her sudden aggression but not hard enough to break skin or bruise. “Jesus fucking Christ.”</p><p>Agatha groans. “That’s how I feel every time I look at you or hear your voice.”</p><p>“Every time?”</p><p>“Pretty much, yeah. I’m going to regret telling you that, aren’t I?”</p><p>“Probably. But right now I want my face in your pussy, sweet girl. Get on your back.” She moves off of Agatha so she can comply.</p><p>Agatha stretches all of her muscles and arches her back, then crawls up to the head of the bed and lays herself down with a wince and a loud whine when her ass hits the mattress.</p><p>“A good reminder to behave,” Rio teases, grabbing her knees and forcing them roughly apart, then counters the rough act with a gentle lick up the inside of one thigh.</p><p>“Yes, Rio, I’ll behave,” Agatha says, and keeps her legs apart.</p><p>Rio flicks her tongue through hot, wet folds and gathers slick on the tip to smear across Agatha’s clit, then sucks it into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha yelps in surprise and bucks her hips up into Rio’s face, which makes her bite her lip and doesn’t feel great, so she employs her hands for leverage to hold Agatha down while she takes what she wants.</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha pants, arching her shoulders up and tilting her head back, then flopping down with an apologetic sigh.</p><p>“S’okay,” Rio mumbles into her cunt, sucking and flicking the swollen little bud, fast and relentless, until Agatha shrieks and clamps her thighs around Rio’s head, shuddering out an orgasm.</p><p>Rio shivers, her own thighs slick around the seams of her panties, and Agatha’s not gushing, but there’s enough to swallow, and she loves the taste.</p><p>“You’re delicious,” she says, wiping her mouth with her sleeve as she sits up.</p><p>Agatha’s just laying there breathing hard.</p><p>“What do you say when someone compliments you?” Rio prompts, raking her nails lightly up under Agatha’s blouse, over her belly.</p><p>“Thank—” Agatha manages to say distractedly before it fades into a desperate, mewling cry.</p><p>Rio’s eyes go a little wide. “Does somebody have something they like that they didn’t mention yet?”</p><p>“Hands under my shirt,” Agatha breathes. “Oh God.”</p><p>Rio takes her hand out. “I’ll save that for another time,” she promises at Agatha’s noise of protest. “Right now I have something specific I want. I’d rather explore your turn-ons when I can really focus on them.”</p><p>Agatha nods, and it’s not rude or pleading, so she understands. Good. Because Rio will make an entire day out of exploring her turn-ons.</p><p>For now, though, she gets out of bed, keeping a hand on Agatha’s hip while she stands. “Will you be okay for about a minute or two while I go into the closet for my strap?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are swirling, but the blue is bright and clear. “Yes, Rio.”</p><p>Rio smiles at her and blows a kiss, then disappears into the closet and ransacks her drawers until she finds what she wants. It’s been a while since she used a strap, so she didn’t remember where it was.</p><p>She grabs an average-sized dildo to put in and heads back to the bed, not wanting to leave Agatha alone for the amount of time it’ll take to get into the harness.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are blown as they track Rio across the room and rest on the harness when she reaches the bed. “Are you going to take your pants off?” she squeaks.</p><p>Rio laughs. “Yeah.”</p><p>“Fuck me,” Agatha breathes. Her gaze is rapt.</p><p>Rio gets out of her slacks and leaves her panties on, stepping into the harness and securing it around her thighs and waist. She snaps in the dick and takes Agatha’s hand, pulling her to her feet and leading her to the living room.</p><p>When they get to the couch, she sits. “Here’s what’s going to happen,” she says, guiding Agatha to stand between her spread legs. “Are you listening?”</p><p>“Yes, Rio.”</p><p>She’s most definitely listening. Her eyes haven’t strayed from Rio even once. Rio feels completely naked under Agatha’s stare even though she’s wearing a blouse and underwear.</p><p>“You’re going to straddle my lap and lower yourself onto my cock, as slow as you need to until it’s all the way in, and then you’re going to sit like a good girl while I put something on tv for a half hour or so. If you hold still for me, when the show is over, I’ll fuck you.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw is dropped and she’s just staring, speechless.</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow. “Was any of that unclear?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, eyes wide.</p><p>“So you understood everything I said?”</p><p>Agatha nods. “Y—f—” She can’t seem to form words.</p><p>“When you can repeat back what’s going to happen, we’ll continue.”</p><p>It takes five minutes. “I’m going to sit on your cock and hold still while you put something on tv for a half hour,” Agatha finally says, her voice wispy and thin. “If I’m a good girl, you’ll fuck me when the show is over.”</p><p>“Are you okay with all that? You said you’ve never let anyone near you with a strap before. Do you <em>want</em> me to fuck you with mine?”</p><p>Agatha licks her lips and nods, absently wringing her hands. “Yes. I want it. I’ll earn it.”</p><p>Rio has never experienced anyone as arousing as Agatha Harkness in her entire life. “Get naked and come sit on my cock then, pretty girl.”</p><p>Agatha takes off her blouse and bra. She’s already abandoned her underwear somewhere between the bed and the couch. Once she’s fully naked, she kneels on the sofa and puts her hands on Rio’s shoulders, and God, she’s beautiful, and she starts to lower herself onto the strap, her face doing all kinds of amazing things the further down on the shaft she gets.</p><p>Roughly a minute later she’s sitting on Rio’s thighs, the cock nestled fully inside her.</p><p>“How’s it feel, baby?”</p><p>Oh shit.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opens and closes, her brows furrowed as she adjusts herself on the cock to get comfortable, and Rio’s going to just pretend she didn’t say baby, or at least that Agatha didn’t hear it, because maybe she was too focused on getting comfortable to pay attention to what ill-advised terms of endearment Rio’s brain decided to throw into the already volatile mix, and so yeah, she’s going to gloss over it and pretend she didn’t say it and never say it again, because—</p><p>Rio’s thoughts halt when Agatha stares her directly in the eye, the blue rings around her pupils blazing, and whispers, “it feels good, daddy.”</p><p>Rio’s hips jerk and Agatha shrieks. “Sorry,” Rio says breathlessly, her clit throbbing harder than she can handle. She might have to make herself come before they do this. “Get off for a minute, I need to come before we do this.” Yeah, there’s no avoiding it. Agatha calling her daddy with a strap buried in to the hilt will be the thing that kills her dead if she doesn’t take care of herself right now.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw drops again as she obediently slides off the strap with a pop and sinks to her knees on the floor. “Can I—”</p><p>“No,” Rio interrupts, pushing her hand in her underwear and nudging the base of the dick out of the way so she can rub her clit. “It’ll just take me a minute, hang on.”</p><p>Agatha kneels on her hands, presumably to keep them off of Rio since she was told no, and Rio appreciates the extra effort right now because she’s not in any state of mind to refuse if Agatha disobeys.</p><p>She comes quickly because she knows exactly how to touch herself, and her ass comes off the couch, thighs clenched as the tension rolls out of her in sharp little waves. Fuck, that’s a relief. Now she can properly focus and take her time without being desperate to come. “Good girl,” she growls, adjusting her dick back to the center of the harness and reaching out to grab Agatha by the hair. “Back on my dick, baby.”</p><p>Agatha’s nostrils flare and she climbs onto Rio’s lap, sinking down quicker and easier this time with a groan. “Of course, daddy.”</p><p>Rio’s probably still going to die. She pats her chest to invite Agatha to snuggle up while she grabs the remote from the end table and switches on the tv. She doesn’t give two fucks what she watches, she just picks a random channel while Agatha leans forward and settles against her chest, face pressed to her neck. One hand lifts to stroke through Agatha’s hair, letting the strands separate and fall through her fingers.</p><p>Whatever she put on the tv plays in the background, but Rio’s not paying attention. She’s focused on the feel of Agatha in her lap, sitting on her cock like a docile little princess, snuggled up to her chest, breathing even and warm against her neck.</p><p>Ten minutes in and Agatha hasn’t moved a muscle. Rio might think she was asleep if she wasn’t making content little noises at the fingers running through her hair.</p><p>This is dangerous, because Rio is falling for Agatha and they’ve only known of each other’s existence for two months, and only spoke for the first time last week. But there’s nothing she can do about it and she refuses to shut herself off from things just to avoid the possibility of getting hurt, so it is what it is. She plays with Agatha’s hair and enjoys everything about what they’re doing right now and how it’s making her feel.</p><p>Ten more minutes and Agatha’s still humming contently at the royal treatment of her hair, and still hasn’t moved or shifted or twitched. She’s so sweet and soft like this. Rio never wants it to end.</p><p>“Agatha?” she whispers.</p><p>“Yes?” Agatha whispers back, breath tickling the side of Rio’s neck.</p><p>“How long can you sit like this?”</p><p>There’s no hesitation before Agatha answers. “As long as you want me to.”</p><p>Emotions prick at the back of Rio’s throat and her voice is a little thick when she confesses, “I want you to sit like this forever.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a soft breath but doesn’t move. “Then I’ll sit like this forever.”</p><p>Obviously they both know that’s impractical, but the feelings behind the words are what matter, and Rio is relieved at Agatha’s response. It could’ve gone so wrong. Agatha could have bolted, thought it was too fast too soon and ended things, could have ping-ponged out of subspace, but she didn’t.</p><p>Another twenty minutes and Agatha’s breathing has evened into sleep. Rio’s heart skips and a protective urge so strong flares up in her chest that she has to stop herself from squeezing Agatha too tight. Has to force herself to just let her sleep. To not wake her up and kiss her and confess every thought she’s ever had.</p><p>She doesn’t do any of that, she just navigates the tv to the web browser and googles how long it’s safe to have a dildo inside you, and lets Agatha sleep.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Google says it’s safe even overnight, so Rio lets Agatha sleep for as long as she needs to.</p><p>She stirs after about an hour with a quiet groan.</p><p>“Hey, princess,” Rio says softly.</p><p>Agatha reaches her arms up to wrap around Rio’s neck and lays her head back down. “Was I bad?”</p><p>“No,” Rio croons. “Not at all. You’ve been amazing. So good.”</p><p>“You’re—still inside me,” Agatha mumbles into her neck. “Is your strap warm yet?”</p><p>It’s the most innocent thing Rio has ever heard despite the actual words coming out of Agatha’s mouth, and she melts a little on the inside while fighting off an affectionate laugh. “It is. You did a good job. Thank you, baby.”</p><p>Agatha nuzzles further into her with a whimper. “It’s uncomfortable, daddy. But I don’t want to move.” She tightens her arms around Rio’s neck.</p><p>“Let’s get you off my dick, princess, and you can stay in my lap. Lift up slowly for me.”</p><p>Agatha nods and slowly lifts her hips, groaning the entire time until she’s off the strap, and Rio helps her sit back down behind it.</p><p>Agatha’s instantly pressed tight to her front again, trapping her cock between their bodies so she doesn’t have room to take it off. It’s hard, and warm, and it’s wet and sticky from being inside Agatha for so long.</p><p>“M’sorry I fell asleep,” Agatha says, adjusting herself a little.</p><p>“Shh,” Rio says, rubbing her back. “You’re perfect.”</p><p>After a few minutes of comfortable silence, Agatha lifts her head up to look at Rio, and there’s an expression on her face that Rio doesn’t know. But it’s earnest and soft and vulnerable.</p><p>“Daddy?” Agatha asks, and her voice is smaller than Rio’s heard it all week.</p><p>With a shock, Rio realizes that whatever Agatha is about to say next is making her <em>shy</em>. Holy mother of God. “Yes, baby? What is it?”</p><p>“Never mind,” Agatha says and ducks her head.</p><p>Rio’s mind is whirling and she tries to think of the best thing to say to make Agatha feel comfortable enough to express whatever this is. So she doesn’t try to make Agatha look at her and she doesn’t ask any more questions. She just strokes up and down the muscled back beneath her fingertips and says gently, “Daddy’s listening.”</p><p>Agatha clings tight enough to hurt the back of her neck, but she doesn’t care. She thinks she would endure anything to prolong this moment.</p><p>There’s a heartbeat where Agatha hesitates. And then she murmurs against Rio’s skin, her voice even smaller than before. “I need you.”</p><p>Rio can’t breathe. “Anything you need,” she manages to choke out through sheer force of will. “You can tell me.”</p><p>“I feel empty,” Agatha barely whispers. “I… I thought I wanted off.” She shakes her head. “I don’t.”</p><p>Rio holds in a whimper, because she’s never heard anything so endearing, so… so <em>sweet</em>. And from <em>Agatha</em>. “You can come back on,” she says, gentle but with a throat full of gravel. “For as long as you want, princess.”</p><p>Agatha pushes up onto her knees and angles her hips forward until the head of Rio’s dick slips between her legs, and she sinks down onto it with a shuddering moan. “Da—daddy please,” she shivers. “I’ll be good.”</p><p>Rio’s a little confused at the promise, because Agatha has been nothing but good. Does she want to be fucked? And she’s afraid Rio doesn’t think she’ll be good for it? “You are good, baby. I want to give you what you want, I just need you to tell me what it is,” she says, still stroking Agatha’s back. “You can have anything.”</p><p>Agatha slides her arms from around Rio’s neck and rests her hands on the spaces between her neck and shoulders instead. Picking idly at her blouse collar. “Would you touch me, daddy? Gentle? Make—make me yours?”</p><p>Rio’s not going to survive. A hot pulse of need sways her equilibrium and pounds between her legs. “You want to be mine?” she asks, trailing one hand up into Agatha’s hair and slowly closing a handful of it in her fist.</p><p>“More than anything,” Agatha whispers.</p><p>“Hold on tight, baby, I’m taking you to the bed,” Rio says, and scoots to the edge of the sofa so she can stand up, one hand under Agatha’s ass and the other still holding her hair.</p><p>Agatha’s legs wrap around her waist and nails dig in to her shoulders, and she walks the short distance to the bedroom, careful as she climbs onto the bed on her knees without letting Agatha slide off her dick. It’s a little awkward as she manages everything, but she does it, and stays inside as she lays Agatha out on the bed, her own body draped on top like a weighted blanket.</p><p>Agatha’s shaking like a leaf.</p><p>“Are you cold?” Rio asks, feeling her arms.</p><p>“No daddy,” Agatha swallows, looking up at her. “I’m—nervous.”</p><p>Rio runs her thumb over Agatha’s bottom lip. “You can tell me,” she urges.</p><p>“What if I’m bad?” Agatha asks, and she’s so genuine it’s heartbreaking.</p><p>“What do you think is bad?” Rio needs clarification before she can give reassurance.</p><p>“I’m bad a lot,” Agatha says, averting her eyes. “I forget my manners. I—I talk back even when I don’t mean to. Even when I try to be good.” Her voice is small again, and Rio wishes she could snap her fingers and take away the deep-seated fear that comes from who knows how many people giving up on her?</p><p>Rio strokes her cheek and kisses her forehead. “It’s okay if you make mistakes, baby,” she says. “Daddy will forgive you. Always.”</p><p>“But what if you can’t?”</p><p>“There’s nothing we can’t work out if we try,” Rio says with a kiss to the tip of her nose. “When you’re mine, you’re mine. And I want that. I want that so much. I’ll never give up on you, princess. Can you believe me, please?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fill up like she’s going to cry, but she doesn’t. She lets out a soft moan and finally nods her head. “Yes daddy.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio says with a smile, and she uses one hand at a time to pin Agatha’s wrists on either side of her head. “Are you ready for me to make you mine?”</p><p>Agatha moans and tilts her head back, pushing her chest off the bed, then settles and nods. “Yes. Please.”</p><p>Rio plants her knees more firmly and draws her hips back a few inches, watching the play of emotions on Agatha’s face, and pushes back in agonizingly slowly until she’s buried all the way again.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha breathes.</p><p>Knowing this is the first time anyone else has fucked her with a strap <em>does</em> something to Rio. Not just to her ego, or to her libido. It’s more than that. Like they’re in another world together, just the two of them, and nobody else will ever exist.</p><p>She pulls out a little further and pushes back in just as slowly, just as deep.</p><p>Agatha lets out a keening sound that has no name. “Fuck,” she says again.</p><p>Rio puts her mouth to Agatha’s ear. “Princesses don’t say fuck,” she whispers.</p><p>Agatha groans, tossing her head to the side. “Yours does,” she whines.</p><p>Rio chuckles and withdraws the strap almost all the way, then glides back in, unhurried.</p><p>Agatha squirms and tries to angle her hips for more contact, but Rio squeezes her wrists and raises an eyebrow. “Settle.”</p><p>Agatha huffs and it’s clearly a great effort, but she relaxes her muscles and stops trying to force it. “Sorry daddy,” she says, blushing.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio says with a grin. “Hold still and take what daddy gives you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snap to hers, jaw dropping, and a strangled moan gurgles out of her throat. “Yes sir.”</p><p>Rio’s clit twitches as those words wash over her, wringing out a shudder and making her thighs tighten. Agatha’s playing with fire now. “I thought you wanted gentle.”</p><p>“Gentle, but not… snail speed,” Agatha says. “Sir.”</p><p>Oh, she’s a devious little shit. Maybe she thinks Rio can’t control herself and still be gentle while being fucked with by a mouthy little princess. But she can. Or, more specifically, she can withhold movement altogether. So she just remains motionless, staring down at Agatha with one corner of her mouth quirked up in a telling half smirk.</p><p>The longer Rio does nothing, the more the realization shows on Agatha’s face.</p><p>“Oh no,” she says when the impact of her behavior fully hits. “No, please, oh God. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Rio is unmoved, emotionally and physically. She just waits.</p><p>Agatha’s face crumbles and she pushes on Rio’s hands with her wrists. Rio releases them, curious about what she’ll do.</p><p>Agatha’s hands go to her face, cradling it, stroking Rio’s cheeks with her thumbs. “I’m sorry,” she says, more sincere and less desperate.</p><p>Rio gives her an inch. Out and in.</p><p>Agatha’s breathing hard. “Please,” she says, and lets her hands fall back to the bed so Rio can pin them down again. Which Rio does.</p><p>She gives an inch again. Out and in.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha hisses. “Please. Please, please, please.” The desperation is starting to kick up again.</p><p>Two inches.</p><p>Agatha’s tossing her head side to side now and kicking her feet. “Please, fuck, please daddy, daddy daddy daddy Rio please fuck me, make me yours, shut me up daddy please…”</p><p>Rio groans and gives in, pulling out and sliding in, smooth and gentle but over and over, out and in, out and in. Faster, still gentle, still smooth. Faster. It takes a lot of control to go fast without going hard. Her thighs are burning with the effort. But it’s worth it. Agatha’s absolutely fucking coming <em>apart</em>.</p><p>“Daddy PLEASE!” she literally shouts, arching her back, baring her throat, tears leaking from the corners of her tightly shut eyes.</p><p>Rio releases her right hand and guides it to her clit. “Why should I do all the work? Help daddy make you come.”</p><p>Agatha’s desperation is showcased by how fast she complies, immediately rubbing hard and fast over her clit without any kind of protest.</p><p>And about ten seconds later, she clenches around Rio’s cock, her body going taut as she comes with a strangled cry.</p><p>Rio lets her enjoy it for a few heartbeats before she closes a hand over her throat and growls. “You’re mine.”</p><p>Agatha whimpers and nods. “Yes. Yes,” she agrees.</p><p>“Say it.” Rio shakes her gently.</p><p>Agatha gasps at the pressure that puts on her windpipe but it’s soft and fleeting and she obeys instantly. “I’m yours.” She moans as she says it.</p><p>“No one else’s,” Rio says.</p><p>“No one else’s,” Agatha echoes, pupils blown.</p><p>“<em>Ever</em>.”</p><p>“Ever.”</p><p>Rio relaxes and lets go of her throat and leans down to kiss her.</p><p>The kiss lasts a long time, Rio exploring Agatha’s mouth with her tongue and letting Agatha do the same. When she pulls back, she pulls her hips at the same time, and her cock slips out of Agatha’s pussy, come dripping out around it down to the blankets.</p><p>“You’re a mess,” she observes as she takes off the harness and sets it aside.</p><p>“You’re a mess maker,” Agatha volleys, and it’s not sassy, it’s just cute.</p><p>Rio laughs and uses the corner of one blanket to clean her off, then stretches out next to her with an arm draped over her chest. “We can take a shower later.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are shining as she looks at Rio. “Thank you for that,” she says, a little flush on her cheeks. “Am I really yours now?”</p><p>Rio’s heart skips nervously. “If you want to be.” She’s afraid of what Agatha’s answer will be, but it comes quickly.</p><p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Good,” Rio says, her heartbeat slowing back down to normal.</p><p>“But that doesn’t mean you’ll go back on the work thing, right?” Agatha asks suddenly.</p><p>“No, never,” Rio promises. “I will never, ever do that to you again. No matter what you say or do at work. I should never have done it in the first place. I was just so caught up in… I don’t know… being so stupidly <em>offended</em> that you didn’t want to spend the night. Nothing about what I did that morning was right.”</p><p>Agatha looks pleased with that answer and curls into Rio’s side. “I did want to spend the night, I was just scared of falling too fast, especially when I had no idea that you wanted more than a one-off.”</p><p>“But you know now, right?” Rio checks.</p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p>“And you’re not scared now?”</p><p>“I’m definitely still scared of falling too fast,” Agatha admits quietly.</p><p>“Same,” Rio says before she thinks better of it, and clears her throat. “I mean…” Oh, what’s the point of trying to hide it anyway? “I mean yeah. Same.”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha asks, and her surprise tugs a little at Rio’s heart.</p><p>“Well, yeah. Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>“A million reasons,” Agatha says, and starts ticking them off on her fingers. “Rude. Sarcastic. Selfish. Spoiled. Doesn’t want to be dommed at work. Hurtf—”</p><p>“Hang on,” Rio says, eyes wide, when her brain catches up to her ears. “Just—hang on. The first four, we’re working on those. They wouldn’t be enough to keep me from falling for you. The fifth one, the getting dommed at work thing, I don’t care about that at all. That shouldn’t even be on the list of possible reasons I wouldn’t fall for you. That’s not a character flaw, Agatha, that’s a boundary. A healthy one. If anything, it makes you more appealing because you know what you do and do not want.”</p><p>Agatha seems to be listening and taking in everything she’s saying. “It’s not a drawback? You wouldn’t rather be with someone who lets you do whatever you want, whenever and wherever?”</p><p>“No,” Rio says, not for the first time having the urge to pummel into oblivion whoever made Agatha so insecure. “You’re a person, with feelings, not a cardboard cutout or a sex doll. I want to do what gets us both off. Not just me.”</p><p>Agatha presses closer. “You’re sure?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio says, arms going around her. She can’t imagine walking away from Agatha. She wants this woman in every way it’s possible to want someone. “Let’s make a rule.”</p><p>“What kind of rule? No tv after nine o’clock?”</p><p>Rio snorts and pinches her. “No. The rule is that in my car and in this house, you are my submissive and I am your dominant. Anywhere else, at all, we’re just Agatha and Rio. Friends, or colleagues, or whatever else we might be in the future.”</p><p>Agatha’s body uncoils like a tripped spring and she lets out a very content-sounding sigh. “That’s a good rule,” she says, and Rio doesn’t think she’s ever seen or felt Agatha this relaxed.</p><p>“And just so you know?” Rio says after a few minutes of quiet. “You’re pretty easy to fall for.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks turn scarlet and she hides her face in Rio’s neck. “<em>Rio</em>,” she complains in that tone people use that says they’re embarrassed but secretly love the praise.</p><p>Rio laughs and squishes her. “Do you want to spend the night? I promise not to go off the deep end if you say no.”</p><p>“I want to stay.”</p><p>“Good. I wasn’t going to go off the deep end but I would’ve at least broken a few windows.”</p><p>Agatha groans. “You’re not funny.”</p><p>“I’m hilarious.”</p><p>“You’re… perfect.”</p><p>Rio’s face heats up in a rare moment of embarrassment. “Stop,” she says, tilting Agatha’s face up to give her a kiss. “Are you tired?”</p><p>Agatha stares, tongue pressing into her cheek, and speaks clearly. “No.”</p><p>Rio gets the message clearly. “You want more?” She raises her eyebrows.</p><p>“I want… to make you feel good,” Agatha says hesitantly. “But I don’t think you’re going to let me.”</p><p>“It makes me feel good to touch you,” Rio says, stomach tensing up.</p><p>“Are you—will you ever let me touch you?” Agatha asks with a frown.</p><p>Rio sighs. “I will,” she promises. “I just have to be in a certain mood. Is that—are you okay with that, or does it make you want to leave?”</p><p>“I don’t want to leave,” Agatha says. “I might have a tantrum, though.”</p><p>Rio rests their foreheads together. “If you have a tantrum in my house, you’ll regret it.”</p><p>“I’m used to getting what I want.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I react badly when someone tries to tell me no.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I want to touch you.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Stop saying I know!” Agatha snaps, pulling away.</p><p>Rio lets her go; watches her lay on her back and stare at the ceiling.</p><p>“Is this really what you want to do after we had such a good evening?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says, and Rio can’t tell if she’s gearing up for an apology or a snarky remark. “I want to be allowed to touch you back.”</p><p>“And I said not tonight. If you keep pushing it won’t be any time soon. I’ve given you a boundary that you need to respect or you’re going to end up standing in the corner.”</p><p>Agatha snorts out a derisive laugh. “Good luck with that.”</p><p>Rio has two choices, and she’d rather not go with physical force right now because she’s tired. “You can have the bed. I’ll take the couch.”</p><p>Agatha bolts upright before Rio can even move. “What?”</p><p>“I’m too tired for a boxing match tonight, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to lay here and be disrespected.” She slides off the bed and heads for the door. “Goodnight, Agatha. I’ll see you in the morning.”</p><p>“Wait,” Agatha says, and the derision is gone entirely. “Please, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio stops halfway to the door and sighs. “Agatha, I wanted a nice night with you. Especially your first time staying over. But you’re being spoiled and selfish.”</p><p>“You said we’re working on those,” Agatha says, and Rio can hear the tears in her voice.</p><p>Fuck. She’s crying.</p><p>Rio turns around and goes back to the bed, standing at the edge of it. “We are working on them,” she says. “Part of working on them means you don’t always get what you want. And lashing out at me is not going to change my mind about anything, ever. It’s just going to get you punished, and most of the time not in a fun way.”</p><p>“Please get back in bed,” Agatha says, sounding small again. “I’ll go to the corner.”</p><p>“This is the thing, honey,” Rio tries to explain, reaching out to wipe away some of Agatha’s tears. “You don’t get to call the shots. You don’t get to decide when you’ll agree to go to the corner and when you won’t. You don’t get to use compliance as a bargaining chip. You either do as I tell you or you face the consequences that I set.”</p><p>“I understand, but can this please be my warning?” Agatha begs her. “It’s new for me and I’m trying so hard. Please, Rio?”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio says after briefly giving it some thought, and nods her head. “That’s fair. Go put yourself in the corner and I’ll set a timer for ten minutes. Don’t move or speak. Just think about what got you into trouble, which was pushing one of my boundaries and being disrespectful.”</p><p>Agatha gets out of bed and goes wordlessly to the closest corner of the room, and stands awkwardly in it.</p><p>Rio climbs under the blankets and lays down, setting the timer on her phone, and when it goes off, she hits ‘stop’ and calls Agatha over. “Come here, honey.”</p><p>Agatha shuffles over and gets under the blankets with her, curling up to her side. “I thought about my behavior.”</p><p>Rio slides an arm under her to hold her. “And?”</p><p>“And it was spoiled and selfish.”</p><p>“But we already knew that, didn’t we?” Rio says gently. “Anything more?”</p><p>Agatha holds Rio’s collar in both of her hands. “It was disrespectful. I wasn’t thinking about what you wanted or needed, and as your submissive, I should always be thinking about what you want and need when we’re in your car or your house.”</p><p>Rio’s breath catches at that, because it’s a beautiful way to express the aspect of their relationship that they’d agreed upon tonight. An expression that dives beneath the surface of bratty behavior and into the depths of the dynamic they’re sharing. She couldn’t have asked for more than that. “That’s right,” she praises with a smile that she knows is showcasing how whipped she already is, but she can’t help it, and she doesn’t want to hide her feelings from Agatha anyway, because that wouldn’t be fair. “Thank you for thinking past the surface. I appreciate it very much.”</p><p>Agatha’s face flushes but she doesn’t look like she wants to complain. She looks like she’s soaking up the praise and blooming under it. “Thank you for giving me a warning,” she says, leaning her head on Rio’s chest. “I’ll turn into a good submissive for you.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio says in alarm, shaking her head. “You <em>are</em> a good submissive for me.”</p><p>“Rio, I’m constantly making mistakes,” Agatha says, squeezing Rio’s collar tighter.</p><p>“I make mistakes too. I’ve made a lot, and you’re not saying I’ll turn into a good dominant, are you?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says softly.</p><p>“You are a good submissive for me,” Rio says again.</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes for a moment and breathes, then opens them to look at her. “I’ll try to believe that.”</p><p>“I’d like you to say it.”</p><p>“I can’t say that.”</p><p>“I’d like you to. Even if you can’t believe it yet, I’d like you to say it please.”</p><p>“Rio, I can’t…”</p><p>Rio is gentle as she strokes Agatha’s cheek with her thumb. “You can, and we’ll wait just like this until you do.”</p><p>Agatha makes an aggrieved, whiny sound, but Rio doesn’t respond, she just waits.</p><p>“Please don’t make me say it.”</p><p>“I want to hear it… and as my submissive, you’re thinking about my wants and needs, right honey?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha nods, her voice hesitant. “What exactly do I have to say?”</p><p>Rio’s still stroking her cheek. “Say ‘I am a good submissive for you’.”</p><p>Agatha leans into the touch on her cheek and closes her eyes. Rio can see how hard this is for her. But it’s important.</p><p>“I… am a good submissive for you,” Agatha whispers.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio says instantly, pulling her in for a heated, possessive kiss. “So good. So good for me.”</p><p>Agatha groans into the kiss, opening to it. Rio works her up, hands gliding across her face, her neck, over her shoulders.</p><p>“So fucking good, baby. Say it again. For daddy.”</p><p>Agatha lets out the most sinful noise Rio has ever heard. “I’m a good submissive for you, daddy,” she breathes.</p><p>“Damn right you are,” Rio says with a rumbling growl. “If I hadn’t already paddled you, you’d be over my knee for thinking you aren’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyelids flutter and she presses herself hard into Rio’s side. “Oh God. Please.”</p><p>Rio lifts her eyebrows. “You haven’t had enough? I paddled you pretty hard. You’re bruised.”</p><p>“Please daddy please put me over your knee,” Agatha begs her, eyes glassy. “Fuck. Please. Please. Daddy. Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s taken aback at the begging, especially since Agatha has already been spanked once tonight. But maybe it’s the position, not the spanking. “Is being over my knee something like hands under your shirt?” she asks.</p><p>“Yes, I can take it, I promise, I want to feel your hand punishing me while I’m over your knee, God Rio please. Daddy please.”</p><p>Rio’s so turned on it’s ridiculous. And Agatha is grinding on her thigh by this point, getting her all wet there too. “Tell daddy again how good you are and I’ll put you over my knee.” Fuuuuuck. Something about Agatha calling her daddy is hotter than anything. No one’s ever called her daddy before, even in her most dominant and strappy moments. She hadn’t really ever considered whether she’d like it. But Agatha saying it earlier tonight fucking floored her and she more than likes it.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t hesitate now, her eyes on fire. “I’m a good submissive for you, daddy,” she says without a hitch in her voice, without averting her gaze. She’s still grinding on Rio’s thigh and Rio reaches down to stop her.</p><p>“Stand up.”</p><p>“Yes daddy.”</p><p>Agatha gets off the bed and stands, her hands wandering toward her cunt as she waits for Rio to sit up.</p><p>“Don’t you dare,” Rio catches her, sitting up and moving to the edge of the bed. She snaps and points to her right side, and Agatha steps forward.</p><p>God, she’s beautiful. From her tangled, messy hair to her bright blue eyes to her rock-hard nipples… her quivering stomach to her muscled thighs to her dripping cunt. She’s a fucking goddess.</p><p>Rio grabs Agatha by the wrist and tugs her forward. “Over daddy’s knee, princess.”</p><p>“Yes daddy,” Agatha says and crawls across her lap, stretching out her chest on the bed and leaving her feet on the floor.</p><p>Rio lifts up her right knee and props her heel on the bed frame to put Agatha on her toes.</p><p>“Shit. Fuck. Oh my God,” Agatha whines when she’s lifted into the position Rio wants her in.</p><p>Rio pulls her hair.</p><p>“Ah! Fuck fuck fuck shit,” Agatha swears, tilting her head back at the rough treatment. “Spank me please daddy Rio, I need it so bad…”</p><p>Jesus fucking Christ. Rio slaps her hand down on Agatha’s left cheek.</p><p>Agatha ruts against her thigh.</p><p>“You like being over my knee?” Rio asks, chest puffing up at the way Agatha is reacting to her.</p><p>“Yes daddy, you’re so powerful like this, putting me over your knee like a bad little bitch.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes spring wide, her cunt at attention. ‘Fuck fuck fuck shit’ indeed. She’s throbbing. She slaps Agatha’s other cheek.</p><p>“Yes, you’re so tough on me daddy, spanking me over my bruises,” Agatha gasps, still rutting against her thigh like an <em>actual</em> bitch in heat.</p><p>“That’s right,” Rio says, swept along with the tide, letting Agatha take the lead on the dirty talk. “You need me to be tough on you, don’t you?”</p><p><em>Slap</em>.</p><p>“Yes daddy, I need it. I need tough. I need the bitch beaten out of me.”</p><p>Rio’s hips jerk. She’s so wet and sticky she wants her underwear off. Wants Agatha’s head between her legs.</p><p><em>Slap</em>.</p><p>“Fuck. Please. I need my filthy mouth cleaned and my hair pulled so tight I can’t move and my ass spanked so hard I can’t sit daddy please…”</p><p><em>Slap</em>.</p><p>“Daddy’s little bitch,” Rio says, low and even. The perfect counterpoint to Agatha’s chaotic begging. “You’re not spreading these for anyone else, are you?” She slaps one of Agatha’s thighs a few times in a row.</p><p>Agatha frantically shakes her head. “No! No one else!”</p><p>Rio smacks her other thigh and drags her nails over the red mark. “How do I know that?”</p><p>“I haven’t even wanted anyone else since the first time I saw you,” Agatha gasps, and Rio can easily tell the difference between daddy’s little bitch and a sincere confession. She doesn’t want the two getting muddled and she doesn’t want to pull Agatha out of headspace so she adapts quickly.</p><p>“Daddy knows,” she purrs, moving her right hand back to Agatha’s bruised ass cheeks and giving a punishing slap. At the same time, she snakes her left hand up and into Agatha’s hair, squeezing a handful tight enough to restrict movement, as requested.</p><p>Agatha tenses like a bowstring and snaps.</p><p>Rio’s thigh is hot and slippery as Agatha comes all over her, and she keeps hold of the fistful of hair, using it to force Agatha backward off the bed, to her knees, and then to drag Agatha’s head between her legs. She uses her free hand to get her underwear down far enough to kick them off.</p><p>Agatha is too dazed to do anything at first, but after a few shaky breaths, recognition returns and she goes to work with a feral moan.</p><p>And she <em>is</em> feral.</p><p>Rio’s never had someone go down on her like this.</p><p>Like she’s a five-course meal at a five-star restaurant in a five-star hotel.</p><p>Agatha is biting and pulling and sucking and licking and Rio can’t really think clearly because she’s being torn apart by the most talented mouth she’s ever had the pleasure of fucking.</p><p>If she couldn’t still feel the evidence of Agatha’s orgasm on her thigh she would be more embarrassed about how fast she comes apart, because it’s fast. Agatha’s head is barely down there for sixty seconds before she explodes.</p><p>God, it’s messy.</p><p>Her thighs clamp down and she shakes with a quiet cry, hand still fisted in Agatha’s hair, and it takes her a moment to realize that Agatha hasn’t stopped.</p><p>Hands push at her chest, urging her to lay back, but she resists, wanting to stay in control. She squeezes Agatha’s hair to get her attention, but doesn’t make her stop.</p><p>Agatha pushes her tongue in, hard. Lapping up Rio’s slick like it’s made of diamonds, moaning as she swallows.</p><p>It makes Rio moan too.</p><p>The sound only seems to spur Agatha on. She grabs Rio’s thighs and digs her nails in, licking her way around swollen folds and probing between them, pushing her tongue inside again, further, tickling the nerves in the hidden parts of Rio’s cunt.</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>She wouldn’t have been sure who said it if Agatha wasn’t clearly beyond words, trapped in a nonverbal haze with a singular focus. So she knows the swear came from <em>her</em>.</p><p>“Fuck.” She says it again.</p><p>Agatha whines and grunts against her cunt and shifts focus to her clit, pushing the hood back with her nose and flicking the exposed nerves with the tip of her tongue. “Daddy please come on my face,” Agatha mumbles, nipping Rio’s clit with gentle teeth and then sucking it fully into her mouth with a pulsing rhythm.</p><p>Rio is helpless against it. And the words make her shudder. She comes on Agatha’s face, as requested. She’s granted a lot of requests tonight. And now she’s done. She sprawls out on her back, boneless and spent.</p><p>When Agatha tries to push her thighs further apart, Rio tugs on her hair. “No. Enough.”</p><p>Agatha obeys without question, wiping her face with the back of her hand and crawling up to collapse half on top of Rio, half on the bed on her side.</p><p>Rio feels Agatha’s breathing even out within minutes. She’s asleep a few minutes after that.</p>

<p>In the morning, they shower together before work, and Rio drops Agatha at her car with enough time for her to go home and change her clothes.</p><p>A little before her lunch break, Mrs. Antonelli comes into her classroom and up to her desk, speaking low enough so the students can’t hear.</p><p>“What did you do to Harkness?”</p><p>Rio sits up straight, panicked. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“She said my hair looked nice. I mean she mumbled it as she passed me in the hallway and didn’t stop, but… Mr. Edelburg said she told him he was looking a little more youthful today. What the hell did you do?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio says, her face on fire. “Why do you assume I did something?”</p><p>Mrs. Antonelli gives her a knowing look, but Rio won’t crack. She won’t do anything to undermine Agatha’s reputation at work. Especially not after their conversation about it.</p><p>“Okay, Vidal,” Mrs. Antonelli says, clearly amused. “Whatever it was, thank you.”</p><p>And she leaves.</p><p>Rio has <em>got</em> to get Agatha’s phone number. Now would be the time for a frantic text.</p><p>Then she remembers she can dial the classroom and picks up her desk phone, punching in the extension.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>“You don’t say ‘Ms. Harkness’s room’?”</p><p>“Nobody ever calls my room.”</p><p>“Are you going around being nice to people?”</p><p>“No. I was just trying to undo the hurtful things I said.”</p><p>Rio’s heart is <em>pounding</em>. “That’s—”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha snaps. “What did you hear?”</p><p>“Mrs. Antonelli said you complimented her hair and told Mr. Edelburg he looked more youthful.”</p><p>“Why don’t you sound happier? I thought—shit I have to go. My aides are looking at me.”</p><p>Agatha hangs up.</p><p>Rio blinks at the phone and sets the receiver back in the cradle, then shakes her head and turns back to the movie her class is watching on space exploration.</p><p>Maybe phone etiquette should be the next thing on the list of manners to teach Agatha.</p><p>--</p><p>She’s finishing her lunch in the staff room when Agatha breezes in.</p><p>The atmosphere goes from relaxed to tense in the blink of an eye, but Agatha doesn’t seem to notice, she just strides over and takes a seat (carefully, Rio thinks with an internal chuckle) in the chair to Rio’s right.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t have any food with her, so this is clearly a social visit with a purpose. But as the silence stretches on, Rio raises an eyebrow. A glance at Agatha’s face reveals darting blue eyes and a clenched jaw.</p><p>Agatha’s waiting for everyone else to leave.</p><p>Rio almost laughs.</p><p>Finally Agatha explodes. “Oh come on! Would you all hurry the fuck up and get out so I can talk to Vidal without your nosy asses creeping in on the conversation?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes bug but she says nothing. Her tongue is pressed hard into her cheek.</p><p>When Agatha sees her expression, those blue eyes flag. “Please? I meant please!” she shouts at everyone else.</p><p>Rio’s holding on by a thread. She can’t remember the last time she had to try so hard to keep a straight face. But at the same time, something soft blooms in her chest because Agatha’s trying.</p><p>As the rest of the staff start moving faster to clean up their lunches, Rio finally speaks. “Let’s just step into the hall?” she suggests. “We can speak privately there if you’d like, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>“Right. Yeah. Fine,” Agatha says distractedly, shoving her chair back as she stands and stalks out of the room.</p><p>Rio deliberately avoids making eye contact with anyone on her way out. “What’s up?” she asks casually when she finds Agatha pacing the hall.</p><p>“I can’t come over tonight,” Agatha says, her voice tight. “But it’s not because I don’t want to.”</p><p>As much as Rio wants Agatha to come over every night, she knows it’s not realistic. “That’s okay,” she says, doing a pretty good job of sounding reassuring. “I know you’re not going to be able to come over every single night. You have a life outside of me. Are you afraid I’m going to be upset?”</p><p>“<em>I’m</em> upset,” Agatha confesses, still pacing. “I don’t want to go to this stupid dinner with my mother. She always pretends like she’s not trying to set me up with random influential men, but she always <em>is</em>. No matter how many ways I’ve publicly announced I’m gayer than a three-ring circus.”</p><p>Rio feels a pang of sympathy along with the full-body symphony of jealousy that Agatha’s words provoke. “I’m guessing you can’t just opt out?”</p><p>The look Agatha gives her can best be described as scathing. “No. I cannot.”</p><p>Rio’s not sure what Agatha wants her to do with the information.</p><p>“Anyway,” Agatha says, rolling her shoulders. “I just wanted to let you know.”</p><p>Rio nods. “I appreciate the heads up.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t walk away. “Can I have your number so I can text you while I’m being tortured in an entirely unsexy way?”</p><p>Skippety-skip. Rio’s heart flutters. “I keep meaning to get yours too. Give me your phone, I’ll put mine in.”</p><p>--</p><p>Rio gets out of the shower, and after she dries off and puts on an oversized t-shirt until she decides what to wear, she checks her phone. There’s a red ten by her messages icon and she stares at it, almost afraid to open her texts. She never gets ten messages, so she already knows who they’re from. Her stomach is doing nervous flips and her thumb hovers over the screen.</p><p>Finally, she taps it.</p><p><em>Hi.</em></p><p><em>Guess what?</em></p><p><em>I was wrong.</em></p><p><em>She’s not trying to set me up with an influential man.</em></p><p><em>THERE’S AN ENTIRE FUCKING GAGGLE OF THEM.</em></p><p>Rio snorts and keeps reading.</p><p><em>I’d rather be on my knees in your living room.</em></p><p><em>Or your bedroom.</em></p><p><em>Or sitting on your lap warming your strap.</em></p><p><em>What are you doing? You haven’t even read these yet.</em></p><p><em>Unless you don’t have read receipts on, in which case I’m being tortured from all sides. I’m going to stop texting now until you respond because it’s giving me a complex.</em></p><p>Rio immediately texts back.</p><p><em>I was in the shower. I have read receipts on. How’s your gaggle of geese looking? Any swans in the group?</em></p><p>Agatha sends back the middle finger emoji and Rio cackles.</p><p><em>It was so sweet when you fell asleep on my strap. It was also so fucking hot.</em></p><p><em>I’ll do it again for you daddy.</em></p><p>Rio groans.</p><p><em>Are you trying to make me jerk off to your texts?</em></p><p><em>Yes.</em></p><p><em>Hm. Maybe I will. Not sure. Are you ever going to invite me to your place by the way?</em></p><p><em>No.</em></p><p>Rio stares at the phone. Agatha’s typing again though.</p><p><em>Just kidding sir.</em></p><p>Thud. That’s the sound of Rio’s body dropping.</p><p><em>Shouldn’t you be paying attention to your harem?</em></p><p><em>I am. One’s fingering me under the table and another’s eating my ass.</em></p><p>Rio has a sharp, visceral reaction to that, jealousy tearing through every nerve, muscle, and bone even though she’s ninety-nine percent sure Agatha’s fucking with her. And Agatha’s not in her car or her house so she really can’t do anything about it at the moment. She settles on a vaguely threatening response.</p><p><em>You’re going to regret that later.</em></p><p><em>Regret letting them do it or regret telling you about it?</em></p><p>Rio’s suddenly less certain that Agatha’s fucking with her.</p><p><em>Are you… you are joking, right?</em></p><p><em>Of course I’m joking! I’m gayer than a three-ring circus, remember? And nobody’s touching me but you, Rio. Even outside of your car or your house.</em></p><p>Rio breathes a sigh of relief and tries not to be embarrassed at her reaction.</p><p>Agatha’s typing again so Rio doesn’t respond yet.</p><p><em>Were you jealous?</em></p><p><em>Insanely.</em></p><p><em>Good.</em></p><p><em>You won’t think it’s so good when I punish you tomorrow night.</em></p><p><em>Are you gonna hit me, daddy?</em></p><p>Rio shivers and presses her tongue against the back of her teeth.</p><p><em>I haven’t decided what I’m going to do.</em></p><p><em>G2G one of the gaggle’s dicks is finally hard.</em></p><p>Rio groans and has to resist the urge to throw her phone across the room.</p><p>--</p><p>The fact that Agatha can’t come over is actually a blessing in disguise because it gives Rio time to really think about how to punish her. And makes the anticipation of carrying out the punishment so delicious.</p><p>Because by the next morning she knows what she’s going to do. And Agatha is going to fucking <em>hate</em> it.</p><p>After the bell, Agatha shows up in her doorway looking smug. They haven’t seen each other today, even in passing, so it’s the first look Rio’s gotten of her since lunch time yesterday.</p><p>Shit, the woman makes her mouth water. Leaning on the doorframe, ankles crossed, hands in her pockets. She’s in jeans and a t-shirt because it’s casual day, and she’s wearing pink fucking cowboy boots that make Rio want to scrap her entire plan for the night and just fuck as soon as they get to her car.</p><p>“I like the boots,” she says as she inches past Agatha and heads out of the building.</p><p>Agatha’s still smug as she gets in the car, but when they’re both in and buckled, it’s obvious she’s trying to rein it in.</p><p>“So… about yesterd—”</p><p>“Don’t talk,” Rio interrupts, starting the car. She can see Agatha’s nostrils flare out of the corner of her eye, but no more words are forthcoming, so she starts to drive.</p><p>Agatha is silent the entire time, thank God for small favors, and when the garage closes behind them and they’re out of the car, Rio stops them at the door leading from the garage into the kitchen. She strokes Agatha’s face and kisses her softly, then puts a finger to pouting lips to indicate Agatha should still be quiet.</p><p>The door creaks faintly as she opens it and lets them in, and she locks it behind them, leading Agatha to the living room.</p><p>“Bring a chair from the dining room and put it in front of the tv,” she says. “I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Agatha nods and goes off to get a chair, and Rio disappears into the hall closet for some rope.</p><p>She gets back at the same time as Agatha, and when Agatha sees what Rio’s holding she drops the chair.</p><p>“Shit!”</p><p>“Quiet,” Rio reminds her. “It’s okay. Just pick it up and put it in front of the tv.”</p><p>Agatha’s scowling but she manhandles the chair to the demanded location and stands behind it, eyes glued to the lengths of rope.</p><p>“Sit.”</p><p>Agatha looks dubious but steps around in front of the chair and sits.</p><p>“Take off your boots.”</p><p>Agatha kicks them off.</p><p>“Put your hands behind your back. Don’t forget you can safeword or use the traffic light system.”</p><p>Agatha nods and slowly puts her hands behind her back. Rio can see she’s breathing hard already.</p><p>She feels like she needs a little extra confirmation given Agatha’s body language. “You can talk now. Is this okay?”</p><p>Agatha looks over her shoulder to catch Rio’s eye. “Yes,” she says, and it’s not exactly simple but it’s not overly laden with emotion either.</p><p>Rio kneels down behind the chair and ties Agatha’s hands together, then secures them to the chair. “Can you get out of that?”</p><p>Agatha tugs on the ropes for a few seconds, in different directions, but her hands don’t come free. “No.”</p><p>“Did the knots tighten?”</p><p>“Only a little.”</p><p>Rio slips her fingers between the ropes and Agatha’s wrists to make sure they’re not unsafely tight. When she’s satisfied, she kisses the back of Agatha’s head and crouches down in front of the chair to tie her ankles. She ties each one to a separate chair leg, has Agatha try to escape again, and double checks for safety.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha says, and Rio thinks she sounds annoyed at the repeated check-ins.</p><p>Rio chooses not to address it because she’s going to have an entirely different attitude problem to deal with as soon as she starts the video in the DVD player. She stands behind Agatha and turns on the tv. “So… You think it’s funny to make me jealous?”</p><p>“I don’t know if I’d say funny exactly, but it was definitely satisfying.”</p><p>“I’ll rephrase. You enjoyed riling me up and making me jealous over something that wasn’t even happening?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha purrs.</p><p>Rio strokes her hair and nibbles the shell of her ear. “Do you think you’d enjoy feeling jealous?”</p><p>“Obviously not.”</p><p>“So it’s fun for you to make me feel that way, but you wouldn’t enjoy it yourself.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrow. “Again, I think that’s obvious.”</p><p>“Not necessarily. Some people enjoy feeling jealous.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer.</p><p>So Rio continues. “Having fun at my expense is naughty, Agatha.” She draws her fingers through Agatha’s hair again, until Agatha leans into it, and then trails off her touch. “You’re not going to touch me tonight. And I’m not going to touch you. But you will get to see how my ex used to touch me.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha rears back. “Have you lost your fucking mind?” She starts struggling against the ropes.</p><p>Rio hits play on the DVD player. Her ex-girlfriend’s dimly-lit bedroom appears on the tv screen. Her ex is on her knees on the floor, and Rio’s standing in front of her wearing a strap. Which is buried in her ex’s throat.</p><p>“Turn this shit off!” Agatha bellows, struggling so hard the chair moves a few centimeters.</p><p>“No no, baby. You wanted to have all the fun but that’s not fair, is it? Keep your eyes on the screen. Watch her touch me.”</p><p>“I don’t want to watch her touch you! Turn it off!”</p><p>“No,” Rio says, tongue pressed to her cheek.</p><p>When Rio’s ex reaches up to play with her nipples while she sucks the strap, Agatha yells so violently that it hurts her ears.</p><p>“Do you still think it’s satisfying to tell me random men are fingering you and eating your ass?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says instantly. “No, no, no. Turn it off.”</p><p>“Do you still think it’s satisfying to tell me you have to go because someone’s dick is finally hard?”</p><p>“No!” Agatha shouts. “It’s not, I’m sorry. Please turn this off, I don’t want to see anyone else touch you.”</p><p>“Are you feeling jealous, Agatha?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says, renewing her struggles against the ropes. “I want to break her fingers. Get it <em>off</em>, Rio!”</p><p>“It’s not much longer,” Rio says with a chuckle.</p><p>On the screen, her ex climbs up on the bed and Rio’s getting ready to fuck her with the strap, and Agatha loses it.</p><p>“Witch killer!” she shrieks.</p><p>Rio scrambles to shut off the DVD and the tv, then tugs the ropes free of the chair and unwinds the one that’s binding Agatha’s wrists together. She leaves the ropes around her ankles for now because they’re no longer attached to anything.</p><p>As soon as she’s free, Agatha gets up and throws her arms around Rio’s neck, burying her face.</p><p>Rio holds her and soothingly rubs her back. “I’ve got you,” she murmurs.</p><p>“I know I deserved it but the last part was too much, I’m sorry,” Agatha says, muffled against her neck.</p><p>“Hey, I told you never to apologize for safewording,” Rio says, shaking her head. “It’s never going to make me upset if you use your safeword. It would actually make me upset if you didn’t use it when you needed to.”</p><p>Agatha nods, and Rio can feel her racing pulse where they’re pressed together. “I’ll think twice before trying to make you jealous again,” she promises. “Now that I know I can’t take the heat.”</p><p>“Everyone has lines,” Rio points out. “We just found one of yours.”</p><p>“I guess,” Agatha says, and she sounds kind of pouty. “Did you mean what you said about no sex tonight?”</p><p>“I did,” Rio says, preparing for a tantrum.</p><p>But she’s pleasantly surprised. “Okay,” Agatha sulks. “I understand.”</p><p>Rio kisses the top of her head and walks them to the sofa, then sits and pulls Agatha onto her lap. “Can you tell me what was too much for you about it? So I know for future reference? If you don’t know or aren’t sure, that’s okay too.” She reaches down to remove the ropes from Agatha’s ankles as she waits for a response.</p><p>Agatha curls into her, playing with her collar. “You’re the only person I’ve ever let use a strap on me,” she says quietly. “I didn’t want to see you use one on somebody else.”</p><p>Rio’s breath catches before stuttering out. “That’s so… touching,” she says, tears stinging her eyes.</p><p>Agatha looks up sharply, and Rio gets the impression she thought the answer might be mocking, but when she sees the emotion behind the answer, she settles back down. “I mean I guess I gave you my virginity in some small way,” she whispers.</p><p>Rio’s choked up now, because she supposes that’s true, and all the feelings and implications are overwhelming. “I—I guess you did,” she whispers back. “Thank you for safewording, Agatha. It means a lot that I can trust you to do that.”</p><p>“I don’t trust very many people,” Agatha says, shifting a bit on her lap. “But you are one of them, in case you were wondering.”</p><p>“Do you want to go for a walk?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“It’s a nice night.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha agrees. “Right now?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha slides off her lap and retrieves her boots to put them on, and Rio takes her by the hand, tugging her out the front door and nudging it shut behind them.</p><p>When they reach the sidewalk in front of the house, Rio stops to kiss her.</p><p>The kiss heats up quickly and hands start to wander.</p><p>Agatha pulls back, confused. “But you said…” She looks around. “You wanted to come outside so we’re not in your house or your car,” she says breathlessly.</p><p>Rio tries to look innocent, cheeks puffed out, and shrugs her shoulders. “What can I say? You’re irresistible, but I don’t break my own rules. Out here, though, the rules don’t apply.”</p><p>“I know it’s late and no one’s around but we can’t just fuck on the street…”</p><p>Rio laughs softly and grabs Agatha’s t-shirt. “The neighbors have a bouncy house.”</p><p>“Oh my God.”</p><p>“If you’d rather go back inside…”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“Back to the rules…”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>…”</p><p>“Back to not being touched tonight…”</p><p>Agatha pinches the bridge of her nose. “Where’s the fucking bouncy house?”</p><p>Rio cackles gleefully and pulls her along by the shirt. She opens the neighbors’ gate as quietly as possible and locks it tight behind them, then creeps into the backyard with Agatha in tow until they’re standing in front of a bright red (dark in the moonlight) bouncy house castle. “Didn’t you ever want to have sex in a castle?”</p><p>“I’m too old for this shit,” Agatha complains, but she pushes aside the safety netting and climbs in.</p><p>“You’re never too old for a bouncy house,” Rio argues, following her in and standing up to jump.</p><p>Agatha grabs her by the leg and looks queasy, so she stops.</p><p>“Are you… scared?” she asks carefully.</p><p>“Prone to motion sickness,” Agatha explains.</p><p>“Shit. So fucking in this thing will make you nauseous?”</p><p>“Probably.”</p><p>“Okay, let’s go somewhere else.”</p><p>“Well, we can try. I might be okay. Because where else would we go?”</p><p>“Motel room?”</p><p>“You’re that serious about your rules that you would pay for a motel room?”</p><p>“You’re paying.”</p><p>Agatha snorts. “Asshole. I’m on a teacher’s salary the same as you.”</p><p>“Fine, we’ll split the bill.”</p><p>The porch light comes on and the neighbors’ door opens.</p><p>Rio tackles Agatha on instinct with a hand over her mouth to keep her quiet.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes are wide, and to make things worse, Agatha licks her hand.</p><p>She sees a flashlight beam scanning the yard and makes sure they’re down low enough to be hidden by the bouncy house walls.</p><p>“Who is it, Ron?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Must’ve been a raccoon or something.”</p><p>“No, I told you, I heard voices.”</p><p>“Well no one’s there, Charlene. You’re hearing things. I’m going back to bed.”</p><p>“That’s fine, if an axe murderer comes in and kills me, you’ll have yourself to blame.”</p><p>“If only.”</p><p>Agatha licks Rio’s hand again and Rio snatches it away, wiping it on her pants.</p><p>They wait a few minutes after the door shuts and the light turns off, then skitter out of the bouncy house and back through the gate, off of the neighbors’ property.</p><p>“That was reminiscent of my teenage years,” Agatha says with a snort when they’re back in front of Rio’s house.</p><p>“The bouncy house?”</p><p>“The sneaking around. Can’t we just do it in the house?”</p><p>“Dom Rio is not touching sub Agatha tonight. Friends with benefits Agatha and Rio can go to a motel. What’s it gonna be?”</p><p>“It’s cute you think we’re friends,” Agatha says, hand to her heart, but then she relents and blows her hair out of her eyes with an exaggerated sound of annoyance at the inconvenience. “<em>Fine</em>. Motel. But you know what I would say as a teacher? You’re being inflexible.”</p><p>“Maybe that’s because my rules aren’t flexible.”</p><p>“No, you as a person. You’re being rigid. Your brain is stuck on the fact that you already made a decree about dom Rio and sub Agatha, and so there’s no room for flexibility even though you want to fuck.”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth to tell Agatha to fuck off when she realizes it’s actually intriguing. “Huh.” She stands thinking about it, and all the reasons she never goes back on her rules. “I’ve had people question my effectiveness as a dominant when I went back on a rule or changed my mind about a punishment,” she finally shares.</p><p>“I wouldn’t,” Agatha says, taking her hands. “And as much as I would enjoy getting my claws into you as friends with benefits… I love submitting to you, Rio. If we have to go to a motel and fuck as friends, we can. But I would never take advantage of you changing your mind about a punishment, no matter how bratty and opportunistic I am.”</p><p>Rio feels like she might actually cry. The consideration Agatha’s showing is so heartfelt that it’s making emotions swell in her chest that she hasn’t felt in a long time. “Okay,” she whispers. “Come on.” And she drops one of Agatha’s hands, using the other to lead her inside.</p><p>The moment they cross the threshold, Agatha’s body language shifts. She’s no longer actively holding Rio’s hand, she’s letting her hand be held. Her steps lose their confident swagger and she walks a pace behind. And when Rio turns to look at her, her head is bowed.</p><p>Jesus Christ.</p><p>“You’re fucking magnificent,” she breathes.</p><p>Agatha looks up with her mouth open. She doesn’t have to speak for Rio to read the surprise.</p><p>“You are, baby,” Rio insists, letting go of Agatha’s hand to frame her face and pull her in for a kiss.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha says shakily when their lips part.</p><p>“So magnificent,” Rio murmurs, kissing her way down Agatha’s chin and over the front of her throat. “So beautiful.” She bites the skin between Agatha’s neck and shoulder. “So mine.”</p><p>Agatha whimpers. “Yes,” she says urgently. “Yours.”</p><p>“Mine,” Rio repeats, threading her fingers through Agatha’s hair and giving a sharp tug. “And I want you in nothing but your boots.”</p>

<p>The tug on her hair makes Agatha’s eyes go glassy… or maybe it’s Rio’s words. Either way, she grabs Rio’s collar, the sign she’s overwhelmed (in a good way). “Yes sir,” she says, her body pressed tight against Rio’s.</p><p>Rio sucks a dark mark onto her throat and releases her hair so she can undress. “Be good.”</p><p>Agatha sways on her feet when Rio releases her, but doesn’t fall or stumble. “I need to take the boots off to get my jeans off, sir,” she says quietly as she pulls her t-shirt over her head, shaking it free of her hair before discarding it. The bra comes next and she looks at Rio for permission to take off the boots temporarily.</p><p>Rio stares back at her, a million different feelings flooding through her, and gently touches her face. “They go right back on afterward,” she murmurs.</p><p>“Yes sir,” Agatha says, the black of her eyes so dilated that it almost encompasses the blue. She keeps those eyes on Rio as she lifts up one leg at a time to take the boots off, and her jeans hit the floor a second later. She kicks out of those and steps on the toes of her socks to get them off without using her hands. Then she climbs back into the boots before she takes off her bra.</p><p>Her nipples are hard. Rio tweaks the black metal speared through each one and watches Agatha’s mouth drop open at the painful pleasure.</p><p>“Rio,” she whines breathlessly, arching her back.</p><p>“Underwear, baby,” Rio prompts, tugging sharply on the rings.</p><p>Agatha grabs her panties with both hands and rips them down one side. Then she rips them down the other side to get them off.</p><p>“Jesus fuck,” Rio gasps, an immediate throbbing starting up between her legs. “I wanted to be soft but…”</p><p>“Use me. Please,” Agatha chokes.</p><p>Rio takes her to the floor roughly and pins her on her stomach with an arm across the back of her neck. “Get your legs open you filthy fucking whore,” she hisses, kicking at one of Agatha’s boots.</p><p>The sound from Agatha’s throat is feral and she spreads her legs, hips bucking into the carpet.</p><p>The way Agatha responds to her, especially when Rio calls her names, will never get old. “Is that what you are?” she goads.</p><p>“Yes daddy,” Agatha moans. “I’m sorry. Please touch me.”</p><p>Rio swipes a finger between her legs and Agatha grinds into the carpet again.</p><p>“Oh God. Please.”</p><p>“You’re wet, baby.” Rio pops her finger into her mouth and sucks.</p><p>Agatha whines and presses up against the arm across her neck for a split second, then goes back down with a mewling cry. “Yes daddy, I’m wet.”</p><p>Rio grins and pops her finger back out of her mouth, painting Agatha’s thighs with her saliva. “I didn’t tell you to get so wet, did I?”</p><p>“No sir,” Agatha says, digging her fingers into the carpet. “I couldn’t help it. I’m sorry… I’m sorry for getting so wet, I couldn’t—I—”</p><p>She’s crying, Rio realizes with a delicious shudder. Fuck, she loves when Agatha gets like this. Literally nothing could ever compare. “Why are you crying, baby?” she asks, scratching lightly over Agatha’s ass cheeks.</p><p>“Because I’m a spoiled little bitch and I’m not getting what I want,” Agatha sobs. “I need you so bad. Please touch me, please, I need your fingers so fucking bad…”</p><p>Rio closes her eyes against the onslaught of arousal mixed with emotion. She doesn’t say anything yet, she’s still taking it in.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha begs. “I’m your whore, okay? It’s all I want to be… a filthy fucking whore, just like you said, just for you, fuck, God, please fuck me Rio, I can’t take it, please!”</p><p>Rio is so wet she can feel it soaking through her underwear, pressing against her skin, hot and sticky. “How do you want it?” She slaps Agatha’s ass.</p><p>Agatha yelps and raises her ass in the air, chasing Rio’s hand. “Please, please, please,” she chants. “Spank me daddy, fuck me, please, use me however you want… whatever makes you feel good, anything, anything, I can’t—”</p><p>Rio slaps her ass again, then forces her hips back to the carpet and throws a leg over one thigh to pin her down. “Stay down,” she growls.</p><p>“Yes sir, yes sir, I’m sorry,” Agatha babbles through her tears. “What do I have to do? I can’t take it I can’t fucking take it!”</p><p>“I’ve got you,” Rio purrs, sinking three fingers into her cunt.</p><p>Agatha’s sobs shift to cries of relief. “Thank you,” she sniffs. “Fuck. Thank you. Thank you daddy, thank you, thank you…”</p><p>Rio’s eyes are hooded and she is firmly planted in topspace, her head swimming. “So tight. So wet. So hot and fucking slick. So <em>easy</em>, aren’t you?” She pulls out and slams her fingers in hard.</p><p>“Ye-es,” Agatha stammers, pressing her cheek into the floor. “I’m such a whore, I—I’m so—I’m so—I’m easy—I swear, just for you, no one else…”</p><p>Rio keeps her pinned down and fucks into her hard and fast, relentless in her force and rhythm. Agatha’s yelling with each thrust. Rio fucks her harder. Switches to rubbing her clit. Until she screams, tightens, and a violent shudder overtakes her as she comes on Rio’s hand.</p><p>Rio doesn’t stop. Doesn’t even slow down. “Good girl,” she growls. “I believe you.”</p><p>“Oh fuck,” Agatha pants, winded from the orgasm, and Rio has no intention of letting her catch her breath before making her come again.</p><p>She pumps her fingers back in, curling and pressing everywhere she can reach. “When we’re done on the floor, I’m taking you to the wall.”</p><p>Agatha mewls pathetically. She seems beyond words for the moment.</p><p>Rio focuses; pounds into her until she knows Agatha will be raw and sore later on, then removes her arm from Agatha’s neck and flips her onto her back. It takes little effort and even less time, and her face is buried between Agatha’s spread thighs, clit sucked gently into her mouth.</p><p>The juxtaposition hits Agatha hard and she arches her back up off the floor, hands clawing at the carpet. She comes so beautifully on Rio’s tongue.</p><p>Rio swipes her sleeve over her mouth to clean her face and kisses Agatha’s belly button. “Stand up, sweet girl. Daddy’s not done with you.”</p><p>“Oh fuck, oh God, I can’t,” Agatha gasps, squirming and tossing her head side to side.</p><p>Rio chuckles darkly and stands, leaning over to take her by the arms and tug her into a sitting position. “Legs under you. Get up.”</p><p>Agatha folds her ankles under her ass and pushes to her knees, but that’s as far as she gets. She’s wobbly.</p><p>Rio’s right there. “If you fall, I’ll catch you. Get up.”</p><p>Agatha’s pupils are blown, her face flushed, mouth slightly open. She’s breathing through it.</p><p>She puts one foot on the floor and pushes to stand. She’s shaking but she doesn’t fall.</p><p>There’s a wet spot on the carpet and Rio’s nostrils flare. “You made a mess.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha whispers, her eyes never leaving Rio’s.</p><p>“On the wall.” Rio’s voice is commanding; impersonal.</p><p>Agatha takes the few steps and leans her shoulder against the wall, breathing hard.</p><p>“On the wall!” Rio barks. Agatha should know better.</p><p>And oh but she does know better, because the instant Rio repeats it, Agatha’s facing the wall with her front pressed against it and her hands flanking her head.</p><p>“You’re going to stand just like this while I get your ass ready for my strap, and then I’m taking you to the bedroom.”</p><p>Agatha makes a choked sound and pounds her fists on the wall, then flattens her hands again.</p><p>Rio presses herself flush to Agatha’s back, one hand between them, probing a finger around her asshole. “What’s your name, baby?”</p><p>Agatha groans. “Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Rio is satisfied that Agatha’s coherent, and pushes a little way inside. “How’s that feel?”</p><p>Agatha groans again.</p><p>“Answer me,” Rio insists, pushing in further.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha says distractedly.</p><p>The fact she can get Agatha so distracted that words disappear is endlessly appealing to Rio’s dom brain. “Answer me better than that,” she demands, pushing all the way in and pressing down with her fingertip.</p><p>Agatha pounds the wall again, then flattens her hands. “Please.”</p><p>Rio bites the side of her neck, making her shudder. “You’re not answering me very well, baby. Are you trying to be disappointing?”</p><p>A tiny whine filters its way to Rio’s ears and Agatha exhales heavily. “No daddy,” she says, her voice thick. “M’sorry. It feels tight. And good. Uncomfortable. Dirty. And amazing.” The words come out slow. Rio has her <em>down</em>.</p><p>And having Agatha down is such an all-encompassing rush of hazy bliss that Rio’s heart stutters. <em>Be careful</em>.</p><p>“Tell me if it hurts,” she directs, because in Agatha’s state of mind, she might forget to do so.</p><p>Rio eases the tip of her middle finger in alongside her index finger and gives a firm push.</p><p>Agatha cries out and hugs the wall, then slowly forces her ass toward Rio’s hand.</p><p>“Okay?” Rio checks in.</p><p>“Mm.” Agatha nods.</p><p>“Yes or no, baby.”</p><p>“Yes.” Again, her voice is thick and the word comes out slowly.</p><p>“Good girl.” Rio flicks the shell of Agatha’s ear with the tip of her tongue and inches her middle finger the rest of the way in. “So fucking tight. You haven’t let very many people back here, have you baby?”</p><p>“Jus’ my toys,” Agatha slurs.</p><p><em>Jesus Christ</em>. Rio’s ego tries to get in the way and she stomps it down with a vengeance. “How big?” she asks. “Bigger than my two fingers?”</p><p>“Dunno,” Agatha says, feathery.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio says, kissing her shoulder. “I’ll use the smallest one I have.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice is floating. “I… can take… it,” she says, pushing back against Rio’s hand again. “Want to.”</p><p>Rio’s clit has settled into a dull, throbbing cadence by this point. “Be good,” she says, an edge to her tone.</p><p>Agatha’s whimper is decadent. “I—be good,” she swears. “Your good girl.”</p><p>“That’s right,” Rio croons, kissing her shoulder again. “My good girl.” She steps back from the wall, bringing Agatha with her, keeping her fingers buried. “Walk.”</p><p>Agatha stumbles but Rio’s there to support her, wrapping her free arm around Agatha’s waist and guiding with her own steps.</p><p>It’s a slow process getting to the bedroom, but Rio’s fingers are still snugly in Agatha’s ass when they reach the bed.</p><p>Agatha hasn’t stopped making noise, and even when she bends over the bed, she’s squirming and moaning softly. It’s like she <em>can’t</em> stop moving.</p><p>“Where are we, baby?” Rio asks, leaning over Agatha’s back.</p><p>“Bedroom,” Agatha mumbles. “Your bedroom.”</p><p>“And where were we before we came in the house?”</p><p>“Neighbors’ bouncy castle.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio says, kissing her temple. She leans further over and reaches under the bed, feeling around until her fingers hook over the edge of the box she wants, and drags it out.</p><p>She gets out of her pants and into the harness, and snaps in her smallest attachment, swiping her fingers along Agatha’s pussy to gather some natural lube. She takes her time smearing it over the tip of the dick, then carefully eases her fingers out of Agatha’s ass, positioning the strap and giving a gentle push.</p><p>Agatha tenses up immediately and Rio stops moving.</p><p>“Does it hurt?”</p><p>“A little,” Agatha says breathlessly.</p><p>Rio draws her hips backward, removing the toy, and leans over Agatha’s back again. “I’m sorry, baby,” she says, all traces of harshness gone, replaced with a tender, soft, lilting affect.</p><p>“But I want…” Agatha starts to say, trailing off with a whimper.</p><p>“I don’t want it to hurt,” Rio says, nuzzling Agatha’s cheek with her nose. “Not like that. We’ll work up to it another night, okay?” Her heated buzz continues to fade into more of a protective topspace and she takes off the harness, helping Agatha get up fully onto the bed.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha says, still quiet and subdued, still riding the high. “Want to make you happy.” She curls into Rio when Rio offers an embrace.</p><p>Rio melts at the sentiment and holds her close. “I am happy,” she promises. “You’ve made me very happy tonight.”</p><p>Agatha presses her forehead against Rio’s neck. “I’m falling in love with you, Rio,” she whispers. “Please don’t break my heart.”</p>

<p>Rio is instantly punch drunk. “I won’t,” she breathes. “But how…?” She’s in disbelief. How can this magnificent woman be falling in love with her?</p><p>“I’ve never felt so safe to be who I am,” Agatha whispers. “You make room for every part of me.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes are stinging.</p><p>“It’s okay if you don’t have the same feelings for me, or any feelings for me, I underst—”</p><p>“Of course I do,” Rio says in a rush. “I literally couldn’t ask for more from you. You give me everything. And you’re amazing. You’re perfect. If I wasn’t falling for you I’d be a fucking idiot.”</p><p>Agatha starts to cry.</p><p>“Heyyyy,” Rio says, holding her tighter. “You didn’t like that answer?” she teases.</p><p>Agatha just clings to her and Rio drops the teasing, stroking her hair and kissing the top of her head since Agatha’s face is pressed into her neck.</p><p>“It’s okay, baby,” she hums. “I’m here. You can cry.”</p><p>“I didn’t think anyone would ever get past my defenses,” Agatha sniffs after a few minutes of quiet crying. “I’m glad it’s you that finally did. I can’t imagine not having met you, I can’t.”</p><p>“Then don’t,” Rio says. “There’s no reason to imagine that. You did meet me, I did get past your sky-high walls, and you’re mine.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach pushes against Rio’s hip. “Fuck. Why do I like that so much?”</p><p>“Being mine or hearing me say it?”</p><p>“Both, but I meant hearing you say it. It does something to me, physically, when you say that kind of thing.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio murmurs, putting her lips to Agatha’s ear, her eyelids fluttering.</p><p>Agatha breathes a little heavy. “Yes?”</p><p>“Would you wear a collar?”</p><p>Agatha squeaks. “Oh God.”</p><p>“Outside of work,” Rio continues. “Around your throat.”</p><p>Agatha whimpers. “Yes.”</p><p>“And during work… something hidden. Or a piece of jewelry that wouldn’t make anyone look twice…”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says again. “Collar me, please. Please.”</p><p>Rio pets her hair and pulls it. “I will.”</p><p>Agatha whimpers again.</p><p>“But the meaning is only binding in my car and my house,” Rio says after a thought occurs to her. “Wearing the collar outside of those places doesn’t mean anything changes.”</p><p>Agatha nods. “Yes, I like that.”</p><p>“And if wearing it outside of those places makes you feel submissive outside of our arrangement, then I’ll put it on you when you get in my car or enter my house and take it off you when you leave.”</p><p>Agatha’s hips roll into her side. “How do you do this to me? You take me apart so easily.”</p><p>“You say that like you don’t take me apart too,” Rio says. “I can’t believe you sub for me so beautifully. It takes me apart, it does.”</p><p>“Sometimes I’m sure I can tell,” Agatha says softly. “And sometimes I have no idea what you’re thinking.”</p><p>“I’m always amazed and thinking I’m lucky.” Rio runs a fingertip along the front of Agatha’s throat. “You’re going to look so pretty,” she whispers with a shiver, “collared to me.”</p><p>A moan filters out and Agatha’s eyes find hers. “Would you tell me again that I’m yours?”</p><p>Rio slides her finger around to the back of Agatha’s neck and then grips with her whole hand. She holds Agatha’s gaze and darts her tongue out over her lips. “You’re mine.”</p><p>Another moan.</p><p>“<em>Mine</em>,” Rio says again with emphasis.</p><p>Yet another moan and Agatha ruts against her hip.</p><p>“Now you say it.”</p><p>“Yours,” Agatha breathes. “I’m yours.”</p><p>“You’re my property,” Rio says, her voice dropping lower.</p><p>Agatha cries out, grinding harder against her hip. “I’m your property,” she recites. “I’m your property. Please say that again…”</p><p>Rio grips her neck harder and lets Agatha grind against her hip. “You’re my property,” she says again with a possessive growl.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha chokes out on a stuttered exhale as she comes.</p><p>Rio stares at her. “Did you just come?”</p><p>Agatha’s pupils are blown. “I—yes,” she says, looking a bit stunned herself.</p><p>“From grinding on my hip while I called you my property?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha repeats. “I’m—I did.”</p><p>“Do you think that’s appropriate?”</p><p>“Well… no.”</p><p>Rio can’t help laughing at her answer and ends up kissing her instead of scolding her. “Fuck, you’re cute.”</p><p>Agatha looks like she really wants to protest being called cute, but ultimately she just hides her face and says “thank you”.</p><p>“Are you tired?”</p><p>“Exhausted.”</p><p>“You can take your boots off now, baby.”</p><p>Agatha kicks them off.</p><p>--</p><p>They don’t get a chance to see each other outside of work again until the next Friday afternoon, because Agatha has social obligations and Rio has extra work to prepare for an upcoming school event and they’re both tired by the time they finish doing that every night.</p><p>The list of transgressions from the week that Agatha will have to answer for is surprisingly slim – but then again, Rio probably doesn’t know about every rude thing she’s said or done. She’s been in her classroom a lot drawing up fliers on her free time and such.</p><p>The thing that seems to persist is Agatha’s parking in the front lot, where parents and visitors are supposed to park, because it’s close to the front doors.</p><p>Rio is prepared to deal with it in an unconventional way, and as Agatha leans on her classroom doorframe after the bell on Friday, Rio smirks as she pushes past and heads for the exit. “Come on, keep up,” she says when Agatha’s slow to follow. “We’re going shopping.”</p><p>--</p><p>“Are you comfortable going in here with me?” Rio asks when she parks outside the local adult shop.</p><p>“Yes, Rio,” Agatha says, biting her lip. “Are we collar shopping?”</p><p>“We are.”</p><p>“Can I make a suggestion, please?”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio says, reaching across the console to stroke her cheek.</p><p>“Have you heard of Vandam’s Leather?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“It’s a high end leather store a few blocks from here, and they have really nice things,” Agatha says almost shyly. “They have a good selection of collars to choose from. I’ve… always wanted one, but… well, you know. No one could ever stand to be around me long enough to collar me so…” She looks out the window.</p><p>Rio tightens her hand around the back of Agatha’s neck and pulls her over the console to kiss her. “I would love to take you there.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a slow breath. “You would? I wasn’t sure but I thought it was worth asking. I can pay for it, of course. Vandam’s is more expensive than this place, I just—”</p><p>“Shh,” Rio interrupts her with a finger over her lips. “You’re okay. You’re worth the investment, Agatha. I’m paying for it.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fill with tears. “I don’t deserve you, Rio.”</p><p>“Yes, you do. And I don’t want to hear that again. Understood?”</p><p>Agatha nods and sniffs. “I understand.”</p><p>“Good. Now give me directions to Vandam’s.”</p><p>--</p><p>Vandam’s Leather is a very high-end store indeed. It’s beautiful, and their products are beautiful. Obviously made on a smaller scale than big distributors – maybe not made by hand, but made individually by machine rather than in bulk. Rio can tell by the type of stitching and the slightly varied look to each product, even of the same type. And the atmosphere is homey and comfortable. Like they’re walking into a home furniture store instead of a place to buy collars and leashes and corsets. The lighting is dim enough to be friendly but not so dark you can’t see what you’re buying.</p><p>“Wow,” Rio says after taking a second to absorb it all. “You’re right. They do have very nice things. I love this place already.”</p><p>Agatha’s holding her hand and walking a pace behind. Rio stops to let her catch up, but she stops at the same time, and Rio realizes it’s purposeful. She turns her head to catch a flush on Agatha’s cheeks, and chooses not to comment. She doesn’t want to embarrass her by drawing attention to her submissive behavior in a public place. As pleased as Rio is with that behavior, it’s not required in this location. But if Agatha is initiating it on her own, Rio is not going to say something to make her feel self-conscious.</p><p>She turns back around and scans the walls until she finds the selection of collars, and heads that way. As she’s running her fingers over some of them, she feels Agatha’s breath coming fast against her neck. “Are you okay?” she asks quietly.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha whispers.</p><p>“What color would you like to get?”</p><p>“Black, please.”</p><p>“It goes with everything. Good choice,” Rio says offhandedly and steps over to the rack of blacks and greys, starting to thumb through them. “How wide do you want?”</p><p>“What do you think?” Agatha asks, pressing herself to Rio’s back and resting her chin on Rio’s shoulder from behind her.</p><p>“I think the half inch ones are too thin. They’re dainty, which can be appealing, but I think they’re too dainty. The inch and a half or two inch ones are too thick. So goldilocks thinks maybe a one inch.”</p><p>Agatha’s arms go around Rio’s middle and rest on her stomach. “Okay,” she whispers. “I like that.”</p><p>“Now for the hardware. It obviously has to have an O-ring or a D-ring in the front for the leash, but other than that… do you like chains, studs, spikes… I hope you don’t like spikes because that’s not exactly functional, but if that’s what you want, that’s what we’ll get.”</p><p>“No spikes,” Agatha agrees, voice quiet. Her chin is digging in to the spot between Rio’s neck and shoulder, but Rio loves the way she’s standing so the discomfort is incidental.</p><p>Agatha reaches around her to pick up a collar with a small O-ring in front and no other hardware attached, but there are designs etched into the thick black leather that remind Rio of wings even though they’re clearly not meant to be any specific object.</p><p>“Do you like this one?” Agatha asks hesitantly, holding it out for Rio to take and inspect.</p><p>Rio takes it and runs her fingers along the etching, enjoying the way it feels. It’s smooth even with the indents. “I do. Do <em>you</em> like this one?”</p><p>Agatha wraps her arms around Rio’s middle again and nods into her chin’s resting spot.</p><p>“Okay, let’s try it on and make sure I like how it looks and you like how it feels. Is that allowed?”</p><p>“I don’t know, I’ve never tried anything on,” Agatha says as she’s exhaling.</p><p>Rio looks around for an associate, but they all seem to be busy, so she shrugs. “I’m sure it’s fine. It’s a collar, not underwear. Okay, stand in front of me.”</p><p>Agatha reluctantly releases her hold and steps away to stand in front of Rio.</p><p>Rio orients the collar correctly and fits it around Agatha’s throat, buckling it in the back.</p><p>Agatha lets out a quiet moan and drops to her knees.</p><p>Rio’s eyes bug. “No no, honey get up, we’re in a store,” she says, tugging on Agatha’s sleeve. <em>Oh my God oh my God oh my God</em>. Agatha’s not budging.</p><p>Rio thinks quickly and pushes her to sit down fully, then flops down next to her so it just looks like they’re sitting down to try on shoes or something. Even though they’re not in possession of any shoes to try on. It’s better than Agatha kneeling at her feet in public when they didn’t negotiate that beforehand.</p><p>She reaches around and unbuckles the collar, and Agatha whimpers when she takes it off.</p><p>A sales associate finally comes over with a politely concerned expression. “Is everything all right?”</p><p>Rio digs her credit card out of her pocket and hands it to him along with the collar. “Can you ring this up for me? I’ll meet you at the counter in a minute.”</p><p>“Of course,” he says with a smile and heads off toward the front of the store.</p><p>Rio turns back to Agatha. “Let’s get out of here, baby. Are you back with me?”</p><p>Agatha runs a hand over her face and nods. “Sorry. I don’t know—sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t apologize,” Rio says, nuzzling her nose against Agatha’s forehead. “You just… really like being collared,” she adds with a teasing smirk as she gets to her feet and helps Agatha up.</p><p>Agatha makes a little noise of protest at the teasing and follows Rio to the register, where they get the collar and the receipt for Rio to sign.</p><p>When they’re in the car, Rio turns to look at her across the console. “I think… in light of your reaction to being collared… I should put it on you when you enter my house and take it off you when you leave. Wearing it all the time is not going to be conducive to you living your life.”</p><p>Agatha’s blushing bright red and turns her face away.</p><p>“Hey, I’m not making fun of you,” Rio swears. “I’m being serious.”</p><p>Agatha draws her knees up onto the seat and wraps her arms around them.</p><p>“Agatha, look at me.”</p><p>She shakes her head.</p><p>“Look at me,” Rio insists, and Agatha finally looks at least halfway back in her direction. “It’s okay that you have a strong reaction. It’s okay that being collared brings out intense emotions for you. There’s nothing bad about that, I promise.”</p><p>“I embarrassed you in the store,” Agatha says, and Rio is alarmed at the icy undercurrent in her tone.</p><p>“You didn’t,” Rio says. “I freaked out because you were kneeling at my feet in public and you’ve expressed a desire to keep things private. I didn’t want to violate your boundaries.”</p><p>“I never said private,” Agatha says. “I said not at work.” She finally looks fully at Rio. “You weren’t embarrassed?”</p><p>“No,” Rio says. “I was worried. Not embarrassed. And worried for you, not for me. Believe me, anywhere you want to get on your knees for me is good in my book. But I would never want to betray your trust by taking advantage of a situation.”</p><p>Agatha seems to relax a fraction of an inch. “That’s all it was?” Her voice is so small and fragile.</p><p>“That’s all it was,” Rio says. “I would never be embarrassed by you showing me devotion, no matter where we were. If you want to submit to me in certain public places, you just have to tell me ahead of time so I don’t feel like I’m taking advantage of you when you’re turned on or in subspace.” <em>Like I did that day at work without even realizing it</em>.</p><p>“I was definitely in subspace,” Agatha breathes. “I was on the edge of it since we walked in, but when you buckled the collar… I just… it’s something I’ve wanted for so long, it just sent me.”</p><p>“I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t extremely thrilled at getting to be the one you’re like this with.”</p><p>“Getting to be?”</p><p>“Well, yeah. I get to be the one you go down hard with. It’s thrilling.”</p><p>“As if I’m some kind of precious commodity,” Agatha says, her brows furrowed.</p><p>“You are,” Rio says, her expression mirroring Agatha’s. “The small amount of ego I possess is inflated at getting to be your dom.” A thought hits her square in the chest and knocks some of the wind out of her. “Agatha… are you under the impression that I view this relationship as some kind of unwanted obligation? Like I’ve just been randomly saddled with the responsibility of being your dom whether I like it or not?”</p><p>Agatha looks distressed and hugs her knees tighter to her chest. “Most of the time I know that’s not true, but sometimes I can’t help wondering. I know I’m not easy to deal with. Maybe you think that it’s up to you since you’re the only one that can handle me.”</p><p>“I <em>want</em> it to be up to me,” Rio tries to assure her. “If there were people lined up for the job, I’d fight them off. I <em>want</em> you. So much. Every part of you. Not a single moment feels like an obligation. Didn’t you hear me when I said I was falling in love with you too?”</p><p>Agatha has the good grace to blush, and leans over the console to rest her forehead on Rio’s shoulder. “Yes. It’s just hard to believe after so many years of people giving up on me. I’m sorry. I’ll try to stop being so dramatic.”</p><p>“Honey it’s not dramatic, it’s trauma,” Rio says instantly. “You do not need to be sorry. All you need to be is yourself.”</p><p>Agatha purrs and nuzzles into her. “Thank you. I promise I’ll try.”</p>

<p>“Shit, we forgot a leash,” Rio says, her head thudding against the head rest. “I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand flies out and lands on her thigh.</p><p>Rio understands and covers Agatha’s hand with hers. “You can come with me, I just wasn’t sure you’d want to go back in right now.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a soft breath and nods. “I want to.”</p><p>“Okay, baby,” Rio says, squeezing her hand. “Come on, let’s get you a leash.”</p><p>She goes around and opens Agatha’s door for her while Agatha’s still getting out of the seatbelt. She doesn’t have to ask what’s taking so long because when Agatha gets out of the car, her pupils are blown.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio breathes. “You are so hot, sometimes I just can’t.” She steps forward and her body backs Agatha up against the car door.</p><p>Agatha whimpers and holds still. Letting Rio do whatever she wants.</p><p>“We need to negotiate public spaces because I want my hand in your pants right fucking now,” Rio says, biting her lip.</p><p>Agatha’s too gone to negotiate, but Rio doesn’t mean to do it right now anyway. They’ll talk about it later, at the house. She takes Agatha’s hand and leads her into the store, selects a leash made of silver chain links, and holds it up.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes track its movement like a metronome.</p><p>“Is chain okay? I’m going to love the sound it makes when I take you for walks,” Rio says, her voice low and intimate, just for Agatha to hear.</p><p>Agatha’s knees buckle but this time Rio’s prepared and slings a quick arm around her waist to hold her up. She needs to get Agatha to her house, now.</p><p>She half drags the trembling woman to the counter, pays for the leash, signs the receipt, and puts Agatha in the car, buckling her up.</p><p>“You’re safe, baby, just breathe,” she says, because she has to walk away to go around the car and she doesn’t want Agatha panicking. “I’m going around to get in the driver’s side. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha swallows and nods. That glassy look in her eyes will never, ever stop affecting Rio on such a visceral level that she’ll need to change her clothes when they get home.</p><p>Rio shuts the door and quickly jogs around to get in the car. She drives a little faster than usual, one hand on Agatha’s knee the whole time.</p><p>She checks in every two minutes to make sure Agatha’s coherent enough to know they’re in the car going home, and when they get there, the garage door grinding shut after them, Rio gets out of her seatbelt and awkwardly straddles Agatha’s lap, holding her face. “Where are we?”</p><p>“At your house. In the garage,” Agatha says slowly.</p><p>“Where did we just come from?”</p><p>Agatha breathes through parted lips and arches her back. “Vandam’s Leather.”</p><p>“What did we buy?”</p><p>Agatha moans, a quiet, needy sound, and squirms under Rio’s weight. “A collar and a leash,” she says, her voice airy and light but weighed down by purpose.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio hums and puts her hand down the front of Agatha’s pants.</p><p>Agatha bucks and whines before Rio even touches her underwear. It’s cramped and uncomfortable but she wants to do it right here, right now, and she rubs Agatha over the soaked crotch of her panties.</p><p>“Ohhh,” Agatha groans, tossing her head side to side and moving her hips so much Rio feels like she’s roping cattle.</p><p>But she doesn’t tell Agatha to hold still. Not this time. She weathers the storm, her hand sure and focused despite the volatile surroundings. She rubs, first with the heel of her hand, and when Agatha’s moans get higher and shorter, she draws up a little to use one fingertip over the pad of Agatha’s clit. The panties provide much needed friction and she moves with Agatha, meeting her jerky motions pound for pound, and she has Agatha clenching and coming within a few frenzied minutes.</p><p>And then Agatha’s clinging to her, breathing hard, face pressed into her chest as she calms.</p><p>“You’re so fucking tempting, Agatha,” Rio whispers. “I’ve never wanted anyone like this. I constantly want my hands all over you.”</p><p>Agatha squeezes her tighter, and a few minutes of silence creep between them before she hears a quiet “no objections.”</p><p>Rio laughs and tilts her chin up to look at her face, then kisses her and opens the car door. “Are you ready to go inside and talk about public spaces?”</p><p>“Can I clean up first? I’m a mess.”</p><p>“I’ll clean you up,” Rio says and gets out of the car.</p><p>Agatha follows and Rio gets a towel, making Agatha drop her pants and underwear in the middle of the living room, and gently dries off her pussy and the slick that’s smeared on her inner thighs.</p><p>Agatha blushes the entire time and Rio loves it. She tosses the towel into the bathroom and comes back to pull up Agatha’s panties, fitting them around her hips. She helps her get the pants up and fastened next, then sits on the sofa and drags Agatha down into her lap.</p><p>Agatha squeaks in protest at the dragging but once she’s sitting she curls up with her head leaning on the space between Rio’s neck and shoulder.</p><p>“So,” Rio says, stroking up and down Agatha’s back through her shirt. “You said not necessarily private, just not at work. Can you elaborate?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath is warm against her skin. “Stores like that… adult stores. Sex clubs. Outdoors where no one can see us, like a forest clearing or abandoned parking lot. Grocery store if we go a few towns over… same for a restaurant or coffee shop or bookstore. I like the idea of submitting to you in public. Just not at work.”</p><p>Rio wants to interrupt like seven times minimum, but she keeps her mouth shut and listens until Agatha’s finished. “God,” she finally says. “Yes, to all of that. How did I end up with the hottest woman alive? Physically and personality wise. You’re the hottest woman alive, Agatha. Christ.”</p><p>Agatha looks at her in surprise. “Yes to all of it? You—all of it?”</p><p>“Being seen with you at all is exhilarating. Being seen with you as my sub is downright life-altering. Just the idea of it makes my nerve endings tingle and has me so fucking wet you could probably choke if you licked my pussy right now.”</p><p>Agatha makes a strangled sound and tries to slide off of Rio’s lap toward the floor, but Rio tightens her arms.</p><p>“That wasn’t an invitation. You have behavior to answer for, you haven’t earned the right to lick my pussy tonight.”</p><p>Another strangled sound, this one with a different meaning behind it. “What behavior?” Agatha asks, squirming.</p><p>“You keep parking in the front lot. It’s for parents and visitors, Agatha.”</p><p>“I know, but it’s closer to the doors,” Agatha says with a sigh.</p><p>“You can keep doing it for as long as you like,” Rio says, arching an eyebrow. “But for every day you park in the front lot, we are going to jog twice the distance from the back lot to the doors.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw drops and she gapes at Rio. “I don’t jog.”</p><p>“You do now.”</p><p>“I’m not going to do that,” Agatha says, hackles rising. She straightens up on Rio’s lap.</p><p>“Are you safewording?” Rio asks, sitting up straighter as well.</p><p>Agatha growls, which means no but that she doesn’t want to admit out loud that she’s not safewording.</p><p>“Then yes you fucking are. Get up.”</p><p>The feral nature from their first few encounters rears its head and Agatha hisses. “Make me.” She lays on her back on the floor.</p><p>Rio tries to salvage the situation, taking a deep breath and running her hands over her face. “Agatha… where is this coming from?” she asks much more calmly than she feels. “What happened to the day you moved your car to the teachers’ lot just so I wouldn’t call you selfish?”</p><p>Agatha rolls onto her stomach so she’s not looking at Rio. She doesn’t answer.</p><p>Rio sighs. She reminds herself to act, not react. She kneels on the floor next to Agatha’s left side and affectionately strokes her hair. She feels rather than hears Agatha gasp. “Is there a reason you can’t jog that you don’t want to tell me?”</p><p>She can sense the fight inside Agatha’s body of whether to give in or see this tantrum through.</p><p>“No,” Agatha snaps after a minute. “Fuck you.”</p><p>Rio’s going to give her one more chance. She keeps stroking Agatha’s hair and leans over to kiss her shoulder blade. The muscles quiver under her mouth. Agatha’s shaking, she’s trying so hard not to give in. “If you tell me why it’s so distressing to you, we won’t do it, baby.”</p><p>Agatha whines and wriggles under the continued touches to her hair. “Because—” Her voice is soft, and Rio thinks maybe they’ve turned a corner. But then—“I said there was no fucking reason! Are you not paying attention or are you just that stupid?!”</p><p>Rio tries to keep the disappointment out of her body language and grips a fistful of Agatha’s hair. “You are my submissive in this house,” she scolds. “I gave you every opportunity to communicate with me but you are hellbent on breaking the rules and disrespecting me so now I’m done.” She stands up and leans over to grab Agatha by the ear and pull her up from the floor.</p><p>Agatha shrieks and has no choice but to move with Rio’s hand.</p><p>Rio drags her to the back door and into the backyard. “Run to the fence and back until I tell you to stop.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha sneers.</p><p>Rio keeps hold of her ear and starts jogging.</p><p>Agatha screams and clamps a hand over Rio’s, and starts jogging, hurling insults. “You stupid fucking bitch! You’re going to rip my fucking ear off! Stop! Stop! Let go!”</p><p>“Run to the fence and back until I tell you to stop,” Rio repeats.</p><p>“FINE! FUCK!”</p><p>Rio lets go of her ear and stops jogging, and Agatha runs. To the fence and back. To the fence and back. To the fence and back.</p><p>Rio was only going to make her do it five times, one for each day she’d parked in the front lot, but now she doesn’t know when she’ll call an end to it.</p><p>Agatha’s been running for fifteen minutes straight when she collapses to her knees at Rio’s feet, sobbing. “Because I wasn’t fast enough to keep my father from leaving!”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen in alarm and she drops to the ground, taking Agatha’s face between her palms. “What?”</p><p>“I don’t like to run because I couldn’t catch up to my father to tell him I loved him and beg him not to go. And he was gone and I never saw him again, and I was alone with my mother,” Agatha sobs.</p><p>“Oh my God. Baby. Why didn’t you just tell me?” Rio asks, her heart breaking, and she pulls Agatha into a hug.</p><p>Agatha melts against her, crying into her chest. “He was gone, and she was horrible,” she wails. “She’s always been horrible!”</p><p>“Baby, baby, shh,” Rio says, cradling Agatha’s head to her chest, repeatedly kissing the top of it as they sit on the ground outside. “I’m so sorry baby, I’m so sorry,” she soothes.</p><p>“Everyone leaves me!”</p><p>Rio’s crying a little too. “Not me,” she promises. “I’m never leaving you. No matter what you say or do. No matter how many times you shut down and lash out. I’m right here.”</p><p>Agatha clings to her, and they sit like that for what feels like forever, until the night lights up, thunder cracks, and the sky splits with rain.</p>

<p>Agatha had been calm for a while before it started pissing down rain, but Rio picks her up anyway and carries her into the house.</p><p>Agatha puts her arms around Rio’s neck and lets herself be carried without any theatrics.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she whispers as Rio closes and locks the back door.</p><p>“I know,” Rio says with a quiet sigh.</p><p>“I’m in trouble, aren’t I?” Agatha asks, still whispering.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio says with another quiet sigh.</p><p>“I thought so,” Agatha says. Still a whisper.</p><p>“You made some really bad choices,” Rio says, carrying her to the living room and sitting on the sofa. She keeps Agatha cradled like a baby. “Are we in agreement about that?”</p><p>“Yes but I—”</p><p>“Yes or no? You’ll have your turn to speak in a minute. Just answer me for now. Are we in agreement that you made some really bad choices?”</p><p>Agatha nods and curls closer, and puts her thumb in her mouth.</p><p>Rio almost passes out. “Okay,” she chokes, petting Agatha’s unruly hair. “That’s good.” What was her next question again? She’s having trouble focusing on anything but Agatha curled up sucking her thumb like a toddler.</p><p>She waits for a few minutes just enjoying the peaceful scene before she says softly, “I know you didn’t want to talk about it, and that was okay. But do you think that maybe instead of saying ‘no, fuck you’, you could’ve said ‘yes but it’s too hard to talk about’?”</p><p>Agatha looks up at her with big, shining eyes, and Rio thinks the option hadn’t even occurred to her. She keeps her thumb in her mouth and slowly nods, looking away.</p><p>“Do you think I should let you get away with talking to me the way you did? In my house, where you are my submissive?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fill with a different kind of tears than the heartbroken sobbing from outside and she looks at Rio again, shaking her head ‘no’.</p><p>“I’m not angry with you, but I’m not going to allow myself to be treated like that,” Rio explains. “I know you were hurting. But you could’ve told me the bare minimum instead of lashing out. Or you could’ve safeworded. You’ve safeworded before so I know you’re not resistant to doing it. I don’t understand what was different about tonight that made you unwilling to communicate at all.”</p><p>They sit for another few minutes and then Agatha reluctantly takes her thumb out of her mouth and speaks. “I was embarrassed,” she says, her voice hoarse and quiet. “It’s a stupid thing to be triggered over. Running.”</p><p>“It’s not stupid at all, and you weren’t triggered over running, honey, you were triggered over being abandoned as a child. The running was the jump point but the trauma is abandonment. And even if running itself <em>was</em> the trigger, we can’t help what makes us feel things, and it’s never stupid to be affected.”</p><p>“I was frustrated that I couldn’t just make myself tell you. I hate that I acted up, Rio, I just want to be good for you. I love being good for you. I’m really sorry.”</p><p>“I appreciate the apology,” Rio says, giving her a squeeze and kissing the top of her head. “Are you ready to face the music or do you need more time to process and talk things out?”</p><p>Agatha looks at her pleadingly. “Do you <em>have</em> to punish me?” she whispers.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says gently. “You misbehaved deliberately to avoid communicating and you said some pretty awful things to me that I will not tolerate. If you don’t accept punishment, you can either safeword or I can take you to your car. But if you stay, and you do not safeword, you are absolutely going to be punished.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha says almost before Rio’s even done speaking. “I shouldn’t have asked that. And if you didn’t punish me I’d feel thrilled for about five seconds and then feel so guilty I’d be sick. I’m just so cozy and happy being held like this I don’t want it to end.”</p><p>“Now you’re using effective communication and that makes me proud,” Rio says. “So we can sit like this a while longer, is that fair?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha murmurs, closing her eyes and relaxing into Rio’s hold. “Thank you so much, I don’t deserv—”</p><p>“Stop right there,” Rio cuts her off. “You do deserve it. I don’t want to hear that again, understand?”</p><p>“Yes Rio,” Agatha says, subdued.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio says, soft again, and rocks her a little as they draw comfort from each other.</p><p>About fifteen minutes later, she kisses Agatha’s head. “Are you ready?”</p><p>“Yes Rio,” Agatha says, though Rio can see she’s pouting a little as she stands up.</p><p>“Into the bathroom,” Rio directs.</p><p>She hears the sharp exhale of surprise from in front of her, but to Agatha’s credit, she doesn’t hesitate. She walks to the bathroom.</p><p>“Sit down,” Rio says, nodding toward the closed toilet, and Agatha sits. “Wait there.”</p><p>She goes to the kitchen for a sharp knife and returns to the bathroom, opens the medicine cabinet, and takes out a bar of soap. She uses the counter space next to the sink to cut off a corner of it and leaves the knife and the remaining soap, taking the small piece over to Agatha.</p><p>“Open your mouth.”</p><p>Agatha hesitates at that one, but only for a second, and then does it.</p><p>Rio holds her jaw with one hand and scrapes the piece of soap over her bottom teeth, then flips her wrist so she can do the same with her top teeth.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes water but she doesn’t move or complain.</p><p>Rio pops the rest of the little piece into Agatha’s mouth and closes it for her. “Keep your mouth closed until it’s gone. You’re going to swallow every bit of that as it slowly dissolves. Because when you disrespect me, I will clean out your mouth. Are we clear?”</p><p>Agatha keeps her mouth shut and nods, blinking back her tears as she gags.</p><p>Rio stands leaning against the wall across from the toilet and watches.</p><p>Agatha holds still, swallowing and gagging it down every so often when enough of the bar has melted into liquid to need swallowing.</p><p>“Please, I have to spit it out,” she whines.</p><p>Rio holds her eyes as she leans down and picks up the trash can from under the sink and places it in front of her. “It’s okay if you spit it out, we’ll just start over.”</p><p>Agatha clamps her mouth shut and shakes her head, her watery eyes finally leaking, a few tears rolling down her cheeks. She nudges the trash can back under the sink with her foot and shakes her head again.</p><p>She doesn’t complain any further, and she doesn’t spit out the soap.</p><p>When she swallows the last of it, she looks at Rio, and there’s so much going on in her expression that Rio doesn’t know how to interpret it.</p><p>“Is it gone?”</p><p>Agatha nods. “Please can I eat or drink something? It’s still on my teeth and in the back of my throat and it tastes like—”</p><p>“It tastes like disrespect,” Rio reminds her, and Agatha’s eyes blow. “You can eat and drink in thirty minutes.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw works silently and she nods again, and reaches a hand out for Rio.</p><p>Rio moves into her space and hugs Agatha’s head to her stomach. “I hope I don’t need to do that ever again,” she says. “But slapping your face for backtalk wouldn’t do any good, would it?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha admits quietly. “Any kind of hitting just turns me on.”</p><p>“Thank you for being honest. I love the way you’re communicating now, baby. And I’m proud of you for taking your punishment like a good girl.”</p><p>Agatha puts her arms around Rio’s waist and squeezes. “It was so hard. I wanted to spit it out so bad. But I wanted to show you I was sorry. Not just say it.”</p><p>“You did show me, baby,” Rio says, running fingers through her hair.</p><p>“Do you forgive me?” Agatha’s voice is suddenly small and fragile.</p><p>“Absolutely,” Rio promises.</p><p>“You’re not going to leave?”</p><p>“Not a chance.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha says, squeezing her again. “For wanting me enough to punish me instead of leaving me.”</p><p>“You don’t have to thank me for that,” Rio says.</p><p>“I really am sorry. I hate the way I treated you. It’s inexcusable.”</p><p>“And you were punished for it, and now we move on,” Rio soothes her. “Let’s get out of the bathroom.”</p><p>“But why do I <em>do</em> that?” Agatha asks, aggrieved.</p><p>“I think it’s just a defense mechanism,” Rio says. “But I’m not an expert.”</p><p>“I don’t need to defend myself from you though,” Agatha says. When Rio tugs on her hands, she allows herself to be led back to the living room. “My defense mechanisms should go to sleep around you.”</p><p>Rio sits and Agatha curls up in her lap, mimicking their earlier position. It seems natural now, sitting like this, holding Agatha like a baby.</p><p>“It’s not that simple,” she says with a wistful smile. “We can’t control them like that. They’re instinctual.”</p><p>“I know, it’s just frustrating,” Agatha sighs.</p><p>“I know, baby. But you’ve already gotten much more respectful overall than you were a week ago. Try not to get so frustrated with yourself. You’ve been so good the last few times we’ve gotten together. One difficult evening doesn’t erase any of that.”</p><p>Agatha looks at Rio for a long time, and Rio can see her brain working. “Okay,” she finally agrees.</p><p>“Okay?” Rio asks, eyebrows raising.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flush a little. “I mean okay like… I’ll try to remember it’s not my responsibility to be frustrated with myself, and I’ll try not to think you’re always going to leave if I misbehave.”</p><p>“Do you—is that why you think your father left? Because you misbehaved?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes go a bit wide and Rio’s afraid she’s going to snap again even after everything they’ve just been through tonight, but then her jaw quivers and Rio realizes she’s not angry, she’s just sad. “I don’t know,” she whispers. “He didn’t tell me.”</p><p>“Parents don’t leave because of their children, they leave because of their spouses,” Rio says in a rush of air, her heart breaking that Agatha could think something like that even in unsurety. “Your behavior would <em>never</em> cause that. No child is ever at fault for a parent leaving them. It wasn’t because of you, honey, I can promise you that even though I don’t know either of your parents.”</p><p>Agatha looks like she wants to believe it, Rio thinks. “My mother said it was because I never listened and always got into things I wasn’t supposed to.”</p><p>Rio grits her teeth. “I’m sorry she lied to you,” she says after discarding about a dozen scathing responses.</p><p>That seems to resonate and Agatha relaxes a little, snuggling up closer and resting her head in Rio’s favorite spot. Just between her neck and shoulder, nestled against the soft skin there.</p><p>Rio takes an internal deep breath, relieved that she said the right thing. “You’re so precious,” she says quietly after a minute. “Thank you for everything you give me.”</p><p>Agatha squirms in her lap. “I think you give me a lot more than I give you.”</p><p>“You would be wrong,” Rio says, kissing the top of her head. “And it’s not a competition anyway. I said thank you, now what should you say instead of countering that?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes go wide again, her irises swirling. “You’re welcome,” she breathes.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio says. “Oh, and Agatha?”</p><p>“Yes Rio?”</p><p>“Don’t ever call me a stupid fucking bitch again.”</p><p>Agatha gasps and her eyelids flutter. “I won’t. I won’t ever.”</p><p>“If you do… I’ll put something a lot worse than soap in your mouth.”</p><p>Agatha’s panting softly by this point and shakes her head. “I won’t,” she swears. “But… what’s worse than soap? I can’t even imagine.”</p><p>“A teaspoon of cayenne pepper under your tongue.”</p><p>Agatha chokes. “Oh God.” She grabs Rio’s shirt in both fists. “How do you just—I mean—I definitely don’t want that but just hearing you say it—fuck, Rio, how do you do this to me? I feel crazy.”</p><p>“Welcome to the club. You sucking your thumb? Please. It sent me into orbit.”</p><p>Agatha squirms and pops her thumb in her mouth again. “Like this?” she says around it.</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flare as she stares. “Yeah. Like that.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darken and she peers at Rio from under half-closed eyelids. She slides her thumb out of her mouth and returns her hand to Rio’s collar, curling her fingers around it. “You like me acting like a toddler? Or a little baby?” she asks, her voice low and even.</p><p>Rio swallows nervously. “Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip and breathes through her nose. “Are you gonna give me a bottle? Or a sippy cup?”</p><p>Rio’s heart is racing. Agatha has a talent for awakening things inside her that she never knew existed. “Maybe.”</p><p>“Push me on the swings?”</p><p>They’ve moved from half teasing to fully serious now, Rio can tell. “If you want that, yeah. We—we can negotiate a scene at the park sometime.”</p><p>Agatha clutches her shirt tighter. “Wait, are you serious? You would?”</p><p>“Of course I would,” Rio says. “If I say yes to something I’m not just messing with you, honey.”</p><p>“How are you so amazing? I’m just…” She makes a noise like an explosion.</p><p>“I want to fulfill every need you have,” Rio explains. “Unless it’s something I object to, I’m willing to do anything you want to do in a scene.”</p><p>“Jesus,” Agatha whispers.</p><p>“So is that something you want? A day at the park?”</p><p>Agatha’s face turns bright red. But she nods.</p><p>“Then we’ll plan a day at the park.”</p><p>“Can it be a night at the park so no one else is there?” Agatha asks almost shyly.</p><p>“Absolutely, as long as we can see what we’re doing.”</p><p>Agatha shudders and clings to her. “What the hell was I doing with my life before I met you?”</p><p>Rio smirks because she has an answer for that. “Being a fucking menace to anyone and everyone twenty-four hours a day.”</p><p>Agatha grimaces but snorts out a laugh. “Right. Right. I think the world owes you a debt of gratitude.”</p><p>“The school does at least,” Rio teases.</p><p>Agatha goes serious again. “I do,” she says, looking Rio in the eye. “Can I kiss you please?”</p><p>Rio’s heart thumps against her ribs and she slides a hand behind Agatha’s neck. “So polite,” she croons. “Yes, you may.”</p><p>Agatha presses her lips to Rio’s, and it’s soft and sweet, and then she curls up again with a sigh. “You always taste so good.”</p><p>“Like coffee and despair?” Rio asks with a grin.</p><p>“No,” Agatha says. “You taste like coffee sometimes but you always taste like… I don’t know, just like Rio, I guess. I’ll never get enough.”</p><p>Rio rests her cheek on the top of Agatha’s head. “That’s a win for me.”</p>

<p>Agatha stays the night, and in the morning Rio makes breakfast. She’s barefoot at the stove flipping pancakes when Agatha wakes up and shuffles into the kitchen, flopping into a chair. Okay so maybe she’s not entirely awake because she rests her forearm on the table and lays her face on it and doesn’t say anything.</p><p>Rio snorts softly and turns back to the stove. Ten minutes later the pancakes are done, and Agatha is indeed asleep at the table, and Rio wonders how many more times this woman will do something so unexpected and adorable.</p><p>She makes them each a plate and puts butter on all the pancakes, then sets out syrup and powdered sugar, gets forks, pours them both a glass of orange juice, and gently shakes Agatha awake.</p><p>Agatha lifts her head and leans toward Rio, pressing her face into Rio’s side.</p><p>“Good morning princess,” Rio says, affection lacing her tone despite not meaning to say it quite like that.</p><p>Agatha’s arms come up to encircle her waist and she’s being squeezed like a vise. “I woke up by myself,” she complains.</p><p>“I was hungry,” Rio says with a little laugh. “Aren’t you hungry?”</p><p>Agatha nods but doesn’t let go of her waist. “But I’m too tired to eat.”</p><p>Rio reaches behind her to take hold of Agatha’s hands and remove them from around her, then stands behind her and nudges the chair with her hips until Agatha’s front is almost touching the edge of the table.</p><p>Agatha grunts her dissatisfaction.</p><p>Rio smirks and drops a kiss to the shell of her ear, then lets go of one hand to pick up the fork and curl Agatha’s fingers around it. She guides Agatha to cut a piece of pancake and spear it on the fork.</p><p>Agatha is suddenly sitting up straight, her left hand flat on the table, and Rio hears the rush of air as she sucks in a breath.</p><p>“Waking up a little?” she purrs into Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“Ffffffff,” Agatha says.</p><p>Rio keeps hold of the hand with the fork and guides it to Agatha’s mouth. “Open,” she encourages with another kiss to the shell of a blushing ear.</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth and Rio helps her put the pancake into it.</p><p>“Are you good now baby or do you need me to help you chew it?”</p><p>Agatha makes a strangled sound and starts chewing the pancake. “You’re going to kill me,” she squeaks when she swallows.</p><p>“I can’t have you going hungry,” Rio says, full of mischief.</p><p>“I’m good now,” Agatha says, voice raspy. “I’ll eat.”</p><p>Rio skips to her own chair and starts eating her own breakfast. “After we eat, I need to go get some things at the store. Do you want to come with me, stay here, or have me take you to your car?”</p><p>Agatha stops chewing mid-bite. “What things?” she asks with her mouth full.</p><p>“Jesus, manners,” Rio says, eyes wide. “Swallow before you speak.”</p><p>Agatha turns bright red and finishes the bite of pancake. “What things?” she asks, much quieter this time.</p><p>“A few sippy cups and some pajamas for you.”</p><p>Agatha drops her fork. It clatters against the plate. She slides off her chair and sits under the table.</p><p>Rio keeps eating. Even when she feels arms around her leg and a head resting against her knee, she keeps eating. If Agatha needs some time to decompress under the table, that’s okay.</p><p>A few minutes later Agatha’s voice filters up through the tablecloth. “Can I still go with you?”</p><p>“Yeah, of course,” Rio says casually.</p><p>Another few minutes and Agatha speaks again. “Can we go a few towns over?”</p><p>Rio drops her fork.</p><p>Her pulse is hammering in her ears and behind her eyes. She’s instantly wet. “Yeah, of course,” she says, not casually at all. “Let’s finish eating and negotiate.”</p><p>Agatha finally crawls out from under the table and sits in her chair again. The blush has faded and she picks up her fork to finish her breakfast.</p><p>--</p><p>They move to the sofa after Rio washes the dishes and Agatha dries them. Rio has them sit facing each other instead of putting Agatha in her lap, because she needs to be able to see her expressions.</p><p>“What are you comfortable with in a store like Target or Walmart a few towns over?” Rio starts them off.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha says.</p><p>“You don’t know as in you can’t think of anything or you don’t know as in you don’t know how you’ll react to anything?”</p><p>“I can’t think of anything. Can you give me options of what you’d be likely to do and I can say yes or no?”</p><p>Rio is so proud of her that she grabs her face and kisses her. “Good job. I absolutely can.”</p><p>Agatha melts into the kiss and it makes Rio feel some kind of way that she looks proud of herself at the praise. She thinks it’s the first time Agatha’s ever looked proud of herself. She could be misinterpreting the look, but she doesn’t think so.</p><p>“Walking behind me while you hold onto my belt loop?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“A smack on the butt if I need to correct you for something small?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flutter. “Yes.”</p><p>“Even if people are in eyesight?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” Agatha says, squirming. “God, Rio.”</p><p>Rio squirms too. “Verbal scolding? Even if people can hear it?”</p><p>Agatha looks positively impatient to have that happen. “Yes.”</p><p>“Being grabbed by the arm and pulled away from something?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“That’s probably all I’d be comfortable with in that kind of store,” Rio says.</p><p>Agatha nods and shifts closer to her. “That sounds perfect.”</p><p>A minute later she looks anxious. “What’s wrong?” Rio asks immediately.</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha assures her. “I just thought of a question. Am I allowed to misbehave a little bit on purpose in the store to make those things happen? Or is that disrespectful?”</p><p>A wave of emotion washes over Rio so hard that she feels staggered. Her throat chokes up a little and she reaches for Agatha, dragging her closer until Agatha is in her lap. “That is a very good question,” she says, hoping she doesn’t sound as wrecked as she feels. “I can’t express how much I appreciate you asking that. And the answer is yes, you are allowed to misbehave a little bit on purpose in the store, <em>because</em> we are negotiating it beforehand. <em>Because</em> you asked that question.”</p><p>Agatha relaxes and her eyes sparkle the slightest bit. “I did good?”</p><p>“You did so good.”</p><p>“I have a good teacher.”</p><p>Rio melts into a puddle but she doesn’t want to be obvious about it. “Finally acknowledging my skill?” she asks instead, nuzzling the top of Agatha’s head with her lips. “Thank you, baby.”</p><p>--</p><p>Rio’s stomach is doing flips as they pull into a parking space at Target an hour later. “Sippy cups and pajamas, nothing else, got it?” she sets a boundary for Agatha to cross.</p><p>“Yes sir,” Agatha says, eyes shining.</p><p>Rio thumps her forehead against the steering wheel. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Agatha shuffles behind her with a finger hooked in her belt loop as they enter the store. “Why are we getting pajamas?” she asks suddenly.</p><p>“We’re getting kids’ pajamas,” Rio says, steering them toward the children’s department. “Or a sweatsuit, I think they have Powerpuff Girls pants and hoodies.”</p><p>Agatha stumbles but manages not to actually fall. “Oh.”</p><p>“Is that not okay?” Rio asks, stopping so she can turn to look at Agatha over her shoulder.</p><p>“No no it’s fine,” Agatha says, tugging on her belt loop. “I just didn’t know. I wasn’t expecting it.”</p><p>Rio nods and kisses her forehead, then resumes the trek to the aisle with bottles and sippy cups. “Do you want bottles too or just sippy cups?”</p><p>Agatha is pressed so tight against her back it almost makes her groan.</p><p>“Sippy cups will be fine,” she mumbles.</p><p>“Which ones do you like?”</p><p>Agatha quickly taps her finger on a pack of Ninja Turtles sippy cups and pulls it back like the package is going to burn her.</p><p>Rio grabs it from the peg. “Any others?”</p><p>Agatha scans the small selection and taps a package of plain clear ones with pink lids.</p><p>Rio takes that one from the wall as well and holds onto both packages. “Would you rather have Ninja Turtle pajamas than Powerpuff Girls?” she asks. “We can look for them if you want.”</p><p>“No, I want Powerpuff Girls,” Agatha says.</p><p>“Okay, come on.”</p><p>Rio heads off toward the athletic wear department where she thinks she’s seen Powerpuff Girl sweat outfits before, and halfway there she doesn’t feel a tug on her pants anymore and turns around to find Agatha in the cookware aisle looking at saucepans.</p><p>“Hey,” she calls, walking over. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“I need a new saucepan,” Agatha says. “My best one is covered in burnt grease.”</p><p>“We can get one later,” Rio says. “We’re just here for sippy cups and pajamas, remember?”</p><p>“I want to look now,” Agatha says, throwing her a pout. “Please?”</p><p>“If I have to repeat myself you’re not going to like it,” Rio says just as an older woman turns down the aisle.</p><p>Agatha clocks their audience and looks torn between pushing the issue and getting into trouble, or behaving and not getting scolded in front of the woman.</p><p>Rio waits with her eyebrows raised. Her heart is racing a little, wondering which way Agatha’s going to lean.</p><p>Agatha chooses a middle ground and grabs a saucepan off the shelf. “I’ll just get this one.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “Not now.”</p><p>“You can’t tell me what to buy,” Agatha says, puffing up her chest.</p><p>Okay so she’s choosing violence. Rio raises her voice. “When you make the money, you can decide what to get. Until then, the saucepans we have are fine. Put it <em>back</em>.”</p><p>Agatha growls and fully just drops the saucepan on the floor.</p><p>The older woman at the other end of the aisle is very obviously trying not to look at them but keeps sneaking her eyes toward them. Rio can’t blame her. They <em>are</em> very interesting.</p><p>“Pick that up and put it back on the shelf.”</p><p>“I thought we didn’t have time for this.”</p><p>“I didn’t say anything about time, I specifically referenced money. Pick it up and put it back on the shelf. Last warning.”</p><p>“Or what?” Agatha snaps, but she bends down to pick it up and puts it back on the shelf.</p><p>Rio grabs her by the arm and drags her out of the aisle. “If you let go of my belt loop again your butt is getting smacked in the middle of this store, is that clear?”</p><p>Agatha hooks a finger in her belt loop and grumbles.</p><p>Rio turns her head and lowers her voice. “I said, is that clear?”</p><p>Agatha swallows and nods. “Yes sir.”</p><p>Rio shivers and nods as well. “Good.”</p><p>They don’t have any more trouble getting to the athletic wear department.</p><p>But once they’re looking at character sweat suits, Agatha lets go of her and wanders off again.</p><p>Rio follows and grabs her by the arm. “What did I say?” She turns her and smacks her firmly on the ass.</p><p>Agatha yelps and scowls and turns bright red. And that’s <em>before</em> a couple teenagers at the next rack start whispering.</p><p>To Rio’s astonishment, Agatha doesn’t seem embarrassed by <em>that</em>, because she turns directly toward them and barks, “Mind your own fucking business or you’re next.”</p><p>“Mind our own business?” one of the boys sneers. “You just got your ass spanked in a fuckin’ store. Mind <em>your</em> own business.”</p><p>Rio can see Agatha about to absolutely lose her shit, so she steps between her and the teenagers, lightly pushing her chest to get her to back up. “Honey,” she says. “Focus on me. I don’t want you fighting with teenagers.”</p><p>Agatha’s furious and trying to look around her, but Rio pushes her chest harder and knocks her off balance so she has to catch herself, and that takes her attention long enough for Rio to sneak a hand up into her hair and squeeze a fistful at the base of her neck.</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>Agatha freezes.</p><p>“You are here with me, not them. Your focus should be on me, not them. Don’t disrespect me by spiraling out of control.”</p><p>It’s obviously a huge struggle, and Agatha’s face is red with anger instead of embarrassment, and she’s clenching and unclenching her hands at her sides and growling under her breath, but the longer they stand there, the more Rio can see her acting instead of reacting.</p><p>Finally she takes a deep breath and nods as well as she can with Rio’s grip on her hair. “Yes sir,” she whispers. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio breathes a sigh of relief and loosens her hold, lightly scratching at the back of Agatha’s neck rather than pulling her hair. “Thank you honey. Good girl,” she whispers back. “When you’re out with me as my submissive, if something happens that you don’t like, you let me handle it.”</p><p>Agatha deflates further and takes hold of Rio’s belt loop. “But you didn’t say anything,” she murmurs, eyes on the floor.</p><p>Rio quirks up one corner of her mouth because she can’t hold in her amusement. “Just wait, baby.”</p><p>The jewelry department is next to athletic wear and they’re on the edge between the two, so it’s easy for Rio to grab a couple necklaces from a display. She balls them up in her fist, and after they find the Powerpuff Girls sweat pants and hoodie, she slips the necklaces into the boy’s coat pocket as they walk toward the registers.</p><p>She hears Agatha gasp from behind her, and when they get to the register, Rio adopts a concerned expression and looks as nervous as she can. “Hi,” she says to the clerk. “I saw one of those boys over there put some jewelry in his pocket…”</p><p>Agatha grabs her pants so tight the waistband digs into her stomach.</p><p>The clerk frowns. “I’ll have someone from loss prevention look into it. Thank you.”</p><p>“Yeah, I don’t really like to get involved, but I can’t stand stealing,” Rio says, and they check out, pay, and leave.</p><p>When they’re in the car, Agatha leans across the console and stares hard at her. “Kiss me, please?”</p><p>Rio purrs and grabs her by the shirt, pulling her in, fitting her mouth over Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha moans and opens her mouth, and Rio slides her tongue in. It’s hot and wet and messy, and Agatha’s breathing hard.</p><p>“You’re so hot,” she pants.</p><p>“Mmm, thank you,” Rio chuckles.</p><p>“I can’t believe you did that. I thought you were supposed to be the reasonable one.”</p><p>“That <em>was</em> reasonable. Getting into a shouting match with random children would be unreasonable. Making them regret talking to my sub like that without putting either of us at risk of a confrontation was reasonable.”</p><p>Rio kisses her again, claiming her mouth possessively and biting her bottom lip until Agatha whimpers.</p><p>“I forgot to ask how you feel about being fucked in the parking lot,” Rio says with a sigh, resting their foreheads together.</p><p>“Yes please,” Agatha answers, but Rio shakes her head.</p><p>“It’s too late now baby, you’re turned on so your consent is impaired. We’ll talk about it before our next outing.”</p><p>Agatha whines and kicks the dashboard, and crosses her arms over her chest. “I’m not buckling my seatbelt,” she says petulantly.</p><p>Rio can’t help laughing. “Shut the fuck up and get buckled. I’ll fuck you when we get back to my house.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says, looking out the window, not budging her arms.</p><p>“Agatha, when are you going to realize that throwing a tantrum never ends the way you want it to? If you don’t put your seatbelt on I’ll just drive us back anyway, and then I <em>won’t</em> fuck you when we get there.”</p><p>Agatha gets out of the car.</p><p>Rio takes a deep breath. If it were anyone else she’d drive off, but with Agatha’s abandonment issues there’s no way she’s going to do that.</p><p>She calmly gets out and walks around to stand in front of Agatha, who’s leaning on the passenger door with her arms folded again and her ankles crossed as if nothing’s going on.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio says softly, scratching a fingernail under Agatha’s chin.</p><p>Agatha squirms and looks away.</p><p>Rio sets her hands on Agatha’s biceps and rubs up and down. “I know you’re frustrated,” she whispers.</p><p>Agatha nods, still looking away.</p><p>“It’s okay to be frustrated,” Rio says, sliding her hands up over Agatha’s shoulders and smoothing them down her back, then pulls her into a gentle hug.</p><p>Agatha’s frozen for a few long seconds and then she feels Agatha’s arms hesitantly unfold and go around her.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha says.</p><p>“I know it’s hard for you when you don’t get everything you want,” Rio says. “Will you please get back in the car and put your seatbelt on?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m sorry,” Agatha says again, her voice shaky. “I—I’m ready to go.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio croons, kissing the side of her head and easing out of the hug. Catastrophe averted, she waits for Agatha to be in and buckled before she goes back around to the driver’s side, gets in, and takes them home.</p>

<p>Agatha is subdued for the entire drive, and when Rio parks and shuts the garage, in the stillness following that, when the car is turned off and the hum of the engine quiets, she hears a sniffle.</p><p>“Oh, honey,” she says, and goes around to open Agatha’s door, unbuckles her, and pulls her gently out of the car into another hug. “It’s okay.”</p><p>“What do you want with me?” Agatha asks, wiping her eyes on Rio’s shoulder. “I’m the worst submissive on the planet.”</p><p>“That’s enough of that,” Rio says. “It’s not true, and I don’t like hearing you talk about yourself that way.”</p><p>“It is true, though,” Agatha says, and she sounds defeated.</p><p>“It isn’t, and we are going to discuss this inside. Go sit on the sofa.” She pulls out of the hug and opens the door, motioning Agatha through, and when that’s been accomplished she grabs the bags from Vandam’s Leather out of the car and follows, discarding the bags on the way to leave her holding the collar and leash.</p><p>She takes a breath and stands in front of Agatha. “Undress.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes dart to the items in Rio’s hands and widen, her fingers instantly springing to action undoing fasteners, and she takes off her clothes.</p><p>“Down.”</p><p>Agatha drops to her knees.</p><p>Rio will never get tired of seeing Agatha on her knees. Or naked. Or even just sharing her space standing up fully clothed. She sets the leash on the couch and focuses on the collar, leaning over to wrap it around Agatha’s neck and buckle it in the back, sliding two fingers underneath to make sure it’s not too tight, and stands back up.</p><p>Agatha grabs the waist of Rio’s pants and curls her fingers into it, breathing hard.</p><p>“You’re overwhelmed baby, I know,” Rio whispers, petting her hair.</p><p>Agatha moans and sits back on her heels.</p><p>“Up,” Rio says, and it will never cease to amaze her how quickly Agatha obeys in these moments. She’s back up on her knees instantly. “Stay.”</p><p>She takes a few steps back and Agatha stays, dropping her hands to her sides when she can no longer reach Rio’s pants.</p><p>Rio is uncomfortably wet. “Down,” she says, and snaps at the floor in front of Agatha, watching her lower herself to all fours. “Come.”</p><p>Agatha crawls to her, head bowed.</p><p>Rio crouches in front of her and wraps a hand in her hair, wrenching Agatha’s head up to look her in the eye. “You are a <em>good</em> girl,” she says.</p><p>Agatha groans, her jaw working in silence.</p><p>“Say it.”</p><p>“I am a <em>good</em> girl,” Agatha repeats. Rio can barely see the blue in her eyes. Her pupils are swirling black holes, tempestuous and tame in the same breath.</p><p>“You deserve everything I have to give.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyelids flutter.</p><p>“Say it,” Rio prompts, knowing she won’t even consider arguing right now.</p><p>“I deserve everything you have to give,” Agatha echoes without hesitation.</p><p>“You will not call yourself a bad submissive again.”</p><p>Agatha whimpers, and Rio knows it’s because she doesn’t want to promise that.</p><p>“Say it.”</p><p>Again, there’s no hesitation. “I will not call myself a bad submissive again.”</p><p>“There is a difference between being a bad submissive and having trauma responses to things, Agatha, and we will talk about that when you’re not in subspace. But right now, just know you are a good girl and you make me proud every day we’re together.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t fight it. “Yes, Rio.” Her voice comes out slower and Rio can see her sinking further down.</p><p>She leans forward and whispers into Agatha’s ear. “I’m so wet…”</p><p>Agatha makes a strangled sound and lurches forward, but Rio quickly releases her and backs up.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>A small whine and a shudder, but Agatha obeys.</p><p>“Sit.”</p><p>Agatha lowers herself to sit on her heels, her fingertips planted lightly on the floor on either side of her thighs. The metal through her nipples glints in the light from the ceiling fixture and Rio can see her stomach quivering. She’s fucking perfect.</p><p>A sudden urge overcomes her and she goes to pick up the leash from the couch, running her fingers over the chain and down to the looped leather handle. She tugs on Agatha’s hair to get her to lean her head back, and ducks to kiss her forehead before straightening again. “Stay.”</p><p>Agatha’s breathing is slow and steady.</p><p>“What is your safeword?”</p><p>It takes a moment, but Agatha slurs “witch killer”.</p><p>“What is your name?”</p><p>Dark eyes close and flutter open before she answers. “Agatha.”</p><p>“Good girl.” She steps back and whips the looped leather handle of the leash across Agatha’s quivering belly.</p><p>Agatha cries out but doesn’t move.</p><p>How can she possibly think she’s a bad submissive? She is magnificent.</p><p>“Beautiful,” Rio says and whips the leash over her flank.</p><p>Agatha cries out again, shivering, but stays in position.</p><p>Red welts are already formed on her smooth skin. Rio uses her backhand to whip the leash over the other flank, eyes glued to the spot as the next welt rises.</p><p>There’s no cry this time, just a whimper, and Agatha bites her lip.</p><p>“Shh, no no,” Rio croons, stepping forward to run her thumb over Agatha’s bottom lip. “Don’t bite yourself, baby. Do you need me to give you something to bite?”</p><p>Agatha struggles to respond. “Ho-w many more?”</p><p>“Two,” Rio says, stroking her cheek and running a fingertip around the shell of her ear.</p><p>“Th—then no, I can—I can take it,” Agatha shudders.</p><p>Rio’s stomach clenches hard. “Brave girl,” she praises, the fingertip behind Agatha’s ear making a slow trail down her jaw, then tapering off at her chin as Rio steps away again.</p><p>She snaps the leash handle against the side of Agatha’s left breast, the tip barely lashing her nipple.</p><p>The sound that leaves Agatha is a gorgeous melody of pain mixed with a feral growl, but she does. Not. Move.</p><p>And she doesn’t bite herself.</p><p>Rio’s chest swells with pride. “So good,” she praises. “One more, baby. Do you think you can take one more for me?” She already knows Agatha can.</p><p>“Y—” Agatha starts, then swallows thickly and finishes. “Yes, R-Rio.”</p><p>“Last one, honey,” she says, and mirrors the last stroke on the other side, the leather cutting a glaring welt on Agatha’s right breast, glancing the edge of her nipple.</p><p>Agatha yells, and it’s longer than the others, and she’s trembling all over, Rio can see it even from a foot away. She tosses the leash over to the couch and steps to Agatha, taking her face in both hands and tilting her head up slowly. Her head has been back for a few minutes and she doesn’t want to risk pulling any neck muscles. She’s careful as she pulls Agatha’s head forward to stretch her neck, and when she’s satisfied it’s safe, she wedges one arm under Agatha’s knees with some difficulty given the position Agatha’s sitting in, and lifts her up.</p><p>Agatha’s arms are already going around Rio’s neck before she’s all the way picked up, and Rio carries her to bed, laying her down and climbing in next to her, pulling a blanket over them both.</p><p>“Where are we, baby?” Rio asks, rubbing her hand up and down one of Agatha’s arms.</p><p>“D’no,” Agatha mumbles, rolling onto her side and burying herself in Rio in every way she can. Head tucked into Rio’s neck, arm draped across her, leg hooked around her waist, stomach to stomach, chest to chest.</p><p>Rio strokes her hair and lets her cling. She waits a few minutes and tries again. “Where are we, baby?”</p><p>All she gets is a vague noise and Agatha pressed harder into her.</p><p>“Okay. That’s okay.” She keeps stroking Agatha’s hair and starts humming softly to her.</p><p>It takes a few more minutes, and she can tell when Agatha’s awareness creeps back in by the change in body language. The rigidity fades to a comfortable, relaxed snuggle and Agatha murmurs against her neck. “In your bedroom.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, baby,” Rio croons, kissing the top of her head. “I’m going to take the collar off now. Can you be good and hold still?”</p><p>Agatha nods. “Yes, Rio.”</p><p>Rio reaches behind her neck and slowly pulls the strap out of the buckle, off of the prong, and through the buckle again to release it. She sets it with care on the nightstand behind her and turns back to Agatha, stroking soft fingertips over her throat where the collar had been. There are no marks or indentations, there’s no soreness to rub away, but she does it anyway, helping ease the loss of something so grounding for Agatha.</p><p>“Good girl,” she praises. “Still with me?”</p><p>“Yes, Rio,” Agatha says with a soft sigh. “That feels so nice. Thank you.”</p><p>“I know it might not be an easy transition,” Rio says, voice quiet.</p><p>Agatha draws her head back to look up at Rio. “I’m still yours, right? Even without the collar on?” she whispers.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio breathes. <em>God, yes</em>. “You’re mine no matter what, Agatha.” <em>I want you in every way</em>.</p><p>Agatha nods and tucks back in, pressing hard everywhere they’re touching. “Thank you.”</p><p>“For what?” Rio starts running her fingers through Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“For wanting me to be yours,” Agatha says.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio says, surprised the answer could be that simple. “But you don’t have to thank me for that. It’s not exactly a selfless sentiment. I get something out of it.”</p><p>“I get more,” Agatha says, and for a second Rio thinks she’s being argumentative, but there’s no laugh or snort, no smirk against the skin of her neck where Agatha’s mouth hovers, and she realizes it’s just a genuine expression of feelings. Agatha feels like she gets more out of this than Rio does. She’s not arguing, she’s communicating. And while Rio disagrees wholeheartedly with the idea that Agatha gets more out of the arrangement than she does, she’s not going to object to a feeling. She’s not going to say or do anything that would discourage Agatha from sharing her feelings again.</p><p>“Do you?” she asks almost absently, twirling a lock of Agatha’s hair around one finger. “What do you get out of it, baby?”</p><p>Now there’s a smirk against her skin. “Are you angling for compliments?” Agatha teases, but it’s light. Rio can tell she doesn’t mean it.</p><p>“No,” she says anyway, still twirling the same lock of hair. “I really want to know. If you don’t mind sharing.”</p><p>“I don’t mind,” Agatha says, the leg hooked over Rio’s waist tightening. “I get a gorgeous, confident, ethical dominant that treats me like a princess when I deserve it and corrects me when I make mistakes. She helps me learn about myself. She’s kind, and patient, more patient than anyone has a right to be with me. I never feel threatened, even when I’m being punished. The safety I feel with her is… nothing I’ve ever experienced or ever thought I would. I get adventure, mind-blowing sex, intelligent conversation, food, shelter, guidance, companionship, affection, respect, discipline, self-worth… The list is literally endless, Rio,” she concludes, her voice fluttering on the last two words. “What I get from this is endless.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes start burning halfway through and tears are spilling by the end. “Agatha,” she says, choked and emotional, and Agatha’s head snaps up in alarm.</p><p>“Don’t cry,” she says breathlessly, eyes wide, unwrapping her arm from around Rio to brush away her tears.</p><p>Rio kisses her, soft and sweet, tongue licking her bottom lip to gain entrance to her mouth, which Agatha grants the moment it’s requested, opening to whatever Rio wants.</p><p>Rio explores her and claims her, and when she pulls back several long moments later, she rests their foreheads together. “Are you ready to hear what I get out of this?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha whispers.</p><p>“Because…?” Rio prompts when no explanation is forthcoming.</p><p>“Because what if—I don’t—I’m not good at hearing about myself, I—I—” She stops talking and sighs. “You’re going to make me listen anyway, though, so I might as well agree.”</p><p>“That’s not a very good attitude,” Rio says, but it’s gentle, and she kisses the tip of Agatha’s nose. “But you’re right. I am going to make you listen. So are you ready?”</p><p>Agatha looks wholeheartedly distressed, but she nods.</p><p>“I get a sweet, mouthy, brilliant, beautiful, hot, fiery woman who submits to me and <em>only</em> to me, which makes my head spin to be honest. She challenges me in all the right ways, she listens so beautifully when she’s in subspace, and sometimes even when she’s not… and she allows me to punish her when she doesn’t listen or when I think she’s misbehaved. She gives me her trust, her power, her vulnerability. When we’re together I feel like I’m the only person she’s ever met because she gives me her undivided attention one hundred percent of the time. And when I cross a line, she doesn’t run away or make me feel like a bad dominant, she safewords, or takes me up the coast and talks to me. And she respects me when I safeword, even though I’m the one in charge, which is less common than you’d think. But she has never made me feel ashamed for needing to stop a scene or shift focus or take a break. She lets me take care of her in so many ways, and that makes me feel important and needed and valued. She has clear boundaries which makes it easier for me to make decisions.”</p><p>Rio might have wanted to say more but Agatha bursts into tears and clings so much tighter it actually hurts.</p><p>“Stop, I can’t,” she begs.</p><p>“Okay, shh,” Rio soothes, stroking her hair, breathing through the discomfort of being squished so hard. Because she doesn’t care if Agatha breaks her ribs, she’s not going to make her loosen her grip.</p><p>That’s dramatic. Her ribs aren’t going to break.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio continues to comfort her. “I’ve got you.”</p><p>Agatha just sobs.</p><p>“I know you’re not used to people having good things to say about you, baby, but that’s their failure to see what’s in front of them, not yours. You’re the best submissive I’ve ever had.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath catches for a second but she doesn’t stop crying, and Rio knows that even if it’s hard to hear, it’s good for her to hear it.</p><p>When the tears finally die down, Rio kisses her forehead. “Come on, let’s clean you up.”</p><p>Agatha lets Rio lead her into the bathroom and sit her on the closed toilet seat, and she stays still so Rio can wipe her face with a warm cloth.</p><p>When she’s done, Rio tosses the cloth into the laundry basket in the corner and turns back to Agatha, framing her face with both hands. “Now… would you like to know which type of manners you’re going to learn next? Because we can’t forget the whole reason we started this was to teach you some manners,” she says with a smirk.</p><p>Agatha bites her lip and squirms, looking mischievous and sheepish at the same time. “Please, enlighten me.”</p><p>Rio grips her face a little harder and puts them nose to nose. She breathes slowly, in and out, and waits until Agatha opens her mouth to speak before she says quickly, “Patience.”</p><p>Agatha groans. “I don’t need to learn patience.”</p><p>“Which one of us gets to decide what you need to learn?”</p><p>Agatha looks like she’s going to make a bad decision but ultimately gives in. “You,” she says softly.</p><p>“That’s right,” Rio says. “I decide. And I’ve decided to teach you patience.”</p><p>--</p><p>She decides to teach Agatha patience on Saturday night. She goes shopping ahead of time because she a) can’t find her good rope and b) doesn’t have any gags that Agatha couldn’t chew through.</p><p>She spends the evening preparing for the scene and changes into a green silk nightgown with lace panties a matching color. She opts to go barefoot but paints her toenails black. Her fingernails are already painted red for work, so it’s double the effort to remove the polish and paint them black as well, but she doesn’t want mismatched colors so it’s worth the time and energy.</p><p>She throws her hair up into a casual ponytail and climbs on a chair to screw a heavy duty eyelet hook into the wall high enough up for what she wants. Just before Agatha is scheduled to arrive, she applies some light makeup, and when the doorbell rings, she shakes herself out, takes a breath, and opens the door.</p><p>Her jaw drops because Agatha is wearing a fucking ball gown. Deep, rich purple, flowy and satiny… and sequined over the bodice.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks tint pink under the scrutiny. “I’m sorry,” she says in a rush. “I came straight from one of my mother’s stupid dinners. I thought—I thought wearing this would be better than making you wait.”</p><p>“It is!” Rio blurts out. “It’s flawless. You look breathtaking. Come inside.” She moves out of the way and Agatha steps through the door, shutting it behind her.</p><p>“It felt a little weird driving myself here for the first time,” Agatha says. And then she seems to get over herself and really look at Rio, because her eyes darken and sparkle. “I like the way you look,” she says, quiet but charged. “A lot. I like it a lot.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio says, feeling a little flushed at the compliment and the way Agatha’s eyes linger as they rake across her body. “Go have a seat on the sofa.”</p><p>Agatha steps closer and kisses Rio on the cheek, then heads off to the living room, leaving Rio standing there watching her go for a minute before kicking herself into gear.</p><p>She follows and sits next to Agatha, and Agatha draws one leg up onto the sofa so they can face each other.</p><p>“So,” Rio starts, stroking Agatha’s face with gentle fingertips. “Patience. You’re going to be doing a lot of waiting tonight. And you’re going to be a good girl about it.”</p><p>Agatha’s nostrils flare and she chases the touch when Rio withdraws. “Yes, Rio,” she says quickly, eyes fluttering.</p><p>“See that hook on the wall over there?”</p><p>Agatha’s fluttering eyes spring open and she turns her head. “I—yes…”</p><p>“And you see the rope on the coffee table?”</p><p>Agatha’s head turns toward that. “Yes, Rio.”</p><p>Rio can see her breathing getting faster. “What do you think I’m going to do with that rope and that hook, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha’s breaths are downright shaky after that question. “I think you’re going to string me up, Rio,” she whispers.</p><p>The way she words it does something extra to Rio’s insides and she shudders. “I am,” she confirms. “Do you have any objections to that?”</p><p>Agatha looks at her, pupils blown. “No, Rio.”</p><p>“Good girl. I’m going to tie your hands to that hook and you’re going to stand against the wall, and you’re going to be quiet and wait for my attention as long as I choose to make you wait.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands dig into the sofa cushion. “Yes, Rio.”</p><p>“Since this is a lesson, and not a skill you already have mastered, I am willing to provide extra assurances to keep your mouth from getting you into trouble. I would like you to wear a bit gag I bought for you. I know we haven’t discussed gags before, so if you aren’t comfortable, that is absolutely fine.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingernails pierce the fabric of the cushion beneath her.</p><p>“Honey you’re tearing up my sofa,” Rio says, gently placing her hands over Agatha’s and lifting them from her furniture. “Does the idea of wearing a gag make you nervous?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha says, and her voice is like sandpaper. “I’ll wear it.”</p><p>“Do you like the idea? Or—”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Copy that,” Rio says with a little smirk. So Agatha was tearing up the furniture because she was turned on, not because she was nervous. Good to know. “I got a bit gag because I have a feeling you could chew through anything nonmetal.”</p><p>Agatha’s face dusts pink, but Rio doesn’t think it’s embarrassment. “I would,” she agrees. “Metal was smart of you.”</p><p>“Thank you, baby. One more thing to negotiate before I put you on the wall. I’m going to put a vibrator inside you and run it on low. It won’t make you come but it’ll keep you stimulated while I’m busy doing other things.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw drops and Rio can see the shiver run up her spine. “Fuck,” she finally breathes.</p><p>“I’m keeping your dress on, but get rid of the panties. If you need to safeword, kick your shoes off. Otherwise you’re keeping those heels on.”</p><p>When Agatha makes no move to comply, Rio raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“I said get rid of the panties. What are you waiting for?”</p><p>Agatha leans closer and whispers in her ear. “I’m not wearing any.”</p><p>Rio grabs her by the hair. Doesn’t do anything, just grabs her, staring, processing the information. “Agatha,” she says, and she doesn’t know if it’s a warning or a prayer. “Okay, tell me how you’re going to safeword when you’re gagged.”</p><p>“By kicking off my shoes,” Agatha says.</p><p>“Good,” Rio says, nodding. “Yeah. Good.” She’s still distracted by Agatha having been to her mother’s dinner party without underwear. But that’s a topic for another time. “Stand up.”</p><p>She releases Agatha’s hair and stands, watching Agatha follow.</p><p>“Go to the wall and put your back against it.”</p><p>“Yes, Rio.” Agatha goes to the wall under the eyelet hook and stands with her back pressed to it.</p><p>Rio takes the rope from the coffee table and climbs up onto the chair she’d used to install the hook earlier. “Raise your arms.”</p><p>“Yes, Rio.” She lifts her arms above her head.</p><p>Rio uncoils the rope and wraps it around Agatha’s wrists one at a time, then both together, then loops the end around crossways to secure it. She takes the slack and feeds it through the eyelet hook on the wall, tying it carefully in a mooring hitch for easy release if Agatha safewords, but puts the tail out of reach so she can’t untie herself.</p><p>“Some people can stay like this for hours, some people for five minutes. If your arms go numb, you safeword, understand?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha nods. “If my arms go numb I will kick my shoes off.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio says and kisses her. Quick and hard. Then she gets down off the chair and moves it aside, out of the way but still easily accessible if she needs it.</p><p>She goes to the coffee table for the vibrator next and returns to Agatha, showing her the tiny object.</p><p>“This is going inside you,” she says, and turns it on the lowest setting, jumping a little as it hums to life between her thumb and fingers. She bends over to reach the bottom of Agatha’s dress and puts her hand under it, standing back up, and when she probes to see if Agatha’s wet enough she gasps. “Jesus Christ,” she mutters, because Agatha is <em>soaked</em>.</p><p>Rio might have to put panties on her to keep the vibrator in, she’s so slick. One way to find out.</p><p>She positions the tip of the vibe at Agatha’s opening and smoothly pushes it inside until her pussy swallows it, then withdraws her fingers.</p><p>Agatha tilts her head back into the wall and lets out a quiet groan. “Turn it up, please,” she says instantly.</p><p>“No,” Rio says. “I told you I was putting it on low.” She has a feeling she’s going to need that gag sooner rather than later and goes quickly to grab it from the coffee table.</p><p>“But it’s not enough,” Agatha says, eyes pleading as Rio walks back over with the shiny metal bit.</p><p>“You are learning patience,” Rio reminds her. “Open.”</p><p>Agatha clenches her jaw.</p><p>Rio’s not putting up with it. She slaps her face, hard, and Agatha relents with a whimper, opening her mouth.</p><p>She shoves the bit between Agatha’s teeth and makes sure the cheek guards are in the right place, then buckles the straps to secure the whole thing.</p><p>“So pretty and <em>quiet</em>,” she says pointedly, patting the red mark on Agatha’s face.</p><p>And then she walks over to the sofa, flops down, and turns on the tv.</p><p>Agatha makes an outraged sound, and Rio knows this is the moment she’s truly realizing what she’s in for.</p><p>Rio ignores it and finds something to watch.</p><p>Agatha escalates. She’s shouting muffled insults and stamping her foot so hard Rio’s afraid she’ll get shin splints or possibly crack the subfloor under the carpet.</p><p>Rio comes to the conclusion that she’s going to need to go over there and set better boundaries. So she rises from the sofa, walks over to Agatha, and takes her by the chin. “This is not patient,” she says. “You’re shouting and stomping, you’re not waiting quietly like I’ve asked you to do. This is the only time I am going to come over here to correct you. For the rest of the night, if you want any scraps of my attention, you will stand here in silence and wait. The more patient you are, the more attention you will get. Is that clear?”</p><p>She releases Agatha’s chin, waiting for a nod. She can hear the vibrator humming between Agatha’s thighs; see her squirming against the wall, and she knows it must be torturous. But if Agatha wants it to ever end, she needs to behave. To learn patience.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t nod. She narrows her eyes and tries to pull her hands free, so Rio walks away.</p><p>She ignores the despairing sound from behind her. Then she ignores the scream of anger. And as she slides back onto the sofa, she turns her head away from Agatha to hide her expression, because one of those pointy heels busts a hole in her wall.</p><p>That one is <em>so</em> hard to ignore. It takes a monumental effort. Because what she wants to do is storm back over and punish Agatha. But the worst punishment of all is exactly what she’s already doing. So she ignores it.</p><p>Agatha punches another hole with her shoe, and another, and another, and another. She had better hope to God that her salary is enough to cover drywall, because if she can’t pay for that with money she’s going to pay for it with pain.</p><p>Rio doesn’t even glance over. Not once. And it’s so hard. But she stares at the television, not hearing a word of what they’re saying, her brain running on adrenaline-fueled fractals. Thinking about everything except what she’s pretending to focus on.</p><p>Property damage? Really? It’s one of the most disrespectful things Rio can think of. Because this is her <em>home</em>, and that is a structure that holds it up. The only reason she doesn’t leave the room entirely is because she needs to know if Agatha safewords. Although she’s half tempted to untie her and send her on her way, honestly.</p><p>She’s still considering it when the commotion stops and she hears Agatha whining and crying instead.</p><p>She doesn’t look over. Agatha has most definitely not earned her attention. She’s not going to go running as soon as the destruction ends. Agatha has to work for it after that fucking ridiculous display.</p><p>Agatha continues to whine and cry for what feels like forever, and Rio just stares blankly at the television, waiting and listening. Not until it has been silent for an entire episode of The Twilight Zone – because she finally realized what she’s watching – does she stand up from the sofa and stretch her muscles.</p><p>When she looks over at Agatha, her breath catches. Agatha’s head is slightly bowed, the bodice of her dress stained with drool, and she looks so vulnerable it makes Rio choke a little. She’s been good for an hour, not made a sound, so Rio walks slowly over and scratches underneath her chin. “Thank you for quieting.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are still shining and she nods at Rio’s words. A few tears spill over and Rio brushes them away with her thumbs. The hum of the vibrator reaches her ears and she puts a hand under Agatha’s dress, skating it up her calf, the inside of her knee, and when she goes a little higher, her fingers get wet and sticky.</p><p>Agatha’s <em>dripping</em> down her thighs. Jesus Christ.</p><p>And her legs started shaking when Rio touched her. She knows Agatha needs her.</p><p>She plays in the slickness, rubbing her whole hand across Agatha’s thigh and smearing it down her leg, getting her wet all the way to her knee, and then pulls her arm out from under the dress and straightens up.</p><p>Agatha whimpers, hips bucking toward Rio’s hand, but Rio looks her in the eye and gives a firm shake of her head. She tells Agatha without words that she’s not getting what she wants.</p><p>Agatha makes the most broken sound Rio has ever heard, and if she couldn’t see the stiletto-sized holes in the wall in her peripheral vision, she might have given in.</p><p>She licks sweat and tears from Agatha’s cheek instead and whispers. “You look so pretty when you cry.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes slam shut.</p><p>Rio squeezes her waist and wanders back to the sofa, settling down for round two.</p><p>There’s no more screaming. There’s no more property destruction. There’s just pathetic, broken whimpers, squirming, and tears.</p><p>Rio goes to her next after a half hour of silence. They’re making progress. “You’ve been very patient,” she says, and Agatha nods eagerly. “Are you still so wet, baby?”</p><p>Agatha’s nostrils flare and she nods again.</p><p>Rio sucks the slight bit of drool from where it’s pooled at the corner of her mouth, and the tang of metal mixes with the flavor of Agatha’s saliva. It’s not entirely unpleasant and she licks her way across the bit wedged between Agatha’s teeth.</p><p>Agatha makes an unhinged, needy sound, but she doesn’t do anything to try to force Rio’s hand.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio purrs, putting her mouth on Agatha’s neck, biting a bruise over the front of her throat. She kisses her way back up to Agatha’s ear and whispers into it. “Keep being patient.”</p><p>This time she doesn’t go to the sofa. She takes the chair that’s a few feet away and sets it just out of reach if Agatha were to try, and she sits down, legs spread, elbows on her thighs, head in her hands, and just looks. Lets her eyes rake up and down, cataloguing every aspect of the woman tied up in her living room.</p><p>Bound hands above her head, flexing and curling every few seconds. Messy, sweaty hair plastered to her face and falling in wild waves over her shoulders and toward her waist. Heaving chest, hard nipples, hips made for holding while you ride. Shaking legs, dark purple satin high-heeled pumps. She’s a fucking work of <em>art</em>.</p><p>And now for something new. Something she doesn’t know if Agatha will tolerate. Doesn’t know if she’s about to get a shoe flying straight at her face as a ‘fuck you’ as well as a safeword.</p><p>She leans back in the chair, looks Agatha in the eye, and lets a tiny smirk quirk up one corner of her mouth. “By the way… I have a friend coming by in about ten minutes to appraise my <em>merchandise</em>.”</p><p>Agatha shudders and her knees buckle and she’s held up by the ropes around her wrists for a second until Rio is right there, arms around her waist, holding her up until she gets her feet back under her.</p><p>The only sound she makes is a long, drawn-out moan.</p><p>When she’s standing steady on her own, Rio slowly backs off, staying close in case she drops again, but not touching her. “Are you going to behave?”</p><p>Agatha nods eagerly. And then a cloud falls over her features and Rio rushes to assure her.</p><p>“It’s no one local.”</p><p>Agatha visibly relaxes and nods again.</p><p>“Are you going to make me proud to show off my property?”</p><p>Agatha whines and nods <em>again</em>.</p><p>“Are you going to be calm and patient, and let her look you over properly?”</p><p>Agatha sucks in a sharp breath through her nose, eyelids fluttering, and nods yet again.</p><p>If she’s not careful she’s going to make Agatha come just with her questions. And she doesn’t want that happening at all tonight. But there’s one more question she has to ask.</p><p>“If she wants to test the merchandise, are you going to give me trouble?”</p><p>Agatha drops again and Rio darts forward, holding her up until she’s steady. When she’s standing on her own, she shakes her head, and her eyes are swirling seas of pitch black surrounded by tiny threads of dark blue.</p><p>“I’m going to send her a message. Do you need a break from the ropes before she gets here?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head again.</p><p>“Show me you can still move your fingers.”</p><p>Agatha flexes both hands, turns her wrists in circles to stretch them, and then makes fists before relaxing.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio praises, kissing her shoulder and retreating to the coffee table for her phone. She walks back over and sits on the chair before she sends Yelena a message.</p><p><em>ten minutes</em></p><p><em>Aye Aye Captain</em></p><p>She puts her phone on the floor and looks at Agatha. “She’s on her way. Do you need some water, baby?”</p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p>“Be right back.” Rio pops into the kitchen, grabs a bottle of water, and returns a second later. “I’m taking the gag out so you can drink, but no talking, do you understand? Not a word. Just drinking.”</p><p>Agatha nods, and Rio unbuckles the gag, carefully drawing it away, and Agatha works her jaw and swallows whatever spit had been gathering in her mouth. She stares into Rio’s eyes, and Rio knows she wants to talk, but she doesn’t. She opens for the water, swallows it, declines more with a shake of her head, and opens for Rio to put the bit back in.</p><p>Rio discards the water bottle and puts the bit between Agatha’s teeth. “I’m so proud of you,” she says softly as she buckles the straps to keep the gag in place.</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes, and Rio can see that she’s soaking up the praise. She breathes slowly, and when she opens her eyes, she angles her head toward Rio, asking for touch.</p><p>Rio strokes her face with both hands and kisses her forehead several times in a row. “Such a good girl,” she says. “Will you still be comfortable safewording in front of my friend?”</p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p>“And you understand I would not be the least bit disappointed?”</p><p>She’s made this clear before but wants to reiterate given the situation she’s about to put Agatha in.</p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p>“And I would be very disappointed if you didn’t safeword when you needed to?”</p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio says, and she nods too. “She’ll be here any minute. Stand up straight, baby. Show yourself off for me.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a little moan and straightens up, flexing her fingers and pushing her shoulders back.</p><p>“That’s my girl,” Rio says with a grin, and sits back down in her chair.</p><p>Not two minutes later there’s a sharp knock at the door, and Rio gets up to answer it.</p><p>Yelena is on the doorstep dressed in all black – utility pants, a ribbed woolen sweater, and combat boots. Her hair is pulled up in a tight bun at the back of her head and she steps forward to kiss both of Rio’s cheeks in greeting.</p><p>The first words out of her mouth when she sees Agatha are “Jesus fucking Christ, Vidal,” in her thick Russian accent. “You did not tell me she was a thoroughbred.”</p><p>Rio presses her lips tightly together and enjoys the blush that darkens Agatha’s cheeks. “Yelena,” she says, and she can’t help the chuckle that comes out. She snorts and shakes her head to clear it. “This is my submissive, Agatha. Isn’t she pretty?”</p><p>“Oh, she is pretty,” Yelena agrees, putting her palms together and tapping her fingertips against each other. “She is <em>very</em> pretty.”</p><p>Rio watches Yelena stalk closer to Agatha, stopping a few inches away, and she can see Agatha’s chest rising and falling, shallow and rapid. Not panicked – excited. The flutter of her eyes and flare of her nostrils give it away. And how she angles toward the attention instead of away from it. How her eyes cut to Rio as if to say ‘see how well I’m behaving?’</p><p>Rio joins Yelena beside Agatha and runs a finger down the bodice of her dress.</p><p>“Hm,” Yelena says, attention drawn to the wet fabric. “Does she typically drool this much?”</p><p>“No,” Rio says casually, using her thumb to wipe at some of the more recent saliva, which of course does nothing but rub it into the fabric. “She’s had that gag in going on two hours.”</p><p>“Not bad,” Yelena says, pushing her lower lip out in consideration, and gently flicks one of the wet spots. “Not bad. How are her teeth?”</p><p>“Sharp.”</p><p>“Eyes?”</p><p>“Reading glasses.”</p><p>“Hm.” Yelena tilts her head, considering.</p><p>And Rio clocks the moment she notices the holes in the wall, those bright eyes moving between the holes and Agatha’s shoes. She lifts her eyebrows in question.</p><p>“Her attitude?”</p><p>Agatha whimpers.</p><p>“Hush, pet,” Yelena scolds her. “The grownups are talking.”</p><p>Rio wonders if the whimper was a protest – if Agatha thinks Rio is about to detail all of her misbehavior in answer to Yelena’s question about her attitude.</p><p>Rio’s not going to do that.</p><p>“I enjoy her attitude very much,” Rio finally answers. “She goes down into subspace so beautifully for me, and she’s a quick learner. When she makes mistakes, she accepts punishment, most of the time graciously.”</p><p>Yelena nods toward the holes in the wall. “And this?”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders drop, and Rio strokes her belly. “That was a mistake she will answer for later.”</p><p>“Bosses will not like this,” Yelena says, nodding toward the holes again. “Might not want to buy your merchandise.”</p><p>Rio grins and kisses Agatha’s cheek before turning back to her friend. “That would be their loss and my gain.”</p><p>“I might want to buy. For myself,” Yelena says then. “She wears a bit gag well, no?”</p><p>“She wears it very well,” Rio purrs. Agatha finally starts to relax under the hand still stroking her belly.</p><p>“Looks good in a dress,” Yelena continues. “Sexy.”</p><p>“The sexiest girl in any room,” Rio agrees.</p><p>“Let me see her pussy.”</p><p>Rio waits a beat to see if Agatha’s going to safeword, but when all she gets is a tiny groan, she leans down to grab the hem of Agatha’s ball gown and lifts it up around her hips.</p><p>Yelena’s eyes light up and she grins, showing her teeth. “Ohhh, the vibrator I told you about,” she says, delighted. “Amazing, no? The way you control with your phone? What setting you have it on?”</p><p>Agatha’s face is redder than Rio has ever seen it, and she’s breathing hot and heavy.</p><p>“Low. I wanted light stimulation without too much distraction.”</p><p>“The sadist in you make me proud,” Yelena says, chest puffing up. And then her eyebrows raise, gaze between Agatha’s legs again. “How wet <em>is</em> she?”</p><p>Agatha’s trembling all over, Rio can feel it in the air between them. “She’s soaked. Aren’t you baby? Dripped all the way down her thighs earlier from being strung up and gagged and teased.”</p><p>Agatha whines quietly but doesn’t offer any other protest.</p><p>“How she taste?” Yelena asks, eyes twinkling with her personal brand of mischief.</p><p>Rio laughs and swipes a finger between Agatha’s legs, then holds it up so Yelena can flick her tongue out for a taste.</p><p>Agatha moans and jerks on the ropes, arching her back, and Rio thinks it’s instinctual rather than deliberate. “Settle down,” she says gently, returning her hand to stroke Agatha’s belly.</p><p>Agatha breathes harshly through her nose but her body settles into Rio’s touch.</p><p>“Rio’s girl,” Yelena says, directing her words to Agatha. “You taste very good.”</p><p>Agatha whines and shifts her weight with a nod Rio takes to mean ‘thank you’.</p><p>Apparently so does Yelena. “You are most welcome. And now I am afraid it is time for me to take my leave. I will be in touch regarding negotiations.”</p><p>Rio shakes her hand with a nod. “Thank you for coming. It’s so good to get an expert’s appraisal of my property.”</p><p>Agatha’s going to lose her mind in a minute, Rio can tell, because she can’t stop squirming and making desperate little noises.</p><p>Yelena kisses Rio’s cheeks and heads for the door. “I’ll see myself out.”</p><p>The instant the door closes Agatha sags in her bonds and Rio has to hold her up again. “I’ve got you, baby. You did so well. <em>So</em> well. Let’s get you sorted out now.” She reaches up with one hand to release the hitch knot and Agatha’s arms fall forward over her head, still bound together but off the wall.</p><p>She slides an arm quickly under Agatha’s ass and lifts her, carrying her to the bedroom and carefully laying her on the bed, ducking out from under her bound arms. She unravels the rope until Agatha’s hands are free, then releases the buckle on the gag and eases it out from between clenched teeth.</p><p>She sits on the bed beside Agatha and takes her wrists, starting to rub out the soreness she must be feeling. There’s a little bit of chafing, but it’s not extreme, and once Agatha is feeling safe and secure, Rio will get some cream to put on the marks.</p><p>She climbs fully onto the bed a few minutes later and lets Agatha fold into her, limbs tangled together, Agatha’s face pressed into her neck.</p><p>“Was I good?” Agatha asks, her voice muffled by Rio’s skin and hoarse from wearing a gag for two hours.</p><p>“So good,” Rio says, holding her close. “I’m so proud of you, baby. You were so patient… you used such good manners and treated my friend with so much respect. She was impressed, too. I could tell.”</p><p>“Rio, I—” Agatha brings her hands up to curl in the top of Rio’s nightgown. “The wall, I—”</p><p>“Shh,” Rio says, shaking her head. “We are not talking about that right now. Right now you are safe and cared for and getting praised for how well you behaved in front of my friend. Okay?”</p><p>It takes Agatha a minute to accept it, but she finally nods. “Thank you,” she whispers.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio hums. “Is there anything you need right now?”</p><p>“Can you—am I allowed to take out the vibrator yet?”</p><p>“Oh, shit,” Rio says, reaching a hand down under Agatha’s dress and up between her legs to gingerly remove the vibrator. “I’m sorry, baby. I forgot about it, I was so focused on everything else.”</p><p>Agatha shudders as it slips free and clings a little tighter. “It’s okay,” she says, pressing her hips into Rio’s. “I can still feel it buzzing, it was in there so long…”</p><p>Rio shuts it off and puts it behind her on the nightstand, then wraps Agatha in her arms again. “I can’t wait to hear what you were thinking through all of that. Debrief tomorrow when we wake up? Or would you like to talk now?”</p><p>“Tomorrow,” Agatha says. “I’m so tired now…”</p><p>“Do you need anything else?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head against Rio’s neck. “Just you, and sleep.”</p><p>Rio grins stupidly and kisses the top of her head. “Well you’ve got me, and sleep is coming fast I’m sure. Good night, baby.”</p><p>“Good night, Rio.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio wakes first, and just spends a long time breathing in the comforting scent of Agatha’s hair. Every inhale sends a wave of calm through her. Somehow they managed to stay tangled together all night long, which is a first for Rio. She’s never woken up still holding someone. Maybe she never fell asleep holding someone before? She’s not sure about that one.</p><p>Agatha stirs a little while later with a whine and a stretch, her eyes fluttering open, and she snuggles her face against Rio’s neck. “Good morning,” she whispers.</p><p>“Good morning,” Rio whispers back. “How’d you sleep?”</p><p>“Like the dead.”</p><p>Rio grins and squeezes her. “How do you feel?”</p><p>Agatha sighs. “Happy.”</p><p>A little bolt of energy zaps Rio in the chest. “You’re happy?” she says, bringing a hand up to comb through Agatha’s hair. “That makes me happy.”</p><p>Agatha nods and pushes her head into Rio’s hand in encouragement.</p><p>Rio laughs and keeps drawing her fingers through. “Are you hungry?”</p><p>“I am,” Agatha admits. “And I have to pee. Really bad.”</p><p>“We probably shouldn’t have gone straight to bed after I untied you. I have to pee really bad too. You go first, baby.”</p><p>Agatha grudgingly slides out of bed and disappears toward the bathroom. When she comes back, Rio rushes to empty her bladder and then heads to the kitchen to make breakfast.</p><p>“What do you want to eat?” she calls toward the bedroom.</p><p>“You don’t have to yell,” Agatha says from right behind her and she shrieks, jumping five million feet into the air.</p><p>“Jesus fuck, you scared the shit out of me!” She turns and pulls Agatha into a hug. “How were you so quiet?”</p><p>Agatha whispers in her ear. “I finally took my shoes off.”</p><p>Rio grins with a little noise of approval. “Are you ready to talk?”</p><p>Agatha pulls back and pouts. “I’m ready to eat.”</p><p>“I don’t feel like cooking. Do you want to go out?”</p><p>“In a rumpled evening gown with dried saliva stains on it?” Agatha’s eyes widen. “For breakfast?”</p><p>Rio shrugs.</p><p>Agatha blinks and shakes her head like a cat trying to get water off its ear. “Um… well, okay. Are you going in what you’re wearing?”</p><p>“The diner on the corner doesn’t care, believe me. We’re more public ready than most of its patrons.”</p><p>Agatha looks dumbfounded but nods. “Okay, I’ll get my shoes.”</p><p>“Nah,” Rio waves her off. “Leave them. It’s just down the block.”</p><p>“Rio,” she whines.</p><p>“Are you safewording?” Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha’s face screws up. “No.”</p><p>“Then get your butt out the door.” She reaches over and smacks it.</p><p>Agatha obeys but grumbles the entire way.</p><p>Rio watches her reaction as they enter the diner. There’s a young couple having sex in a corner booth, an older man with no shirt and dirt smeared across his torso, a family with kids literally running in circles around their table, a woman in lingerie talking to a cop, and a few scattered “normal” people.</p><p>“Oh my God,” Agatha says under her breath.</p><p>“I told you,” Rio says. “Darlene!” she greets one of the women behind the counter. “Table for two.”</p><p>“Rio,” the woman says with a bright smile. “Nice catch.” She gives Agatha a wink and takes two menus from under the cash register. “Follow me, ladies.”</p><p>Darlene doesn’t even look twice at Agatha’s outfit or the fact that they’re both barefoot. She shows them to the booth next to the young couple having sex and sets down their menus.</p><p>Agatha slides in, incredulous, and sits like she’s afraid of catching something. Rio sits much less carefully and grabs up her menu. “Thanks, D. Can we get two ice waters to start?”</p><p>“Coming right up,” Darlene says pleasantly and whisks herself away.</p><p>“Is the food sanitary?” Agatha whispers.</p><p>“Is it anywhere?” Rio replies.</p><p>“Yes, it is, most places,” Agatha retorts, and Rio realizes too late that they’re not in her car or her house. Agatha can say and do whatever she wants.</p><p>A particularly egregious moan filters over from the next booth and Rio cringes as Agatha turns around.</p><p>“If I hear one more inappropriate sound before I’ve ordered my food, it has arrived, and I’ve finished eating it, even the police officer across the room won’t be able to stop me from squeezing the breath out of both of you!” she snaps. “And the same goes for shaking my seat!”</p><p>Rio covers her mouth with her hand and coughs lightly.</p><p>“Fuck off, dyke,” the guy snarls, and before Agatha has a chance to do anything, Rio’s out of her seat grabbing him by the back of his collar and dragging him out of the booth.</p><p>“Hey!” she calls across to the cop. “Indecent exposure! There’s kids here!” And she shoves him toward the officer.</p><p>“Bitch!” the girl shouts, scrambling out of the booth and running after her man, trying to get him out of the diner before the cop decides to arrest him.</p><p>The guy is frantically trying to put his dick away, and he manages it before the cop reaches them, but the cop tells him they’ll talk outside, and Rio is satisfied.</p><p>When she sits back down with a huff, she can’t even focus on the menu, and finally realizes it’s because she can feel Agatha staring at her. She lifts her eyes to look over the menu and Agatha’s gaze is so intense she drops the laminated paper entirely, her mouth falling open just a little.</p><p>Agatha leans over the table and kisses her. Hard.</p><p>Rio lets her. And kisses back.</p><p>When they pull apart, Agatha’s gaze is still laser focused and hot.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio asks when it doesn’t seem like it’s going to change.</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha blurts in a rush, the words spilling out like they’ve been waiting for years.</p><p>Rio’s heart slams against her chest, the beat of it pounding in her ears.</p><p>“Don’t say anything,” Agatha says quickly, putting a finger over Rio’s lips.</p><p>“What?” Rio says, reeling.</p><p>“I don’t want to know if you don’t feel it back, I just—I need you to know.”</p><p>Rio bites her finger and grins. “Don’t be stupid. I love you too.” Like it’s the easiest thing in the world to say. Maybe it is.</p><p>Agatha hisses at the bite and pulls her hand back, rubbing her finger gingerly, but her smile is radiant and Rio can’t think of anything more beautiful.</p><p>--</p><p>When their food arrives, thankfully with no further incident, Rio starts eating and asks about the previous night. “So… what was going through your head last night?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flush. “You mean the wall?”</p><p>“All of it, not just the negative part,” Rio says, shaking her head. “I want to know what you were thinking. About everything.”</p><p>“When you sat down to watch television I felt—I don’t want to tell you,” Agatha says, staring at her plate, pushing eggs around with her fork.</p><p>“Do you think it’ll make me mad?”</p><p>“No. I think it’ll make you feel bad.”</p><p>Rio sits up straighter. “Please tell me. Don’t worry about my feelings. Please?”</p><p>Agatha’s slouching and Rio wants to take away the reticence to share and the responsibility Agatha obviously feels not to hurt her.</p><p>“It’s okay, baby, whatever it is,” she says softly. “I promise.”</p><p>“I felt abandoned,” Agatha mumbles.</p><p>Rio can’t help the gasp that escapes, but she rushes to assure Agatha and reaches across the table to hold her hand. “I’m so sorry, Agatha… I wanted you to be patient, not feel like I was abandoning you. Why didn’t you—”</p><p>“It wasn’t bad enough to need to safeword, I mean I could still see you and I know you were paying attention to me even if you weren’t looking at me, I just… I was angry and felt helpless, and I wanted your eyes on me so I did whatever I could. And I thought… if the television was more important than me, maybe if I destroyed something else important, you’d come back.”</p><p>“Nothing was more important than you,” Rio says, quiet. “I was watching television because I was teaching you something, not because it was more important than you. I wasn’t even watching it, I mean… I didn’t figure out what show it was until you quieted down and it was the only thing I could hear. I’m so sorry you felt that way though, baby. I’ll try to explain better the next time I’m teaching you a lesson.”</p><p>“It wasn’t your fault,” Agatha says, squeezing Rio’s hand. “It wouldn’t have mattered what you said. I needed to feel that way, and get through it. You got me through it. Even though I guess that tantrum was trauma based, you didn’t respond and I had to learn another way to process the feeling. It ended up being good for me, I just… felt abandoned at first and that’s why I destroyed the wall. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio squeezes her hand back. “Thank you for sharing that with me. Even if something might make me feel bad, I still want to know. Everything you think and feel is important to me, okay?”</p><p>Agatha nods, and then she continues. “Even when I felt that way, I was still so turned on being tied up and gagged, and I mean… who isn’t turned on with something vibrating up their cunt,” she says with a little snort. “Then you came over and touched me, and I understood. You really, truly weren’t going to give me any attention if I wasn’t completely silent. And that just made me wetter.”</p><p>“And that’s why you didn’t fight the rest of the night.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says. “Because it sunk in. If I wanted you, I had to behave. And I know you said it and you always follow through, but I guess there’s just some lessons that have to hit harder.”</p><p>“I understand that,” Rio says, bringing Agatha’s hand to her lips and kissing her knuckles.</p><p>“I thought I was going to come when you told me I look pretty when I cry,” Agatha confesses after a few comfortable moments of silence. “Jesus Christ, I mean… Jesus Christ.”</p><p>Rio can’t help smirking. “Well you do,” she says, chewing the inside of her cheek.</p><p>“When you said I was being patient, oh God, Rio, I wanted you to know how hard it was and how patient I was being, but all I could do was nod.”</p><p>“I knew,” Rio whispers, and Agatha’s eyes water.</p><p>“I can’t believe you licked the bit, by the way. That made me lose my fucking mind.”</p><p>Rio shivers remembering the taste of the metal.</p><p>“And when you said to keep being patient, I knew you were going to walk away again and I fought myself so hard not to lash out, but you made it easier because you didn’t go far and you kept looking at me. I felt… objectified, which I’m sure was your intention. Not as objectified as when you brought your friend over, but having you sit and stare at me made me feel naked even though I was fully dressed. And that damn vibrator wouldn’t stop. Ugh. You <em>tortured</em> me, Rio. And fuck, I loved every minute of it.”</p><p>Rio’s smirk returns, and she goes back to eating, figuring that’s the end of it.</p><p>“When Yelena made that comment about buying me for herself I had this flash of you both holding me down and fucking me by force.”</p><p>Rio chokes on her orange juice and it shoots up the back of her throat and sprays out her nose. “Fuck! Ow!” Her sinuses are burning and she’s still spluttering and choking down what’s left in her mouth. “Oh my <em>God</em>.”</p><p>Agatha looks amused and concerned at the same time. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio says, pounding her chest and clearing her throat. “Is that like—is that something you <em>want</em>?”</p><p>Agatha starts shoveling in eggs and says something Rio can’t understand with a shrug of one shoulder.</p><p>Rio stares. “Agatha. That’s not an answer. You can tell me if it’s something you want. Or something you don’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s bright red, but she swallows the eggs and puts down her fork. “We said we aren’t seeing other people, though.”</p><p>“So it is something you want? Yelena and I to force you?”</p><p>“If I wasn’t worried about contracting MRSA I would be under the table right now,” Agatha says in a low voice.</p><p>“I’m not gonna be upset,” Rio swears. “Playing out a fantasy isn’t the same as seeing other people.”</p><p>“It’s not?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice sounds small and Rio wants to squish her. “No, not at all.”</p><p>“You won’t think you aren’t enough for me?”</p><p>Rio can barely hear her now. “Baby, no. I’m not insecure like that. If you want tag teamed, I’m sure Yelena will be up for the challenge.”</p><p>“Oh God, don’t say it like that,” Agatha groans, her voice at a normal volume again.</p><p>“I need to hear a yes or no, Agatha,” Rio finally says.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha seethes. “But only if I’m allowed to fight back.”</p><p>Rio nods. “That goes without saying. You can fight however you want. But I’m stronger than you… and Yelena is stronger than me. Keep that in mind.”</p><p>Rio can see the shudder that tears through Agatha, and her hands are flat on the table. “<em>Rio</em>.”</p><p>“What?” Rio asks, taking a bite of toast. She doesn’t think she said anything particularly offensive or incendiary.</p><p>“Nothing, just… that’s… <em>so hot</em>,” Agatha says, lowering her voice on the last two words.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio says, and now she’s delighted. “So, what’s off limits?”</p><p>“Nothing that I can think of. What about for you?”</p><p>“There’s got to be something…”</p><p>“Okay, I guess try not to break any bones,” Agatha says with a shrug.</p><p>“That’s <em>it</em>? Try not to break any bones? Not just <em>don’t</em> break any bones?”</p><p>“It’s going to be rough. I’m going to fight hard. I expect casualties.”</p><p>Rio puffs out her cheeks and exhales slowly. “Okay. Okay. You’ll have your safeword if you need it.”</p><p>Agatha nods. “What’s off limits for you?”</p><p>Rio thinks about it, and finally shakes her head. “I guess the same. If I’m forcing you to do something, it’s only fair you can fight back any way you can. I have my safeword. Have you done this before?”</p><p>Agatha smirks. “Yeah. She was really bad at it. Did not succeed. Never texted me again.”</p><p>Rio groans and scrubs her hands over her face. “Agatha.”</p><p>“What can I say? She didn’t have the balls to follow through the one time she did manage to pin me. Have <em>you</em> done it before?”</p><p>“I have. But never two on one.”</p><p>“Has Yelena, do you know?”</p><p>“Yelena has done everything. She’s probably done things neither of us have ever heard of.”</p><p>Agatha laughs, and God, Rio loves that sound. “Are you sure she’ll want to?” she asks after she stops laughing, and she finds something interesting on her plate to stare at.</p><p>“I’ll message her, but baby, yeah. I’m sure.”</p><p>Agatha pulls her knees up to her chest and rests her chin on them.</p><p>Rio picks up her phone off the table and shoots a text to Yelena.</p><p><em>hey general got a question for you</em></p><p>Yelena never takes long to answer. She’s addicted to her phone.</p><p><em>10-4.</em></p><p>Rio rolls her eyes at the response.</p><p><em>your comment about buying my merchandise sparked some interest in a CNC scene with both of us</em></p><p><em>Cy</em><em>кa, do you even have to ask? How long have we known each other? When can I come over?</em></p><p>Rio snorts out a laugh. “She wants to know when she can come over.”</p><p>Agatha’s face registers surprise, then acceptance, then sheepish anticipation. “Any time you want.”</p><p>Rio pokes her tongue against her cheek as she decides.</p><p><em>tomorrow afternoon. come packing</em></p><p><em>You don’t have enough toys for everyone? Tsk tsk, Vidal.</em></p><p>Another text comes through right after.</p><p><em>Of course I come packing. See you at noon.</em></p><p>Rio puts the phone down and looks at Agatha. “Tomorrow afternoon.”</p><p>Agatha looks like she’s about to pass out at the table.</p><p>“Are you done eating? Let’s go.” She takes a twenty out of her phone case to leave for the bill and takes Agatha home.</p><p>--</p><p>Twelve o’clock sharp there’s a knock at the door, and Rio answers to an example of military precision. Yelena is wearing her dress uniform, complete with button-down coat and gold piping. Her trousers are starched and she’s even wearing her service cap. Rio can see a white shirt and black tie under the jacket, and of course she’s got the oxford shoes.</p><p>“Damn,” she says, probably staring like a schoolgirl. She’s only seen Yelena in full dress a few times before.</p><p>“Do not be rude,” Yelena says with a smirk. “Invite me in.”</p><p>Rio makes a sound like a crashing car and steps out of the way. “Come in.”</p><p>When Agatha sees Yelena, she groans. “Oh my God.”</p><p>“Lovely to see you too, buttercup,” Yelena says, removing her cap and setting it on the entryway table.</p><p>Her hair is pulled at the base of her neck in a perfect bun, and Rio imagines what it’s going to look like when this is done.</p><p>“So. I do not like to waste time. What are your rules?” She looks at Agatha.</p><p>“Try not to break bones,” Agatha offers.</p><p>Yelena stares blankly, which Rio interprets as processing time.</p><p>Finally, she speaks. “What?”</p><p>“Try not to—”</p><p>“I heard you,” Yelena interrupts. “Why is this the only rule?”</p><p>“Because if I’m fighting you, it wouldn’t be fair to put restrictions on what you can do, would it? I want you to earn it. If you can get me down and take me, do it. I’m not squeamish.”</p><p>“If?” Yelena asks, head tilted.</p><p>“She will bite you,” Rio warns.</p><p>“She will try,” Yelena says. “And if she succeeds, then I deserved to be bitten.”</p><p>Something about that answer makes Rio insane.</p><p>“I know your safeword,” Yelena continues, tapping a finger against Rio’s chest. “What is yours?” She looks at Agatha.</p><p>“Witch killer,” Agatha says, mouth quirked somewhere between smug and sheepish.</p><p>“Because hers is witch?” Yelena snorts.</p><p>“I was having a smart-ass moment,” Agatha explains. “What’s yours?”</p><p>Yelena’s eyes pop slightly. “If you make me safeword I will buy you a yacht. But… it is teddy bear.”</p><p>Rio thinks she looks impressed that Agatha asked.</p><p>“Teddy bear?” Agatha asks, eyebrows raised.</p><p>Yelena clears her throat and scratches the side of her nose. “Yes. Well. My ex girlfriend called me teddy bear, which I have hated. I knew I would never say it, so is a good safeword.”</p><p>Rio has known Yelena’s safeword for over ten years, and it still makes her chuckle. “Big softie.”</p><p>Yelena’s grin is wolfish. “Your girlfriend is about to find out how soft I am not,” she says, eyes sparkling.</p><p>Rio watches Agatha clench her thighs together and loves it.</p><p>Of course Agatha is wearing the most difficult outfit she could find – jeans, belt, bra and underwear, tank top, short-sleeved blouse, and one of Rio’s old hoodies she’d snagged when she woke up.</p><p>Rio herself is in jogging pants and a loose sweater, socks and sneakers. She knows she’ll need a good range of motion.</p><p>“Pleasantries out of the way,” Yelena says, threading her fingers together and cracking her knuckles. “Are we ready?”</p><p>Rio’s stomach flips. “Yep.”</p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p>Yelena steps closer to Agatha, slowly leans down so they’re face to face, and whispers.</p><p>“Run.”</p><p>Agatha does. She’s up from the armchair so fast Rio’s head spins, and then she’s gone.</p><p>“How long should we give?” Yelena asks, eyeing Rio.</p><p>“Ten more seconds, maybe?” Rio says. Her hands are sweating and shaking and she wipes them on her pants.</p><p>“Nervous?” Yelena clocks the movement, because of course she does.</p><p>“I’ve seen her lash out. Nervous doesn’t cover it.”</p><p>“Second thoughts?”</p><p>“Absolutely not.”</p><p>Yelena grins. “Let’s go.”</p><p>They don’t run. Not yet.</p><p>Rio’s steps are quiet. Yelena’s oxfords reverberate with every step once they’re past the carpet and into the kitchen.</p><p>“Pretty girl,” Yelena calls in a sing-song voice that’s so threatening it makes Rio shiver. And Yelena’s her best friend in the world. “You cannot hide forever. And I do not like to search.”</p><p>There’s obviously no response to that, and Rio heads toward the bedroom. Where she’s promptly hit in the face with something that instantly makes her cheek throb. “Fuck!” She doesn’t look down to find out what Agatha threw at her because something else is flying toward her and she ducks out of the way, slamming the door. “Well,” she says to Yelena, nursing her jaw. “She’s in there.”</p><p>Yelena looks at Rio’s cheek and snorts. “You will be fine. Dive for cover when I open the door. I take the next hit.”</p><p>Rio crouches down in preparation and when Yelena opens the door, she dives into the room and takes cover behind the bed. Agatha is by the closet, throwing shoes.</p><p>“Get out,” Agatha snarls, and Rio watches Yelena deflect a flying combat boot with her forearm.</p><p>“Is that any way to treat a guest?” Yelena asks, stalking slowly forward, through the barrage of boots and heels being hurled rapid fire. She takes one in the forehead because she’s too busy knocking another out of the way and Agatha threw two at once.</p><p>Rio vaults over the bed and they converge on Agatha together, with Rio grabbing her arms and Yelena grabbing her throat.</p><p>Agatha ducks her head to bite but Yelena snatches her arm back, smacks Agatha in the mouth, and grabs her throat again.</p><p>Agatha immediately goes for her wrist again, teeth scraping flesh before Yelena backhands her and shoves her against the wall by the throat while Rio keeps her arms pinned to her stomach. “Try to bite me again, bitch!” Yelena shouts.</p><p>Agatha’s breathing hard but it does nothing to deter her fighting instinct. “Fuck you!” she shouts back and spits blood at Yelena, arching against Rio’s hold.</p><p>Rio’s grip falters at Yelena’s disgusted shriek, and Agatha’s arms are free. “Shit, shit, shit,” she says, feeling fingernails drag across the side of her face as Agatha bolts past her and out of the bedroom.</p><p>“Regroup,” Yelena says, wiping the bloody saliva from her cheek on one of the shirts in Rio’s closet. “Jesus Christ.”</p><p>“I tried to tell you,” Rio says with a smirk, taking a second to breathe.</p><p>“Your face look like you got clawed by a wild animal,” Yelena says. “Maybe not far from the truth.”</p><p>“Yeah, it doesn’t feel great,” Rio agrees. “Next time we catch her, get her to the floor faster.”</p><p>“Such sage advice,” Yelena deadpans, popping her neck and looking determined. “Kick her legs out. I take her arms this time.”</p><p>“Copy that,” Rio says, and they head out. “Oh fuck. She’s in the kitchen,” she says at the sound of breaking dishes.</p><p>“Hope you do not value anything too much,” Yelena says, raising one eyebrow as they walk down the hall.</p><p>Rio stops short as they round the corner into the kitchen. “Oh my God.”</p><p>Agatha’s standing on the counter by the refrigerator, holding a jagged piece of broken ceramic that came from one of Rio’s more expensive plates.</p><p>Yelena takes stock of the situation, then picks up a dining chair and holds it in front of her as she advances.</p><p>Rio follows suit and grabs a chair too, using it like a shield.</p><p>“Back off,” Agatha growls.</p><p>“Why are you standing on the counter?” Yelena asks, continuing to slowly move forward. “One tap on your ankles you fall and break your leg. Get down.”</p><p>Agatha grabs another plate from the cabinet next to her head and chucks it like a frisbee.</p><p>It hits Yelena’s fingers where she’s holding the chair and she grunts, almost dropping it. “I am going to rip you to shreds,” she promises. “Get your fucking ass down from that counter.”</p><p>“You’re not gonna fucking touch me,” Agatha retorts, throwing another plate, then another one toward Rio.</p><p>“You’ll run out of dishes, and then what?” Rio asks, inching forward.</p><p>“I don’t care.” More plates whizz around the kitchen, a few of them breaking.</p><p>Rio’s had enough and she throws her chair as a distraction, then darts forward and grabs Agatha by the belt, dragging her down from the counter, using her other hand to grip Agatha’s wrist, keeping the ceramic shard away from her.</p><p>She hears Yelena’s chair hit the floor and then holding Agatha is a little easier.</p><p>Agatha shrieks and kicks at them both, turning side to side, trying to wriggle out of their grasp, and when Yelena wrests the ceramic shard out of Agatha’s grip, Rio sweeps her feet out from under her and they all tumble to the floor.</p><p>She scrambles to get her bearings and as soon as she knows which way is up she sits on Agatha’s stomach. “Get her belt,” she says.</p><p>“Trying,” comes Yelena’s response from behind her.</p><p>It’s like riding a bucking bronco.</p><p>Agatha spits at her and Rio slaps her, and finally she hears the jangling of metal that says Yelena got the belt unbuckled. Then the whoosh of leather sliding over denim. Then the sound of the buckle hitting something, and Agatha howls.</p><p>“Ahhhh, what the fuck is wrong with you?” she shrieks, her struggles renewed, and Rio is afraid she’s going to get bucked off.</p><p>Another metallic thud and Rio realizes that Yelena is hitting her with the belt buckle.</p><p>Agatha howls again and flexes her arms against Rio’s hands, but Rio’s leaning forward so her full weight is pinning them down, and they don’t budge. “Can you get her pants off?”</p><p>“She is kicking too much.”</p><p>Another loud thud, another howl from Agatha, and Rio can see the tears streaming down her face.</p><p>“Stop kicking,” she suggests. “Let her take your pants off.”</p><p>“So she can put her hands on me? In me? I think the fuck not,” Agatha growls through her tears.</p><p>“How do you know that’s what she’d do?” Rio asks, grinning.</p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha snarls, and gears up to spit again, but Rio leans down quickly and bites her lip, startling Agatha into momentary stillness.</p><p>It’s enough for Yelena to get the button of her pants open and pull down the zipper, because Rio hears it, and then Yelena cries out, there’s a non-metallic thud, and Rio gets kneed in the back of the head.</p><p>Agatha bucks her off, gets to her feet and runs, but Yelena’s up and grabs her by the hair, slamming her face first into the refrigerator.</p><p>Rio ignores the pain in her head and pushes to her knees, reaching over to jerk Agatha’s pants down. She leaves them around her knees to immobilize her legs, because holy fucking shit.</p><p>Agatha screams.</p><p>Rio takes one point five seconds to catch her breath, then grabs Agatha’s panties and rips them straight off of her body in pieces.</p><p>She discards the tattered scraps and stands up, shoving a hand between Agatha’s legs and spearing into her with two fingers.</p><p>And then she laughs, pulling her hand away. “You’re fucking <em>soaked</em>.”</p><p>“Maybe I just pissed myself,” Agatha snaps, trying to angle her hips away from Rio’s hand. “Don’t touch me you fucking asshole.”</p><p>Yelena is standing behind Agatha, still holding her against the fridge, and Rio takes a second to look her friend over while they have Agatha still.</p><p>She’s panting, her hair is half out of its bun, her forehead is resting against Agatha’s shoulder blades, her skin slick with sweat. She looks… really fucking good.</p><p>“Feel her, Yel. She’s soaked,” she says with a smirk, and pats Agatha’s head condescendingly.</p><p>One of Yelena’s hands disappears between Agatha’s thighs, and Agatha hisses in pain.</p><p>“Like the whore we know she is,” Yelena whispers against the back of Agatha’s neck. Rio can see her arm moving, thrusting up hard, and Agatha’s sobbing against the fridge.</p><p>Rio thinks they’ve turned a corner – that the fight has gone out of her.</p><p>She notices too late that Agatha has managed to get her shoes and socks off and her pants all the way down and step out of them.</p><p>And then she watches in fascinated horror as Agatha pushes off the fridge with both hands and one foot, sending Yelena hurtling backwards into the opposite counter.</p><p>Yelena yells and turns around, bending over the counter, and Rio wonders what in the fuck she’s doing, until there’s a flash of motion and a glint of steel, and Yelena has the tip of a butcher knife in the hollow of Agatha’s throat.</p><p>“Tie her hands,” Yelena says, never taking her eyes from Agatha’s face.</p><p>“You’ll have to kill me before I let you do that,” Agatha says, her voice low.</p><p>Yelena pushes the point of the blade until it makes a tiny nick.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha gasps. “Okay, you win.” She puts her hands behind her back.</p><p>“Don’t fucking move or I’ll slice you from throat to cunt,” Yelena says, her eyes hard, voice deathly quiet.</p><p>Rio’s about to fall apart right there on the spot, and she looks around for something to tie Agatha’s hands with.</p><p>There’s nothing, so she pulls the string of the hoodie out of the one Agatha’s wearing. And when she ties Agatha’s wrists, she makes damn fucking sure there will be no escape. She ties the string as tight as humanly possible without cutting off circulation. She checks quickly to be sure she hasn’t miscalculated, and two fingers barely fit under the knot, but they fit.</p><p>“Spread your legs,” Yelena orders, still calm and quiet.</p><p>“Do you feel powerful, fucking women who can’t get away?” Agatha hisses.</p><p>Yelena nicks her throat again and answers simply. “Yes.”</p><p>Agatha spits in her face.</p><p>Rio grabs Agatha by the hair and pulls her head back away from the knife before she kicks the back of her knees to send her down.</p><p>Yelena grabs the handtowel that’s beside the sink and wipes her face, then drops the knife into the basin and turns to Rio. “I want this <em>cy</em><em>кa</em> naked.”</p><p>Rio nods. “Scissors are in the third drawer.” She keeps a hand wrapped in Agatha’s hair, hesitant to believe she’s done fighting even with her hands tied behind her back.</p><p>Yelena stands facing away from them for a minute, and Rio figures she’s catching her breath. “Whooo,” she finally says, grabbing the scissors out of the drawer. “That was quite a workout. All for nothing, because we caught you anyway.”</p><p>Agatha says nothing, and Rio has the uneasy feeling she’s gearing up for something. She watches Yelena cut the hoodie off, then the shirt, then the tank top, then the bra. Yelena’s eyes go hooded when she sees Agatha’s nipples and Rio can tell the piercings are a pleasant surprise.</p><p>“Only a shameless slut puts jewelry through her private parts,” Yelena says, tweaking one of the rings.</p><p>There’s scraps of clothing all over the floor and Rio wants to move this to the bedroom. “Get up,” she says, tugging sharply on Agatha’s hair.</p><p>Agatha snarls, but obeys. “Two on one is hardly fair,” she says as Rio marches her toward the bedroom.</p><p>“Fair?” Rio barks out a laugh. “Fair would’ve been five on one, the hell you put us through. You’re about to pay for it, though. That’ll be fair.”</p><p>A low rumble sounds in Agatha’s chest. “Stupid fucking cunts,” she mutters as she walks.</p><p>Rio slaps her upside the back of the head and when they reach the bed, she forcibly bends Agatha over the end of it. “I bet you’re still dripping for it.”</p><p>Yelena slaps her on the ass and pushes a hand between her legs again, thrusting hard enough to rock her forward.</p><p>Agatha cries out and resorts to pleading. “Wait, wait please, stop…”</p><p>Yelena throws her head back and laughs. “Fuck you, girlie.” She turns to look at Rio. “In case you wonder… you are right. She still is dripping for it.”</p><p>Rio quickly checks her circulation on the way to whispering in her ear. “Hear that? You’re still dripping for it.” She licks the shell of Agatha’s ear and sucks it into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha whimpers, the sound involuntary, and then immediately turns her head away. “Get off me.”</p><p>Rio chuckles and follows, climbing onto the bed, sucking on the back of Agatha’s neck, her mouth getting jostled every time Yelena thrusts. “I can <em>smell</em> how bad you want this,” she taunts quietly.</p><p>“You’re wro—uhhhhh—wrong,” Agatha moans.</p><p>“Sounds like it,” Rio snorts. “We all know how bad you want to get fucked. Girls like you can’t hide it very well.”</p><p>Agatha tries to bite her but it’s halfhearted.</p><p>Rio hears a zipper and snaps her head toward Yelena. She’s freeing her strap from her uniform pants without taking them off, and oh fuck, there’s something about that that sends Rio into orbit.</p><p>“Give me something to put in her ass,” Yelena says casually, withdrawing her fingers from Agatha’s pussy and thrusting her dick in without warning.</p><p>Agatha screams, arching off the bed, panting for breath, and starts to cry.</p><p>Rio’s about to be truly alarmed, but in the next breath, Agatha shatters the need for concern.</p><p>“I can—barely feel your—dick,” she chokes out on a sob.</p><p>A laugh bubbles up in Rio’s chest and escapes, and she grabs Agatha by the hair, yanks her head up, and kisses her.</p><p>Even Yelena stifles a chuckle against her own shoulder, but doesn’t stop the movement of her hips. “You can feel it,” she says, slapping the side of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>Agatha tries to jerk her head away, but Rio keeps the grip on her hair and doesn’t let her.</p><p>It’s a mistake. She feels teeth sink into her lip and split the skin. She rears back, hand to her mouth, a strangled sound of surprised agony spilling out unchecked.</p><p>Yelena narrows her eyes. “Go get the knife,” she tells Rio.</p><p>Rio keeps pressure on her lip trying to stem the blood flow and leaves Agatha cackling while she goes to the kitchen for the knife. She grabs it and a papertowel to press to her mouth and stalks back to the bedroom, handing the knife to Yelena.</p><p>“You are going to want to hold <em>very</em> still,” Yelena says, her tone deadly serious. She slowly withdraws the strap and puts the knife point between Agatha’s legs.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fly wider than Rio has ever seen, but instead of the safeword she expects to hear tumbling out, Agatha stops moving. Completely. Her eyes are almost black. Rio can even see the way she’s making herself breathe slower to stay still.</p><p>“Apologize to her for the bite,” Yelena says.</p><p>“What?” Agatha breathes. “No.”</p><p>Rio watches Agatha’s jaw drop, her face twisting, but she can’t tell if it’s pain or fear of pain.</p><p>“That is half inch. Should we go for full inch?”</p><p>“Why should I apologize for defending myself?” Agatha gasps. “You’re—apex predators—both of you—and you—”</p><p>“And you are apex prey,” Yelena says. “But we subdued you. You owe respect. Apologize.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha refuses again.</p><p>Yelena’s arm doesn’t even look like it moves at all, but Agatha’s resistance falls apart.</p><p>“Okay, stop, I’ll do it,” she half whines, half growls. “Take it out.”</p><p>“Apologize first.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha snarls.</p><p>“Good pet,” Yelena says, carefully withdrawing the knife.</p><p>“Go fuck yourself.”</p><p>Rio goes into the closet and comes back with a nice-sized plug. “How’s this for her ass? Do you think it’s big enough to shut her up?” It’s slightly bigger than the strap she tried to use a while back. She had stopped that night because she wasn’t feeling like causing Agatha any pain at the time. Now, she feels like causing Agatha as much pain as she can take. She thinks all three of them feel like that.</p><p>“Stay away from my ass!” Agatha shouts. And she starts trying to kick them both.</p><p>Yelena pins one leg with her body pressed against it and Rio pins the other. She checks the hoodie string and makes sure Agatha’s hands are still getting blood, then sucks on the plug to lube it a little and puts the tip against Agatha’s asshole.</p><p>When she pushes, Agatha rears up with a core strength Rio didn’t know she had, and slams her head into Yelena’s jaw.</p><p>Yelena grunts, but shoves her back down with a hand between the shoulder blades and doesn’t move. “You are not going to win,” she says.</p><p>“I’ll die trying,” Agatha says breathlessly.</p><p>So Yelena holds her down by the back of the neck while Rio works the plug further and further into her ass.</p><p>There’s resistance, and she can tell it hurts by the pathetic little grunts and whimpers Agatha’s making. “Quiet,” she says. “I’d be using something smaller if you hadn’t fucked up my entire face.”</p><p>Agatha presses her mouth into the blankets, and Rio’s not sure if she’s doing it for something to bite or if she’s trying to be quiet as ordered. Probably the first option.</p><p>She slowly nudges the plug in past the flared base and Agatha gives one high-pitched squeal before quieting again. The sound does so many things to Rio’s body, all of them at odds with each other. Her heart pangs, her stomach tenses and her cunt pulses slick out onto her underwear.</p><p>“There we go. Nice and full. Time to be properly fucked,” Yelena says. “Hold her down, please,” she says to Rio, and Rio puts her hand on the back of Agatha’s neck as Yelena removes hers.</p><p>“It hurts,” Agatha complains, pushing against Rio’s hand. But she’s not going anywhere. Not with this leverage.</p><p>“Do not care,” Yelena says simply, and smacks the base of the plug before lining up her strap and firing her hips forward.</p><p>“Aaaaahhh—owwww,” Agatha cries, but Rio sees the way her eyelids flutter. She’s fucking eating it up.</p><p>“Owww,” she mocks. “Please. You’re practically gagging for it. Fucking slut.”</p><p>Agatha moans.</p><p>Yelena drags her nails down Agatha’s back, leaving welts in their wake as her hips keep slamming against the most perfect set of ass cheeks Rio has ever dated. Probably the most perfect she’s ever seen.</p><p>“Can’t get enough, can you?” Rio taunts. “Give up the act. I can see you dripping every time she pulls out.”</p><p>“It’s—it’s—it’s—” Agatha tries to argue, but when Rio reaches over and wiggles the plug at the same time Yelena bottoms out, she throws her head back with a desperate cry and comes all over Yelena’s dick.</p><p>Yelena collapses bent over Agatha’s back. “I need aftercare,” she says, her accent especially thick.</p><p>Rio laughs even though she needs some herself, and Agatha’s just busy trying to breathe.</p><p>“I am so fucking serious,” Yelena groans.</p><p>“I know,” Rio says, and starts loosening the knots of the hoodie string around Agatha’s wrists. She gets it undone and is careful about unwrapping it slowly. The string has dug in and caused burns and bleeding, and it’s stuck in one spot. “I’ll be right back, baby, I need to get a warm cloth and some ointment. Is that okay?”</p><p>Agatha mumbles something unintelligible.</p><p>“I will get the cloth and ointment. You stay with her,” Yelena says, and Rio can see what a monumental effort it takes her friend to stand up. The strap slides out of Agatha’s pussy with an obscene popping sound, and Yelena wanders off toward the bathroom, unsteady.</p><p>“Be careful,” Rio calls with a frown. She’s actually afraid Yelena might collapse now that the adrenaline spikes are coming down.</p><p>Thankfully she doesn’t hear a crash, and Yelena returns with a wet cloth and ointment.</p><p>Rio dabs the cloth over the spot where the string is sticking, and Agatha’s wrists jerk.</p><p>“I know, baby, I’m sorry,” she soothes, and opens the ointment, squeezing a liberal amount all around and starting to massage it in. The string comes free and Rio sighs with relief, tossing it off the bed, and keeps rubbing ointment over all the rest of the affected area.</p><p>Next she stretches out both of Agatha’s arms, testing her range of motion, massaging her sore shoulders.</p><p>Finished with everything that was immediately necessary for safety, Rio climbs onto the bed and tugs Agatha against one side, holding out an arm when Yelena crawls over and melts into the mattress on her other side. She squeezes them both, and the lower the adrenaline spike goes, the more her entire body hurts. Especially her face.</p><p>“I cannot move,” Yelena groans. “But she should not sleep with that in her ass.”</p><p>Agatha’s still not talking, but she’s clearly listening, because she reaches behind her and pulls out the plug and drops it off the edge of the bed.</p><p>Rio hears the thunk as it hits the floor and the tinier thunk when it rolls into one of the bedposts. Time seems to slow, and it feels like one blink takes five minutes.</p><p>Yelena’s already snoring softly and Agatha’s close behind, so Rio takes a breath and closes her eyes.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio wakes to a pounding in her head and soreness all over her body. She groans, putting a hand to her forehead, and doesn’t want to open her eyes. Her fingers are stiff, and she realizes it’s because they’re caked with dried blood.</p><p>Two other groans reach her ears and when she finally opens her eyes, she laughs softly, because Agatha’s head is buried under one of her arms and Yelena’s head is buried under the other.</p><p>“Witch killer,” Agatha mumbles, and Rio loses it a little.</p><p>Yelena snorts and lifts her head, her hair an absolute tragedy. “Witch killer indeed, Agatha. You almost got a yacht.”</p><p>Agatha’s head snaps up. “Are you serious?” And then “Oh, God, I moved too fast. Someone make it stop. Please.” She drops her head back down.</p><p>Rio is very invested in Yelena’s answer. Her heart is racing, actually. There’s a certain amount of pride she feels that her submissive might have almost gotten the great Yelena Belova to safeword.</p><p>“I am dead serious,” Yelena says. “You are one magnificent feral beast. My body feel like it is in pieces.”</p><p>Rio’s chest swells and she runs her fingers through Agatha’s hair. “She is that, isn’t she?” she agrees.</p><p>“I admit that based on her impeccable manners when bound and gagged, I did not expect quite such a show. It was a surprise, but mostly a pleasant one.” She looks at Agatha even though Agatha’s face is hidden. “Congratulations, Agatha. I have never needed traction after a scene before.”</p><p>Agatha snuggles closer against Rio’s side and whines quietly.</p><p>“You’re embarrassing her,” Rio stage whispers.</p><p>“Is that a joke?” Yelena deadpans. “Not embarrassed by double penetration, just by congratulations?”</p><p>Agatha whines louder.</p><p>Rio kisses her head and sighs. “We should probably start treating our injuries.”</p><p>Agatha and Yelena both start complaining at the same time. “I don’t want-why would you ruin-to get up yet-a perfectly good morning?”</p><p>Rio is not going to combat them both. “Suit yourselves, but if I don’t clean my face I’ll get an infection.” Her lip hurts so fucking bad. She starts to sit up but they both cling to her arms. “Are you f—come on, I really do need to clean my face. If you let me up, I’ll bring you both breakfast in bed.”</p><p>And suddenly her arms are free.</p><p>“Goddamn brats,” she mutters under her breath as she gets out of bed.</p><p>She hears a high five on her way out the door and is half tempted to go drag them both up, but the little grin she can’t help wearing tells her she’s not going to do that at all.</p><p>She almost can’t make herself put disinfectant on the scratches, and she bites her own fist to keep from yelling and alerting the brats in her bed when she finally upends the peroxide bottle over her cheek. It’s like lava sizzling on her face. There’s so much sizzling that she knows she’ll have to pour another round when it stops.</p><p>When round two doesn’t sizzle hardly as much, she puts away the bottle. Because she can’t bring herself to pour it over the bite wound on her lip. She’ll probably just have to go to urgent care for that one. Agatha may need an x-ray anyway for those belt buckle blows. She’ll have to figure out where Yelena landed them.</p><p>She washes her hands in the kitchen and makes pancakes and bacon, puts butter on all the pancakes, makes three plates and takes two of them to the bedroom. Agatha and Yelena haven’t moved.</p><p>Rio clears her throat. “If you want to eat, you have to sit up.”</p><p>Much moaning and groaning later, they’re both sitting up against the headboard with pillows behind them.</p><p>Rio holds out their plates and they both take them, and Yelena immediately picks up her bacon, stuffing half of it into her mouth. “Thank you daddy,” she says as she chews, and all three of them completely freeze.</p><p>Rio’s heart starts racing, her panic button about to set in, because what if Agatha—</p><p>But Agatha just smirks and cuts one of her pancakes, and says “yeah, thanks daddy.”</p><p>Rio stands there for a minute like a deer in headlights and then retreats.</p><p>As she escapes to the kitchen, she hears faintly, “just because I went along with it doesn’t mean I’m not gonna ask questions later.”</p><p>--</p><p>Rio eats at the kitchen table and then prepares herself for the task ahead. She makes her way to the bedroom and leans on the door frame. “It’s time to go to urgent care,” she says, and both sets of eyes snap toward her. “Agatha, get dressed.”</p><p>The complaining starts from both women, as she’d known it would, and she just shakes her head. “I don’t want to hear it. Agatha, get dressed. Yelena, stop encouraging her to be defiant.”</p><p>“What?” Yelena asks, eyes bugging.</p><p>“You heard daddy,” Agatha teases, putting her plate on the nightstand and very gingerly getting out of bed.</p><p>Yelena pulls the blankets up over her head.</p><p>Rio takes a moment to look Agatha over, and God, is she marked up. She’s got three glaring bruises along her hip and thighs from being hit with the belt buckle, a split lip, a massive bruise on her face, probably from being slammed into the refrigerator. There’s dried blood on her chin from the split lip, there’s two shallow cuts on her throat, surrounded by fingerprints from where Yelena had choked her, and the rest of her body is littered with random red marks and smaller bruises.</p><p>“Sit down, baby, I’ll get you some clothes,” she says, her heart aching at the state of her submissive-slash-girlfriend? She doesn’t know what to call them right now, but not in a bad way.</p><p>“Will you also get me clothes?” she hears from under the blankets.</p><p>“You’re dressed,” she says with a little snort, heading for the closet to find Agatha something comfortable to wear.</p><p>“I will not go to urgent care in my dress uniform.”</p><p>“Yeah, fine, I’ll get clothes for both of you,” Rio says, a headache starting that has nothing to do with last night’s wounds.</p><p>--</p><p>When the brats are dressed in loose-fitting sweat pants and sweatshirts, Yelena still sits on the bed after Agatha gets up.</p><p>“I can barely move my right leg.”</p><p>“From when I kicked you off me?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Was that when I almost got a yacht?”</p><p>“Many times you almost got a yacht,” Yelena says. “Who will help me walk to the car?”</p><p>Rio’s injuries are mostly on her face, so she turns to Agatha. “Can you grab the keys from the hook by the garage and open the door, and one of the back doors of the car, baby?”</p><p>Agatha nods and goes off to do that, and Rio walks over to the bed. “Daddy?” she says as she picks Yelena up.</p><p>Yelena wraps her legs around Rio’s waist and her arms around her neck. “I do not know,” she says. “Perhaps now is not the time to reflect.”</p><p>Rio snickers and shakes her head, and carries Yelena to the car.</p><p>--</p><p>She knows what an absolute fucking train wreck they look like rolling up to registration, all of them beat to shit.</p><p>When the clerk looks at them, she blinks. “What brings you in today?” she asks anyway.</p><p>“X-rays and stitches,” Rio says. “And an MRI for her leg, probably,” she adds, nodding toward Yelena, who is leaning on Agatha for support.</p><p>“Were you mauled by an animal?” the clerk asks. “If you came into contact with a rabid—”</p><p>“No,” Rio interrupts. “Only the three of us were involved.”</p><p>“Do I need to call the authorities for any of you?”</p><p>“Not for me,” Rio says. “They can answer for themselves.”</p><p>“No,” they both say, one after the other.</p><p>“So… you just need X-rays, stitches, and an MRI.” She’s clearly not sure what to do with them.</p><p>“That is correct.”</p><p>“Okay, each of you fill one of these out and bring them back to me, then I’ll get you registered.” She slides three clipboards with attached pens through the hole in the plastic partition.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio says, grabbing all three clipboards before helping Agatha get Yelena to a chair.</p><p>--</p><p>They’re registered and in the triage room when a knock sounds and the door opens, and a police officer steps in.</p><p>“Are you serious?” Agatha gawks at him. “We said we didn’t need the police.”</p><p>“I just need to verify that with each of you individually,” the officer says.</p><p>“Or you could go fuck yourself since we all <em>individually</em> said not to call the authorities,” Agatha snaps.</p><p>Rio’s jaw drops and Yelena turns away, but Rio can see her shoulders shake with laughter.</p><p>“Ma’am,” the officer says with a frown. “I’ll need to speak to each of you in private before I can let the matter rest.”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth but Rio beats her to speaking. “Agatha,” she says gently. “Just let him do his job. We should be grateful he came down here. Grateful he cares enough to make sure we’re actually okay.”</p><p>Agatha shuts her mouth but Rio can tell she’s still immeasurably pissed off.</p><p>The officer steps out to wait for triage to be finished, and the nurse takes their vitals, records everything in the computer, and sends them back out to the waiting room, with a wheelchair for Yelena.</p><p>Agatha is called over by the officer first, and she comes back scowling five minutes later. “He’d better fucking believe me.”</p><p>“I’m sure he does,” Rio says, kissing her forehead, which makes Agatha blush and sit down.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal?”</p><p>Rio walks to a private area in the hallway with the officer. “It was consensual,” she says. “But thank you for your concern.”</p><p>“Consensual for all parties involved?”</p><p>“Yes. Everything was discussed beforehand. We all knew we would sustain injuries.”</p><p>“What were you doing?”</p><p>She raises an eyebrow. “Is that relevant?”</p><p>She thinks he looks curious, but ultimately he agrees with her. “I suppose it’s not. Thank you for your time.”</p><p>Rio nods and goes back to her chair, between Agatha’s and Yelena’s.</p><p>“Ms. Belova? I can wheel your chair if that’s all right.”</p><p>Yelena nods, and they disappear down the hall. He brings her back a few minutes later.</p><p>“Thank you for your cooperation,” he says. “I will close the matter.”</p><p>Agatha’s still scowling long after he’s walked away, and Rio puts a hand on her thigh. “Baby,” she says softly. “It’s okay.”</p><p>“Why bother asking us if we need her to call the authorities if she’s not gonna listen to the answer?” Agatha says, still heated. “Fucking idiot.”</p><p>Rio squeezes her leg. “Because some people come in here with their abusers,” she says. “And they say no in front of the person who would hurt them if they said yes.”</p><p>That knocks the wind out of Agatha’s sails and she slouches in her chair. “Oh. That makes sense. I didn’t realize.”</p><p>Yelena has been strangely silent and Rio’s about to ask her if something’s wrong when their names are called by a nurse holding open a door to the back offices.</p><p>--</p><p>Yelena gets a brace and crutches for her jacked-up knee. Rio gets stitches in her cheek and glue on her lip. And no she didn’t almost break the doctor’s arm when he cleaned it. Agatha gets a butterfly bandage on her lip and two on her throat, but nothing is broken. They all get a round of antibiotics called in to the nearest pharmacy.</p><p>Rio pulls in to a parking space and shuts off the car. “I’ll be right back.”</p><p>“Can I have candy bar?” Yelena asks from the back seat.</p><p>“You—” Rio starts, but really, why is she surprised? “What kind?”</p><p>“Reese’s.”</p><p>“That’s not a candy bar,” Agatha says.</p><p>Rio sees Yelena’s hand fly up to smack the side of Agatha’s head. “Is so.”</p><p>“Hey, come on,” Rio says. “Reese’s. Fine.”</p><p>“I want something too,” Agatha says, pulling her feet up onto the seat and wrapping her arms around them.</p><p>Rio makes the gritted teeth emoji face. “What would you like?”</p><p>Agatha peers at her sideways. “Reese’s.”</p><p>“A Reese’s for each of you, but that’s it, that’s all you’re getting. We’re here for antibiotics. Behave yourselves, I’ll be right back.”</p><p>She gets out and shuts the door, muttering under her breath about wrangling two brats instead of one.</p><p>Antibiotics in hand, she grabs the Reese’s and pays for them, then heads back to the car. She can see Yelena leaning forward between the seats and Agatha with her hands over her ears, and when she gets closer to the car she feels the bass pounding in her chest.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing?” she shouts after opening the door, and slams her hand on the power button of her radio.</p><p>The car falls eerily silent.</p><p>Yelena quickly retreats to the back again and puts on her seatbelt. Agatha uncovers her ears.</p><p>“Daddy,” she whines. “Yelena was blasting music the entire time and it hurt my ears.”</p><p>“I only turn it up because she keep turning it off!” Yelena defends herself.</p><p>Rio is so close to blowing a fuse. “I don’t want to hear it!” she tells them both. “I said to behave. I’m trying to get us home and medicated and you’re arguing over music. Do you both want spanked right now?”</p><p>Agatha sinks down in her seat a little. “No Daddy, I’m sorry,” she whispers.</p><p>Rio looks sharply at Yelena. “You?”</p><p>Yelena shakes her head.</p><p>“Then stop annoying each other, and me, and let me get us home in one piece.”</p><p>Yelena waits until Rio’s on the highway before stage whispering to Agatha. “Is she always this mean?”</p><p>Rio forcibly ignores it. And she’s actually curious how Agatha will answer.</p><p>“Only when I deserve it,” Agatha says, and there’s an undercurrent of seriousness beneath her playful tone.</p><p>“I never deserve it,” Yelena states confidently, crossing her arms over her chest. Rio can see her in the rearview mirror. “Where is my candy?”</p><p>It’s in a bag at Rio’s feet. “When we get home.”</p><p>“Why can’t I have it now?”</p><p>“I’m driving. You can have it when we get home.”</p><p>“Agatha can get it for me,” Yelena argues.</p><p>“She would have to take off her seatbelt and she’s not doing that while I’m driving,” Rio says.</p><p>“Then you can pull over and—”</p><p>“If you say one more word about it Yelena I swear to God I will throw the candy out the window.”</p><p>Agatha gasps and turns around in her seat. “You better stop because I want mine when we get home,” she tells Yelena. “And I’ve already proved I can fuck you up.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warns. “We are in my car.”</p><p>“Oooh, what does that mean?” Yelena pipes up.</p><p>“But I’m not doing anything,” Agatha insists. “She’s going to get my candy thrown out the window.” Rio can see her frown out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>“She’s not, honey,” Rio assures her. “You’ll still get your candy. You don’t need to be rude.”</p><p>“Helloooo,” Yelena calls. “What is ‘we are in my car’?”</p><p>Rio doesn’t respond, and Yelena starts kicking the back of Agatha’s seat with her good leg.</p><p>If she doesn’t want Agatha reverting to bad behavior she’s going to have to do something, right now. She skids the car to a stop on the side of the highway, slams it into park, gets out, goes around, opens Yelena’s door, unbuckles her seatbelt, and drags her out of the car, lifting her to sit on the trunk.</p><p>Yelena yelps, her face showing genuine surprise, and she grabs onto Rio’s shoulders to keep her balance.</p><p>Rio shuts the car door so Agatha won’t hear them.</p><p>“Listen to me,” she says, keeping quiet. “Agatha has worked very hard, and I have worked very hard to earn her submission. So if you want to do this, I need you to stop antagonizing her and get serious.”</p><p>The weight of her words seems to settle over Yelena, and she doesn’t speak, she just pulls her lips into a tight line and gives a single dip of her chin in acknowledgement.</p><p>“Okay. Thank you.” Rio opens the car door and carefully gets Yelena back into her seat, and as she’s climbing back into her own, Yelena leans forward and kisses Agatha’s cheek and whispers something into her ear.</p><p>Rio can’t hear what it was, but she thinks it was an apology because Agatha says softly, “it’s okay.”</p><p>Right before Rio shifts back into drive, Yelena’s voice drifts forward, soft and serious. “Sorry, daddy.”</p><p>Rio closes her eyes for a second to let that roll through her, a tiny shudder making her clench her thighs, but other than that she shows no outward reaction. “Thank you,” she says, and drives the rest of the way home without incident.</p><p>--</p><p>Safely parked in the garage, Rio gives out instructions. “Both of you go to the kitchen table and sit down.”</p><p>“Can I please have my candy?” Yelena asks, struggling to get out of the car, but she manages to get herself upright with her crutches and nudge the door shut with her hip.</p><p>If Rio hears one more word about the fucking candy. “Yelena. You can have it with your antibiotics. In literally like two minutes. Go sit at the kitchen table please.”</p><p>Agatha’s already in the house, and Rio follows her in, catching her in the living room by the elbow to stop her. When Agatha turns, Rio kisses her. The softest of kisses, with both of their mouths injured.</p><p>“I’m proud of you, baby. Thank you for listening and behaving when I asked you to.”</p><p>Agatha melts into the kiss and soaks up the praise, her eyes bright. She nods almost shyly.</p><p>“Is it okay with you that she stays today? If it’s not—”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha interrupts. “It’s… fun. And I like seeing the bratty, human side of her. Yesterday she was like a superhero. Today she’s just a girl. I like it.”</p><p>Rio nods, kissing her again, and lets go of Agatha’s elbow.</p><p>When she’s released, Agatha continues to the kitchen and sits at the table.</p><p>Yelena slams the door to the garage behind her and just looks generally miserable, fumbling with the crutches.</p><p>“Do you want carried?” Rio asks, and Yelena nods with this look of relief that is simultaneously pitiful and adorable.</p><p>Rio goes and picks her up, carries her to the kitchen, and eases her into a chair. The bag with the candy and antibiotics is hung over her arm, and she takes it to the counter, emptying it out. She fills three glasses with water and takes them to the table, then goes back for the antibiotics and the Reese’s. Finally, they’re all seated with a glass of water in front of them.</p><p>Rio reads the directions on the bottles and puts two pills down in front of Agatha, then Yelena, and then pops two into her own mouth, swallowing with water and a grimace.</p><p>“Not good at taking pills,” Yelena says. “Hope you are good at the Heimlich maneuver.”</p><p>“I’m not, actually,” Rio says in alarm. “Please don’t choke.”</p><p>“Daddy,” Agatha says, and Rio’s stomach clenches.</p><p>“Yes, princess?”</p><p>“You could crush them up and put them in ice cream…”</p><p>Rio stares at them both. Neither have touched the pills. “You both don’t want to just swallow them?”</p><p>“If she gets hers crushed with ice cream I want that too,” Agatha says, her cheeks a little flushed.</p><p>Yelena nods, and then says, “if she is princess can I be prince?”</p><p>Rio’s breath catches. She’s not going to survive these two. “Okay. Okay. Crushed in ice cream for the prince and princess.”</p><p>When she turns toward the fridge she hears a high five. They’re going to be the death of her.</p><p>Getting the meds crushed and into ice cream is actually quite the affair, but she manages to do it in a way that the powder won’t escape and leave a bitter taste – pokes a hole with the end of the spoon, pours the crushed meds in, then packs more ice cream on top.</p><p>“Don’t chew it,” she says as she hands them each a spoon.</p><p>They both nod and swallow the ice cream without fanfare. Thank God. Rio slides them each their package of Reese’s and leans back in her chair to relax.</p><p>“You did not get one for yourself,” Yelena observes as she takes a bite.</p><p>“Not really in a candy mood,” Rio says.</p><p>“Are you sure? We can share,” Agatha offers.</p><p>“Speak for yourself,” Yelena mutters.</p><p>Rio looks at Agatha, affection surging in her chest. “Thank you, baby, but I’m sure.” She leans forward and wraps a hand in Agatha’s hair, pulling her in to kiss the top of her head. “Sweet girl.”</p><p>She notices Yelena’s eyes drop, an uncertain expression on her friend’s usually confident face.</p><p>“What is it, little prince?” she asks, releasing her hold on Agatha’s hair to run her fingers through it instead.</p><p>The expression vanishes and Yelena looks up, confidence back in place, and clears her throat. “Hm?”</p><p>Rio recognizes that for what it is and doesn’t push. “Oh, nothing,” she says with a shake of her head. “Just checking on you.”</p><p>“Of course,” Yelena says, sitting up straighter. “I am good.”</p><p>Rio can see that Agatha is going to address it before she even opens her mouth.</p><p>“If you want to be called sweet, you have to be sweet,” Agatha says, reaching across the table and drawing a finger over the back of one of Yelena’s hands.</p><p>Yelena’s jaw drops, and she doesn’t withdraw her hand like Rio figured she would. She just sits, staring at Agatha, allowing the gentle touch.</p><p>Rio just lets them have the moment, and finally Yelena speaks. “I did not know it was something I would want… until I heard it said and knew I did not deserve it.” Her eyes are shimmering. “Now I want it.”</p><p>“So be good,” Agatha says. “You can’t kneel, but you can bow your head. You can speak with respect.” She shifts in her seat, one hand curling around the waist of Rio’s pants, the other hand still stroking the back of Yelena’s. “You can say yes sir.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice is low, and Rio feels it between her legs. The tone, the implications, and the words themselves.</p><p>Yelena breathes out slowly. Shaky. Her eyes are hooded as she looks at Rio. “Daddy,” she says, and there’s no trace of immaturity or childish behavior left in her. She is General Belova in the flesh. Commanding. Scary. Pristine. “How else can I be good?”</p><p>Christ. “I’m going to need a minute to process everything. You two go get in the bed and wait for me. You can touch each other, but nothing under your clothes and no clothes come off. Understood?”</p><p>“Yes sir,” Yelena whispers.</p><p>“Yes sir,” Agatha echoes. “I’ll get your crutches,” she tells Yelena, and disappears from the kitchen.</p><p>Rio watches as she comes back in and helps Yelena get situated on the crutches, then watches them disappear around the corner into the hallway. And then she breathes.</p><p>She really does need a few minutes. She is one hundred percent up to this challenge, she just needs a short decompression before she can really shift into daddy dom mode, especially with two submissives.</p><p>She grabs her ear buds from the electronics drawer by the fridge and pops them in her ears, connecting to her phone and blasting heavy metal music as loud as she can take it.</p><p>As she sits with her eyes closed and music pulsing into her brain, she thinks about what she wants to do. A few different scenarios present themselves in her mind’s eye, but one makes her wetter than the rest, so her decision is made about how the afternoon will proceed.</p>

<p>Fully decompressed, turned on at the prospect of what she’s going to do to the two brats in her bed, and with energy replenished, Rio discards her phone and her ear buds and heads to the bedroom.</p><p>Agatha and Yelena are laying on their sides, making out, but they’ve done what they were told and are fully dressed with their hands on top of clothing.</p><p>Rio stands in the doorway and watches until Agatha notices her. “Ladies,” she says with a nod in their direction.</p><p>They stop kissing and roll onto their backs, and Agatha sits up. “Hi,” she says, moving to the edge of the bed as Rio approaches.</p><p>Rio stands between her knees and puts her hands into Agatha’s hair at the nape of her neck, scratching lightly at her scalp. She leans down to place a tender kiss to one temple and straightens back up. “I want you to undress each other,” she says and steps back.</p><p>Agatha bites her lip, then winces and stops that immediately. “Does it matter who goes first, daddy?”</p><p>Rio looks them over with a little smirk. “No.”</p><p>Agatha crawls over and tugs at Yelena’s sweatshirt, and Yelena sits up, raising her arms over her head.</p><p>Rio watches with her arms crossed over her chest, a bit of a leer on her face. Every inch of smooth skin revealed notches her anticipation higher. And Yelena’s gotten some new tattoos since they last did this.</p><p>She walks around to the other side of the bed and trails a fingernail over the crouched black panther on Yelena’s left hip. “This is new.”</p><p>“I knew you’d done this before,” Agatha says, and Rio can tell she’s amused but trying not to sound flippant. “That’s why you called her daddy this morning…”</p><p>Yelena’s cheeks turn red for the first time since Rio has known her. “No no,” she says, shaking her head. “I mean yes. We have done this. But the daddy. Was accident. It just came out because I felt—I do not know.”</p><p>“Safe,” Agatha says as she pulls Yelena’s sweatshirt off and tosses it to the floor.</p><p>“Yes. I suppose so,” Yelena agrees and reaches for Agatha’s sweatshirt, crawling her fingers up with her thumbs under the fabric. She lifts it over Agatha’s head and drops it off the edge of the bed.</p><p>“And you had just done an intense scene the night before, so it makes sense you wanted to be taken care of a little,” Agatha adds, carefully removing the brace and then tugging on Yelena’s pants.</p><p>“But so did Rio.” Yelena lays back and pushes up with her good leg so Agatha can get the pants down over her ass.</p><p>“And Rio is fine,” Rio says. “Rio likes being in charge all the time.”</p><p>Agatha balls up the pants and tosses them, then lays back so Yelena can take hers off.</p><p>“Okay daddy,” Yelena says as she pulls Agatha’s sweat pants off and discards them.</p><p>Neither of them are wearing a bra, so that just leaves their panties. “Underwear too,” Rio directs, twirling a finger toward each of them.</p><p>“Yes daddy,” Agatha whispers, and her nipples are hard. Rio can’t resist lightly plucking at the rings through them, making Agatha gasp and arch her back as she’s trying to take off Yelena’s underwear.</p><p>Yelena’s eyes are riveted to Agatha’s nipples.</p><p>“Let her have a taste, baby,” Rio encourages. “Then get back to your job.”</p><p>Agatha groans and crawls forward a little so Yelena can reach her nipples, and Yelena lifts her head, sucking one into her mouth, and makes a decadent noise that thrills Rio all the way to her fingertips.</p><p>“Doesn’t she taste good?” Rio purrs.</p><p>Yelena sucks on the other nipple, bringing her hands up to Agatha’s waist, and nods as she mumbles around her mouthful. “Yes daddy.”</p><p>“Okay, that’s enough. Back to your jobs.”</p><p>Agatha withdraws and Yelena lets her loose, dropping her hands to her sides, lifting up so Agatha can take her panties off.</p><p>“Good girls,” Rio praises them both for listening the first time.</p><p>Yelena’s jaw works and she looks a little awestruck. “Me too?”</p><p>“You listened, didn’t you?” Rio asks, stroking her calf.</p><p>Yelena nods, and Rio’s not sure of the extent of whatever’s going on inside her head, but she looks about to burst. Either with pride or a spontaneous orgasm.</p><p>Agatha draws Yelena’s panties down and off, handing them to Rio. “It feels good, doesn’t it? When you earn her praise?”</p><p>“Yes,” Yelena says as Agatha lays back and lifts up for her.</p><p>“It’s not like anything else,” Agatha says softly.</p><p>“No, it is not,” Yelena agrees, removing Agatha’s underwear, and Rio holds out her hand for them.</p><p>She tucks both pairs into the pocket of her pants and leans over to open the bottom drawer of the nightstand. She grabs two coils of rope and a harness, sits up and hands the harness to Agatha. “Get this on her.”</p><p>Agatha makes a noise that Rio isn’t sure how to describe – something like a strangled squeak. But she makes short work of getting Yelena into the harness and tightening the straps.</p><p>Yelena shifts her hips a bit, apparently trying to get comfortable, and then settles. “Are you tying my hands, daddy?” she asks, eyes glued to the ropes Rio’s holding, thighs clenching almost imperceptibly.</p><p>“I’d like to, yes,” Rio answers, getting on her knees and shuffling closer. “Is that okay? Can you let daddy tie your hands?”</p><p>Yelena swallows hard and nods. “Er… yes.”</p><p>“I use knots that are easy to undo if you safeword,” Rio says. “Proceed, or don’t proceed?”</p><p>Yelena’s nostrils flare slightly. “Proceed.”</p><p>Rio nods. And then she flicks her eyes toward Agatha. “Don’t think I haven’t noticed how patient you’re being, baby,” she says, smooth as silk.</p><p>Agatha flushes prettily and lowers her gaze. “Thank you,” she murmurs. “I—I wasn’t trying to—”</p><p>“Shh. I know.” Rio leans over to kiss her cheek. “Can you be patient a few more minutes?”</p><p>Agatha licks her lips and nods. “As long as you need me to.”</p><p>“Mm. Such a good girl.”</p><p>Chest swelled with pride, Rio turns back to Yelena and strokes her face. “You’re being very patient too, and I appreciate that,” she says. “Hands over your head, okay?”</p><p>Yelena nods and raises her arms over her head so Rio can tie them to the iron posts of the headboard.</p><p>“You know to tell me if anything goes numb, right?”</p><p>“Yes,” Yelena nods again.</p><p>“Mkay. Relax for a minute,” she says, patting the panther on Yelena’s hip, and then climbs off the bed to stand in front of Agatha again. “Do you remember when I told you I have two paddles? One for bad behavior and one for good behavior?”</p><p>Agatha grabs the waist of her pants and looks up, worried.</p><p>“Hey, what’s that face for? You’ve been good, honey.”</p><p>“I don’t know, I just… automatically panic,” Agatha says, relaxing. “Because what if I did something bad and didn’t realize it?”</p><p>“That won’t happen,” Rio assures her. “If you do something bad, I will always communicate to you that I didn’t like it. You will always know if there is something you are waiting to answer for.”</p><p>Agatha relaxes further and presses her forehead into Rio’s stomach. “So you’re going to spank me with the paddle that’s for good behavior?” she says after a minute.</p><p>Rio’s adrenaline spikes and she shoves her tongue against her cheek. “Mhmm. While you ride the strap.”</p><p>Agatha and Yelena both moan at the same time, and Rio laughs.</p><p>“I’ll take that as a thank you,” she says and extracts her pants from Agatha’s grip so she can go get the paddle.</p><p>It’s light, covered in green padded leather on both sides with smooth black rivets around the edges. She hefts it in one hand and goes back to the bed, leaning over to grab a little vibrator for Yelena’s clit on the way.</p><p>“You’re going to ride that strap, and every time you come off the dick, I pop your ass with the paddle.” She looks at Yelena and holds up the vibrator. “Open.”</p><p>Yelena stares at her. “Huh?”</p><p>It’s a genuine expression of confusion so Rio takes it easy on her and taps the toy against her thighs. “Open your legs, honey.”</p><p>“Oh. Shit,” Yelena says and slides her legs apart.</p><p>Rio swipes a finger between them to check if she’s wet, and the string of slick that tethers as she pulls away answers that question. She wipes it on her pants and carefully slides in the part of the vibrator that will hold the clit stimulator in place, and delights at the way Yelena shudders under her. “You’re going to wear this, and once I turn it on, it’s not getting shut off until Agatha comes. Understand?”</p><p>Yelena’s nod is almost comical it’s so slow. “Yes daddy,” she breathes.</p><p>“You understand?” Rio asks Agatha. “It’s your job to come all over her dick, baby. That’s the only way this ends. And no touching your clit. So the faster you ride the strap, the faster you can end Yelena’s torture, but the faster you ride, the more times you’ll get spanked.”</p><p>They’re both just staring at her, breathing hard, and a thrill snakes up her spine. They most definitely understand.</p><p>“Yes daddy,” Agatha says belatedly, eyes hooded.</p><p>Rio flicks the switch on Yelena’s vibrator and it hums to life with a whirr that settles into a droning buzz.</p><p>Yelena yelps and bends her good knee, arching her back, and Rio pushes down on her hips. “Come on now, Yelena,” she scolds. “I think you should know better than that.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, it’s just—ughhhhhh,” Yelena complains already. “I’m <em>sensitive</em> to vibrational frequencies,” she groans.</p><p>Rio reaches a hand into Agatha’s hair, curls a fist, and drags her closer. “I know she’s wearing it, but that’s <em>my</em> dick, baby. Get down there and suck daddy’s cock until you’re wet enough to take it all.”</p><p>The garbled sound that leaves Agatha’s throat is so utterly arousing that Rio wants to touch herself, but that’s not part of the plan. She forces Agatha to her hands and knees and gives her head a shove toward the strap, then sits back and watches.</p><p>Agatha mewls and crawls forward, ducking her head, and before she even touches the dick Yelena’s hips buck.</p><p>“Hold her down,” Rio says.</p><p>Agatha’s hands curl around Yelena’s hips and press. Rio moves to the side a little so she has a lateral view, and watches Agatha’s mouth descend over the head of the dark green dick. She imagines she can feel it; that it’s attached to her cunt and bumps against her clit with every movement. Her own breathing picks up as she watches Agatha take a few inches.</p><p>Yelena’s eyes are saucers, her head lifted, her face making adorable little tormented expressions as the vibrator keeps up the pace against her clit.</p><p>Agatha’s lips close and she pulls back, then drops lower, moaning, drawing more and more into her mouth, hollowing her cheeks with a powerful suck.</p><p>Rio can’t take it. She wants to see tears. She grabs Agatha’s hair and forces her head down hard, and when the cock hits her gag reflex, Agatha whines, but doesn’t try to fight Rio’s hold.</p><p>Rio keeps her there until she’s literally choking, then pulls her off and up to her knees. “Get up there,” she says with a slap to one ass cheek.</p><p>Agatha’s watery eyes send lightning bolts into her cunt, and Rio can’t help the little noise she makes as one welled-up tear escapes and trails down Agatha’s beautiful face.</p><p>She’s struggling to breathe, but she lowers herself onto the cock, her pussy wet enough that she slides down easy.</p><p>Yelena grunts as she takes Agatha’s weight, and a few seconds later she shudders with her first orgasm, tilting her head back to look up at the ceiling, stomach muscles tight as steel, and then she just goes limp.</p><p>Rio picks up the paddle. “Start riding,” she says, spinning it in her hand a few times, and when Agatha lifts up, she smacks the padded leather across the middle of that perfect ass.</p><p>Agatha moans and throws her head back, sitting still for a second, absorbing the blow. She looks like a lioness and Rio loves it.</p><p>Yelena doesn’t stay relaxed for long. As the vibrator no doubt works her back up to a fever pitch, she starts squirming under Agatha, pulling on the ropes that are binding her hands.</p><p>“How long are you going to just sit there?” Rio asks, as Agatha hasn’t lifted up again.</p><p>“I—I’m just getting used to it,” Agatha stutters. “It’s big.” She lifts off the dick and Rio pops her with the paddle, and she groans as she slides back down. “Fuck. <em>Fuck</em>.”</p><p>Yelena whines out another orgasm, hips jerking, thighs clenching, her good knee drawing up to ride it out. “Agatha start moving. Please,” she pants.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha gushes, finally starting a rhythm of up and down that’s faster than a snail moseying along the road.</p><p>Rio paddles her every single time she lifts up, and her ass is bright red in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Yelena is twisting and pulling and digging her heel into the bed trying to avoid the vibrator on her clit, but of course it follows her every move, and she starts making the most pitiful noises.</p><p>Rio’s inner sadist is flying high as she lays down the paddle again and again, watching Yelena become more and more overstimulated and desperate. The tendrils of top space are snaking around her brain and she sucks in a breath through her teeth in an attempt at self-regulation. Every single noise, every movement is sending her higher, making her wetter, creating this fullness inside her that’s clawing to be emptied out.</p><p>After her third orgasm, Yelena’s trembling. After her fourth, she’s shaking almost violently. After her fifth, she starts to cry. “I can’t, I can’t,” she wails, tossing her head and slamming her good knee into her bad one to close her legs. “Agatha please, please, I can’t take anymore, make it stop…”</p><p>“I’m trying,” Agatha gasps, switching the angle of her hips just a little and riding hard. Fast. Which means Rio spanks her more and more times. Harder. Faster. Her perfect ass is red and purple and bruised.</p><p>Finally, as she slides down hard enough to make Yelena grunt, Agatha releases with a yell, back arched obscenely like an actress in a porn film, and Rio can’t take her eyes away.</p><p>She feels around blindly with one hand, still staring at Agatha, and closes her fingers over the toy torturing Yelena. She’s as gentle as she can be, tugging the vibrator out of Yelena’s pussy and shutting it off.</p><p>Agatha’s still arched and shuddering, still with the cock buried inside her, still fucking majestic, and Yelena’s sobbing with relief.</p><p>Rio can’t do anything but watch. Until she can. She drops the paddle and swipes a finger through Yelena’s folds to get it wet, then slowly pushes between Agatha’s bruised ass cheeks and finds her hole, applying just enough pressure to sink in to the first knuckle. She’s rewarded with a yelp from Agatha, followed by a groan.</p><p>“Daddy,” Agatha chokes.</p><p>Rio’s clit is at attention. Even Yelena perks up a little.</p><p>“What you doing to her?” she asks thickly, picking up her head and trying to see. “I want to watch. Please? I was good, no?”</p><p>“You were good,” Rio says, stroking Yelena’s face with her free hand and leaning down to kiss her. “You want to see daddy’s fingers in her asshole, huh?”</p><p>Yelena’s eyelids flutter. “Yes please, daddy.”</p><p>Rio’s dom brain growls with satisfaction. She keeps the growl out of her voice. “Lift up and turn around, baby,” she tells Agatha.</p><p>“Yes daddy,” Agatha murmurs, pushing up onto her knees.</p><p>Rio helps her turn around and moves herself at the same time so she doesn’t have to take out her finger. “Down,” she says once Agatha’s facing away from Yelena.</p><p>“Yes daddy,” Agatha murmurs again, sinking onto the strap until it’s all the way in.</p><p>Yelena’s mouth opens, her eyes scanning Agatha’s backside. “You are so bruised,” she says in an awed whisper.</p><p>“I’m okay,” Agatha promises, bracing her hands on either side of Yelena’s knees and letting her head drop forward between her arms.</p><p>Rio eases in deeper, up to the second knuckle, and is rewarded with a low, keening groan. “That’s it, baby,” she croons. “Can you take two fingers for me?” She knows Agatha’s poor little ass is probably sore on the inside too, from yesterday. She doesn’t want to go too far… but she does want to go just far enough.</p><p>“I think so daddy,” Agatha pants, hair falling over her shoulders, brushing Yelena’s knees. “I want to.”</p><p>Rio leans over and kisses the small of her back. Slow, open mouthed, trailing her tongue in circles. “Mmm,” she says approvingly. “Such a good girl. You tell me if it’s too much, understand?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says, nodding. “Yes, I will.”</p><p>Yelena watches raptly as Rio probes her middle finger in alongside the first, slightly stretching Agatha’s muscles, massaging on the way in. It’s tight, but Agatha doesn’t tense or whimper. She just moans and tries to press backward but the dick in her pussy stops her. She’s angled in a way she can really only move up and down with any amount of ease.</p><p>“Don’t push back,” Rio warns. “Take what daddy gives you.”</p><p>Yelena’s wrists twitch above her head. Her eyes are wide, trained on Rio’s progress.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha says in a rush. “Please don’t stop, I’m sorry, it just feels so good…”</p><p>“I won’t stop,” Rio says smoothly. “You’re gonna let me guide you up and down, baby. You lie still and let me do the work for you.”</p><p>The sound that leaves Agatha is ethereal.</p><p>Rio pulls up with the fingers in Agatha’s asshole, then flips them over to push down, and Agatha’s muscles are slack, letting her lead, but her mouth is less than idle.</p><p>“Oh God, fuck, fuck, please, oh my God, that feels—I don’t—oh God.”</p><p>Rio laughs a little because she loves hearing Agatha so turned on she’s practically incoherent. “You like that, baby?” She does it again and Agatha’s muscles clench hard around her fingers.</p><p>Yelena jerks on her bonds again. “Please let me touch? Please please?”</p><p>“Not yet, honey, settle down,” Rio tells her. “I turned her around just so you can watch. I think you should be grateful, don’t you?”</p><p>Yelena bites her lip as she nods. “Yes sir,” she whispers, but Rio notices that she can’t seem to stop tugging on the ropes.</p><p>“Stop pulling,” she says, a stern edge to her voice to get Yelena’s attention. “Daddy doesn’t want you to hurt yourself.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Yelena says, thready and wispy, and relaxes her arms. “Sorry sir…”</p><p>Arousal rolls through Rio and she praises the compliance. “Good girl.”</p><p>Yelena’s eyes shimmer at the appellation, her mouth dropped slightly open. It’s different, seeing her friend like this. She hopes she’s giving Yelena a good enough experience – she thinks she is, judging by the reactions she’s getting, but she never wants to let herself become complacent.</p><p>Rio turns her focus back to Agatha, lifting her up, flipping her fingers and pressing her back down. Agatha goes easily, still breathing heavy and making needy noises, letting Rio slide her up and down the strap. Again. Again. Again.</p><p>Agatha arches and throws her head back, muscles tight, and begs. “Rio please, daddy, please, fuck, please let me come, it feels too good, I can’t—I can’t—I can’t—”</p><p>Rio drops her other hand to find Agatha’s clit, plucking at it a few times before pressing firmly with one fingertip, rubbing back and forth. “Go ahead, baby, I know you need it. Come for daddy, okay?” She purrs as Agatha starts to shake. “That’s it, good girl.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a sharp cry as she peaks, everything tensing for those few split seconds before she crashes down, shuddering through the aftershocks.</p><p>Rio stays buried for a few minutes, rubbing Agatha’s back and letting her breathing return to normal, dropping kisses to her shoulder and the back of her neck. She slowly eases out once Agatha’s calm. “I’ll be right back to help you off my dick, stay put,” she says, and slips out of the room to quickly wash her hands, returning in under a minute. “Lift up,” she says, placing her hands on Agatha’s hips to urge her off the strap.</p><p>Agatha groans when she’s finally empty, turns around, and lays on her stomach next to Yelena.</p><p>Rio pulls the hitch knot that’s keeping Yelena’s hands bound to the bed frame, then uncoils the rope until Yelena’s hands are free. She takes one in both of hers and rubs tenderly over the chafe marks on Yelena’s wrist. “Are you okay, honey?” she asks as she soothes the soreness.</p><p>Yelena’s eyes are half closed, but not in sleep. She’s in subspace. Rio has no way of knowing if Yelena has ever been in subspace before – or even subbed at all before. They didn’t exactly discuss it… things just sort of snowballed after Yelena called her daddy.</p><p>“I am okay, yes,” Yelena says, voice a little bit slow. “I am good. Thank you for check.”</p><p>Rio takes her other wrist and gives it the same gentle treatment, then lets Yelena have her hands back. “Is anything numb?”</p><p>“No sir.”</p><p>Fuck, if that doesn’t do something. “So polite,” she says, stroking Yelena’s cheek, watching her eyelids flutter.</p><p>When Agatha stirs a few minutes later, Rio squeezes herself between them, one arm under each girl’s neck, and tugs them close. They both rest their heads on her chest and she kisses the top of them.</p><p>“Have you had enough?” she asks.</p><p>They look at each other and a silent agreement passes between them, and Agatha looks up at Rio. “We want to touch you, daddy.”</p><p>Somehow Rio hadn’t expected that and her pulse jumps. “What? No no, it’s my job to take care of you, not the other way around.”</p><p>“You take very good care,” Yelena says, looking up at her now too. “We do not feel obligation. We <em>want</em> to touch you.”</p><p>“Please,” Agatha begs, and her eyes are so blue, her cheeks flushed, her expression so earnest, Rio can’t really find it within herself to say no.</p><p>So she sighs, and nods, and folds her hands behind her head.</p><p>Agatha looks surprised, but wastes absolutely no time moving down the bed and undoing Rio’s pants.</p><p>Yelena obviously can’t move around like that, so she stays draped along Rio’s side, snaking a hand under her sweater. Her hand is warm, her fingertips dancing across Rio’s flank, leaving contrails on her skin.</p><p>Agatha has her pants undone and is pulling them down, along with her underwear, and Rio does her best to help, lifting her hips at the right moment and settling again after. Cool air rushes between her legs at the loss of covering at the same time Yelena’s hand closes over one of her breasts, and she lets out a slow breath.</p><p>It’s hard to focus with two people touching her at the same time. She feels Agatha’s hands on her thighs, gripping them, just as Yelena’s fingertips draw together to pinch her nipple, and before she can fully react to that, Agatha’s mouth is on her cunt, hot and wet, taking no prisoners.</p><p>“Fuck,” she manages to say, chest rising toward Yelena’s hand, thighs opening further for Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>Agatha’s sucking and licking and pushing inside, teeth scraping her clit, frantic and messy and fucking delicious, and her hips start moving, seeking more, and Agatha gives it to her, pushing two fingers inside her and sucking rhythmically on her clit. Every suck pulls more and more waves of pleasure to the area and fuck, it feels so good, and then Yelena’s pinching her other nipple, lips on her neck, kissing, nipping, licking, and it’s so much.</p><p>“Daddy?” Yelena whispers into her ear, and it sends a sharp shiver down her spine, making her hips jerk.</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio pants, eyes closed, fast approaching the point of no return.</p><p>“You didn’t let me put my fingers in her asshole,” Yelena’s still whispering, lips on her ear. “Will you let me put them in yours?”</p><p>Agatha groans from between her legs. She must have heard the whisper.</p><p>Rio is ninety percent stone top. And she’s never let anyone touch her asshole. Now is not the time to explain to Yelena that if she decides to allow it, Agatha would get to be the first, so she offers a compromise instead. “No honey but you can put them in hers in a minute, okay?” And God, that sentence is almost impossible to get out coherently with Agatha’s relentless mouth devouring her cunt.</p><p>“Okay,” Yelena agrees, and she sounds happy enough that Rio doesn’t feel bad for saying no.</p><p>Agatha pushes her fingers in deeper and curls them up, then starts flicking her tongue rapid-fire back and forth with Rio’s clit trapped between her teeth, and that’s it, that’s the end. She grunts and clamps her thighs shut and comes impossibly hard, lightning frying her nerves, pleasure hot and hazy blooming outward from her cunt.</p><p>When she relaxes seconds later, she has to push Agatha’s head away because she’s had enough and Agatha’s not stopping.</p><p>Agatha whines but doesn’t fight the push, sliding her fingers out, and she’s about to suck them clean but stops, a sheepish expression falling over her face, and she offers them to Yelena instead.</p><p>“Yes?” Yelena asks, looking at her for permission, and Rio nods, arousal and affection both stirring at Agatha’s selflessness and at Yelena’s asking for permission.</p><p>Yelena holds Agatha by the wrist with both hands and sends her tongue out for a little taste, then another, another, and then she finally takes both fingers fully into her mouth, sucking them like a strap with a needy moan.</p><p>“I forgot how good you taste,” she husks when she’s finished.</p><p>Rio feels a flush heat her cheeks and she clears her throat. “Hand me my clothes, baby,” she says to Agatha.</p><p>Yelena pouts a little. “Was that not okay to say?”</p><p>“Huh?” Rio asks, and then realizes what she thinks. “Oh, no no, it’s fine, honey. Don’t worry.”</p><p>Agatha hands her her underwear and pants and looks at Yelena. “Daddy’s not the best at taking compliments,” she says, lightly chewing the least injured side of her lower lip.</p><p>Rio chuckles and pulls her clothes on, fixing up the button and zipper of her pants. Her entire body is humming with contentment; the afterglow of a good orgasm making her very relaxed. She settles again with her hands folded behind her head and looks at Agatha. “Lay on your stomach so Yelena can play with your asshole for a few minutes,” she says, nodding at the space next to her.</p><p>Agatha blushes to the roots of her hair but obediently lays on her stomach next to Rio.</p><p>Rio lays a hand on the back of Agatha’s head and lightly scratches at her scalp. “Good girl,” she says. “I’m proud of you.”</p><p>“Thank you daddy,” Agatha says, voice muffled by her elbow.</p><p>Yelena trails a fingernail in circles over Agatha’s spine, then spreads her hand out when she reaches the lumbar area, sliding lower to palm a bruised cheek.</p><p>Rio can see that she’s being gentle even though she’s squeezing, and Agatha’s small noise of pleasure confirms it.</p><p>“Are you sure is okay?” Yelena checks in, and Rio runs her fingers through Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“Is it okay, baby?” she asks.</p><p>“Yes sir,” Agatha says, adjusting her position so she can lay her head on her folded arms.</p><p>Rio fights down a shiver and just keeps petting Agatha’s hair.</p><p>Yelena gathers up some of her own slick on two fingers and rubs them together to make sure they’re coated, then slowly presses them into Agatha’s backside with a low groan.</p><p>Agatha shifts and closes her eyes, her mouth falling open, but she’s quiet. Relaxed.</p><p>“I like to put my fingers in assholes because they are so tight,” Yelena says. “I like the… pressure. And like how girls react.”</p><p>She does something that makes Agatha gasp, and Rio crosses her legs at the ankle, pressing her thighs together.</p><p>Yelena plays around for a few minutes, and Rio enjoys watching the myriad expressions that flit across her face as she explores, and then she carefully withdraws, dropping a kiss to Agatha’s shoulder blade. “Thank you for letting me,” she says, quiet and sincere.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Agatha says. “Thank you for asking if it was okay.”</p><p>“Do you want help to the bathroom?”</p><p>“No, I am fine.” She wipes her hand on the edge of the sheet. “She is very clean. I do not have a problem.”</p><p>Agatha hides her face in her elbow.</p><p>Rio snorts and swipes a hand over hers.</p><p>“What?” Yelena asks, eyes flicking back and forth between Rio and Agatha. “I did not mean to embarrass.”</p><p>“She’s just a little shy sometimes,” Rio says with a little laugh. “You didn’t do anything wrong, honey.”</p><p>Yelena relaxes and nods, settling down with an arm draped over Agatha’s back. “I need to get home soon. Can I leave my car until I am able to drive?”</p><p>“Yeah, of course,” Rio says. “What are you gonna do to get home? A cab would be so expensive.”</p><p>“I will take an Uber. I do all the time to go clubbing,” Yelena says with a shrug. “Could you bring me my phone please?”</p><p>“Are you okay if I go in the other room to get her phone, baby?” Rio asks Agatha in case she’s still coming out of subspace.</p><p>“Mmm, yes, thank you,” Agatha responds, taking her face out of her elbow.</p><p>Rio kisses the side of her head and slides off the bed to go find Yelena’s phone.</p><p>It takes her a minute, but she finds it half sticking out between the back of the sofa and one of the cushions. When she gets back to the bedroom, the girls are snuggled against each other, and they look so damn innocent and adorable it makes her teeth ache. She hands the phone to Yelena and climbs onto the bed on the other side of Agatha, spooning her from behind, draping an arm over both girls.</p><p>Yelena does something on her phone, presumably ordering an Uber, and sets it on the nightstand on that side of the bed. “They will be here probably a half hour,” she says. “I should get dressed.”</p><p>“In your uniform or those?” Rio asks, nodding toward the discarded sweat pants and sweatshirt on the bed and floor.</p><p>“Not my uniform,” Yelena says, pulling a face. “I cannot wear my dress uniform looking like this.”</p><p>“Yeah, I guess a General covered in bruises might raise some questions with the public,” Rio says, and she sits up. “Agatha, help her get dressed while I collect her uniform and put it in a bag for her.”</p><p>“Yes, Rio,” Agatha says, and when Rio gets out of bed, she follows suit.</p><p>“Good girl, thank you,” Rio says, and starts gathering up the strewn items belonging to Yelena’s dress uniform while Agatha picks up the sweat pants and helps Yelena into them.</p><p>--</p><p>Once Yelena’s dressed with her brace on, Rio hands her the crutches and she ambles out to the living room, sitting on the sofa to wait for her Uber.</p><p>Rio sits next to her with Agatha on her lap. “Are you sure you’re okay to leave so soon? We didn’t even debrief after that scene. Have you done that before?”</p><p>“I have not,” Yelena admits, head tilted. “But I enjoyed it, I am fine, and if anything comes up I promise I will contact. Does this work?”</p><p>Rio nods, and it makes her feel better that Yelena at least knows how to debrief from the dom side, so she understands the importance of processing a scene.</p><p>Yelena’s phone buzzes in her hand and she checks it, then pockets it in the sweat pants. “They are here,” she says, and picks up the crutches, awkwardly getting to her feet. “Thank you ladies for two unforgettable days,” she says, leaning down to kiss them each on the cheek.</p><p>She grabs the bag with her uniform in it on her way out the door, and when it shuts behind her, Rio nuzzles Agatha’s ear with her nose.</p><p>“How are you doing, baby? About everything?”</p><p>Agatha shifts to curl up like she usually does when they sit like this, resting her head between Rio’s neck and shoulder. “Emotionally, I’m exhausted, but in a very good way. I’m very happy with how things went.” She lifts her head up to press her forehead against Rio’s temple, breathing in slowly, breathing out soft. “Thank you for giving me yesterday. I love being good for you, but once in a while it’s really fun to fight back. And you were both so good at it, my God, I can’t even express. You’re so good to me, Rio.” She lays her head back down.</p><p>Rio listens, a calm falling over her to hear Agatha say out loud that she’s happy with everything. “You’re good to me too, baby,” she says, just in case there’s any doubt that she feels that way. “You’re so good.”</p><p>Agatha makes a quiet, content sound and curls up tighter. “Thank you for saying that.”</p><p>“I don’t just say it, I mean it,” Rio says seriously. “And I will keep saying it and meaning it until I erase all of your doubts. I couldn’t ask for a better submissive, Agatha. Or a better—a better anything.” She still doesn’t know how to label their relationship, but maybe they don’t need to. A label doesn’t actually change anything, after all.</p><p>Agatha starts tracing patterns on her arm over her sweater, and Rio lets the motions lull her further into calm.</p><p>“And physically, how are you doing?”</p><p>“My asshole is burning,” Agatha says with a groan. “The whole inside of my ass, actually. But that’s not a complaint, really. It’s kind of a dull, pleasant burn. It reminds me how much it’s gotten used over the past two days.”</p><p>Rio snorts at the last part and kisses the top of Agatha’s head. “Points for honesty. Do you like having your ass used that much?”</p><p>The patterns on her arm trail up to her neck so Agatha’s fingertip is brushing over bare skin. “I do,” she admits.</p><p>They sit in comfortable silence for a few minutes and Rio can tell Agatha is about to ask something before she opens her mouth, because her body language slightly tenses.</p><p>“You’re sure you aren’t upset that I wanted both of you to force me?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice is so small and uncertain it pricks at Rio’s heart. “I’m sure, baby,” she breathes. “I promise you, if I wasn’t okay with something, I wouldn’t do it. I promise you that. I would never let something happen and then be upset with you afterward. Never ever ever, okay?”</p><p>The tension eases out of Agatha’s body and she slumps against Rio, arms going around Rio’s neck. “Okay,” she whispers. “I just don’t ever want to do anything to mess this up. I’ve never been happy like this and I don’t want to lose it. I don’t want to lose you.”</p><p>“I’m not sure if you realize, but I don’t want to lose you either,” Rio says, her voice choking a little, thick with emotion. “I’m not usually miserable, but I haven’t been this happy with anyone else. I’m in it just as much as you are.”</p><p>Her heart pounds against her rib cage as Agatha clings to her. Maybe if she says it a thousand more times, Agatha will finally believe it.</p>

<p>Agatha goes home Monday night, and Rio already can’t wait to see her at work Tuesday morning.</p><p>Never mind that when she walks through the doors, she’s met with gasps and looks and ‘oh my God’ from every person that sees her.</p><p>She ignores that with forced smiles and goes to the break room for coffee, but the coffeemaker’s gone. She stares at the empty spot where it should be for a good two minutes and then goes to Agatha’s classroom.</p><p>Agatha’s alone in there, sitting at her desk looking fucking stunning, the bruises on her face different colors than last night, starting the healing process.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio says softly, and Agatha looks up, a smile lighting her face when she sees Rio.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio puts her hands in her pockets and wanders over to the desk. “So… I thought you said you weren’t going to perform any more tests to see whether I’ll keep my word?”</p><p>Agatha’s nose scrunches adorably. “I haven’t.”</p><p>“But then… where is the coffeemaker?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows shoot up. “I don’t know.”</p><p>Rio stares at her, because Agatha seems genuine. “You don’t?”</p><p>Agatha sits up straighter and Rio can sense her hackles rising. “If you don’t believe me, look around. It’s not in here.”</p><p>Rio resists the urge to go around the desk and physically comfort her. “I believe you,” she promises. “I’ll always believe you. I don’t need to look around.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands relax where they’d been clutching the edge of her desk. “Okay,” she says with a terse nod.</p><p>She’s still upset Rio came to ask if she’d taken it, that much is obvious, but she’s not as upset as she was about to be if Rio didn’t believe her answer.</p><p>One of the aides comes shuffling into the room and Rio starts talking as if they were mid conversation. “And he wanted me to ask you how many of your students might be interested if he booked a Santa Claus for an assembly,” she pulls out of her ass.</p><p>She sees the twitch of Agatha’s eye but nothing else shows on her face. “All of them,” Agatha says, tilting her head. “We always try to bring every student to everything. If it doesn’t work out, we bring them back to the classroom.” She folds her hands in her lap. “He should know that.”</p><p>“Don’t shoot the messenger,” Rio says with a little smirk. “Maybe he thinks Santa Claus would scare your younger students. He’s sending me to the kindergarten and first grade general ed classrooms as well. It’s not an autistic thing, it’s an age thing. He also wants me to find out who doesn’t celebrate Christmas and what they do celebrate so he can book other holiday figureheads.” She hopes that sounds reasonable because she has no idea what she’s doing.</p><p>Agatha’s clearly not going to make this easy for her. “The younger students are usually the most enthusiastic about Santa Claus. He should be sending you to the fifth and sixth grade classrooms.”</p><p>Rio crosses her arms and purses her lips. “I’ll give him the message.”</p><p>“You do that.”</p><p>She turns to leave and pretends to notice the aide for the first time. “Good morning,” she says with a wave on her way out the door. She doesn’t know the woman’s name but figures now is not the time for random introductions.</p><p>As the door is closing behind her she hears the woman say “You are so into her” and Agatha say “shut up”. And then she hears a screeched “what the fuck happened to your face? And your throat?” And then she’s too far away to hear Agatha’s response but she doesn’t have time to double back because the students are due any minute.</p><p>Her phone buzzes, though, and she’s almost afraid to look at it.</p><p><em>Nice save, Rio. Really. She believed every word.</em></p><p>Rio growls.</p><p><em>Maybe she would have if you didn’t look so ‘into me’…</em></p><p>Three dots blink on the screen.</p><p><em>You heard that, huh? </em><em>😉</em></p><p><em>What did you tell her happened to your face? So I know how to handle it if anyone asks me?</em></p><p><em>I told her the truth.</em></p><p>Rio’s stomach twists.</p><p><em>Fffff you what? You didn’t actually, did you?</em></p><p>There is no way Agatha is serious about that. Even though the mere possibility that she might be is making Rio uncomfortably turned on. But no… right? There’s no way.</p><p><em>She won’t say anything.</em></p><p>Rio rushes to her desk to sit down before she falls over.</p><p><em>OMG</em></p><p><em>Are you upset? Should I have lied?</em></p><p>She’s wheezing. And the kids are starting to come in.</p><p><em>No! I’m not upset, I’m turned on, which is worse.</em></p><p>Agatha just sends back a smiling purple devil emoji and Rio puts her phone away.</p><p>--</p><p>On her lunch she finds out that one of the second grade teachers broke the coffeemaker and that’s why it’s missing. There’s a note on the bulletin board in the break room asking for people to pitch in for a new one and a basket for cash on the table. She puts in five bucks and texts Agatha.</p><p><em>Kaufman broke the coffeemaker.</em></p><p><em>Let’s kill her.</em></p><p><em>Hilarious. Come over tonight? I want to discuss something.</em></p><p><em>What did I do?</em></p><p>Rio’s heart pings.</p><p><em>Nothing baby. It’s nothing bad. Just something I want to run by you and see what you think.</em></p><p>God, will Agatha ever stop assuming she’s done something wrong? It’s heartbreaking.</p><p><em>Okay. Meet in your classroom after the kids leave?</em></p><p><em>Perfect. See you then.</em></p><p>--</p><p>Rio looks up when she sees movement in her peripheral, and Agatha leans on the door frame. “Ready?”</p><p>Rio looks her over, biting the inside of her cheek. “Mmm. Yeah,” she finally answers, closing her computer and standing up with a stretch.</p><p>“Can I get a hint about the conversation?” Agatha asks, her hands betraying her nerves by the way she’s picking at a button on her jacket.</p><p>“As soon as we’re in the car, I promise,” Rio says, resisting the urge to touch her in some way. But there’s cameras everywhere in the building except the bathrooms.</p><p>Rio’s step falters when she sees Agatha’s car in the teacher’s lot, where it’s supposed to be. That simple act hits so hard it leaves her winded.</p><p>Once they’re in Rio’s car with the doors shut, she keeps her promise. “It’s about strap sucking.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw drops. “Because I gagged?”</p><p>Rio chuckles, mischief taking hold. “Mhmm.”</p><p>Agatha squirms in her seat. “But you said I didn’t do anything wrong,” she nearly whines.</p><p>“Baby, you didn’t,” Rio rushes to assure her, reaching across to stroke her blushing cheek.</p><p>Agatha leans into the touch. “But something I did made you want to have a discussion about it. That feels like I displeased you.”</p><p>“Not at all,” Rio says. “A discussion about something I’d like to try. Not a scolding.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha breathes, finally relaxing. “Okay. Thank you. I mean—I’m glad I didn’t displease you.”</p><p>“I told you you would always know if you were waiting to answer for something, and I really meant it,” Rio says, leaning over for a gentle kiss, mindful of their healing mouths. “You never have to wonder with me. And if I ever tell you I want to discuss something, it means I want your feedback about something. Not that you’ve displeased me. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha crawls across the console to squeeze herself onto Rio’s lap. It’s not an easy feat with the steering wheel digging into her back, Rio’s sure.</p><p>She doesn’t think they’re leaving the parking lot any time soon so she reaches down and pulls the lever to slide the seat back, making more room for Agatha to be where she wants to be. “Hi, baby,” she murmurs.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha says, curling up more comfortably.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>“Yes, it’s just… this is stupid, but talking to you this morning and not being able to touch you just made me want this all day.”</p><p>Rio presses her lips to the top of Agatha’s head and keeps them there for a few seconds, then turns her head so her cheek is resting there instead. “It’s not stupid, Agatha,” she says. “Nothing you feel could ever be stupid.”</p><p>“Thank you for saying that,” Agatha mumbles.</p><p>“I mean it,” Rio says, and movement in the rearview catches her eye. “Shit, someone’s coming.”</p><p>There’s not enough time for Agatha to get back to her own seat and Rio’s about to panic but Agatha pushes up to her hands and knees so she’s straddling Rio’s lap instead of being snuggled in it.</p><p>Rio figures that getting caught making out would be preferable to getting caught in a vulnerable position, so she follows Agatha’s lead and just lays there.</p><p>Agatha picks her head up to look out the back windshield and her body instantly relaxes, folding back into Rio’s lap. “It’s just Alice,” she says.</p><p>“Who’s Alice?” Rio’s on an emotional roller coaster at the moment, not sure if they’re at the top of a hill or the end of the ride.</p><p>“The aide you didn’t fool this morning.”</p><p>“Oh. And you don’t care if she sees you like this?”</p><p>“She won’t say anything.”</p><p>“That’s what you said before. How do you know? You must really trust her. I thought you hated everyone at the school.”</p><p>“I don’t <em>hate</em> anyone,” Agatha says. “But I get along with the aides in my class. We work closely all day and have to have each other’s backs during behaviors, so… we get along.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean to offend you,” Rio says softly, alerted to the problem by Agatha’s bristly tone. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“No, it’s not—I’m not offended, I just… I don’t hate everyone. Or anyone. And I don’t want you to think that I do. I don’t want you to think badly of me.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t think badly of you even if you did hate everyone,” Rio says. “You can hate whoever you want to hate. As long as it’s not me, I’m along for the ride.”</p><p>She’s teasing, but Agatha grips her so tight at the suggestion that she quickly cancels it.</p><p>“Hey hey, I was teasing, I know you don’t hate me honey,” she says, soothing Agatha’s anxiety with a hand stroking her hair. “It’s okay. Everything is okay. You’re okay.”</p><p>“I could never hate you,” Agatha breathes. “Ever.”</p><p>“I know. I know,” Rio promises. “You’re such a good girl.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath catches and a quiet moan filters out. “Thank you, Rio.”</p><p>“Are you ready to go?”</p><p>“Can you drive like this?”</p><p>Rio’s about to laugh when she realizes Agatha’s serious. So she tamps down her amusement and lets her down easy. “I wish I could, baby, but no, I can’t.”</p><p>“If you had a truck I could lay with my head in your lap while you drive,” Agatha says with a sigh, crawling back to her own seat and buckling her seatbelt.</p><p>“Noted,” Rio acknowledges, starting the car and adjusting her seat back to optimal driving distance from the steering wheel. “You can hold my shirt or put your hand on my leg, though.” She glances backward to gauge her surroundings before pulling out of the parking spot in reverse.</p><p>Agatha reaches for her shirt and curls a fist around it.</p><p>Rio will never get tired of the way it feels for Agatha to seek her proximity. Her touch. Her comfort. And most of all, her reassurance. Making Agatha feel safe and cared for is the most amazing reward she’s ever experienced.</p><p>--</p><p>As soon as they’re in the house, Agatha pulls Rio by the hand to the sofa and waits for her to sit, then climbs on her lap and curls up.</p><p>The sigh of relief that leaves Agatha’s mouth makes Rio feel conflicted. She’s so grateful that sitting with her like this brings Agatha that kind of relief, but there’s a little part of her that aches because it means Agatha’s had to wait all day to be able to relax.</p><p>“Have you been stressed all day?” she asks, lightly drawing patterns on Agatha’s back with one fingertip.</p><p>“Just a little on edge,” Agatha says quietly. “I’m not used to being that close without being able to touch you. We don’t talk that often at work.”</p><p>“Would it be easier for you if I tried to stay away during the work day?”</p><p>“Easier, maybe, but it’s not what I want.”</p><p>Rio nods and kisses her head. “So… business as usual, then. If we have a valid reason to talk, don’t stay away.”</p><p>Agatha squirms on her lap but nods.</p><p>“Let me know when you’re ready to talk. We can just sit like this as long as you want.”</p><p>Agatha hums her appreciation against Rio’s neck. “I’m ready to talk now if I can stay like this.”</p><p>“Absolutely. I wasn’t sure if you wanted some quiet time first.”</p><p>“No. I like the sound of your voice.”</p><p>“You’re the sweetest girl,” Rio says at that, her brain melting a little.</p><p>Agatha shivers in her arms, breath warm on her neck. “Thank you, Rio,” she says.</p><p>“Mm. Thank you for being so sweet. So, about the strap sucking… I noticed that when you gagged, you still didn’t try to fight my hold. You just let yourself gag until I pulled you off the dick.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath comes faster against her neck.</p><p>“Is taking my whole dick in your mouth something you’d be interested in working up to?”</p><p>Agatha’s entire body goes rigid for a second and then she goes slack with a curse. “<em>Fuck</em>.”</p><p>Rio thinks that’s a positive reaction but she knows better than to assume anything. “Is that a yes, baby?” she asks seriously.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha croaks.</p><p>“You’re gonna look so pretty on your knees with your throat full of my cock,” Rio says, running her fingers through Agatha’s hair and squeezing a handful at the nape of her neck.</p><p>“Oh God,” Agatha says, and she’s shaking. “Please, Rio. Can we start now?”</p><p>“So eager,” Rio purrs. “I like that. Take off your jacket, you’re gonna sweat.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes rock back, lids half shut, hands immediately opening the buttons of her jacket, and she shrugs it off her shoulders, letting it fall to the floor.</p><p>Rio loves how blown her pupils are already. “Down,” she says, snapping toward the carpet, and Agatha backs off of her lap to kneel on the floor. “Stay.”</p><p>She goes to the bedroom to choose a good dildo for Agatha to start with, and after looking through her drawer she comes up with a moderately thick one about five inches long. Once she can handle five, Rio has plenty more to graduate her with.</p><p>She sheds her slacks and puts a harness on over her underwear, secures the dildo in place, and returns to the living room.</p><p>Agatha, good girl that she is, hasn’t moved, and doesn’t turn her head to watch Rio’s approach, either.</p><p>Rio feels a swell of pride and stops behind her, letting the tip of the cock press between her shoulder blades as she tugs on a handful of hair at the crown of Agatha’s head. “Good girl,” she says, and drops her mouth to lick Agatha’s cheek with the flat of her tongue.</p><p>Agatha whimpers. It’s a tiny, pleading sound, barely reaching Rio’s ears, but it may as well be war drums for the effect it has on her. She fights off a shudder and strokes through Agatha’s hair instead of pulling it.</p><p>“You’re allowed to move,” she says. “But you need to relax. I’m going to guide you through this, and all you have to do is listen to me, focus on my voice, and do what I tell you.”</p><p>“Yes, Rio.”</p><p>“What is your safeword?”</p><p>“Witch killer.”</p><p>“If you can’t talk and you need to safeword, put both of your hands on my hips and push me away. Is that clear? Repeat it back if you understand.”</p><p>“If I can’t talk and I need to safeword, I will place both of my hands on your hips and push you away,” Agatha says, voice raspy and quiet, but sure.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio says. “Are you ready to make me proud?”</p><p>Agatha outright moans at that. “<em>Yes</em>, Rio, <em>please</em>.”</p><p>Rio finally steps around in front of her, and Agatha’s bright blue eyes are instantly drawn to her cock, jutting out from her hips at a slight angle. Before she’s even fully in place Agatha grabs the base with one hand and licks the tip.</p><p>Rio feels it like it’s really hers. Right in the cunt. Like Agatha’s tongue is swirling over her clit instead of clear silicone. “Easy,” she says, getting her balance, planting her feet securely, putting a guiding hand on the top of Agatha’s head.</p><p>Agatha slows a little, but not much. She laves the shaft with her tongue, then slurps the head into her mouth and sucks.</p><p>“There you go,” Rio encourages her. “One inch at a time, baby. Take it slow. We have all night.”</p><p>Agatha listens, but Rio can tell it takes effort. She slowly moves her mouth along, stopping halfway up to suck a little more.</p><p>“That’s it, pretty girl, let me see you swallow…”</p><p>Agatha makes a gurgling sound and puts on a dazzling display of throat muscles constricting as she swallows.</p><p>Rio watches with rapt attention, following the trail downward, imagining Agatha’s swallowing her come. She’s so wet Agatha has to be able to smell her. “Can you smell how excited you make me, baby?” she asks, scratching lightly at Agatha’s scalp.</p><p>Agatha’s head bobs and her nostrils flare, and she takes another inch.</p><p>Rio quiets and lets her focus.</p><p>Agatha pushes forward until there’s barely an inch left, maybe half, and her eyes water as she fights her gag reflex, losing the battle quickly.</p><p>Rio lets her choke for a few seconds and then pulls back, emptying her mouth and wiping the drool from the corner of it with her thumb.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything, just kneels there catching her breath, and after a few deep inhales and forced exhales, she reaches for the dick again.</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow but lets her do what she wants, and Agatha’s instantly four inches deep again, pushing until she gags and splutters and Rio pulls back.</p><p>“That’s enough, baby, that’s a good first try,” she says, expecting Agatha to bend to the praise, but Agatha’s brows draw down into a furrow.</p><p>“I want to try again.”</p><p>Rio blinks. “It’s not magic, honey. It takes time.”</p><p>“No, it takes practice, not time,” Agatha argues. “You’re being too nice.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw drops. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Agatha shrinks a little, looking sheepish. “I didn’t mean—I’m sorry,” she says, tilting her head down in deference. “But I can do more. I want to do more. I want to try again. Please?”</p><p>“You want to try one more time?” Rio asks.</p><p>“No, I want to try until I can take it all. You said we have all night. Give me back your dick.”</p><p>Rio slaps her hard enough to sprawl her on the carpet.</p><p>Agatha bursts into tears and Rio is stunned speechless for a second until she realizes why, and a thousand pounds of guilt crashes down on her, suffocating her beneath its crushing weight. She drops to the floor and pulls Agatha into her arms. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” she says, over and over again. “I forgot. I forgot. I forgot, baby, I’m so sorry…”</p><p>Agatha cries into her chest and she cries into Agatha’s hair. How could she be so careless? It’s not like the injuries to Agatha’s face are invisible. She can see them perfectly fine, so what in the hell is wrong with her?</p><p>“Can you forgive me?” she asks, afraid of the answer, but Agatha nods against her chest.</p><p>“If—if you let me keep—keep trying until I can t—take your whole cock,” she stutters.</p><p>Rio laughs. Because what in the actual fuck. “Agatha Harkness,” she scolds, but it’s loving and playful.</p><p>“I promise I won’t break from a little gagging,” Agatha murmurs when she’s stopped crying. “Please?”</p><p>Rio’s not going to deny her, she already knows this. “Yeah, okay,” she sighs. “Then you’ll forgive me?”</p><p>“I already have,” Agatha says, pressing a kiss to her collarbone. “But you didn’t need forgiven. I know you didn’t do it on purpose. I—I mean you slapped me on purpose, but you wouldn’t have if you remembered I was already hurt.”</p><p>“No, I wouldn’t have,” Rio agrees. “I just… I can see the bruises on your face, so why didn’t they register?”</p><p>“Because I was being a brat,” Agatha admits, hiding her face. “I’m sorry, Rio.”</p><p>“Forgiven,” Rio says. “Now… back on your knees?”</p><p>“Yes, please and thank you,” Agatha says, kissing Rio’s collarbone again and crawling back to her previous spot, rising up to her knees.</p><p>Rio wipes her eyes with the heels of her hands and gets up, taking her place in front of Agatha, hand resting idly on her head. She resolves to be less careful with Agatha during this activity, as requested.</p><p>So this time, when Agatha starts to gag, Rio grips her hair and slowly bucks her hips until her cock is enveloped completely by Agatha’s mouth and throat.</p><p>Agatha whines and squirms, but not away. She doesn’t try to come off the dick. She’s squirming because she doesn’t know what else to do, that much is obvious. So Rio talks her through it, like she said she would.</p><p>“Close your eyes. Focus all your attention on the muscles pushing against my dick that are trying to get it out of your throat, baby.”</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes.</p><p>“Shut them down, one by one.”</p><p>Agatha’s still gagging pretty violently, and having trouble breathing, so Rio’s going to have to call it in a minute and let her recover before trying again.</p><p>Agatha’s shaking so hard Rio can feel the base of the strap moving.</p><p>She lasts as long as she possibly can before drawing her hips back, and the strangled, despairing sound Agatha makes is simultaneously the saddest and hottest thing Rio has ever heard.</p><p>“I’ll let you try again,” she gasps, clenching her thighs. “I promise, baby. Just breathe.”</p><p>Agatha falls forward onto her hands, coughing. Rio rubs her back until she stops.</p><p>“What did you mean, shut them down one by one?” she asks, and her voice is so hoarse she sounds like she’s come down with something.</p><p>“I’ll show you. Hold out your hand, palm toward the floor.”</p><p>Agatha holds out a shaking hand. Rio puts her own under Agatha’s wrist to support her.</p><p>“Pick one finger and relax just that one. Don’t use the muscles to curl it, just relax it and let it fall on its own.” When Agatha’s pointer finger dips slightly, Rio nods toward it. “That’s what I mean. Isolate each muscle in your mind and consciously relax it. It may not work, it’s just an idea.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha says. “I’m ready.” Her eyes are shining with determination as she gets back up on her knees.</p><p>Rio straightens and steps to her, and she’s never seen someone so laser focused on a job in her life. Agatha opens her mouth and swallows four inches off the bat – Rio’s quickly learned that’s her comfort zone. “Mm,” she hums, laying a hand on Agatha’s head.</p><p>Agatha looks up at her this time as she eases forward, and the eye contact is smoldering for two point five seconds before she starts choking and her eyes slam shut.</p><p>She’s all the way on the strap now, nose bumping Rio’s clit, and Rio can see her trying so hard to suppress the reflex to expel the foreign object, and then suddenly she stops gagging and her eyes fly open in surprise.</p><p>Rio’s face splits in the goofiest grin, she’s sure. She doesn’t even know what to say, it’s so sudden, so she just strokes Agatha’s hair and goes on instinct. “Good girl, baby, I’m so proud. Look at you, taking my entire cock, princess.”</p><p>Agatha groans and her eyes darken, her hands coming up to grab the waistband of Rio’s underwear.</p><p>“Oh, you like that, huh?” Rio teases with a low chuckle.</p><p>Agatha comes off the dick just long enough to rasp “yes sir” before putting it back in. She gags for a second when it first hits her throat, but she’s able to overcome five inches now, and she hollows her cheeks as she sucks.</p><p>Rio feels the pull, and the heat of Agatha’s words and her raspy voice. She’s so fucking wet and throbbing by now that it’s hard to hold her hips still. “Can daddy fuck your throat, princess?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes roll back, lids fluttering, nails digging into Rio’s skin as she shudders, and Rio’s going to ask her later if she just came, but right now, she’s going to take what she wants; what Agatha always gives her.</p><p>“Do you remember how to safeword?”</p><p>Agatha nods and demonstrates by uncurling her fingers so her hands are flat on Rio’s hips, then curls them back into the waistband of her underwear.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio croons, slowly fisting a chunk of hair until she has a tight enough hold to keep Agatha’s head still. “You’re making daddy so proud.”</p><p>Agatha whimpers and waits for Rio to start moving.</p><p>So she does. She draws her hips back a fraction of an inch to start, then eases forward until the cock disappears again.</p><p>Agatha gurgles but doesn’t gag. Rio’s stomach clenches, pulsing more sticky wet heat between her legs, and does it again.</p><p>Agatha takes it like a seasoned strap sucker even though this is technically her first time. The brief moment Rio forced her head down the other night didn’t really count.</p><p>“Your first time really sucking daddy’s dick and you’re taking the whole thing,” she praises, squeezing Agatha’s hair and using her other hand to trail her fingernails back and forth over Agatha’s shoulder as she pulls back a little more, then eases forward. The sight of her strap in Agatha’s mouth is so fucking hot she feels unhinged. She works up to a rhythm of in and out that Agatha can take, and the way Agatha’s nose bumps her clit with every thrust is going to have her coming sooner than she likes. She can already feel the storm building. Her legs are shaking. Her jaw is clenched. A few more thrusts and she’s right, she explodes.</p><p>With a yell.</p><p>And a yank on Agatha’s hair.</p><p>Her legs don’t hold her up through it and she ends up on her knees, and Agatha mewls violently as the strap is ripped from her without warning.</p><p>“Daddy,” she complains, sand on gravel.</p><p>Rio grabs her and pulls her close, then lays down holding her. “You made daddy come, princess,” she soothes. “Such a good girl, I’m so proud of you.”</p><p>Agatha stops whining at that and throws an arm and a leg across Rio. “You are?”</p><p>God, the quality of her voice does something to Rio, right down to her core, down to a cellular level. “So fucking proud,” she swears, brushing sweaty hair back from Agatha’s face. “God, you’re beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha’s features soften and Rio can see her headspace change. “So are you,” she whispers. “I will never get tired of looking at you.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks heat up and she fights the urge to look away, because what Agatha told Yelena was correct – she’s not great at taking compliments.</p><p>“I know daddy Rio is proud of princess Agatha, but are you proud of me?” Agatha asks after a minute, and the vulnerability in her expression twists around Rio’s heart like snaking vines and squeezes.</p><p>“I am,” Rio says seriously. “I’m so proud of you, baby. You did amazing.”</p><p>Agatha glows a little, the vulnerability fading, and Rio never wants to get up off this carpet.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha stays the night, curled up against her in bed, and when the alarm wakes her in the morning, Rio groans and shuts it off.</p><p>Agatha’s still out like a light, and Rio smiles at her sleeping little self, so peaceful and adorable and clingy. She hates having to disturb that peace. “Baby,” she murmurs, kissing Agatha’s forehead.</p><p>Agatha whines and hugs her tighter.</p><p>“I know,” Rio says, kissing her forehead again. “But I thought you might want to shower with me before I take you to your car. I set the alarm a little early just in case.”</p><p>Agatha still clearly does not want to be disturbed, but she eventually nods. “That sounds nice.”</p><p>“We might even have time to get some breakfast on the way if you want.”</p><p>“McDonald’s?” Agatha asks, biting her lip.</p><p>“Is that your guilty pleasure?” Rio asks with a grin, and Agatha nods wordlessly. “Sure, we can get McDonald’s.”</p><p>Agatha’s much more awake after that, buzzing with excitement as she hops out of bed and heads for the bathroom. She’s already naked and with the water on by the time Rio follows, but she hasn’t gotten into the shower, she’s standing there waiting.</p><p>“You can get in, baby, but thank you for waiting,” she says, starting to get herself naked as well.</p><p>Agatha climbs in and turns her back to the spray, tilting her head to wet her wild, gorgeous hair. Rio joins her a few seconds later, moaning softly as the hot water warms her chilled skin. She hugs Agatha from behind and rests her chin on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“Would you like me to wash you?”</p><p>Agatha leans her head back onto Rio’s shoulder to look at her. “I would love that,” she whispers. “Thank you.”</p><p>--</p><p>Rio brings Agatha to her car with enough time for her to go home and get ready for work. “Hey. I noticed last night that you parked in this lot,” she says, reaching over to stroke Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>Agatha leans into the touch and purrs. “I did,” she says softly.</p><p>Rio turns her hand and strokes with her knuckles, looking into Agatha’s eyes. “I’m proud of you for that,” she says, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>Agatha flushes a little and ducks her head. “Riooooo,” she whines.</p><p>Rio can’t help laughing. “What?”</p><p>“It just seems like something silly to be proud of me for when I should’ve been doing it all along.”</p><p>“But you haven’t been doing it all along, it’s not something you want to do, but you did it anyway, so I’m proud of you. You’ll just have to deal with that,” Rio says, highly amused.</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Do you want to get your pretty face slapped?” Rio interrupts. “Who decides what I can and cannot be proud of you for?”</p><p>Agatha’s lower lip slides out and she looks at Rio pitifully. “You do,” she finally admits, grumpy. “It’s just hard sometimes,” she adds, and she is still one hundred percent whining.</p><p>“Get used to it, baby,” Rio says, tapping her on the nose. “You’d better go if you want time to change.”</p><p>Agatha leans over the console to lay her palm flat on Rio’s chest, stealing a chaste kiss before she whispers, “I love you.”</p><p>Rio’s heart flutters and she puts her hand over Agatha’s. “I love you too.”</p><p>--</p><p>At lunch, Rio’s world comes crashing down around her. She gets a text from Agatha that stops her breathing.</p><p><em>Rio, I’m so so sorry, and this is not what I want at all, but something happened and I can’t see you anymore. Please believe me, it’s not what I want. I don’t have a choice.</em></p><p>Rio drops the phone, her eyes already filled with tears by the time she leans over to pick it up, and she’s sick to her stomach, a hollow feeling echoing in her chest.</p><p><em>I’m going to need you to say that to my face.</em></p><p>Her hands are shaking as she waits for Agatha to respond.</p><p><em>I can’t, Rio, I can’t. I can’t look at you and say it, but it has to be this way. Please don’t make it harder.</em></p><p>Please don’t make it harder? Rio chokes out a sob, glad she chose to eat lunch in her classroom instead of the break room today, and throws her food in the trash. This can’t be happening. It really can’t be happening.</p><p>If it’s not what Agatha wants, then what in the hell would make her do this?</p><p>There’s no way she can focus on teaching for the rest of the day so she stops by the office to tell the secretary she’s going home sick, goes home, gets in bed, and cries herself to sleep.</p><p>--</p><p>She calls off the next day too, unable to face reality, but everything in her house reminds her of Agatha – the sofa, where they always sit with Agatha curled in her lap. The carpet, where Agatha kneels for her. The bed, where they’ve shared so many different types of intimacy. It’s torture and she can’t get away from it, so she texts Yelena that she’s coming over and makes the two-hour drive, falling apart as soon as she gets inside.</p><p>Yelena holds her and whispers things in Russian that she doesn’t understand, but somehow that’s more soothing than any decipherable language would be.</p><p>She cries her eyes out in her friend’s arms, and when she’s spent all the tears she possesses, she croaks out, “why would she do this if it’s not what she wants?”</p><p>Yelena purses her lips, still stroking Rio’s hair. “Off the top of my head, blackmail.”</p><p>Rio peers up at her. “Can you use your super secret military connections to find out for me?”</p><p>Yelena laughs. “That would be misappropriation of government resources and I would be court martialed. But you do not need my military connections for this, my friend. You already told me her mother is controlling bitch, yes? I think that is where you will find the blackmail come from.”</p><p>“Why won’t Agatha just stand up to that cunt?” Rio laments, scrubbing her hands over her face.</p><p>“Family dynamics can be much more complicated than this.”</p><p>“No, they’re not,” Rio says. “I don’t care if someone’s a fucking conjoined twin. Family or not, you don’t let someone control your life.”</p><p>“It is not so simple.”</p><p>“Yeah, it is.”</p><p>“I do not want to argue with you, другa. You are hurt, and angry. What you feel is okay.”</p><p>Rio didn’t think she had any tears left, but she starts to cry again. The sense of loss is so profound, there’s not one place in her mind or body untouched by grief.</p><p>How is she supposed to do <em>anything</em> when the other half of her soul is missing? How can she go back to work? She can’t afford to miss any more, but she has no idea how she’ll get through the day tomorrow, having to teach. Talk to people. Pretend to be okay when she’s so far from it she can barely breathe.</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha’s car is in the teacher’s lot, and the sense of pride it had brought before is gone, replaced by a sense of melancholy, because why is Agatha still following the rules when she’s broken things off?</p><p>Rio goes straight to her classroom and shuts the door, sunglasses hiding the bags under her eyes, because she’s barely slept. Barely eaten. Had to force herself into the shower this morning because she didn’t want to do that either.</p><p>Mrs. Antonelli comes rushing in and shuts the door behind her. “Thank God you’re back. I don’t know what happened with you and Harkness, but please fix it.”</p><p>Rio stares in shock for a split second and then bursts into tears.</p><p>The other teacher’s eyes go wide and she hurries around the desk, giving Rio a hug. “Oh dear, I’m sorry,” she says. “I didn’t—”</p><p>“You can’t say anything,” Rio sobs. “Please!”</p><p>“I won’t, I promise, dear,” Mrs. Antonelli says, stepping back, looking flustered.</p><p>Rio sinks into her chair and buries her face in her hands, and only looks up when her space is invaded for a second time a few minutes later.</p><p>This time it’s Alice, the aide from Agatha’s class she’d not-exactly-met the other morning. “I’m Alice,” she says, waving awkwardly.</p><p>“I know,” Rio says, sniffling and reaching under her sunglasses to wipe her eyes. “What can I do for you?”</p><p>“Agatha would kill me if she knew I was telling you, but the reason she broke it off has something to do with her mother. She came into the classroom right before lunch the other day, and I couldn’t hear what they were saying from across the room but they were obviously arguing. Evanora left looking satisfied, so I gather she got what she wanted, which was Agatha breaking things off with you.”</p><p>“Why are you telling me?” Rio’s heart already hurt so badly, and this information isn’t making it any better.</p><p>“Because I’ve worked with Agatha for five years, and up until that day I’d never seen her cry.”</p><p>Rio’s breath catches. “She cried?”</p><p>“In front of all of us. I don’t think she could help it. She’s never excused herself from class in the middle of the day either, but she left and didn’t come back until yesterday. And yesterday was brutal.”</p><p>“What’s she been doing?” Rio asks despite herself. “One of the other teachers came in before you and asked me to fix things.”</p><p>“She was on a rampage the entire day. We usually get along in the classroom, but even we weren’t safe yesterday. She’s been sneering and growling and saying the most hurtful things to everyone… worse than she was before you got involved in the first place.”</p><p>Rio can’t imagine much worse than that. “What am I supposed to do about it? She won’t talk to me.”</p><p>“She wouldn’t talk to you before and you didn’t let that stop you. You’ve got ten minutes before the kids start arriving. Don’t take no for an answer. Make her tell you the truth.”</p><p>Rio feels the first flicker of hope she’s felt since the moment Agatha texted her. “Right,” she says, bolstering her courage with a nod. “Yes. Of course. I’ll do that.” She’s almost out the door when she turns back to say thank you, then walks as quickly as she can to Agatha’s classroom because she’s not going to outright run. Not on camera anyway.</p><p>She pushes through the door of Agatha’s classroom, but it’s empty. At least on the surface it seems empty. She doesn’t see Agatha anywhere. But she can hear movement, and tracks the source of it until she rounds Agatha’s desk and sees her sitting under it, knees pulled up to her chest.</p><p>“Get out from there,” she says, incredulous. It should make her feel better to know that Agatha’s as tormented about things as she is, but it doesn’t.</p><p>Agatha shrieks and jumps and quickly scrambles out from under the desk, rising to her full height and pinning Rio with what she thinks is meant to be an intimidating stare, but it crumbles quickly and Agatha’s got tears streaming down her face.</p><p>“Tell me the truth,” Rio demands. “I deserve that much. What does your mother have on you? She’s the reason you broke things off, I know that for a fact, I just don’t know why, and I don’t know why you’d let her.”</p><p>“She made threats,” Agatha says weakly.</p><p>“So fucking what? Why won’t you stand up to her? You stand up to everyone else, why not her? She threatened you. Big deal. What—”</p><p>“She didn’t threaten me, she threatened you!” Agatha wails.</p><p>Rio’s tirade comes to a skidding halt as she tries to process the new information.</p><p>“She said she’d have you fired and have complaints put on your record so no school district in the state would hire you!”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says, grabbing her by the biceps, “so I’ll work at a private school. Who cares?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha drops to her knees.</p><p>“Honey, get up,” Rio says, flashbacks from Vandam’s leather assaulting her full force, only this is their place of work, the one place Agatha had specifically named as being off limits to their D/s dynamic. “Get up baby, please get up. Anyone could walk in.”</p><p>Agatha ignores the pleading note in her voice and grabs the front of Rio’s pants, curling her fingers into the waistband. “You’d work at another school? You wouldn’t care?”</p><p>“Of course I wouldn’t care,” Rio says, unable to believe the turn this conversation has taken. “Agatha, please get up baby.” She’s looking between the door and Agatha every two seconds, praying no one comes in early.</p><p>Agatha still shows no signs of getting off her knees so Rio takes drastic measures, stepping out of reach and hardening her voice.</p><p>“Stand up. Now.”</p><p>Agatha whimpers and tries to keep hold of her pants, and at Rio’s harsh words she finally gets up, and Rio doesn’t think she’s ever been more relieved, because five seconds later the door opens, and it’s not Alice who comes in.</p><p>“I need you out of subspace, now,” Rio whispers urgently. “We are at work.”</p><p>Agatha’s breathing gets heavy for a moment, then lighter as she comes back to herself, and presumably realizes they’re not alone.</p><p>“We’ll talk at lunch,” Rio says, makes sure Agatha’s steady on her feet, and leaves.</p><p>She doesn’t even know how to feel as she makes her way back to her classroom. All she knows is the clawing, empty feeling in her stomach is slowly going away, and that’s good enough for now.</p><p>--</p><p>At lunchtime she texts Agatha to meet her in the parking lot, and when Agatha emerges from the building and approaches her, it’s all she can do not to throw her arms around the ridiculous woman and kiss her. “I was thinking we could talk in your car, since that’s a neutral space for both of us?” she suggests.</p><p>Agatha looks like she wants that kiss as well, and nods her agreement, following a pace behind Rio, and unlocks the car when they get there.</p><p>“Back seat,” Rio says. “So there’s no barriers.” She climbs in and Agatha slides in after her, and once the door is shut she does take that kiss, grabbing Agatha up by the collar and smashing their mouths together. “Why didn’t you just tell me?” she demands when she pulls back.</p><p>“I thought I was protecting you,” Agatha says, tears filling her eyes.</p><p>“You broke me,” Rio says, her voice thick as she tries to shove down her volatile emotions. “I was broken, Agatha. Completely broken.”</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Agatha says, her tears spilling over, and she climbs onto Rio’s lap, hiding her face against Rio’s neck as she cries. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry Rio, I’m so sorry, so fucking sorry,” she apologizes over and over, clinging tightly, her breath warm and her weight comforting. “I didn’t want you to have to choose between me and your job, I didn’t think you’d still want to be with me if you’d get fired and banned from all the districts in the state, I’m not worth it! Why don’t you care? You didn’t even flinch when I told you, you just said you’d work somewhere else. Why doesn’t it matter?”</p><p>“It’s not that it doesn’t matter,” Rio says, stroking her hair. “It’s just that you matter more.”</p><p>Agatha cries harder.</p><p>Rio lets her. “I would choose you over anything, Agatha,” she says after a minute. “Literally anything.”</p><p>Agatha’s full-on sobbing against her neck now, arms wrapped around her so tightly it’s painful, but she doesn’t care. “I’m sorry!” she wails. “I’m so stupid, you tell me all the time how important I am and I just don’t fucking listen! And now I hurt you because of it! You deserve so much better, Rio!”</p><p>“Shut your mouth,” Rio says, as gently as she can when telling a person to shut their mouth. “I deserve exactly what I have. And you’re never going to take that away from me again, are you, Agatha?”</p><p>“No!” Agatha sobs. “I won’t, I swear, I just thought I was doing what was best for you and trying not to be selfish!”</p><p>“You need to get to know me a little better if you think the past three days were what’s best for me. What’s best for me is having <em>my</em> girl, do you understand that? Mine. You’re mine, Agatha. Not your mother’s. Not anyone else’s. <em>Mine</em>.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha cries. “I’m yours, only yours. I’m yours, Rio. All yours.”</p><p>“I couldn’t even work,” Rio says when Agatha’s cries calm down enough for them to talk somewhat normally. “I barely ate. All I did was look at the places in my house that I’ve been with you and cry myself to sleep.”</p><p>“Oh God. No,” Agatha gasps, shaking her head. Rio can feel the motion against her neck. “No, please.”</p><p>“Yes, Agatha, that’s what breaking up with me did to me. I’m not going to lie and make it sound less awful than it was.”</p><p>“I don’t want you to lie,” Agatha rushes out. “I just don’t want that to be true. I’m so sorry Rio. I’ll never forgive myself for doing that to you.”</p><p>“No need to be dramatic,” Rio says, trying to lighten things up despite what she just said. And then goes serious again. “There’s always room for forgiveness, baby. Especially if you learn something from your mistakes. What did you learn from this one? And I mean truly, truly learn? Deep inside where nothing can change it, what did you learn?” She knows what a monumental task it will be for Agatha to answer that question.</p><p>A soft whimper is confirmation of how hard Agatha finds this to be. She’s quiet for a long time – so long they’re going to have to go back inside in a minute, which Rio is dreading because she wants to stay exactly like this for the foreseeable future. “I learned that you’ll choose me over your job,” she finally says. “That you’ll—that you’ll always choose me.”</p><p>“No matter what,” Rio whispers. “Over anyone or anything.”</p><p>She feels lips on her neck, not claiming, just offering. Repenting. Accepting.</p><p>“I also want to make sure you understand that it is my job to protect you, not the other way around. If anything like this ever happens again, regardless of the potential risk to me in any manner, whether it be job, home, or life, what will you do, Agatha?”</p><p>“Tell you,” Agatha says instantly. “I’ll do nothing except find you and tell you.”</p><p>Rio sighs with relief. “Perfect.”</p><p>“I don’t want to go back in.”</p><p>“Neither do I. But you’ll come over after work, and stay the night. Pack a bag for a few nights, actually.”</p><p>Agatha nods. “I’d like that.”</p><p>“And we’ll talk about your punishment tonight.”</p><p>The only indication of an adverse reaction is a sharp intake of breath, but Agatha lets it out slowly and agrees without protest. “Yes, Rio.”</p><p>Rio knows her well enough to know she wouldn’t feel right if she wasn’t punished, anyway. “Good girl,” she says, kissing the top of Agatha’s head. “Come on, let’s go finish the day.”</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha appears in her doorway a few minutes after the last bell, and Rio’s heart skips. She’s missed this so much. “Hey,” she says with a goofy grin.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha says, chewing her bottom lip. “I know you said to pack a bag for a few days but… that means I would have to go home before I come over and I really just want to be with you… please?”</p><p>“That’s fine,” Rio says. “You can borrow clothes.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a breath and nods. “Thank you.”</p><p>As Rio reaches the doorway, Agatha doesn’t move out of the way, and she raises an eyebrow. “Yes?”</p><p>“How do <em>you</em> feel about people here knowing we’re together?”</p><p>“Why are you asking that? Because of this morning? I was just resp—”</p><p>“No,” Agatha interrupts, her cheeks flushing. “Because I want to hold your hand, and there’s cameras.”</p><p>Rio’s heart starts racing, warmth flooding her body. “I don’t care who knows,” she says softly, and lets Agatha take her hand.</p><p>They walk like that all the way to the car, and Agatha pouts when they reach it. “You didn’t get a truck yet?”</p><p>Rio squeezes her hand before letting go to open the door. “Nope, not yet. But you can hold my shirt while I drive, baby.”</p><p>Agatha pouts her way into the passenger seat and reaches over to grab a tight fistful of Rio’s blouse. “Never letting go,” she announces.</p><p>“Fine by me,” Rio says and pulls out of the parking lot.</p><p>They’re both quiet for the drive, and as is customary especially after a rough time, as soon as they get in the house Agatha drags Rio to the sofa, waits for her to sit, and then curls up in her lap with her face tucked securely against Rio’s neck. “I missed you so much,” she breathes against Rio’s skin.</p><p>Rio puts her arms around Agatha and holds her close. “I missed you too,” she says, which is an understatement, like saying breaking a bone is uncomfortable. “The only time you are ever allowed to break up with me is if you don’t want to be with me anymore,” she says. “Is that clear?”</p><p>Agatha makes the most aggrieved noise Rio has heard from her in a while and clings tighter, if possible. “That will never happen,” she says adamantly. “But it’s clear.”</p><p>Rio shifts until she’s more comfortable and then settles, lifting a hand to comb her fingers through Agatha’s hair. Over, and over, and over, and over…</p><p>They stay like that for hours, soaking up each other’s presence, comforted by touch and proximity and sharing the same air.</p><p>It’s dark outside by the time Agatha speaks. “I really don’t want to move, but I really have to pee,” she says softly. “Would you wait outside the door? Or come in with me if that doesn’t bother you?”</p><p>The fact that Agatha doesn’t want to be apart long enough to go to the bathroom melts Rio’s insides into a useless puddle. “It doesn’t bother me,” she says, and helps Agatha up, letting herself be dragged along and standing next to her while she pees and washes her hands.</p><p>Rio pees and washes up next so they’ll be good to go for a few more hours, and they return to the sofa, Agatha instantly curling back up.</p><p>“Are you ready to discuss your punishment?” Rio asks, and Agatha nods, changing positions a little so she’s leaning against the armrest of the sofa while still sitting on Rio’s lap, so they can look at each other.</p><p>Rio takes one of the pillows and squeezes it between Agatha’s back and the armrest, because it’s not the most padded armrest.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha says, and Rio puts an arm under her neck, both to support her head and to keep her close.</p><p>“So. Your punishment,” Rio starts. “Do you want to take part in determining it?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flush and she shakes her head, putting her thumb in her mouth.</p><p>Oh Jesus, that again. Makes it hard to talk about punishment when Agatha is being so sweet and adorable. “Are you doing that to make it harder to punish you?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, and her eyes are sincere. Rio believes her.</p><p>“Okay honey,” she says kissing Agatha’s forehead. “So I’ll be deciding your punishment on my own.”</p><p>Agatha nods, and the way her cheeks go in and out as she sucks her thumb is driving Rio a little bit crazy.</p><p>So she just watches for a minute, and listens. Watches Agatha’s earnest expression, the subtle movement of her lips, listens to the quiet sucking noises and Agatha’s soft breathing. She’s never felt for anyone the things she feels for Agatha. And she’s had some good, or at least decent, relationships. But not one of them even scratched the surface of the way she loves this woman.</p><p>“I love you so much,” she whispers.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flutter closed for the briefest of seconds and she whimpers, sliding her thumb out of her mouth. “I love you too, more than I ever knew I had the capacity for.”</p><p>Rio kisses her, slow and sweet, tugging Agatha’s lower lip between her teeth for a gentle nibble, her free hand coming to rest against the side of Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha leans into the kiss, opening to it, not doing anything to hurry or demand, but lets Rio treat her with tenderness and reverence.</p><p>Rio remembers something Agatha had said once, about hands under her shirt being a major turn on, and reaches down to untuck her blouse from her slacks, then crawls her fingers under it and splays her hand flat on Agatha’s belly.</p><p>The moan loosed is instant and wild. “Oh God. Rio. Oh God please.”</p><p>Rio purrs and puts pressure with her hand, then eases off and drifts her way upward, toward Agatha’s heaving chest.</p><p>“Fuck fuck fuck,” Agatha chants, squirming all over the place, rolling her hips into nothing.</p><p>It doesn’t seem to matter where Rio touches her, as long as her hand is under Agatha’s blouse. Tracing her ribs one at a time gets the same desperate cry as pinching a nipple through the lace of her bra.</p><p>She pulls her other arm out from under Agatha’s neck and swings one leg over Agatha’s thighs to straddle her, then both hands are under the blouse, rubbing circles over her flanks, sliding around to her back, digging in under tensed shoulder blades with her fingernails and scraping hard down either side of Agatha’s spine.</p><p>Agatha shouts and bites her own arm, shuddering through an orgasm with her thighs clenched together.</p><p>Rio stares in amazement. “You were not kidding about hands under your shirt being a turn on,” she breathes, extracting her hands from the shirt in question to frame Agatha’s face.</p><p>“I wasn’t,” Agatha pants, still unable to hold still as she starts to recover. “Fuck,” she says a few seconds later. “Jesus Christ.”</p><p>“You’re telling me,” Rio says with a grin. “Could you possibly be any hotter? And before you try to answer, it’s no. The answer is no.”</p><p>Agatha flushes at that and curls up in Rio’s lap again. “Thank you,” she says, quiet and subdued at the praise.</p><p>“Let’s talk about your punishment tomorrow,” Rio says, because she’s honestly just too emotional and worn out to come up with something suitable.</p><p>“Yes, Rio,” Agatha says.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio purrs. “Let’s go to bed.”</p>
