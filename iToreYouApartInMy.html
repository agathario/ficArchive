     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Rules have never been a difficult concept for Rio Vidal. Following them hasn't either, although she has never been beyond the human experience of making mistakes.
     </p>
     <p>
      After years kept within the steel walls of the Cook County Coroner's Office, very little has come to challenge her anymore. That is, until a series of deceased men come across her table, all seemingly fine and yet, all in possession of a severed spinal cord.
     </p>
     <p>
      By the fifth body, Rio is beginning to saw her nose off to spite her face; not knowing how such a thing keeps happening, even if it is at the hands of another human being, starts to tilt her focus and skew her moral compass.
     </p>
     <p>
      How far will she go to get answers?
     </p>
     <p>
      Rio isn't even sure
      <i>
       she
      </i>
      knows.

     "Hey, what's a ten letter word for 'a typical instance or case?'"
    </p>
    <p>
     The plastic end of a BIC pen muffled such a question as Cook County Coroner Rio Vidal's dark gaze lifted from the wrinkled newspaper in front of her, the day's crossword puzzle only halfway complete. Her feet were propped on the corner of her desk, white coat dangling loosely at her sides in her relaxed state. A crew neck sweater clung to her chest with a depiction of the moon, but comprised of floral print. She greeted her compatriot with elation and warmth, though a simple 'good morning!' could never have been quite enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good to see you too, Rio," came the grumbled response of the mortuary attendant, Alice Gulliver, as she backed her way through the doorway that would allow her to deposit the delivery she'd arrived with. Every day, a new silver cart. Every day, someone knew to wash and clean and dissect to search for answers. It was usually multiple carts a day, but for it being the first of that day in particular, Alice seemed in good spirits. That was always a plus.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio had graduated from Rutgers with a masters in Forensic Sciences, she had possessed dreams of approaching crime scenes with vigor and curiosity, seeing things from all angles. She had wanted field work for herself, to be in the throes of assistance when it came to determining the true cause of the world's worst crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet somehow, she had landed herself in the Cook County Morgue, ten years later.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though it had not been anywhere near the aspirations Rio had maintained for herself in her younger years, she had found a home in those steel walls and linoleum floors. She found peace in the silence, and a beautiful understanding of true mortality in the countless causes for death she had come across.
    </p>
    <p>
     Normally, in the day-to-day, no two cases were usually the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lately, that had started to change and as such, a concern was beginning to grow within the brass that passed in and out of her doors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio liked to keep to herself in that cold, soulless basement, but she got visitors frequently. It was usually the police or the forensic investigators, but it was often a gentle reminder that while she spent the majority of her day with the dead, the living still needed things, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of them were more friendly than others and some simply wanted the answers to their questions so they could scramble out as quick as they had happened in, escaping the eerie and heavy air that seemed to hang stagnant within those walls.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not Alice, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was the closest thing Rio had to a teammate while venturing down such a macabre career path. They had met on Alice's first day, having transferred in from Will County, and had formed a fast friendship. Rio was drawn to her, to the small hand tattoos and the several piercings that lined her ears. She fit into that darker vibe, but was able to mask it pretty well in the same manner Rio did.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had both built a mutual understanding that in the hours of the day, they dealt with heaviness and loss of human life. In the hours of the night, they had come to lean on one another to find ways to compartmentalize and separate work from personal, searching life for what was worth living versus living to know death for a paycheck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What about... 'ILLUSTRATION?'" Alice called from the autopsy room. Rio was already on her feet, pushing her way through the door to assist her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think that might work, actually," Rio concurred, tucking the chewed up pen behind her ear. She approached the foot end of the steel table so that she could fist two corners of the body bag and help Alice in the relocation of her latest find to a less mobile resting place for the time being. "What have we got this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio's eyes landed on the woman opposite her, looking only a little winded, there was a faint darkness that lapped at Alice's brown irises. It was an indication that Rio was either going to love her answer or find the same disappointment everyone else had.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Another seemingly explanation-less death. Which means that when I come back in several hours, you're probably going to inform me, for the fifth time in the last four weeks, that the spinal cord was severed between the C3 and C4." Alice had folded her arms over her chest, as if she were defying the clear indication here: The boys down the road had a serial killer on their hands and they had absolutely no idea where to even start looking.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Still no bruising or incisions?" Rio questioned with a curiosity-laden tone; she knew that she would find her answers once she got to work, but it was easier to just ask ahead of time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "None. They just turn up at the foot of random graves throughout the city, looking otherwise fine." Alice lifted the clipboard at the end of her cart, jotting something on it before she held it out in request for Rio's signature.
    </p>
    <p>
     Locked in a trance as her mind began to turn and roll toward knowing what she would find and still having no answers, Rio only snapped out of it when Alice waved the clipboard in her eye-line.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've got another pick-up in Bucktown so I can't hang out, but I can bring lunch later?" she offered as Rio finally took the clipboard from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a quick flourish of the pen she plucked from behind her ear, Rio quickly scribbled her signature across the form to signify her acceptance and forked it back over to a smiling Alice who took it with a quick 'thanks.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've really been craving some spicy pimento cheese," she announced decisively as she followed Alice out of autopsy, those misaligned wheels making a little too much noise for Rio's liking now that they weren't under the pressure of dead weight. It only desisted when Alice stopped by the main doors, not immediately pressing the button to open them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you want the kind from the chicken salad place or The Smoke Daddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes lit up at the suggestion, a warm smile filling her face. "If you love me enough, you'll get it from Smoke Daddy and bring me an order of their buffalo cauliflower, too."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're so needy," Alice huffed back through a light laugh as she smacked at the button on the wall to open the doors. "But yes, I will bring you pimento cheese and buffalo cauliflower for lunch. I'll text you when I'm headed back."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're the best!" Rio called after her just as the doors sealed shut once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was time to get to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had developed a method to her madness, a way to move and operate that was both easier on herself and still maintained a healthy sense of respect for the husk of a human life that had ended up in her morgue, on her table. If it was only nine in the morning and Alice was already headed back out, it was a heavy indicator of a busy day ahead. That meant Rio needed to be quick, efficient, and she needed to keep to her precise guidelines that helped her procure the most accurate results.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were few people that Rio came into contact with that had ever considered her to be normal, especially in a work environment. Wasn't it almost a job requirement to exist a little outside of the box? Wasn't it a
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     thing to have enough emotional maturity that she could deposit parts of her humanity into a box so that she was able to complete her job thoroughly and without too much emotion?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had always been deemed weird, even as a child. Instead of trying to run from it or act as though it was something she had a distaste for, she chose to embrace it instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     When six-foot-tall suits bustled through those doors, they did not often expect to see all five-feet-six-inches of Rio Vidal awaiting them, hair usually knotted in a bun that revealed the intricate orchid tattoo on the back of her neck that dropped below the collar of her shirt in geometrically pointed shapes that angled toward her spine. The linework was prominent with minimal shading, but it was the one tattoo that showed the most in terms of her existence in a professional setting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her arms remained covered at work, hiding the full sleeve of ink on her left one. It was an artful dedication to the many, many survivor stories Rio had heard over the years of those who had fought for the right to keep living their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the ink, there were nods to true warriors like Jennifer Morey -- a pair of legs bent and stoppered between a door and a bathtub for panicked security -- and Mary Vincent -- crossed prosthetic arms holding lilies -- and Scott Johnston and Sean Farmer -- an abstract visual of a finger inside of a bullet hole at the base of a skull -- that she carried with her every single day to remind her that the human condition could survive absolutely anything if given the right amount of determination.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite dealing in sources of death for a living, Rio believed in the tenacity of the human spirit. She believed that fighting was always an option, and she wore it on her skin to keep it fresh in her mind at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
     Life could be worth fighting for, if it meant enough to the person living it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, Rio realized after she suited up in her gown and unzipped the bag on her table, there were some people who never had a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
     The man before her was one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Per his ID card, his name was Tristan Ambruster. He was six feet and two inches tall with a weight of two hundred and thirty eight pounds. His dark hair was short and matched the color of the stubble that lined his jaw. He looked peaceful, as most did before Rio began to scour them in search of an ability to tell the proper end to their tales.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tending to the dead with care was a faculty that had to be curated and perfected through experience, something Rio had invested far too many hours in. Even though she knew nothing of the man before her, she was still gentle as she cut his clothing and peeled it from his cold and stiffening frame. Her gloved hands were tender as they removed his shoes and shucked him of his socks.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, naked on that chillingly cold steel table, his life was no more, and it was Rio's duty to discern why.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through hours of incisions and diagnoses, Rio had reached the conclusion that Alice had known she would, even before she sent the toxicology specimens in for testing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tristan's spinal cord had been severed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was more certain than ever that this, as well as the four bodies that had faced an identical fate, could only be the work of one person, or a team at most. These men were large, they were fit and built. For the fifth time now, someone had managed to fell a beast in the exact same way and it was beginning to eat away at Rio's cognitive understanding of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were no suspects. There wasn't even an
     <em>
      idea
     </em>
     of how this was happening. It seemed to be such a violent crime, one that should have required force and yet, all Rio found in terms of visual proof of such an idea were the pinprick bruises in the same odd shape across the chests of each and every man that had met their fate in nearly identical conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first time she had caught them, it had been on the second victim. They had not quite formed on the first by the time he had come into her morgue, but when she went back for an additional review, they'd been there in that same strange arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the third victim, Rio realized that they were points, ones that belonged to an invisible pentagram that had not been drawn. Nothing else about it felt occult and so, even having made such an observation to herself, she'd kept it quiet. There was no real reason to include anything other than the presence of the bruising; all it would do was induce a sense of panic that might end up being unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the process of sewing Tristan back together, another thought struck Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     If this
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     the same person that had been responsible for the last four bodies, the tox screen was going to come back with a flag for Rohypnol. That, in and of itself, was curious and had led Rio to draw her own conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
     The idle chatter she'd caught in passing had been that if the police were looking for anyone, it had to be a man. It had to be a large man, a man who could subdue these victims without a visual representation of force left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thought they were idiots.
    </p>
    <p>
     If this truly was the same perpetrator, Rio was of the opinion at the end of examining her fifth victim that this could not have been a man in any way, shape, or form.
    </p>
    <p>
     A man wouldn't have been so meticulous about not leaving unintentional marks. A man wouldn't have been invested in leaving the bodies as neatly and deliberately at specific graves in different cemeteries throughout the city. A man wouldn't have resorted to drugging another man for the sole purpose of killing him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whoever this was, she was
     <em>
      good.
     </em>
     She was smart, calculated. She knew what the fuck she was doing and quite frankly, it was really starting to piss Rio off.
    </p>
    <p>
     How was she doing it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearly, the drugging was helping her relocate from whatever hunting grounds she was choosing, but the spinal cord... How on
     <em>
      earth
     </em>
     was she severing it without doing
     <em>
      any
     </em>
     exterior damage?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was bothering Rio. In fact, it was bothering Rio so much that she could think of little else, even as she moved through two other bodies before lunch. She hadn't gotten a text from Alice and had considered starting another case, but a soft ding at her computer indicated that she'd received an email -- likely the results of the tox screen from her first case of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been right, on both accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
     1) It
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     the results.
     <br/>
     2) In them, Rio found what she knew she would. There was a high concentration of
     <br/>
     Rohypnol in his system.
    </p>
    <p>
     One arm was extended, palm hovering over her mouse as the other swiftly plucked the pen from behind her ear and deposited the end between her teeth, gnawing on it as her eyes scanned over the report again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she turned this over as it was, it was possible that someone else was going to start thinking the way she was thinking. They were going to shift their profile, and they were going to start looking for a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     The stupidest thought struck her:
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't want them to find her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt even more insane because she had absolutely
     <em>
      no
     </em>
     proof that this was a woman. Rio was a master at developing inferences and more often than not, she was right, but there was something about this that had really gotten under her skin. It had been easy enough to put to bed when it was two men, then three. Had it still been annoying? Of course, but with Rio having picked apart and reassembled five now-empty vessels and still not having determined what had actually happened to them, she was getting
     <em>
      angry.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio needed to know.
    </p>
    <p>
     The process of getting there was murky at best, but as she leaned forward in her office chair and began to click and type, she
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     she was making the wrong choice. She fully understood that by changing the toxicology results to indicate opioid usage as opposed to the Rohypnol, she was actually committing a fucking
     <em>
      crime
     </em>
     that could not only get her fired, but could place her behind bars as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe this had been a long time coming; Rio had maintained a thin veil of sanity when it came to how she presented herself to the public, but the madness that could sometimes fester within her felt a little dangerous, if only to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't hurt a fly and yet, she was driven to understand those who could. More than that, the psychopathy behind violent acts was something that had always drawn her in, something that she had spent countless hours investing her time in. It hadn't just been for college, but had since grown into something akin to a hobby even in the years since graduation.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was why she loved her job; she got to pick apart and dissect and study and search. Rio got the chance to be hands-on in her quest for knowledge, into determining the absurd and pinpointing what others had let slip by.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had never been the type to break rules, much less laws, but something about this had been turning circles in her mind since that very first body, even if she had professionally staved off forming an opinion. It wasn't her job to
     <em>
      guess
     </em>
     what was happening, it was her job to find it, identify it, and present the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right now, the facts were that
     <em>
      someone
     </em>
     out there was murdering men in an incredibly heinous manner and if they kept it up, they were
     <em>
      going
     </em>
     to get caught. If
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     was putting the pieces together, it was likely that someone else would be right behind her, no matter what terrible choices she was making in the meantime to try and prolong it.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she submitted the "official" report with the tap of the 'enter' key, the doors to the morgue swung open and Alice came through with a bag in each hand and a grin on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All that work made you hungry, I bet," Alice teased in her approach as she forked over Rio's lunch. Little more than a delighted laugh met her as Rio reached for her meal, a soft 'thank you' passing through her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled out the contents of the bag and set out her meal, watching as Alice pulled a chair over to sit opposite her, the desk between them. "Always does," she returned with a grin of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So, big boy from this morning? Was it what we suspected?" Alice questioned, tilting her head as she tossed a tater tot effortlessly into her mouth. That look on her face as she chewed was almost scrutinizing, Rio thought, but she dismissed it and prepared herself to do something she never did, especially not to Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lied.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The injury was the same, but..." she paused, taking a bite of cauliflower for the sole purpose of taking her time in deciding the best lie to proceed with. "The tox screen was wrong. Opioids. The four others were Rohypnol. It doesn't make any sense."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was not an actress by any means, but the faux sense of irritation she was brandishing seemed to be working. Alice looked just as perplexed, if not a little off-put by the idea that they had been wrong. It was close enough that she could have called Rio out on it, could have suggested that she re-run the test, but she seemed to leave it at that, picking at her tots for a moment longer before her next question came.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Anything else that might make you think it's the same person?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look," Rio sighed, placing the half-empty container of cauliflower on her desk as she leaned forward, simply assessing Alice's expression for the briefest moment before she continued. "They aren't classifying this as a serial offender yet. And maybe... I don't know, maybe it isn't? What if it's multiple people, or a team? Who knows, it could even be some stupid internet dare that people are willing to risk prison time for. So until then... I just do my job and be angry about the fact that I
     <em>
      cannot
     </em>
     for the
     <em>
      life of me
     </em>
     figure out how the fuck it's happening."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice had been attentive, listening, watching Rio as she tried to sort through her thoughts, but Rio felt like she was seeing right through such a massive serving of absolute bullshit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could not very well look her friend in the eye and admit to falsifying records and expect her to still think she was sane. Rio could not, within reason, justify the choice she had made that afternoon and so, she would lie her ass off to save face with the only other person she actually respected.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Suppose you won't, at least not until next time," Alice offered, though she still had not torn her attention from Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something in Rio's middle began to twist uncomfortably; what was she doing? What was she
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     doing?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was buying herself time.
    </p>
    <p>
     She
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     to figure it out, to figure
     <em>
      this person
     </em>
     out, at least before the police took that ability away.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who knows, maybe they'll skip town and wreak havoc on some other County Coroner's office instead of souring my mood almost twice a week," Rio returned, her tone admonishing in spite of her internal admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was the first to break, her eyes dropping to the container of cheese spread and the crackers that were piled next to it. She had thought that busying herself and diverting her focus might chase off that wily twisting in her middle, but the reality of the decision she had already made was still there, feasting on her morality.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You okay?" came Alice's gentle inquiry, though there was an undeniable edge to that curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah," Rio dismissed with ease. "Just annoyed." To staunch any further elaboration, she shoved a cracker into her mouth and looked to the screen of her computer. In an attempt to change the subject, she pulled up the site-wide email she'd received that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You see the email this morning?" Rio asked, gaze flickering to Alice and back before she began to read without having received an answer. "'Please be attentive toward designated parking spots. Any threats or acts of physical violence in relation to parking disputes may be met with automatic termination.' Who the fuck is scrapping it out in the garage? Are we all not at LEAST in our mid-thirties?"
    </p>
    <p>
     As Alice laughed, Rio's panicky inner monologue seemed to die down, or at least find reason for pause. She had no reason to believe that Alice would suspect anything, but the paranoia was still trying to rear its ugly head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did the right thing, almost always. She was human and had made mistakes before, but when the time came for a choice to be made, she tried her hardest to make the right one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not this time, though. This time, it hadn't even been a battle. She'd done the wrong thing because it felt right in her own quest for understanding. The only way she was going to find it was to do her own work, her own research. She needed to delve deeper without anyone else looking over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, yeah. That dude in accounting went insane. He ended up damaging his own car," Alice offered back, taking the last bite of her sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sometimes I worry for this world," Rio mused sadly, and while it was a dark sentiment, she also knew it was one she was powerless to change.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You and me both," Alice replied, wadding up the wrapper from her sandwich. Rio's attention fell on her as she pushed to her feet and discarded her trash in the bin, that warm smile finding her face as she looked back down at Rio. "Well, I've got a few more runs this afternoon, but if you're not busy after work, we should get a beer or food or both."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio appeared to consider the offer, but she'd long since made up her mind on what she was doing with her evening, even before Alice had put the idea of food and drinks on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was going to dig. She was going to go home, order a pizza, crack open a beer, and she was going to spend the entire night
     <em>
      somehow
     </em>
     finding a way to figure this out. She had her vast array of knowledge and that should have been suitable, but the anomalies and complexities of these five deaths were never going to leave her alone until she understood them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Maybe not tonight," Rio returned, though her voice was soft and sweet. "Just kind of want to go home and curl up on the couch with Phineas while we continue through our eighth rewatch of Nightwatch."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You and that cat," Alice chuckled with a roll of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's a sweet boy, even if he weighs twenty-two pounds. He can't help his breed."
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas was her three-year-old charcoal grey Maine Coon and he was the king of Rio's jungle. Her apartment, no matter how spacious, was his territory and anyone who dared approach only succeeded with his approval. Thankfully, he had taken to Alice quite easily. It made the nights when they stumbled in at 2am, harebrained drunk, a little easier to navigate when his hackles weren't raised.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cat or not, Phineas was protective over his human and Rio loved him even more for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, if you change your mind," Alice suggested, glancing over her shoulder with a curl of her lips as she slapped the button on the wall, "you know how to reach me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's head tipped back, the truly tickled laughter spilling from her as she formed her retort.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You got it, Kim Possible! Have a good rest of your shift!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Just before the doors automatically swung shut, Rio could see as Alice's left arm shot up and she flashed a very loud middle finger, pulling even more joyous noise from deep within Rio's lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     For as vexing and sometimes downright depressing as her job could sometimes be, Rio could still find those flickers of light, the ones that kept indicating to her what it meant to move forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, she was trying to remind herself -- as she sat alone in the office again -- that this
     <em>
      one
     </em>
     time, it was okay to be curious, and to be willing to do what was necessary to satiate that curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only person that Rio needed to convince was herself, and by the end of her shift as she hung up her white coat and headed out for the day, she was pretty certain she had managed to do just that.
    </p>
    <p>
     After picking up a couple of Modelos at the gas station, she'd returned home to order her dinner and tuck in for a quick shower. Of course, she had not been able to accomplish such a mission without greeting the distinguished gentleman of the house first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas had slinked off the couch, languid as he stretched out to reinvigorate himself from the nap Rio had apparently disturbed him from.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, hello handsome," she cooed, squatting down to scratch the top of his head. The way his eyes closed and his ears pinned back pulled the quietest chuckle from her every single time, her entire demeanor softening from whatever in her day that plagued her. It was a distraction, and a welcome one, but it could only last for so long.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had not even finished her shower by the time she was looping back around to fixate on Tristan. On work. On this serial k -- No. She couldn't use those words yes, not officially.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been
     <em>
      trying
     </em>
     to distract herself, and it had been going... alright, but the moment the quiet found her, the volume in her head only seemed to increase. No abrasions. No incisions. No fucking sign that anything had happened to these men and somehow, each and every one of them had died because of a severed spinal cord.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt repetitive, to keep getting hung up on the same facts but at this point, it was all Rio had. All she could work with was all she
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     worked with, and that was giving her nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Minutes after she had dressed and returned to the living room to crack open one of the cans of beer, there was a light knock on the door that signified the arrival of her dinner. After signing for the charge and thanking the driver with an extra five dollar bill, she kicked the door shut and fastened the deadbolt so she could comfortably set about the rest of her evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     It hadn't taken her long to settle in and devour a couple of slices of pizza, but almost as soon as she was done, her MacBook was open in her lap and the hunt was officially on. Obviously, there was a certain line of caution that needed its due attention, but Rio was an intelligent human being and if there was
     <em>
      anyone
     </em>
     who was going to sort this, it was going to be her. That was one thing she was bound and determined to prove.
    </p>
    <p>
     The cursor blinked in a taunt, over and over and over, begging for her to just
     <em>
      type something.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     All she had to do was pose an inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
     The best place to start would likely be the freshest prey.
    </p>
    <p>
     In went her query; Tristan Ambruster.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first few results that populated were coverage of his murder the night before and that morning. She skimmed through them and found nothing useful; it was still too soon for people to have found much in any excavation attempt on his life.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it turned out, the short summaries of his expiration weren't due to a lack of content.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, the eight results below it were about the plethora of run-ins he'd had with police; several were domestic violence charges that got overturned and a couple more detailed sexual assault allegations that never went anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something tugged at Rio's focus, causing her to press on such a sore spot. She pushed a little harder, searched a little more thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the women that had been publicly outspoken about Tristan's violent demeanor had ended up dead six months later -- official cause of death was ruled as a suicide. Whether or not that was true did not seem to matter. When Rio saw the woman's name, she realized that it was not the first time she had read
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     name in the last thirty minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scrolling back up, she started scouring again, though it did not take her long.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a photo of the crime scene from earlier in the day on a local news site, the headstone above where Tristan's body had been found was visible, as was the name that was etched so plainly into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the same name in relation to the suicide.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda Maximoff.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whoever had killed Tristan had specifically laid him at the foot of Wanda Maximoff's grave. That wasn't random. That wasn't a haphazard decision. No, that was most certainly a very, very intentional choice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whoever this killer, this
     <em>
      woman
     </em>
     -- as Rio was now more certain of than ever -- was, she had sent a message. Rio got it loud and clear.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only thing left to do in her mind?
    </p>
    <p>
     Dig deeper and discover if she had missed those first four messages on her initial pass, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two hours later, Rio saw it all, like a road map before her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every corpse had been left at a grave of someone they had wronged but suffered no consequence for. This was a calling card, as well as a victimology; these men had public appearances even without lengthy criminal records, and
     <em>
      someone
     </em>
     knew how to use Google.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last remaining item left on Rio's list?
    </p>
    <p>
     Find her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
     There was a fine line between curiosity and fixation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three days after making Tristan's acquaintance just before finding herself elbow deep in his chest cavity, Rio's toes were threateningly close to crossing that very line.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stuck to her routine, showed up to work and performed every duty she had to perfection, committing to every responsibility she was tasked with. It fell back into a pattern of the times, nothing amiss and nothing that frayed Rio's nerves to a point of no return.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was only a matter of time, Rio knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     On that third day, something in the deep crevices of her mind just
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     that if there was ever going to be a night that she might find answers, it was going to be that one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice had asked -- at least once if not twice a day -- if Rio wanted to go out, or if she wanted to come over. Each invitation was met with a deferral, though Rio was trying her hardest to be cordial without revealing what it was she would rather spend her time doing. She had hated lying to Alice the first time, about the tox screen, so she tried to keep her excuses as close to the truth as she could manage.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just haven't been feeling very social," Rio had offered once.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Crowds just aren't it for me right now," she'd given another time.
    </p>
    <p>
     That morning, Alice hadn't even tried.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you feel up to it, I'm going to Roscoe's tonight. If not, no worries, but... You should consider it." She had sounded resigned, like she already knew that for the third night in a row, Rio was going to choose to tuck up in her apartment and keep to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could see the concern. She could see that Alice was watching her pull away and she was growing worried. She would play it off as just needing to recharge, to isolate from the world for a bit to just be content in her choice for complacency. Rio didn't want Alice to worry, but there were certain things she just couldn't talk about.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she told Alice that she had slept maybe seven hours the last two nights, and why she had been losing sleep, Alice was going to make a prompt phone call to the nearest psych ward and pack Rio's bags for a vacation that included frequently wearing a pair of socks with rubber grips on the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Rio offered a soft acknowledgement that she would consider it and wished Alice a good day. Their conversation and chatter had been almost nil as she came and went throughout the day and while Rio had thought more than once that she should say something to break the tension, she was never able to find the right thing. So they moved bodies in quiet, they murmured soft goodbyes and by the end of the day, Alice had tossed a reminder over her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you change your mind, Roscoe's. Shoot me a text."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will. Have fun, Alice," Rio called after her as the doors swung shut on their own accord and she was left to tend to her own evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was going home, yes, but only to change.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, she was going to make a decision between Best Intentions or The Heavy Feather. They were both bars in Logan Square and, per her research over the two days prior, that was the neighborhood that four of the five victims had resided in. With the fith one -- the very first victim -- having been from Wicker Park, it made sense that She had migrated.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was all Rio could think to label her as. Anything else felt like a cheesy tag-line, something that was too beneath the complexity of what this woman was achieving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Between the four victims that had lived in Logan Square, Rio had located all of their social medias. In their photos, three of the four had been to Best Intentions. The fourth -- Tristan -- had been to both Best Intentions and The Heavy Feeather. It left Rio with a decision: Did she look at this as a very clear sign that Best Intentions was a hunting grounds, or did she follow the thread that the killer could have migrated to somewhere new when selecting her prey?
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt positively out of her mind, chasing leads that she knew she could do nothing with. What was the play here, even if Rio got what it was she was looking for? Did she just outright ask to know? Did she ask to be told, or to be shown?
    </p>
    <p>
     Wait -- What the fuck?
    </p>
    <p>
     Why had that thought even crossed her mind?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      To be shown?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      To be shown
      <b>
       what
      </b>
      exactly?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     How countless men were being
     <em>
      murdered?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     No, that was fucking
     <em>
      absurd.
     </em>
     Rio might have headed toward the deep end on this one, but the idea that she could bear to witness a life be taken? Didn't that seem a little extreme even in her quest for knowledge? It did, right?
    </p>
    <p>
     Right?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Right?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     None of it even mattered at that point, she supposed. She was no closer to knowing the truth than she had been the very second that first mystery had been dropped onto her table.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no denying that She was clever. Even those days later, and perhaps with Rio's helpful diversion, the police were still popping by to ask questions, though she gave the same answers every single time. It was the same injury in all five but different illicits in the last. Pinprick bruises on the chest. Nothing more, nothing less.
    </p>
    <p>
     But She still had to hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     She still had to follow whatever compass was guiding Her and if she shortening of her cooling off period was any indication, Rio had a feeling that tonight would be the night. Between her two options, she still felt as though she was going to wind up with a body on her table in the morning. Even if Rio chose wrong, She wasn't going to stop this spree. If anything, She was just finding her groove.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a click of the switches, the lights cut to the morgue and Rio was headed home to shower and change, still waffling over what option she needed to select in regards to the bar she was going to occupy for the evening. By the time she pulled on a red satin slip midi dress and fastened a matching pair of heels around her ankles, Rio had made a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     She decided to go with her gut.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something felt all too fitting about Best Intentions, and the fact that four of the five men had been there, that
     <em>
      wasn't
     </em>
     coincidence and no one in the world could ever convince Rio that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a once over that led to her fussing with her hair a moment longer, Rio was satisfied with her appearance; the dress hung well on her frame and the way she had tied her hair into a neat bun at the back of her head while leaving several strands to frame her face showcased her natural, soft beauty. The thin straps that held the dress up covered nothing else, leaving her full sleeve of ink bare and beautiful. As a bonus, with the way the dress was cut, the very tip of her sternum tattoo -- a geometric wolf with bared teeth and raised hackles -- was visible, but no other part.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the full understanding that she did not intend on finishing even a full beer, Rio had been confident that she could drive herself. If it turned out that she was wrong and she had spent an entire evening in a bar corner, she could at least lay claim to getting in a couple hours of people watching.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, she had climbed into her dark green Tiburon and took off toward Logan Square, a woman on a mission.
    </p>
    <p>
     Did it matter that it was an insane mission that had no good outcome?
    </p>
    <p>
     It should have, probably, but Rio no longer was of sound enough mind to actually care.
    </p>
    <p>
     After arriving, she'd ordered one Modelo in a glass, thanked the bartender, and floated her way over toward a booth in the far corner of the bar to sit, to wait, to watch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Idly, Rio took the smallest sips of her beer, those dark and curious eyes scanning and assessing. Time began to wear on and while most of the crowd within the bar walls were being rather tame, there was one man in particular who seemed to be a little... excessive in his flirting with the bartender. She was being professional with him, but it was clear that the vibes he was exuding were not ones she was a fast fan of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Occasionally the bartender would glance over her shoulder to make sure he didn't think she was ignoring him, but overall it appeared as though she just wanted to be left alone. It might have been annoying, but it seemed harmless.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her beer a quarter of the way gone, Rio's gaze landed on the corner opposite the one she was in to find a couple indulging in a drunken and overt display of public affection and while it was rather gross, it wasn't the worst thing they could have been doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were a couple of men playing pool in the corner, occasionally getting a bit rowdy though it seemed as though the majority of the banter happening between them was friendly and in jest. They were just a couple of friends engaging in healthy competition. While they were amusing, even for a few minutes, Rio's interest in them inevitably waned, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even the man yelling at whatever hockey game was on the television was a minimal distraction, lasting only a moment or two before Rio's attention was diverted and scouring the bar again for anything that might have seemed even minutely out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
     No matter how much she began to hate it, it had stayed relatively quiet, in those first forty-five minutes. It was rather calm was after them, too, but at that forty-six minute mark, something happened that immediately grabbed at Rio's attention for reasons unintelligible to Rio herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     A woman -- roughly five and a half feet tall -- came striding through the front entrance of the bar, her head held high as her wild and thick sandy brown hair cascaded down her back, untamed and haphazard in an elegant way that made little sense. She was clad in a deep violet ruffled chiffon dress that had a very dangerous slit up the thigh and while she
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     in heels, Rio noted that they were rather short given the formality of the dress itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had only caught a brief glimpse of her profile upon entry, losing it the moment the woman seemed to glide right over to the bar, her hand landing flat on the back of the man who had previously been annoying the ever-loving fuck out of the bartender. She leaned in over his shoulder, spoke to him and he seemed to straighten on his stool. After she took a step back, he got to his feet and offered her a quick, if not slightly awkward, hug.
    </p>
    <p>
     From her vantage point, Rio thought she had never seen a more mismatched pair in her entire life. The woman had an air of eleagance to her, even though Rio hadn't even gotten a good look at her face. She was poised, well-dressed, and the way she began to flirt with the man seemed so well-practiced.
    </p>
    <p>
     He, on the other hand, looked like he had been plucked straight from a cornfield that could be found outside of the city and planted in the middle of a borough sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the woman touched his arm, Rio felt something flare in her middle.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to be that man. She wanted that woman to touch
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     arm like that and she didn't even know what the fuck she looked like. It was the air around her, the way she tossed her head when she laughed -- a laugh that was bright and electric -- and the way she bobbed her foot, circling it around absent-mindedly as she held conversation with her date.
    </p>
    <p>
     Someone stumbled into the corner of Rio's table and immediately, her attention was jostled away from the confident woman in the purple dress that was clearly on a date with a man, snapping up to find the culprit already heading toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck. She wasn't meant to be fixated on some random person. She was meant to be paying attention, to be looking for...
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What the hell was she even looking for?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     In reality, Rio knew very little about Her. All she knew was that She had a process for selecting Her victims and while Rio had considered Best Intentions to be her best bet, she was starting to feel like she had made a mistake. She had pushed too hard only to lose a mental coin toss. She should have gone to The Heavy Feather. In fact, She was probably already there, already schmoozing up some poor schmuck who had no idea that he was going to be found with a cleanly severed spinal cord in the middle of a random cemetery in a different part of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
     The decision had been made and so, Rio supposed, all that was left to do was wait it out. She could have relocated, but what would have been the point? It was probable that she had already missed her window of opportunity and so she was instead going to have to turn up at work tomorrow to perform an autopsy that would ring true to five others she had done in the last month.
    </p>
    <p>
     She just wanted to know how.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was all she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Knowing that she wouldn't even get a buzz off of it, Rio downed a considerable amount of the beer that remained in her glass. She wasn't ready to leave, but she needed something that might help her temper the bubbling annoyance that had formed in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been so convinced that she was right. She had been so fucking sure that if this woman was going to turn up anywhere, it was going to be that bar. The fact that all Rio had found inside was typical partons, horny drunks, and this haphazard ass Tinder match of a couple, it left her feeling more than just irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was pissed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had made a bad call and now, she could choose to keep watching the most interesting thing in the bar, which was that spectacularly painful date, or she could just choose to go home. While she made her decision, Rio decided to watch the show.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it was a damn good thing she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as she had been teetering over the edge of deciding to get in her car and go home, she saw something. The man excused himself and got to his feet, meandering his way toward the  bathrooms down the back hall. The woman was still situated with her back to Rio, but she was not as sly as she had thought she had been, not when she reached over the man's beer for a napkin but hesitated long enough to dump something into it first.
    </p>
    <p>
     No way.
    </p>
    <p>
     No
     <em>
      fucking way.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, Rio's heart was hammering in her chest, thundering in her ears. She had seen it, she had watched this woman drop some kind of substance into the man she had met's beer and was acting completely cool about it. The truth was, that woman could disappear into thin air and Rio never would have been able to identify her. That alone was another annoyance that Rio found herself adding to her growing list.
    </p>
    <p>
     Minutes later, the man returned and, as predicted, resumed the task of consuming his beer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had hardly torn her eyes away from that back of chiffon and skin and tangled hair, aching for the woman to just turn around so that she might have even a glimpse of what she looked like. Rio had never actually anticipated getting this far and as such, she was scrambling to put together a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman was still flirty, still touchy, but the effects of the drug started to become apparent in the man's form and how it had started to slacken. It was clear that the window for this woman to make her move was closing; she didn't want him to be so fucked up that she couldn't get him out of the bar. Rio simply watched, waiting for it to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, it did.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman leaned across the bar and paid the bartender, slipping her an additional tip before she grabbed the man's hand and stood from her stool.
    </p>
    <p>
     At long last, she turned around.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dress was even more stunning from a frontal view, but the true heart stopper was just how fucking beautiful the woman was. That hair framed her face so well, soft against the sharp angles of her jaw, her cheekbones, her nose. She was frighteningly stunning and, if Rio was right, she was undeniably deadly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although they did not lock with Rio's own, it was also very clear that the woman had the most breathtakingly blue eyes, even in the rather dim light of the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman was a sight, and it was no wonder these men were beguiled enough to succumb to her prowess and charm. She still radiated nothing but confidence, even as the man threw and arm around her shoulder and let her escort him out of the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a fight, but Rio diverted her eyes, pretending to scroll at something on her phone as it laid atop the table in front of her. She didn't want the woman to catch her staring, though as She passed by, Rio could
     <em>
      swear
     </em>
     she felt the heat of Her stare. And then? Then She was gone and Rio was sat in that booth realizing that she suddenly had another decision that needed to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
     The opportunity was right there in front of her and all she had to do was take it and not be completely obvious about it. Or, she could just sit there like an idiot and give up the entire night's mission because she was what? Afraid? Nervous?
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck that. Rio had come this far. To let Her get away was stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a little less than a quarter of her beer left as she abandoned it on the table, grabbing her phone and keys as she calmly made her exit and ventured toward her car. On her journey, those dark and excited eyes scanned over the parking lot, finally spotting what she had been hoping to: after the sound of a car door slamming, the woman came around the back end of a Lexus SUV and hurried into the driver's side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stalled and deathly still, Rio waited for the SUV to start before she scrambled the rest of the way to her car and climbed in, waiting only a moment as the woman pulled out of the parking lot behind the bar and onto the street to the right. She could use a little bit of a head start as to not make Rio's attempt at following Her
     <em>
      completely
     </em>
     obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Rio pulled out onto the street, the tail lights of the Lexus were still visible and she could see the body of the car as it passed beneath the occasional street lamp. She was vigilant, paying close attention when the woman would make a turn or stall a little too long at a stop sign. She kept that distance, now having become the one stalking her prey.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not wish to devour this woman, did not wish to flay her alive. No, Rio just needed the insatiable pit of curiosity within herself to be filled with the knowledge that had been so fucking elusive to her up to that point. She just wanted an answer, an explanation for something that seemed to have none. She wanted to know how it was that this woman was killing these men with nothing short of magic, and she was willing to do anything to get results.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being confined to the city streets kept their speeds low, but Rio hadn't lost sight of the woman's vehicle longer than it took to catch up to a corner and take the turn. She recognized that they were heading west, progressing at a snail's pace toward the edge of the city. Rio knew that she could
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     lose Her before She left the municipality and hit country roads or else she would wind up bountiless and disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The overhead lamps started to grow sparse, illuminating less and less of the road they were traversing, even if Rio was maintaining a healthy gap between them. The neighborhoods began to dwindle and the space between homes started to grow. And then, the vast emptiness of farmland opened up ahead of the SUV in front of her, if only by a hundred yards or so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched as the Lexus picked up speed and she did as well, not wanting to squander what was right in front of her. She had somehow gotten this far and the last thing she wanted to do was see it speed off into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     The little car rocketed forward, keeping an even pace with the SUV as they wound out into the country, leaving bound and determined to not let Her get away.
    </p>
    <p>
     They drove, and they drove.
    </p>
    <p>
     They drove even longer, to a point where they had been out of the city for twenty-five minutes and had taken minimal turns. With their location, Rio had eased up on her tailing, leaving a quantifiable amount of distance between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another five minutes passed and something unexpected happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman's brake lights came on. She slowed rather quickly, and then pulled off to the side of the road, her hazard lights beginning to flash in the darkness of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had no other choice than to keep driving. She couldn't stop; that would be obvious. She couldn't turn around; that would be even
     <em>
      more
     </em>
     obvious and would take about a ninety-six point turn that could not be pulled off without an embarrassing and awkward display.
    </p>
    <p>
     All she could do was keep going forward and that fact alone pissed her off beyond measure. All she had wanted was a fucking answer and now, she was going to have to drive right by the possibility of getting one. Perhaps she should wave at it in longing as she passed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her speed decreased only slightly, but Rio had maintained every intention of continuing forth only to wind her way back toward the city and back to her empty apartment and awaiting cat who was surely annoyed that she had not been home at the proper time to give him his wet food. He'd get over it, but it angered Rio even more because it had been for absolutely nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she had at least returned home having succeeded in her mission, that would be one thing. At least then, his suffering would have come only at the cost of her accomplishment. Now, there was nothing to show for her effort and it was discouraging. Rio pressed on, ready to turn it in for the night, but as she got a good fifty feet away, the door to the SUV flew open and the woman was climbing out.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a reaction that caused Rio's body to lurch forward as a result of the force, she stomped on the brake and threw her car into park. Her eyes were wild as she tried to understand what was happening, watching as the woman marched out into the street, hair more like a lion's mane and less like a halo, even though it was catching the headlights just right.
    </p>
    <p>
     The most noticeable thing about her presence in those moments was not her hair, or her dress, or that positively and ferally insane look in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, the most noticeable thing about the woman standing in the middle of a country road in the middle of the night, staring dead ahead, was the fact that she was holding a pistol. Not only was she holding a pistol, but she was pointing it directly at Rio, who had both of her hands up in an instant in surrender.  Truth be told, Rio was not even certain the woman could see her with the way the headlights were shining in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was what she had asked for, wasn't it? Rio had wanted an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had one, now.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was very apparent, very loud:
    </p>
    <p>
     FUCK OFF.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     "Out!"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was demanding, it was forceful. It was a command that Rio
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to obey, but she felt like she had been chilled to the bone, frozen in place.
    </p>
    <p>
     The beautiful, stunning, authoritative, cold, calculating
     <em>
      killer
     </em>
     was standing several yards away, pointing a gun directly at her. She had offered her command and it did not seem as though it was negotiable in any way. She wanted Rio out of the car and Rio
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     she needed to comply, but there was no possible way this ended well for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I said OUT!" she woman shouted again, but this time it came with advancement as she paced forward, flicking the gun to the side in indication. She seemed to believe that her previous two requests had not been enough to signify what it was she was looking for. "Get out of the fucking car!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Like being hit with lightning, life surged back into Rio's form and the thoughts began to barrel forward, tangling and knotting in an incoherent mess. Sucking in a sharp breath, her right hand began to move, contorting so that she could point downward to indicate her seatbelt. Apparently the woman had gotten close enough to make her out and gave a curt nod of approval. Slowly, Rio reached down, still leaving her left hand up, so that she could unbuckle her seatbelt and slide it over her left side.
    </p>
    <p>
     With an overabundance of caution, Rio reached for the handle and popped the door open, using her foot to shove it open so that her hands could remain visible as she climbed out of the car. She could already feel the beads of sweat that were rolling down the back of her neck and was almost certain she could actually taste her heart as she chewed on it in those moments.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hands still raised, she kicked the door shut, seemingly not concerned with the fact that the car was still running.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You a cop?" the woman called, voice razor sharp on the other side of that gun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's chest was heaving, her mind was racing. She knew that the best option here was to be honest, to just tell the truth, but was
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     even believable? That she was a morgue attendant who had become unnecessarily fixated on finding out how, exactly, she was killing men that were nearly twice her size?
    </p>
    <p>
     Her head shook, but it wasn't enough of an answer for the other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I said are you a fucking cop?!" she asked again, voice slicing cleanly through Rio's chest, stilling her heart for the length of several beats before it jumped back into rhythm again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "N-No! N-Not a cop!" Rio croaked, thoroughly startled by how fucking weak her voice sounded.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman was immobile, lit up by the light pouring out from the front of the car, her anger and alarm so plainly broadcasted on her expression. She looked devastatingly furious in a way Rio had never witnessed before in another human being.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't kill women," she shouted informatively, the edge in her words not nearly as lethal. "But I'll make a goddamn exception if you're lying to me!" There it was, right back as if it had never left, though this time that edge was
     <em>
      coated
     </em>
     in venom.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not a fucking cop!" Rio spat back, garnering a little more strength than she'd been able to muster previously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then why are you stalking me?!" the woman barked, though her voice distanced the slightest bit as she looked over her shoulder at her own vehicle for the quickest moment. There were the slightest traces of alarm as they twisted and pinched at the muscles in her features.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I -- I'm not!" Rio yelled back, hands still up in her surrender. This woman could just fucking shoot her, get back in her car, and take off. It was that easy. It would be that simple and Rio would simply bleed out in the middle of some back-ass road where she likely wouldn't even be found until morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     This had been stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
     This woman had gotten away with five impossibly complex murders in just under a month and was well on her way to completing number six, but Rio had thrown a wrench in such a plan, if only for the time being. She could just as easily make Rio number seven and toss the pistol in a nearby river, never thinking twice about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     What had ever made Rio think she could follow her without being clocked? What had she been thinking, acting like this was a sane or rational thing to do?
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman looked over her shoulder again and then back to Rio, inching forward half a step. "I saw you at the bar! You've been following me the entire time! If you're not a cop, why the fuck are you following me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Her volume was raising again and the tone she was choosing was bordering on threatening. It was clear that Rio had spooked her and as a result, she was baring her teeth. She was showing her power as an intimidation tactic and Rio would have been lying if she tried to say it wasn't working. The truth was, she was amazed that she hadn't pissed herself yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Never before had Rio been face to face with the fuck-around end of a gun and she had quickly realized that it was not somewhere she liked being. All this woman had to do was apply the right amount of pressure and it was
     <em>
      over
     </em>
     for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She needed to say something. This dangerous woman was demanding an answer to a very forceful question and yet, Rio wasn't sure what the right one here was. If she told her the truth, it wasn't going to earn her a one-woman show. If she lied, it was very possible that whoever this woman was, she could simply choose to squeeze the trigger and put an end to the life of County Coroner Rio Vidal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then who would feed Phineas?
    </p>
    <p>
     "WELL?!" came the woman's pressured prompting, soles of her heels scuffing the asphalt as she edged forward again, her arm tightening as she shoved the pistol forward. "Why are you following me?!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The last word had barely left her lips by the time Rio was shouting her answer back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know why you do it!" she managed, though it was far louder than the squeak she had thought it would end up being. "I know why you kill them!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't see her face clearly because of the way she was holding the gun, but the woman's expression was just visible enough that Rio could see the shock as it began to seep into her form, the weight of understanding pulling her down. She drew in a sharp breath, taking two full steps this time, leaving the muzzle of the gun only a couple of feet from Rio's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's not an answer," she sneered, causing a painful chill to fire straight up Rio's spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Honesty hour it was, then.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I... I --" she stammered, trying to swallow down the mouthful of sand that had developed the moment she braved to stare down the barrel of the pistol. "I just --"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I swear to fucking God," the woman threatened, arm straightening again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I just want to know how!" Rio screamed back, her breath jamming in her throat in a manner that made her cough and sputter. It had scared the fuck out of her to be so forthright, but it seemed to win her some favor. The woman shuffled back a few inches, but she did not lower the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you mean you
     <em>
      want to know how?
     </em>
     " she clipped venomously, posture stiffening at such an idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked; this woman didn't seem dense and yet, she seemed completely confounded by Rio's request. It was simple enough, wasn't it? She just needed the knowledge. All she had to do was just tell Rio and Rio would happily get in her car and drive home. She would pretend like this had never happened, like she had never seen that woman before a day in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even more, she would go into work and by noon, Alice would roll in with a man on a cart that had a severed spinal cord and no other indication as to why he was dead. When that time came, Rio would act like she was still angry and indignant over the fact that she still 'could not figure it out.' She just needed to be told, first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean I... I just...
     <em>
      need
     </em>
     to know how you do it... How you can sever the entire spinal cord and just... not leave a single mark. And the pinprick bruising on the chest... What's the point? Is it a red herring? To make it seem occult? Or do you prop them on a stand that's shaped like a pentagram? And Rohypnol? How do you move that much dead weight once you get out of town? I --"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jesus fucking Christ, Miss Marple," the woman snapped, silencing Rio in the middle of her ramblings. "I didn't ask twenty questions for you to give twenty fucking answers." Again, her head snapped over her shoulder and the alarm was a little more prevalent when she turned back around.
    </p>
    <p>
     She seemed to consider the situation for a moment. Rio could see them, the thoughts as they rolled through her head and wrote themselves for Rio to bear witness to on her face. She was clearly warring with herself and judging by the way she kept looking over her shoulder, she realized that the time she had to get where she was going had started to dwindle as a direct result of this interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     tell you," she offered, but Rio could tell she wasn't going to. What Rio did
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     see coming was the next offer that followed up the first. "But I could also show you."
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      NO! Say no! What the fuck, Rio?! She can
      <b>
       show
      </b>
      you how she's fucking killing men?! What the fuck?!?!?! SAY NO!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her internal monologue was practically screeching at her, shouting and screaming and wailing and bellowing. It didn't matter, it was never going to be louder than the sirens that were blaring, telling her she had what she wanted right there, right in front of her, and all she had to do was agree.
    </p>
    <p>
     She
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     to say yes. It wasn't even an option at that point.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sh-show me?" Rio stammered, seeking clarification. She needed to know that this was not a stunt, that it was not some way for this woman to isolate her further just to kill her off.
    </p>
    <p>
     That would have stupid. She could have killed her already and been on her way. If she had, she'd likely have been a lot less pissy because there would have been minimal risk of her guest coming-to in the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I'll show you. But we have to go."
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, so... this was happening. She was being serious. She wanted Rio to follow her. It had suddenly become the most insurmountable task just to breathe, but Rio sure as fuck was trying with all of her might.
    </p>
    <p>
     In and out. In and out. In and out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Breathe, idiot. Breathe and
     <em>
      answer
     </em>
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Follow me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, the gun lowered and Rio could see her fully, clearly. She still looked wildly irate and irritated beyond measure, but she seemed serious in her offer. "It's not far from here. Stay close."
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, the woman climbed back into her vehicle and slammed the door shut with a thunderous force that left Rio feeling two inches tall. As she started to pull back on the road, Rio found a sudden urgency to get her ass back into her car and do as she had been instructed. She was quick in getting situated, throwing the car into drive as she pressed the gas in an attempt to catch up.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman had been right. They'd only driven for a few more minutes before she turned off to the left. Rio was not at all surprised when they hit a dirt road that was entirely riddled with potholes and divots that Rio's tiny car was most certainly not built to handle. After another minute, the Lexus veered off to the right and stopped, but it did not shut off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched, leaning over her steering wheel for a better view, as the woman marched up to the doors of the barn to unlock and open them. Before she ventured back toward her car, she waved a hand in Rio's direction, a call for her attention. Rio rolled down the window, tilting her head so that she could hear any direction offered a little better.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Park around back," the woman demanded and Rio nodded, following the command to a t. Once she had pulled around and shut the car off, she was not surprised to find the woman waiting at the mouth of the barn for her arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio started to walk inside, she was stopped by the woman's firm palm on her chest. It was the lightest contact, not forceful by any means and yet, Rio could
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     the raw strength in the touch. Her suddenly wide gaze snapped toward the brunette as she drew in a sharp breath. Not only was this woman touching her, but this woman was
     <em>
      touching
     </em>
     her, directly in the center of her sternum in that fucking dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those blue eyes damn near sparkled in the moonlight, shimmering with a staunch sense of righteousness and determination. Her voice was chilled and hollow when She spoke, offering Rio a piece of advice before she made a choice that would likely change her life forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Once you step inside, there's no going back. And if I go down, you go down with me. Am I understood?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was ominous and it felt akin to a threat, but Rio simply nodded her understanding. She didn't feel the need to point out that this woman did not know who she was or anything about her other than the fact that she was stupid enough to agree to this just to finally obtain an understanding of something that had skated around the edges of her comprehension for far too long.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I understand," Rio forced out, trying to deliver an assured nod in assistance, but it was barely a bob of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't make me regret this. I don't
     <em>
      like
     </em>
     killing women, so don't make me start now," that smooth but low voice warned, those dangerous blue eyes boring straight into Rio's as she listened.
    </p>
    <p>
     That time, she did not offer a verbal agreement, but the reservation of energy allowed her to give a more assertive nod of her head. She swallowed down the fear and the nerves that had bunched up somewhere in the center of her throat and drew in a deep breath. This was it. She was making this choice and once both of her feet passed over that threshold, there was no turning back.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was a commitment to something Rio
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have called the police. She should have walked away. She should have gotten in her car and driven away. All of the things she should have done and yet, she chose to do the one thing she should
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     have done.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stepped inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took mere seconds for the woman to begin blowing around, not faltering in the slightest over the uneven ground in those heels as she pulled the doors shut and locked them with a large wooden plank that settled into hooked metal arms; no one was getting inside unless She decided they would.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stay out of the way," She ordered, waving a hand that said she wanted Rio to move. Immediately, she volunteered compliance and removed herself entirely, giving Her the space she needed to tend to the purpose for their occupancy in the run-down and bordering on dilapidated barn. Rio watched in interest as the woman collected a dolly and wheeled it over toward the passenger's side of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     The view had been obscured by the body of the vehicle; that wasn't good enough, so Rio shuffled to the side. It wasn't painfully obvious that she was fixated, but she peeked around to watch as the woman lifted the man out of the car and propped him on the dolly. It was clearly modified to suit this need for her, but it was... interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had she crafted it herself? Did she know someone who had helped her build such equipment? If so, how had she explained that away?
    </p>
    <p>
     There were already a plethora of questions beginning to brew in Rio's mind, but she stayed silent in her observance of the woman's work. She tipped the dolly back and began moving, wheeling the man to a large steel table, one that had leather straps worked into the steel, sticking up and unfastened.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was not close enough to see, but there was something different about the table. It didn't make sense, but something about it
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     different. It was a little lower than the tables she had in the morgue, but there appeared to be small divots toward the top, though she couldn't quite make them out. It was perplexing, to say the least, and Rio could already feel herself growing antsy at the idea of having to endure the process in order to discover the functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to endure the process. All Rio wanted was the end result.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she was not stopping to consider was that the end result here included a dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman lined up the dolly perfectly with the end of the table and tipped it forward, causing the man's dead weight to slump forward, slamming face-first onto the steel tabletop. It was almost comical, but Rio was far too enraptured by what was unfolding right before her to give it much of a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     She instead opted to stay silent, to keep to herself as the woman worked. She hooked the man beneath the arms and pulled him up the length of the table. Once she had gotten him where she needed him, the woman tended to wiggling and sliding him around in the minutia, making the tiniest adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
     Face down on that steel table, Rio watched with morbid fascination as the man's wrists were bound one at a time, and then his ankles. His feet hung over the edge of the table -- one of his shoes had fallen off at some point -- and every single inch of the front of his body was forcefully flush with the surface beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the woman finished fastening the last strap around his ankle, the man's head began to rock slightly. A deep groan rumbled low in his lungs, but it was silenced as the woman jerked his sock off and marched up, forcefully cramming it into his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     There Rio stood, nearly shitting herself, as she watched in a complete state of immobility while this woman prepared to
     <em>
      kill
     </em>
     this man. She had some righteous public-serving agenda here, clearly, and Rio knew that if she tried to intervene it would not end well, but the full gravity had yet to really pull her in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where she was, in those moments, was a suspended state of fascination. She needed to just
     <em>
      get
     </em>
     it. Maybe then she might find peace. Maybe then she might be able to shake the thoughts that had been knotting her up for weeks over this woman and her brazenly successful attempts to eradicate souls that radiated nothing more than malice and cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was something so fluid and... well, so beautiful about the way this woman before her was moving like a well-oiled machine. She had this down to a science, knew exactly what she was doing. It was clear that Rio's appearance had rattled and she kept glancing up to check that Rio had not bolted, grumbling something under her breath each time that Rio could not quite make out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither of them had anticipated this turn in their evenings, but there they were, and Rio was rooted to where she stood. She was unable and unwilling to blink more than necessary out of fear that she might miss something vital or crucial to truly having a comprehensive analysis of what had been plaguing her mind for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the man was immobile and silent, the woman paced over to a large stainless steel set of drawers, not hesitating to pull open the top one. Immediately, she reached inside and grabbed hold of something, though Rio could not quite make it out from where she was. Cautiously, she took a step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman's head whipped up, her eyes filled with a primal crackling of light at the sound of Rio's shoes scuffing over the dirt. To show she had no ill intentions, Rio's hands were back up in a gesture reminiscent of when she had gotten out of the car, a clear showing that she was not there to cause any issue, but simply to observe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her dark gaze dropped to the woman's hand and what she was clutching within it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that... Is that it? What... What you use?" Rio managed, though her voice cracked and broke as she tried to force the question out.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman did not voice a response. She simply nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     She did not offer it for inspection but instead plucked it into a pinched grip in her other hand. By doing so, Rio could see it better.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a cuff, a collar of sorts. It was open, but only because the pronged ends slid into the table the man was strapped to. It clearly went around his neck, but... There were still unanswered questions in regards to the mechanics. Before Rio could ask, the woman found her words first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's a blunt edged rib of metal inside here," She explained, holding the collar up so that Rio was able to see it better. In the dim lights of the barn, she could see the tiniest glint of the interior piece of metal.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made so much sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of announcing that she suddenly understood, Rio tipped her head in silent acknowledgement. The woman took it for what it was and set to her work, sliding the collar over the mans neck, pressing until it clicked into place in the table. At the same time, she had grabbed a hand full of his hair so that she could rearrange his head to rest with his face smashed against the cold steel below him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only thing Rio had
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     caught sight of were the five small prongs of metal that had been welded to the table, elevating the man's torso the tiniest amount.
    </p>
    <p>
     The brunette shifted, planting herself toward the head of the table. She surveyed her prize, looking him over from heel to head before her hand found his hair, gripping it tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know why, but the way the woman's attention snapped up and that weapon of a gaze found her felt like a bolt had been shot through her chest. It felt harder to breathe, like it took more conscious thought to replicate what should have been a mindless action. She managed it, though she was immediately holding her breath when the woman started to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know what it is you're expecting out of this --" She gave a rough pull on the man's head, but because of the way the collar had been snugly fixed around his neck, there had been no movement. The lack of space had ensured that the only thing that happened there was that the metal rib dipped into his physicality and did exactly as it was designed to do: it severed his spinal cord and his entire body went limp as his head lulled just slightly to the side. " -- but that's all there is to it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Her tone was so calm, so cool, and so completely empty of any emotion. It was as though her words had been filtered through steel and were stripped of any and all emotion that
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     have found them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was numb, from head to toe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just like that, the man was dead, and there the woman stood not having even broken into a sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was mechanical, it was a process, it was so... devoid of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a way, Rio felt as though in a matter of seconds, she had just
     <em>
      broken.
     </em>
     She wanted to say something, wanted to move, but too many things were happening at once. She was blinking, processing, making sense of the fact that she had literally just witnessed the most efficient and clean murder she had ever fathomed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The effortlessness that the woman before her was exuding was verging on absolute psychopathy... But...
    </p>
    <p>
     It was also creating a familiar but unwelcome sensation low in the pits of Rio's middle, inching downward in a dangerous fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Th-That's... You... I --"
    </p>
    <p>
     "You asked for it. There it was. The rib does all the work. No mark, no magic. Just physics."
    </p>
    <p>
     Just physics.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Just physics?!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Who the fuck applied physics to a restraining collar that was capable of severing the spinal cord with a light jerk? It made no fucking sense. Even the explanation of fucking
     <em>
      physics
     </em>
     didn't quite strike Rio as enough, but she didn't know what other questions to ask. She was spinning on a loop, running on a wheel like the inch tall rodent she felt herself to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been so convinced that if she knew, it would make things better. If she knew, she could stop wrestling with the frustration of feeling so inadequate that she could not figure it out. She had been
     <em>
      so fucking committed
     </em>
     to the idea that knowing would solve all of her problems.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, she had even
     <em>
      more
     </em>
     questions and with the way the woman had started moving, Rio realized that she was not going to be getting those answers any time soon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still methodical and measured, the woman moved with grace as she unbuckled the straps and removed the collar. Before she started to move the body, though, Rio inched forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can... May I?" she question, her voice mousy and tight. Her gaze flickered to the man's neck and the woman on the other side of the table dipped her head in agreement. Rio shuffled forward but kept her distance. Not a trace of her -- skin, hair,
     <em>
      anything
     </em>
     -- could be found on this man or her life would be over as she knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
     As her assessment began, she could see the faintest red line, but it appeared to be fading right before her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How --" she started, but the woman launched a hand up to silence her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nope. Not the deal. You're not interrogating me. This might have been idiotic on my part, but I'm not stupid enough to explain every detail. You wanted to know? Now you know." Despite the fact that she had started to move the body, no trace of her effort touched her voice. It was almost freakish in nature how she was able to handle this.
    </p>
    <p>
     That man was at least two hundred pounds of literal dead weight and while her form was strained, the woman looked like she was capable of doing this in her sleep. She slid him down the table and back into the dolly, having placed stoppers behind the wheels to keep it from moving too much.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had really thought of
     <em>
      everything.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She was literally a killing machine. This was just an operation to her, a duty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was positively stunned by what had unfolded in the last five minutes and she had no blueprint for where the fuck she was supposed to go from there. Instead, she just watched in abject fascination as the woman loaded the man into the back of the SUV and shut the hatch, as if she were loading up the week's trash to be disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even as the woman removed the brace from the door and pulled it open so she could leave, Rio had not moved an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright, well... Have a good night," the woman offered, lifting two fingers to tap her forehead before offering a salute of farewell. She angled to the right and started to head toward the car, but in a move of pure possession, Rio reached out for her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could feel the muscles beneath her fingertips as the woman tightened and spun on her, that very terrifying look filling her eyes. They dropped to Rio's hand and lifted again in silent demand that she explain herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I... That's it? I'm just supposed to leave?" Rio asked, her brow pinching tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," the woman responded flatly, blinking at Rio like there would have ever been any other answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was right. Rio knew she was right. She hadn't owed her a thing, but she had given Rio the answer to a question she had been asking for weeks, and
     <em>
      no one
     </em>
     could ever know that she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now let go of me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked down at the contact, but she did not release it, not even as she looked back into the woman's white-hot gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me your name," Rio requested, her voice soft but a little louder than a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the woman did was laugh, right before she yanked her arm out of Rio's hold. "Oh, pretty girl," she chastised, elegantly striding toward the helm of the car, "this decision could absolutely be a false flag of my ignorance, but do not mistake me for a fool."
    </p>
    <p>
     She stopped, just outside the door, her hand hovering over the handle. With what appeared to be a second thought, she turned on her heel and strode back over toward where Rio was planted. The closer she got, Rio had thought there would come a point when she stopped. Instead, Rio was almost convinced that they were going to collide.
    </p>
    <p>
     With an inch between them, the woman stopped moving everywhere except her head which bobbed forward, chin tucking over Rio's shoulder. Her lips were
     <em>
      so very close
     </em>
     to Rio's ear.
     <em>
      So close
     </em>
     , in fact, that Rio instantly felt her breath as it licked and lapped at every divot and crease there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Trying to will away the immediate throbbing between her legs that had no rational explanation, her eyes slid shut and head head tipped back. Her lips parted, but no sound emerged, even if an uneven breath shook its way out.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Maybe if you tell me yours, I'll find you first."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything that was happening inside of Rio's body and mind wanted her to simply combust. This should not have been effecting her the way it was, should have had such a vice grip on her. It was an instance that assaulted all senses, that made her feel overloaded. She could smell the woman's perfume as it mixed with her shampoo, could hear the slight hitch in Her breath. She could see the thinnest sheen of sweat as it had coated Her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio should have kept her mouth shut. She should have placed more distance between them and walked out of that barn. Again, there were a list of things that she
     <em>
      should
     </em>
     have done and instead, she made another choice to do something she should
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     have done.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "It's Rio. Rio Vidal."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The sinister hum of satisfaction that left the woman caused Rio's skin to prick with goosebumps, her heart freezing over in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Well then, Rio Vidal,"
     </em>
     came a sultry purr that did unimaginable things to Rio's brain,
     <em>
      "I suppose I'll be seeing you."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She did not speak another word, just turned her head so that her lips
     <em>
      just barely
     </em>
     skimmed Rio's ear before she turned on her heel and made her way to her car. The engine started and she began to back out, her gaze pinning Rio in silent instruction to move as she passed by. In accordance, Rio shuffled out of the barn and simply watched the woman seal it up before climbing back into her car.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before it started moving again, the woman's curious gaze found her one last time, and then she backed her way down the drive and found the dirt road just to disappear into the night. There, resolute in her confusion, Rio stood just staring off into the darkness, the pitch black of the Illinois countryside.
    </p>
    <p>
     All she could think in that moment was one solitary thing:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What the fuck did I just do?
     </em>
    </p>

     It had taken Rio close to twenty minutes to start up that tiny Tiburon. It had taken her an additional five to find the ability to shift gears into drive and pull out from behind the ramshackle barn to find her way back to the city. Back to her apartment. Back to her cat who was surely losing his mind over the fact that she was not home for him to crawl into bed with.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back to her life where she was not supposed to have the knowledge she now had.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back to her job where she would have to feign anger in front of Alice, as if she had not borne witness to the exact cause of these deaths, and the person responsible for them.

     responsible, as she had known all along. Everyone else had their assumptions, but Rio's gut had not led her astray anywhere throughout her search.
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <em>
      beautiful
     </em>
     woman responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <em>
      genius
     </em>
     beautiful woman responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio pulled into the parking garage attached to her apartment, all she felt capable of doing was cursing herself. She had fucked up. She hadn't just fucked up as in 'oopsie.' She had fucked up in the sense that if this ever hit the light of day, she was done for. Not only would she be unemployed, but she would be sitting in a prison cell for the rest of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was too pretty for prison.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was also too soft for it, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     With those facts taken into consideration, Rio knew she had no other choice than to act right and not let even the slightest flicker of that night find its way to the surface. This was something she had to bury, much in the same way she had to bury her humanity when she was dissecting and examining human bodies for a living.
    </p>
    <p>
     This could never see the light of day or her life was over, and Rio wasn't ready for that to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she had guessed, Phineas was poised only a foot away from the front door as she slinked through it, her mind still a complete tangle of thoughts and emotions and images that she could not seem to sort out. She could see the woman as she moved about like it was child's play to kill a man. She could hear the woman's chilling but stern voice as if she were whispering in Rio's ear again. She
     <em>
      swore
     </em>
     she could even still smell her perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
     After tending to Phineas by means of food and fresh water, Rio sulked off to strip down and shower, somehow of the mind that maybe it might rinse off the shame she was feeling at how... unbothered she was by all of it. Yes, it was startling. But it had also been so easy and that fact alone was just as jarring in its own right.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no emotion there, no suffering or cries or pleading for her to spare his life.
    </p>
    <p>
     That man had sipped at that beer, none-the-wiser that it would be his last, and that it would be the reason he would simply cease to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
     It should have revolted Rio, should have made her sick. It
     <em>
      should
     </em>
     have been repulsive that someone could claim a life with such finesse and little remorse. Yet, Rio stood in the shower, washing herself clean and fixating on every single detail she could remember, both about the woman and about what she had witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had started with the method of it all, the way that woman had planned out every single aspect. She held the meeting, was casual while dosing the man, helped him out innocently to an awaiting car and drove. She drove and drove until no one would notice her anymore. Once stashed away from the world, her transport had been crafted to minimize effort. The trip might have been short, car to table, but it lessened the physical force she had to exert.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even after those brilliant measures came the table. Rio wanted to know how she'd gotten both the table as well as the collar crafted without question or suspicion. It was something new that she absolutely
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     to know. How did this remarkably poised and insanely beautiful woman pull in all of these parts and pieces to be nothing more than a black widow in the night, her venom soaking the blunt rib inside of that collar?
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearly, her appearance was lending to the fact that she kept getting away with it. It left Rio wondering who this woman was, what it was she did for a living that allowed her to own secluded property and wear expensive dresses and smell as though she'd spritzed thousands of dollars onto her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could she drive a nice car and consistently meet men in bars and flag absolutely no attention? Rio's inference had been right in that this woman was hunting in that bar in particular and yet, no one seemed to notice a thing, not as it was happening and definitely not the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's mind continued to wander, to play through the footage of how practiced and methodical She had been as she had secured the man to the table. She had brandished that collar like it was a source of pride for her, a devious and devilish glare to the snarling grin she'd worn as she had shown it off.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck she was so beautiful in the most goddamn dangerous way.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought happened at the same time something else did: Rio's hand had apparently started sliding down her stomach, her fingers finding sensitive and slick flesh as those flashes of the woman flickered in and out of focus.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      FUCK! NO!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whipped her hand back and grunted in frustration. What the fuck was she
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     doing?! This was nothing but sheer madness mixed with a healthy dose of sheer stupidity and she was slowly losing her grip on all that was sane and made sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because honestly?
    </p>
    <p>
     None of this made any fucking sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     What the fuck did it mean that she had been so willing to watch the most damning crime? What the
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     did it mean that as Rio had watched the woman glide about, doing what she set out to do, Rio had been
     <em>
      turned on?!
     </em>
     And now, it was happening AGAIN?!
    </p>
    <p>
     It was idiotic. It was irrational.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was fucking dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a flick of the shower knob, the stream shut off and Rio stood there, staring at the low level of water as it began to swirl and disappear down the drain, taking the last remnants of her sanity with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had to distract herself. There was still a tall boy in the fridge and even though it was nearing 1 in the morning, she still had to be up and getting ready for work in just over five hours. She could drink the beer, climb into bed and hopefully find a way to stop thinking about the way her night had unfolded.
    </p>
    <p>
     If only.
    </p>
    <p>
     The beer had been consumed in its entirety and yet, even buzzed, Rio couldn't stop dwelling. She was ruminating and living in the memory of that dank and dusty barn, the smell of mildew and musk burning her nose. It didn't matter that she hadn't been there in hours because in her mind, it was as if she had never left at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas had followed her down the hall and into the bedroom, easily hopping up into his place at the foot of the bed, tucked in his little corner. It took him little time to curl up into a large ball, snug and tight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Snug and tight, Rio thought, just like that collar.
    </p>
    <p>
     How had she made it? What had given her the idea? How had she known it would work?
    </p>
    <p>
     Even as Rio laid down and turned off the bedside lamp, closing her eyes did not help in getting the memories to desist. If anything, they became a more vivid display in front of the darkness of sealed vision.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman's pale skin had looked almost opaque in the moonlight outside of the barn and the way her eyes had absolute sparkled in their evil? It had been mystifying, captivating. It had been like falling into a trance, one Rio had not known how to break herself out of until the woman was urging her off the property.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having been completely fixated on watching her as she had moved about her domain in preparation for her kill, Rio had noticed a few things:
    </p>
    <p>
     1) The woman had two scars on her left arm, up toward the shoulder.
     <br/>
     2) The woman had
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     nice hands. Her fingers were long and nimble, precise.
     <br/>
     3) The woman was fucking
     <em>
      strong.
     </em>
     Even with the assistance of the dolly, the way she had moved that man around had made him seem no heavier than a sack of potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Subconsciously, Rio rolled to her back, feeling more than restless. Why wouldn't the images stop? Why couldn't she find it in her to just fucking rest when she had to wake up in four hours? It was becoming a nuisance, but those visuals kept looping. The only thing different she focused on was varying parts of the woman's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her neck, and how long it looked with the way her hair had framed it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands. Those damn gorgeous fucking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes, so hungry and angry and full of manufactured justice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her chest, exposed so blatantly by the neckline of her dress and the way it dipped
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     low.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't the only thing dipping low; Rio's hand hand started to wander, surfing over the soft cotton of her shirt where it covered her toned abdomen. It continued, fingertips pressing firmly into skin so that they could creep below the elastic that encircled her waist, keeping her shorts snug around her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Neck. Flexing and bulging muscles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hands. Careful and intentional.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eyes. Studious and sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Chest. Full and supple breasts barely hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's fingertips skated through the hair between her legs before sinking into desperate and dripping heat. Her knees bent slightly and she wiggled into a more comfortable position, head nestling deeper into the pillow below it. Her eyes remained closed, but her lips parted at the minor relief that came with feeling out her own body and the incriminating slick that had formed as a result of her evening's festivities.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh
     </em>
     what she would do to that neck. The marks she would leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's fingers were almost mindless in their movements, up and down, up and down, just dancing their way through her desire, that product of aching that she did not consciously dare admit to having.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh
     </em>
     those hands and how they would have felt, strongly gripping at her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, Rio's touch raised and began to trace the lightest circles around her clit, causing her hips to shift in automatic reaction. Those parted lips allowed for the gentlest and weakest moan to leave her, so quiet that it hardly reached the wall above her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh
     </em>
     what it would have been like to stare into those eyes while being at Her mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pressure increased as she found a rhythm, whisps of pleasure beginning to swirl in her stomach. The moment she drifted to the next thought, to the contrive image she managed to build herself, Rio's fingers slipped down and inward, pressing into herself with a much louder moan than the one she had tried to form earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh
     </em>
     what her skin would have tasted like, dewy with the sweat of her effort, as Rio kissed and sucked and licked at those luscious breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more she fantasized, the more her body chose to act on its own accord, hips shifting and jilting to accommodate more of her own touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     A new train of thought jumped onto the tracks as Rio's fingers pumped in and out of her soaking core:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh
     </em>
     what it would have felt like if they were Her fingers instead, filling her, bending her will by means of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was impossible not to feel the way her muscles tightened around her own fingers, those whisps becoming waves in the matter of a few seconds. They were getting closer to shore, closer to crashing right into her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those teeth, so polished and sharp as they were displayed in the most wicked sneers.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh
     </em>
     what those teeth could do to Rio. To her neck, her chest, her breasts, her stomach, her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     And
     <em>
      oh
     </em>
     what that tongue might be able to --
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Ohhh, fuck!"
     </em>
     Rio cried, her hips bucking up into her own palm. It was as if she were physically granting the permission to feel as much of herself as she could as she came to the thoughts of the most intriguing person Rio was certain she had ever come across, even if she
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     a murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the fact that the images had still not stopped and she
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to keep going, as the spasms began to lessen, Rio withdrew her fingers, allowing them to rest in their own mess atop the patch of hair at the apex of her lips. Her chest was heaving and a couple of beads of sweat had started to form near her temple.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time since she had laid down, Rio's eyes opened in the darkness, leaving her staring at the ceiling ten feet above her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pleasure began to ebb, her breathing slowing to a more reasonable pace as rationale and common sense began to fill her form again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh God.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh God.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What the fuck?!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What in the actual fuck?!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The hand she had not just used to pleasure herself raised, palm smacking to her forehead in a mildly painful display of just how fucking stupid she felt herself to be. No
     <em>
      fucking
     </em>
     way had she just fantasized about a literal fucking
     <em>
      serial killer
     </em>
     while she fucked herself to orgasm. Was she okay? There was no way she was
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     okay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Panic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Self-doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's head was spinning and after only a couple more minutes of getting lost in the severe moral breach that had occurred within her, she'd worked herself up enough that she launched herself out of bed and bolted to the bathroom. She fell to her knees before the toilet and immediately began to wretch inside, the beer foaming in a way that caused her to heave harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     What the fuck had she been thinking? Why on earth had she ever agreed to something she
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     was wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
     Because Rio's quest for knowledge apparently held more weight within her than her normally coveted moral compass. And, really, when it came to the morality of it all, didn't it fall into a grey area more than all else?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Morally
     </em>
     , what the woman was doing was... not exactly wrong. Yes, it was absolutely wrong to take a human life, but if that human life was a detriment to other human life... Was it really the worst thing?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was four-thirty in the fucking morning and there Rio lay, having an internal debate on whether or not murder was wrong if it happened in the right context. It was not a dilemma that she would have ever considered before, but as she tossed and turned, she kept thinking about that small little pull, the tiniest jerk that had just... snuffed out a life.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't even an effort for Her. Hell, the woman had put more effort into getting the man on the table and strapping him down than she did the actual act of killing him. That alone was something that perplexed Rio; the build-up was all work and for that kind of payoff? It might have made more sense if the kill was exhilarating, if it was violent and raw and full of emotion. But for it to be the slightest jerking of a head and that just be all there was to it?
    </p>
    <p>
     The climax felt anti-climactic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew now and yet, much to her own chagrin, she still didn't understand. The pieces made sense on their own; it was vigilantism in its most pure form. That alone was dangerous, but when welded to this woman's sheer brilliance and determination? Whoever She was, She was a human weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just before exhaustion won out and allowed Rio to slip off into sleep, she had a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the end of it all, she was damn lucky to be alive. What she had done was stupid, it was careless, and she needed to remind herself consistently that she could have wound up cold and riddled with bullet holes if the woman had been anyone else. For whatever reason, she'd decided to succumb to Rio's need to understanding and while it had panned out well enough, it had still been a very, very large risk.
    </p>
    <p>
     If nothing else, at least she lived to see another day.
    </p>
    <p>
     _________________
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio's alarm went off sixty-eight minutes later, it took every single ounce of will in her body to not launch her phone across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     She did not want to get out of bed. She did not want to wash her face and brush her teeth. She did not want to get dressed and drive to work. She did
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     want to see Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was going to see Alice, there was no question about that.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was also no question about the fact that when she did inevitably see Alice, she was going to be wheeling in a cart that carried the man from the night before, the one from the bar. She was going to bring him in and jabber at Rio about how for the sixth time in a month, another man was dead because his spinal cord was severed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was going to look Rio in the eye as they transferred the body bag and Rio was going to have to put on the best fucking show of her life. She was going to have to act, and acting was not a profession Rio had ever once considered. She wasn't the best liar, she got clammy under pressure and when things got to be a little too uncomfortable, she just laughed until she could make a quick exit to stave off any embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
     So how the fuck was she going to look her friend in the eye and act like she was angry that she still had no clue this was happening? Lying about the tox screen had been one thing, but this was another level entirely. It wasn't something she was proud of, but Rio knew it was a necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio chose to tell Alice the truth, there was no telling what Alice would do. On one hand, she would lose her fucking mind and call the cops right then and there until they beat Rio into submission and convinced her to give the woman up. That would never happen -- Rio didn't even know her name and she realized as she walked through the front doors of the municipal building how that specific choice had been by design for that very reason.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe the woman knew what she did for a living, maybe she didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she hadn't before, all it was going to take was a quick Google search of the name she had provided the night before and the woman would know who she was, what she did for work, where she went to college. Hell, she'd probably find several photos posted to Roscoe's Facebook page of her and Alice grinning like idiots while drunk off their asses.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was an entirely separate crisis to consider; she had just handed over the keys to her life when she had told the woman her name and now, she was realizing that she had placed herself right beneath Her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had every ability to make good on Her word and find Rio first. That both thrilled and horrified Rio for almost the exact same reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she had slid on her crisp white coat and went through her morning checklist, Rio had placed herself behind her desk and sipped at the coffee she had grabbed from the break room while looking over that morning's crossword puzzle. She always stole them out of the paper in the break room, no matter how many people it annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had not taken long for Alice to arrive with her first pick up. Instead of watching her sail in like she usually did, Rio was up and on her feet, curiosity winning out in spite of the fact that she was meant to be playing it cool and collected.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good morning!" she greeted brightly -- oh, this was going
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     poorly. Rio was being far more of a morning person than she usually was an Alice picked up on it immediately, though the way she chose to call it out was surprisingly gentle for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No crossword clue to bark at me today?" Alice question and Rio took the other end of the cart, though she didn't need to push much with the way Alice was already pulling the entirety of the weight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nope, hadn't really started on it today," Rio answered with a shrug as they lined up the steel tops so that they could shift the body to stability. "What do we have first thing this morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      White male, early thirties, dead but no visible cause. Likely a severed spinal cord.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Forty eight year old woman. Picked her up near Wicker Park in an abandoned house. If I had to call it, I'd say an overdose," Alice plied informatively as she released her hold on the bag and grabbed for the clipboard, as was routine.
    </p>
    <p>
     For just a moment, Rio had been listening to the Alice that had been speaking in her head that she had not understood what the real Alice had actually said. Rio blinked at her, the last word looping over and over again until she spoke it aloud in hopes that Alice might repeat herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "An overdose?" Rio asked, brow knitting to show that she didn't quite understand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, she has some track marks between her fingers," Alice answered easily, not realizing that Rio had not been having the same conversation she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Track marks. She.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't the man from the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something in Rio sank, but she fought to keep her expression neutral. She couldn't show that she was disappointed that she would not get a closer look at the man from the night before. At least, not right then. The day was still young, sure, and there was plenty of time left for Alice to show up with him, but Rio had been hoping it would be first thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was... fucked, wasn't it? Something had to be wrong with her that she was fucking
     <em>
      disappointed
     </em>
     that the first victim on her table was not the man she had watched die the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice didn't catch it, though. As Rio scribbled her signature on the paper and forked the clipboard back over, Alice was already tending to the pager that had sounded on her hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck. Looks like it's going to be a busy one today," she grumbled, tucking the clipboard back into its holder on the outside of the cart. "I've got two, so I'll probably just grab both at once and then head back here. I'll text you if I wind up at a cemetery."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was being funny. She was making a joke. It was something that was meant to make Rio laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio just realized it after two seconds too long, long enough to make it weird when she started laughing, completely delayed in the reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Maybe while I'm gone, you'll get through at least one cup of coffee and stop being weird."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, whoops. Maybe Alice was a little more perceptive than Rio was giving her credit for.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will try. I slept like shit, so no promises," Rio returned, following Alice out into the office area so that she could depart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Phineas taking up the whole bed again?" came Alice's teasing in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Doesn't he always?" Rio mused, removing her pen from behind her ear as she flipped it along her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have a good day, Rio," she offered as she slapped the button on the wall and the doors swung open to enable her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You too, Alice. See you soon."
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Rio set to work. It had taken her only a few minutes to determine that Alice had been correct and the woman had died as the result of an opioid overdose. It was an open and shut case, but she did her due diligence to make sure that everything else could be excluded. Once satisfied, Rio sewed the woman back up and tended to cleaning and storing her just in time for Alice to make her return.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This one can just go straight into cold storage," she offered, no greeting or quip beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah? You good?" Rio questioned, glancing down at the bag on the cart. It did not look like a fully grown adult. Her stomach sank, but Alice realized very quickly she needed to clarify.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's not a kid," she stated bluntly, though the expression she was wearing told Rio it was meant to soothe her. "It's just not all there. A lot of it was eaten by wildlife."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's lips turned down at the corners in a way that could have been a showing of her disappointment that her work was entirely unnecessary in that case. What it really symbolized was the fact that she thought it was Bar Man from the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you can grab it, I can go get the man of the hour."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew immediately what, exactly, Alice meant by that. She had recovered another man's body from another cemetery and it would inevitably be another case of a severed spinal cord with no other indication that the man should be dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Another one?" Rio asked, her eyes widening slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Six in less than five weeks," Alice agreed with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And they're still reluctant to call this what it is?" Rio posed, her right brow arching sharply in a slightly over-exaggerated manner. "Let me guess, they're still convinced this is a man, too."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice snorted, giving a shrug of her shoulders as Rio lifted the remains off of the cart and walked them over to the cold wall, pulling one of the drawers open with the toe of her shoe. Once she had tugged it far enough, she laid the bodybag gently inside and pressed it shut.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Be right back!" Alice shouted from the other side of the wall as she disappeared through the doors to retrieve her other delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, Rio knew what she was going to find when she opened that body bad. She knew that it would be the same motions that she'd been replicating for the last month, that she would find the same things she'd found every other time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The decision to be made was whether or not she was going to keep manufacturing the tox results to make it look like a shift in MO or if she would let it pass as it came through with the Rohypnol results.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was only one problem with that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Letting it through as normal would most certainly draw attention to the fact that while the actual kill had been the same, the previous tox report had been submitted bearing an anomaly. That could fall back on her and if it did? That meant a whole world of hurt and headache that she did not want to face.
    </p>
    <p>
     She never should have changed it in the first place. In doing so, she had created a snare and as it stood, her foot was right in the middle of it. One wrong move and she was going to hang herself out to dry.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Alice returned, Rio had somehow found a way to center herself, a way to tame the way her heart had started to sprint in her chest, running suicides back and forth. Once they had made the transfer and Alice had move the cart toward the entryway, Rio had not been expecting her to come back. A shout of farewell usually did the trick, but Alice stepped right up to the table as Rio unzipped the body bag.
    </p>
    <p>
     The one thing Rio could not give Alice right then was eye contact. If she looked Alice in the face after seeing the man that had spent almost an hour annoying the fuck out of the bartender at the bar that Rio had been staked out in the night before, she was going to crumble and her will to stay stoic would break in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
     She unzipped the bag and began to work, shimmying him out of it before she folded it and handed it over to Alice who took it but did not retreat to place it on her cart. She was still watching, though shew as doing it quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We're never going to figure it out," Rio finally announced, forcing a well of defeat to tug at the bottom of the statement. She needed it to sound like a fact, like it was something that Alice would believe without protest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wouldn't say never," Alice countered, trying to sound hopeful despite the circumstances. "It just might take us another twelve bodies."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed at the idea, and while it was a natural reaction, she was thankful for it. It had happened without thought and that was good; it was an indication that lying might prove to be a little easier than Rio had first considered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You think whoever's doing this will keep going for that long?" Rio asked, finally braving a glance at her friend. Thankfully, Alice seemed focused on the man on the table, so grey he was almost green.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Whoever it is, they don't seem to be slowing down. It's pretty much every three days at this point, right?" she posed, finally looking up to make eye contact with Rio. Surprisingly, Rio remained steely and firm in her facade to keep Alice from peering inside of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Three days," Rio repeated, her gaze dropping to a familiar face, one she had to look at like a stranger. "Every three days."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice started speaking, but whatever she wanted to say died on her tongue as her pager went off again and she heaved an annoyed sigh. "Break's over, I guess," she grumbled, fidgeting with the empty body bag in her hands. "See you in a bit, Rio. I heard Gina's ordering pizza for everyone today. Catch you in the break room for lunch?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course. I never turned down a five cheese," came Rio's light teasing. "Have fun, be safe, typical mom shpiel."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bye!"
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, the cart squeaked, the button clanged as Alice slapped at it, and she was off to make her next pickup.
    </p>
    <p>
     It
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     been three days.
    </p>
    <p>
     What if it was less?
    </p>
    <p>
     What if the woman's mission was to have a turnaround of one body a day? What would Alice have to say every single day when it was more and more of the same?
    </p>
    <p>
     The entire time she spent dissecting and cleaning the man before her, all she could think about was what he had looked like when he was alive. He had been cocky and arrogant, pissing off anyone close enough to hear him talk. He had thought that he was some kind of gift to the world and even if she had not been there to drug and kill him, the woman could have done ten times better than
     <em>
      him.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could have been better than him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh fuck, not again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had to stop thinking like that, had to stop fantasizing that the woman would ever actually make good on her word and come find her. It had been a tactic, nothing more, to just get Rio out of her way so she could move freely about the world again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, a thought struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she didn't want to wait for the woman to find her.
    </p>
    <p>
     What if she'd make her presence known even sooner?
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, that was what Rio decided to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     She went home, showered, spent half an hour with Phineas and made sure he was well fed before she grabbed her keys and blew out of her apartment. She was dressed in joggers and a form-fitting t-shirt that hugged her curves in all the right places, and while something in her wanted to drop the other woman's jaw, something in Rio had told her that her plan that night was not likely to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been right; she'd waited at the barn for three hours. The woman had never turned up.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was disappointing, but Rio was not deterred.
    </p>
    <p>
     If anything, she had two more nights. It was a fifty-fifty shot. If she repeated the process the next night and She was a no-show?
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, third time would be a charm, wouldn't it?
    </p>

    <p>
     Night two.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the second night in a row that Rio sat reclined in the driver's seat of her car, careful gaze sharp and observant for any sign of headlights.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon checking the time, Rio heaved a sigh of resignation; it was after midnight. If She was going to show up, She would have done so already. Rio had known better; it would have broken the pattern and yet, she couldn't help herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was quite a feat that she remained the least bit useful at work, as she could hardly stop visualizing and deconstructing what her life had looked like that night, the night she had gone to that bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     The night she had gotten in her car and followed someone she had suspected of murder. The night that she had been caught red-handed in her pursuit. The night that startlingly beautiful woman had so simply offered her a ticket to the show. The night that Rio's perception of morality and the finality of death began to crack and crumble.
    </p>
    <p>
     There had not been a slumber since that night that did not begin with a hand between her legs as those bountiful and vivid images rolled through her mind like the most delicious soft core porn. It made it a little easier to ignore the fact that it was
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     a snuff film, one only Rio would ever have to play through over and over again.
     <em>
      Only
     </em>
     Rio got that privilege, that pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, the orgasm would wash over her, she would recover enough to realize that she might actually be losing her grip on sanity, and she would roll over and fall asleep ten minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>
     The previous night had gifted her more than an hour of sleep, though she was nearing the precipice of not getting quite enough to remain cognizant and aware. Rio was fighting her way through it, continuing to press on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Work had been rather uneventful, though Alice had been in an uncharacteristically good mood, something Rio quickly realized was because she had gotten laid the night before. Of course, that opened the door to a day full of Rio relentlessly making playful quips and jabs to finally celebrate Alice's liberation from celibacy.
    </p>
    <p>
     They backfired every time when Alice would retort that the last two times Rio had a woman between her legs was only because she was at the gynecologist.
    </p>
    <p>
     As much as Rio wanted to be bitter about it, Alice wasn't exact wrong. It was just that Rio didn't want to make time to date. She wanted to spend time with her friends and with her cat. She wanted to read, to research, to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, she apparently wanted to stalk a serial killer that she could not stop thinking about to save her own life.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have just left. It was 12:08am and she had to be up at 6am for work. She needed to just drive home, check on Phineas and climb into bed and fall asleep after an orgasm she would feel guilty about for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, Rio sat there for another twenty-two minutes. Y'know... Just in case.
    </p>
    <p>
     At 12:30am, she knew it was useless. The woman was likely keeping to her timeline, taking precautions to ensure that no one else caught onto what it was she was doing. It had taken Rio a little more effort than anyone else would have likely put into it, but Rio's insatiable thirst for knowledge had led her to push harder than the average person might have.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was home and in bed, asleep by 2am.
    </p>
    <p>
     Day three.
    </p>
    <p>
     Work was about the same, though Alice had disclosed upon her first drop off that she had been ghosted by the woman she'd slept with two nights prior.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oof, sorry about that," Rio offered in consolation as they moved the first subject of the day onto the altar of all there was to know at the end of the line.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean, it's alright. I didn't want to date her, she was just really good in bed," Alice returned with a shrug, an air of nonchalance falling snugly over her.
    </p>
    <p>
     That might have been true, but Rio had her own opinions about communication. "A 'Hey, we're just not compatible' text sure does go a long way."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ah," Alice replied, clucking her tongue. "My dearest Rio, have you not realized that such a level of emotional maturity is capable only by those in possession of more than one braincell? And... that's not a common occurrence these days."
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes, Alice said things that, while true, were phrased in the most insane ways. Each time, Rio was never able to combat the laughter that sounded as a direct result.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The fact isn't funny," Rio tried to recover, her hand finding her stomach as if it would assist in calming the amusement. "But the way you stated it had that Wu-Gulliver flair without question."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice shrugged and forked over the clipboard, thanking Rio when she handed it back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Another day another dollar. I think we should do falafel for lunch. Text me what you want," Alice rattled off as she grabbed hold of the cart and made her way out of the autopsy room.
    </p>
    <p>
     For them, it was like clockwork, like a machine that dictated their routines in and out of that morgue. It was no wonder they had become such good friends; through all of the death and disease, the one constant they had was each other. People came and went, always needing something or another from Rio, but not Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     All Alice wanted was someone to talk to, someone who had similar thoughts. What Alice had wanted was a camarade and that was exactly what Rio had been able to be for her. She showed up, she cared, she poked fun when she could. She did all the things a good friend should, and in return, Alice provided the same in kind.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have a good day, Alice!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Make sure they're all dead first, Rio!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The grin Rio wore as the doors swung shut behind her best friend was vibrant and tickled, amusing enough that she was focused on the interaction for almost ten whole minutes before she found her mind looping back into that place she kept trying to restrain it from.
    </p>
    <p>
     It stayed there through five bodies, lunch with Alice, and the normal evening she tried to have. Cooking herself a meal and spending twenty minutes playing with the laser pointer as Phineas chased it around the living room had not been enough to shift her focus elsewhere. Even when she was actively doing something, her mind was still dancing away and winding up in that old barn.
    </p>
    <p>
     The black Lexus. The purple dress. The silver table. The orange lighting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Night three.
    </p>
    <p>
     This one, Rio had been convinced. She had been so certain when she placed a kiss atop Phineas' head and strode out of her apartment, that
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     would be the night she would finally be able to see Her again. She'd been trying both nights since they had last seen one another and Rio would have absolutely been lying right through the small gap in her teeth if she tried to lay claim to not being frustrated that she'd wasted almost seven hours waiting for someone who was never going to show.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was down to her own stupidity, really. Part of her absolutely knew that the woman was not going to break her routine, her schedule, just because Rio wanted to see her again. Hell, she probably had no fucking clue that Rio had even shown up the past couple of nights.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, for the third night in a row, Rio sat behind that barn until almost one in the morning, pissed off beyond measure by the time she pulled onto the street and headed home.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the third night after the last kill. She should have been there. If She was keeping pace, there was
     <em>
      no
     </em>
     reason She had to not show up.
    </p>
    <p>
     So where the fuck was she?
    </p>
    <p>
     More than that, why the fuck was Rio so bent out of shape about it?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a question she had not been able to answer, even as she spent twenty minutes trying to masturbate that night only to find herself too annoyed to come.
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     only pissed her off even more. In fact, it compelled her to take a hefty swig of ZzzQuil so that she could fall asleep a little easier. She had clearly misjudged the dosage, so much so that when she woke up the next morning, it was to realize that she had slept through both of her alarms, two calls from work and three texts from Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was already almost an hour and a half late.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     After making a quick call to let her superior know that she had overslept, Rio had scrambled to get ready. She made her way straight in, only partway amused when she walked into the office area of the morgue to find Alice in her chair, boots propped on Rio's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, good morning, sleepyhead," Alice greeted, wearing a grin that felt too smart-allecky for the fact that Rio had been awake just over thirty minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, yeah, I fucked up," Rio conceded as she hung her bag on one of the hooks fastened to the wall. "I took some ZzzQuil to try and get some decent sleep and it obviously backfired." As she paced toward the desk, her eyes cast toward the autopsy room, a little shocked to only see one bag given the fact that she was just over two hours late.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Slow morning?" she questioned, gaze dropping to Alice. She still looked way too relaxed and comfortable in Rio's spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Actually yeah. Several remains pick-ups from yesterday that just got stored and I was able to grab them all at once."
    </p>
    <p>
     One body.
    </p>
    <p>
     What if it was a product of Her work?
    </p>
    <p>
     What if she had decided that Rio had completely compromised her operation and had just packed everything up and changed venue? What if the body in that bag was lying there with a severed spinal cord and Rio would have to face the fact that the woman wanted nothing more to do with her?
    </p>
    <p>
     She hadn't followed through, hadn't found Rio in those three days. She hadn't reached out, not at all. Even when Rio had tried to beat her to the punch, there had been nothing to show for it. Instead, Rio was standing at that desk fighting herself on asking too eagerly to know what she would be dealing with that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And that one?" she decided on. It was casual, lacked too much interest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Eighteen year old woman. Rough accident, but first responders think that she was gone before the crash and lost control. But, that's what you're here for!" she tacked on, obviously feeling a little more playful that morning in particular. Maybe it was Rio's tardiness or maybe it was the fact that they had reached the end of the work week. Whatever it was, it was a little unnerving.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gotta earn a paycheck somehow, right?" Rio mused, glancing toward the autopsy room once more before finding Alice again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wanna help me real quick before I'm sure you'll be summoned?" Rio posed, somehow finding it in her to be sweet in her request.
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, Rio was annoyed. She was mad. She was tired. All she wanted was to go back home, curl up in bed with Phineas and somehow find a way to get over this... fixation? Obsession? Whatever it was, Rio wanted to let it go, to find a way to eradicate those thoughts from her mind. She wanted to stop thinking about the woman, about how beautiful she was and how good she smelled. She wanted to stop thinking about those fucking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     All Rio wanted was to go back to what her life had been like before that first man had thumped onto her table with his seemingly undamaged physical form, save for the severed spinal cord.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice swung her heels off of the desk and stood, following Rio to tend to her work day. The move was quiet until Alice's pager inevitably sounded and she heaved a sigh that told Rio she did not want to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Be back soon," she offered, slinking off toward the exit.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have a good day, Alice," Rio called after her, indignation filling her as she looked down at the unopened body bag on her steel table.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't a man in his thirties. It wasn't a body that held Her trademark. It wasn't another piece of a puzzle Rio wasn't even sure she wanted to put together.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a tragedy, and as Rio determined, the aneurysm the young woman had just before the collision had been the true cause of her death. It was an anomaly, especially in someone that young, but it hadn't been impossible. While unfortunate, it was another very clear indication that life happened as it wanted and no one really had much of a say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not unless they were Her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, they got to call the shots, got to choose who lived and who died.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had all the power in a world that was so quick to make its inhabitants feel so powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another three bodies filled her shift and the disappointment and irritation that found Rio each and every time it was not what she had been hoping for had become paramount by the end of the day. It had gotten bad enough that when Alice had tried to convince her to come out drinking with her that night, the way Rio chose to decline had not been the most polite choice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't want to, Alice," she'd tried, but Alice kept going.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, come on, Rio. You've been shafting me for the last two weeks. We can just go out, get a few beers and --"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck, Alice! I said I don't want to go!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice's mouth snapped closed and her eyes went wide, not having seen such a side to Rio in quite some time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was not an abraisive person, did not usually snap or yell or come across as aggressive. She was soft-hearted and so well put together on a day-to-day basis, but the irritation of what had been happening on the outside of those walls was clearly getting to her. She was being reduced to nothing but frustration and longing, a desire to know more, to have more, to see more.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright, I'm sorry," Alice offered, holding both palms up in surrender. She turned to leave, not wanting to elongate any kind of confrontation, but it was clear she had something else to say. "Rio?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's head lifted, eyes tearing from the desk to land on her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're... You're okay, right? Like... Should I be worried?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice's inquiry was so soft, so gentle, so... concerned. She knew Rio, perhaps better than anyone, and such a mildly volatile display from her was abnormal and cause for reassessment. The way she had asked it, it melted that angry front Rio had been maintaining over the last two minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm okay, Alice," Rio responded quietly. She chewed on the inside of her lip for a moment in thought before she continued. "I just really need to take the weekend and just... sleep in. I think it might fix me." The small curve of her lips she wore was accompanied by a light laugh that, while forced, showed she held no hard feelings toward her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was just trying to care.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was making it really fucking hard.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No beer, no caffeine. Just sleep and junk food and Phineas snuggles. Scouts honor."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice's gaze was pointed, studious as it searched Rio's expression for any give, any tell that she might have been trying to cover. When she found nothing, she offered Rio a kind smile and a nod of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio realized in that moment a very sad, very dangerous fact: she was getting better at lying.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have a good weekend. If you wanna come out for drinks or brunch this weekend, just text, yeah?" she offered. It was an open invitation and it was one of the reasons Rio adored Alice so much. Alice was letting Rio make the choice and making sure Rio understood that it could be made at any time, whenever she was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have fun this weekend, Alice. Be safe."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice had departed first, but Rio had been right behind her, thankful to walk away from those steel walls for a couple of days. What she had not taken into account was the fact that she didn't really have much else to spend her time on in those two days.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     do, to start the weekend off, was try one last time -- on night four -- to wait it out at the barn in hopes that the woman would return. If she did not, Rio would have had enough reason to believe that She had left town and Rio would simply never see Her again. It was a very viable reality and yet, Rio didn't want it to be
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had spent the time it took her to cook dinner trying to convince herself that she was better off just staying at home. She could find a movie to stream or watch and pour herself a glass of scotch to simply spend her night on the couch under the weight of her emotional support idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, by the time she had finished eating and rinsed off her plate, Rio was already headed to shower and change so that she could drive out of the city and sit in her car behind a piece of shit barn that no one would otherwise pay any attention to. It took her little time and within a half an hour, her wet hair hung over her shoulders and she was dressed in a baseball t and jeans that were maybe a little tighter than they needed to be. With the pair of Doc Martens she pulled on, she didn't look like a complete bum and felt suitable enough to be seen by the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Per her ritual, Rio placed a kiss directly centered between Phineas' ears and made her exit, finding herself cutting her headlights as she pulled behind that now-too-familiar barn about thirty-five minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew it was pointless. Something had changed; the woman's pattern was faltering, regressing. It should have been progressing, shorter cooling off periods the longer it went on, yet She had just... stalled. Or stopped. Or left. All three options left Rio feeling perturbed in the worst way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ten minutes passed, then an additional twenty. With thirty more, Rio had accepted defeat and come to understand her own stupidity. Whatever that tiny wave of heat had been between them that night, especially when the woman had whispered in Rio's ear that way, it had meant nothing and Rio's obsession with trying to find it again had done absolutely nothing for her. All she found in it was disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sighed, lips twisting as she chewed on the insides of them. It was time to pack it in, time to give up. If the woman wanted to be found, she would find Rio first, as she had stated she would. Coming here night after night was a stupid choice on Rio's part and the idea that it ever would have brought anything positive to her life was an absolute farce.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lifting a hand, Rio had been ready to call it quits by starting her car.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then she watched to the left as headlights faintly appeared and got brighter before making a left turn, getting even brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Holy shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Holy shit. It had fucking worked
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Without a second for thought, Rio was ripping out of the car to take off toward the barn as the woman bumped down the drive. With her urgency, Rio had appeared into view of the headlights at the same time the woman rolled to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Proud of herself, Rio was wearing an ear-to-ear grin, even as the door to the SUV swung open and the woman clamored out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't see her face at first, or the color of the dress she was wearing. She couldn't see how nice her hair looked in the fishtail braid she had woven it into, or how soft her makeup was. Rio couldn't see anything other than the way the woman stalked forward, sharp and quick as she barreled right toward -- and then right into -- Rio, a hand snapping up to lock around her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman kept going, forcing Rio to take the couple of steps back needed until her spine was pressed to the barn door, those headlights lighting up the confrontation as if it were a primetime showdown.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What the FUCK are you doing here?!" the woman growled fiercely. Even in the dark, she was too close now for Rio not to see the burning rage in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been wondering since that night she'd followed the woman just how strong she actually was. She was afraid she had her answer in the way the woman's hand was gripping tightly at her throat. She wasn't deliberately crushing Rio's windpipe, but the hold she had was forceful and firm. In fact, Rio was almost certain that if She tried to raise her arm, Rio's feet would come cleanly off the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Rio's hand had somehow managed to land on the woman's wrist, gripping and pulling to no avail. She wanted to answer, but speaking was a little difficult with how they were arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried. What produced from her lips was merely a croak, a grinding of vocal chords that creaked and groaned in the effort. When she made the sound again, the woman realized that Rio was trying to answer her. Her grip loosened, but only enough that it was easier for Rio to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I found you first,"
     </em>
     Rio managed, though it was still a little difficult to push words out around the still-present pressure around her neck. There were traces of arrogance in what tone she could manage, but it was covering up the fact that she felt like she could have combusted with what it felt like to be at the woman's mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a sense of certainty within Rio that if this woman really wanted to, all she had to do was squeeze and lift and she could literally choke the life out of Rio with one hand, using the barn door to support her weight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're a fucking idiot," the woman spat at her, eyes flashing in warning. The way the moonlight rippled through them in her anger made the hair on the back of Rio's neck stand on end. "I've seen you on the fucking cameras. You realize that showing up here every fucking night is only increasing the risk that you might go to prison, right?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Squirming slightly against the woman's hold, Rio couldn't fight off the smirk that curled her lips, devious in nature. "You think you'd get caught?"
    </p>
    <p>
     At this, the woman scoffed, seemingly insulted by the mere suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course not."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's smirk only grew. "Well, you were a lot closer than you might have thought. I've changed the last two tox screens to throw them. Also edited each report to reflect physical altercations to explain away the chest bruising. If they'd started to think they were looking for a woman, they quickly changed their tunes."
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman just blinked at her, a stupefied expression broadcasting clearly as those blue eyes filled with incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You broke the law to cover for me?" She asked. At the same time, her grip around Rio's neck slackened slightly, the heels of Rio's feet settling in the dirt again, grounding her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio simply nodded, swallowing despite the awkward feeling it gave her with the woman's hand still stationed on her throat. She realized, taking total physical account of her own automatic responses, that the throbbing between her legs that had started beyond her comprehension only worsened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jesus Christ, Rio was in far too deep for this to ever end well, and she knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I... Don't ask me why, because I do not fucking know," she admitted, eyes dropping to where her hand was still wrapped around the woman's wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, the woman relented and let go of Rio's throat, stepping back with a look of contempt so loud on her face. In the exact same moment, that thunderous pulsing between Rio's legs waned and lessened, losing its intensity. Her arms folded across her middle and she shifted her weight to her left side, taking the time to size Rio up. She was also apparently taking the time to figure out what the fuck She was supposed to do with an unexpected audience for the second time that week.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you want?" She finally asked, though it was more of a bark of demand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I... I just want to observe. To assess and understand," Rio answered honestly, though she sounded like a high school science geek looking for extra credit as it came out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This isn't some fucking Broadway show that you get encores of," the woman snapped, her brow pinched tight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know that," Rio shot back sharply. "But I..."
    </p>
    <p>
     She what? Hadn't been able to stop fantasizing about the woman before her and every fluid and choreographed move? Had fucked herself nightly to the thought of Her? Had lost sleep turning over this string of murders? Now even more because this dangerously hot woman was behind them?
    </p>
    <p>
     "You
     <em>
      what?
     </em>
     " the woman bit back, taking a step forward again.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Maybe if I piss her off, she'll choke me like that again.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, what the FUCK.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I... I..." Rio stammered, clearly succumbing to the nerves that were flustering her. "It doesn't make any sense, okay?! I just keep thinking about you, about this, about how fucking
     <em>
      easy
     </em>
     it all it, and how it shouldn't be. I... I just want to learn."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Learn?
     <em>
      Learn?
     </em>
     Like you're some fucking protege?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No! I just... I don't care about killing shit bag men. All I want is to just..." Rio's lips twisted, debating the next words she was going to choose.
     <em>
      "Get you."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That confident and resolute silhouette stiffened in the headlights, but Rio still couldn't make out much of her face. Maybe it had been a poor word choice and maybe the woman was about to choke the life out of her for it, but at least it had been honest. At least this time, Rio wasn't even trying to lie.
    </p>
    <p>
     An eerie silence fell over them as the woman seemed to contemplate which choices lay before her. Rio knew that one of them was to tell her to piss off and get lost, but was another to let her stay?
    </p>
    <p>
     After another minute, the woman finally spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get the fuck out of the way," she grumbled, having lost her volume.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a far-too-snappy manner, Rio shuffled to the side, watching as the woman unfastened the locks and shoved the barn doors open. Without a word, she stalked back to her car and climbed inside, pulling into the barn. In the time it took her to get out again and make her way for the doors, Rio appeared in the empty space.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you going to make me leave?" Rio asked, though the timid tone that occurred left her a little disgruntled; she didn't want to seem or sound like a child in front of this woman, but fuck if she wasn't intimidating as hell.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman, who's features were a little more discernable in the dim light of the barn, did not answer right away. Instead, she stood with her hand on the barn door as she picked Rio apart with that icy blue gaze, flaying and slicing her up without laying a single finger on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lips pursed in her inspection and when her gaze finally lifter to lock with Rio's, it did not waver or deviate. It stayed there. It stayed there for at least forty five seconds before the woman's low and rough voice delivered her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can stay," she stated flatly. "And you can even observe closer. But I'm not answering any questions."
    </p>
    <p>
     She was so certain, so forceful with her words. And then, she simply stepped aside so that Rio could progress forward and she could shut and barricade the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was silent after that, moving about in a much similar fashion to the one she'd utilized earlier in the week. It annoyed Rio; she wanted to know why the extra day, why the woman had broken her pattern. Was it because she had spotted Rio on the cameras? Was it because something else in her personal life had come up? Was it her job? What did she do for work? How could she hold down a job by day and relentlessly reap lives by night?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a process at this point, a culmination of practice and routine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dolly. Car door. Transfer. Table. Straps. Collar. Jerk. Dead. Transfer. Car. Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched in her active fascination, mentally logging and noting what she could see more of this time. The collar's rib was actually a bit thicker than she had first thought, and the edge of it seemed a little sharper than Rio had first surmised.
    </p>
    <p>
     That made sense; a duller edge might not have enough force but too sharp and it would slice through skin. It was fascinating, really, how the woman had managed to perfect such a lethal weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You made that yourself, right?" Rio finally asked, breaking the fifteen minute long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman's pointed glare snapped up and pinned Rio, eyes narrowing in a silent threat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I said no questions," she reminded Rio, but there was an undeniable venom coating her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But a yes or no answer isn't going to send you straight to prison," Rio tried to reason. "I'm not saying anything to anyone. If I do, I'm either being submitted to the psych ward, or I'm going straight to jail without passing go. Either way, I'm not telling a fucking soul about this."
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman shifted her weight as she stood by the driver's door, assessing whether or not Rio was being honest. She must have decided she was, because She spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I did. It took me about three months to get right. The first six tries, it never severed and only paralyzed them. Left too big of a mess and I took off."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to ask where it was, wanted to find out enough information that she could Google to uncover more. She needed to know all there was to know about this woman and she feared that until she did, she was never going to be able to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Swimming in the thoughts, Rio's gaze had gone distant and the woman caught on immediately, barking an order with a tone that was meant to guard more than the previous one she had been using.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Time to go. And I should really stress this time," the woman advised, stepping forward to close the few feet of space that had been between them, "that you should
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     come back here again. Choosing to do so could prove stupid and I think a face like yours," she breathed, her voice dropping to a croon as she lifted two fingers to tap at Rio's cheek, "is far too pretty for prison. You wouldn't last a week."
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman was close enough, with that advancement, that Rio could almost taste the amaretto as it carried from Her breath to Rio's lips, their faces so close. They were
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     close that an impossibly stupid thought crossed Rio's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Just kiss her.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Not having time to consider the absurdity of the mental demand, Rio was stunned when the woman simply took a step back and then headed for the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took little time for her to remove the brace and back the car out, only returning to make sure she door was properly locked, all while Rio simply floated in the periphery, still studying and memorizing and absorbing.
    </p>
    <p>
     When She was satisfied, She headed for the car one last time, lifting her head to look over her shoulder at Rio, who was still standing there awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go home, County Coroner," the woman ordered, but the harshness in her voice had ebbed a bit. "You've got a busy day tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, She
     <em>
      definitely
     </em>
     knew who Rio was. Whether that was bad or awful was still to be determined, but at least She
     <em>
      knew who Rio was.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "I..." Rio tried, but her face fell at her lack of a preemtively developed follow-up. "Will I see you again?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a pathetic question, one that Rio knew she never should have asked. It stung even more when the woman climbed into her car and shut the door. Before she backed out, though, she rolled the window down, a devious grin on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not if I see you first."
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, the window rolled up again and the woman put the car in reverse, disappearing once more on her trek to whatever cemetary she was going to dump this body at.
    </p>
    <p>
     All that was left for Rio to do was climb into her car and go home.
    </p>
    <p>
     That, and think about how she swore she could still feel the woman's hand around her neck.

    <p>
     Madness. Sheer, inarticulable madness.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was literal Jekyll and Hyde levels of pure madness.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of it, every last second of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had climbed into her car, not having gathered much more actual information about the woman or why,
     <em>
      truly why
     </em>
     , She was doing what She was doing.  It was another clinic, a showing of cold and calculated procedure, as if she were performing a life-ending surgery. But the woman didn't use scapels or crack open ribs. She did not touch the heart or fondle the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     All She did was apply physics to a problematic situation and let it speak for itself. She was mathematical and measured in every bit of what She did, to an extent that Rio ached for nothing more than to just take the slightest peek inside of her head. She just wanted to see how things worked up there, how She was able to conceive such an intricate operation, one that she appeared to be running solo.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were even more questions that Rio had shown up with. The fact that it was the second time now she felt that way, her agitation was growing, burning a little hotter.
    </p>
    <p>
     From that grip the woman had on Rio's throat, there was a very miniscule amount of doubt in Rio's mind that She could not have either crushed Rio's trachea or broken her neck with just the right maneuver. Maybe it could have been an overexaggeration, but Rio had
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     been touched like that, so roughly, in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning over the key, she found herself distracted from those thoughts by the almost painful pulsing between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     God, this was so fucking stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a thought she'd had many times over the last week, and yet, her body chose to betray her again. All she could think about was how close the woman been as she had snapped and barked and growled like a threatened pit bull. She had made sure that Rio got a full view of those pearly white teeth, how sharp they were. She wanted Rio to understand that she could absolutely chew her up and spit her out with little regard.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only things that circled through her mind as she headed back to the city were what the woman's perfume smelled like -- different from the last time they had crossed paths -- and the way the intricate braid had laid so perfectly over her shoulder. Rio's mind was occupied with
     <em>
      Her
     </em>
     the entire way home and it was driving her up a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was all but living in that tail end of their interaction, the way the woman had stalked right up to her and while her words themselves could have technically been considered a friendly warning, her intent and demeanor had communicated in a crystal clear fashion that it was
     <em>
      absolutely
     </em>
     a threat.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You should never come back here again.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You wouldn't last a week.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That fucking vicious smirk.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get it the fuck together, you dumbass!" Rio shouted at herself, slamming the heel of her hand to the steering wheel while she waited at a red light.
    </p>
    <p>
     None of it was logical and yet, Rio was caught in a web this woman had been spinning for God knew how long. Surely, it had not been Her intent to draw enough attention to make a capture she did not first establish as prey, but Rio was tangled and twisted in a way she did not know how to undo.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, that was a lie.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted further in.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted this woman to see that there was something in her practices that Rio was drawn to. Maybe it didn't follow any line of sense, but She very obviously knew who Rio was, what she did for a living, and had probably been able to unearth a few lesser known facts about her as well. It was nothing she was ashamed of, but she was certain that there were at least a few photos of her still on the internet somewhere from her taxidermy days as a teenager.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some part of Rio prayed to whatever higher power existed that She had not found
     <em>
      those.
     </em>
     They were embarrassing and she had managed quite the glow-up in the years since. The woman probably already thought her to be an absolute nerd and so to see those? Oof, any hopes Rio might have had of the woman actually seeking her out would probably be shot in the face after that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wait a minute...
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Why did she care?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Why did Rio give a single fuck about what a
      <b>
       serial killer
      </b>
      thought about her?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Perception was a bitch, point blank. More than that, Rio did not want to be met with the reality that the fucked-up and strange kinship she had started to feel was unrequited and always would be. This woman owed her nothing and the fact that she had let Rio -- the
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     person in the world, she was sure -- observe from the wings not once but twice surely said
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     , didn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
     They didn't really speak much and the woman was rather closed off and unreceptive to any serious communication, so it left Rio wondering why.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why had the woman agreed to let her stay a second time? Why had She not come out the first night She spotted Rio on the cameras? Why hadn't she run her off? Why? Why? Why?!
    </p>
    <p>
     The very second Rio put her car in park inside of the carpark, both of her hands found 10 and 2 on the wheel and she leaned forward, thumping her forehead directly between them with an anguished groan. It wasn't that the act itself hurt, but her head felt as though it was going to explode with all of the unanswered questions and threads that had no tie-ins. She had been showing up thinking she would walk away knowing more and she was wrong. It made her so fucking angry.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a ninety second spiral of her trying to assess what it was she actually thought she was doing, Rio finally pulled herself from the car and made her way up to her apartment. Having spent a little time with him earlier in the evening, Phineas was curled up on the couch asleep instead of waiting for her by the door. When she flipped on the living room overhead light, his head lifted and he offered and wide and toothy yawn just before he laid his head back on his paws and closed his eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
     One thing Rio had accepted before she even closed the front door was that she was not going to be sleeping. It was fine. The next day was Saturday and she did not have to wake up and pretend in front of Alice like she was surprised that the man who turned up on the table had the same injuries as six others.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then she thought about what the woman had said.
     <em>
      You've got a busy day tomorrow.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The likely instance there was that She had lost track of the days or did not have Rio's schedule pinned yet. Which... That was probably a good thing, even if the idea of Her having done such a thing tickled Rio in a nonsensical way.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, there was a darker part of Rio, the one who had always had an ignorable fixation around morbidity and human expiration, who wondered if it was deeper that that. Was She implying that she was heading for a spree? Was she trying to tell Rio that something bigger was coming?
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't know, and the longer she thought about it, the more restless she got. Sitting next to Phineas as she stroked at his fur had been idle work, not enough to distract her. She had turned on the television in hopes for assistance, but again, all she could do was think about the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     All she could do was think about how angry she had been and how it had impelled her to use a show of force on Rio, as if it ever would have scared her away. Instead, she was staring at a dark wall over the television as she visualized the woman's face in her mind, the way her eyes had practically luminesced in the dark due to her rage. Rio was just spinning it over and over again in her mind, the way she had felt those angry and rough fingertips sinking deeper and deeper into her flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was almost certain, even, that if she got a good look in the mirror, she might be able to see traces of the woman's nail imprints in her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     At this thought, a hand raised and skimmed over the back of the neck, smooth skin until -- wait! There were three small divots, the tiniest little creases that were blemishes against otherwise silky smooth skin. The second she realized that she had been right, it felt like the stem of her brain had been lit like a fuse to a stick of dynamite.
    </p>
    <p>
     It burned hotter and higher, finally striking her in the brain as the heat pulsated in every clockable point in her body. The most violent one happened to be between her legs and the suddenly overwhelming sensation caused her to lurch forward over her knees, still stationed on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     A rough and angry groan seeped out of her; she was asking that question again: why?
    </p>
    <p>
     Why was this happening? Why couldn't she find a way to wrangle in her own mind and get it to behave appropriately? Why was it so fucking hard to just be
     <em>
      normal?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     With another grunt, Rio sat up and pushed herself to bare feet, toes flexing into the carpet for just a moment before she began to pace, back and forth from the dining area into the living room and back. Phineas' head had lifted and he was curiously watching her, but he otherwise did not move from his spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because he was alert and Rio was in crisis, she took it upon herself to begin a one-sided dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Phin... What am I doing dude?" she asked, glancing over at him as she careened into the living room to turn on her heels and head back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean... This is stupid. I don't even know her fucking name!" she told him, raising both hands to cover her face as she turned around in the dining room and trekked back toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It doesn't matter that she's beautiful, or that she's
     <em>
      so fucking smart.
     </em>
     It doesn't matter that I just want to have a conversation with her, to pick her brain. No, she thinks I'm some kind of fucking
     <em>
      stalker! WHICH?!
     </em>
     Is stalking really that much worse than murder?!" she nearly shrieked. Realizing just how loud she had been, she shrank a bit in her back and forth and pressed her lips tight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorry, buddy. Not trying to yell. I just... This is probably the most insane I have ever felt. And... I got really close that time when I broke my leg and blocked out the pain enough that I could stare at the bone poking through my skin."
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Brrp.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the quietest chirp, but it sounded like a chirp of agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, so even her cat thought she was losing her mind. That was comforting.
    </p>
    <p>
     After that little back talk, she cut the conversation short and instead vented only in her mind, thinking it all over until she found herself at her inevitable destination: her back to the door of the barn, her heels not touching the ground, and Her hand around Rio's throat in a vice like grip.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have lifted her legs, should have wrapped them around the woman's waist. Maybe it would have compelled Her to fuck Rio stupid until she forgot all about Her. Maybe the woman would have choked her a little harder if she had.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could catch her from indulging the thought in depth, that pulsing that had not left her worsened to a point that it was actually beginning to make her stomach hurt. Fuck it, she had to do something about it. If it made her a bad person, then she was a bad fucking person and the world would just have to live with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gave a soft tutting of her tongue to beckon Phineas, knowing he would follow her into the bedroom as per their routine. What he did not realize was that this was not routine and for the time being, Rio needed him out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     As he took his place, curling up in the corner of the bed, Rio turned into her closet and retrieved both her six and a half inch tie-dye dual density silicone dildo and the harness she owned for it. Before Phineas could make sense of where she was headed, Rio blew out of the bedroom and closed the door behind her, heading toward the living room and that plush armchair that sat in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't think about it. She just had to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     After tossing the harness and dildo to the seat of the chair, she wasted absolutely no time in stripping herself down, kicking her jeans and panties to the side. Immediately after, she shed her shirt and then the bra she'd been wearing, giving absolutely no fucks that she was stark naked in the middle of her living room at two am on a Saturday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gave even fewer fucks -- into the negative for anyone that might have been counting -- that she was about to reduce herself to nothing more than some bitch in heat as she reached for her equipment and threaded the dildo through the ring of the harness. She stared at it for a long moment before she snapped back into action, arranging it into the most stable position on the arm of the chair so that the dildo stood erect and waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio would have given anything in that moment for it to be on the hips of the woman, and not shoddily set atop the arm of her living room chair, but beggars could most definitely not be choosers right then, and Rio was
     <em>
      begging
     </em>
     for relief at that point. She would work with what she had and bury any complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just like she was about to bury that dildo as deep into herself as her body could fucking take.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a ragged breath that seemed to ward off any doubt, she stepped forward and lifted her left leg, sliding her knee onto the seat of the chair for support, leaving the other foot flat on the ground. It took a bit of arranging, but she found a suitable position and reached down, taking hold of the silicone so that she could run the tip through the excessive slick that had been building there throughout the entire night.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Fuck,"
     </em>
     Rio hissed, her right knee bending slightly so that she could position the tip against her entrance, sliding down onto it slow enough to enjoy the stretch and then the fill, a low moan rumbling from between her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     With only a minute amount of effort, her hips dropped as her core made contact with the upper part of the harness, flush to the arm of the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh, God,"
     </em>
     Rio whined, beginning to work her body up and down in slow strokes. The majority of the effort was stemming from the muscles in her right thigh, but it wasn't so uncomfortable that she needed to figure something else out. If anything, the moment she fell into a steady rhythm, it felt quite good.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both of her hands had landed on the arm of the chair, supporting her weight a little more so that her motions could gain a bit more fervor. It did feel amazing, but it wasn't hitting all the right notes. The angle was good, the fill was always supreme, but something was missing. She could think about the woman, could
     <em>
      think
     </em>
     about Her hand on Rio's throat, but it wasn't lighting up the right neurons.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hips slowed slightly and she sat up a little straighter, though she was still propped on one arm. Her hips were rutting more than they were bouncing on that silicone, but that did not last long. In fact, when the hand she had just freed began to wander up her stomach, squeezed and kneaded at a breast before soaring up her sternum, Rio was already moving again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand fastened around her own throat, trying her best to match the feeling of her own fingers to where the woman had placed her own earlier in the night. It took just a moment, but the moment she realized she'd found it, Rio's movements became erratic and nearing on frantic. Her eyes slid shut as the whimpers that came from her became more frequent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Squeezing harder, Rio was all but throwing her hips down, that dildo reaching every right part of her. Now that she had offered her brain a little crumb of assistance, the pleasure was beginning to roll in. She was still a little ways off, but those little tingles were stewing and churning, tickling the inmost parts of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice began to sound, but when Rio realized that she had started to moan a name she did not know, she just moaned anyway, not actually forming of the sound. It was just a guttural, raw sound that would piss her neighbors off if it woke them. She couldn't have cared less in that moment. All she cared about was squeezing harder, riding faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her eyes closed, she could fantasize that the woman was the one below her, could almost imagine the feeling of Her hands on Rio's thighs. Rio wanted to know what she sounded like when she moaned, when she got pleasure out of seeing Rio riding her like her fucking life depended on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Riding that arm chair felt like running a marathon and despite the fact that Rio's chest was heaving and she felt out of breath, she was not going to stop until she got her prize. So, she kept going until she began to feel that swelling low in her belly. She squeezed a little tighter at her own throat, working faster to reach her climax.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Fuck! God, fuck me!"
     </em>
     she managed through her own unsafe attempt at replicating a thrilling feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     With one last slam of her hips, pleasure ripped through Rio from head to toe, causing her to fold forward as her body pulsed and squeezed at the silicone buried as deep as it could be within her body. Her moans slowly devolved into whimpers and the trembling seemed lessen as the pleasure slowly subsided. She was still heaving, hunched over the length of the arm of the chair, a thin layer of sweat on her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her forehead dropped and landed on her wrists, her hips shifting slightly as another whine slipped from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why couldn't it have been Her?
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio pushed herself back up and lifted from the piece of furniture, she couldn't stop the gasp that left her when the dildo slipped out and she was just... empty.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was empty of silicone, empty of a relationship, empty of her goddamn sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition to that emptiness came the missing pieces of her that she'd come to lose, like her decision making skills and her rationale. She was hollowing out more and more while she tried to figure this woman out and it did not seem to be leading her anywhere good. In fact, it was beginning to feel like her hand was being forced and she could do little else aside from give up the pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't want to stop any more than She wanted to stop killing these abusive and violent men.
    </p>
    <p>
     After taking the time to clean the toy and stow her things back where the belonged, Rio found herself still circling that same track as she showered. She had felt frustrated since she'd left she barn, but in the midst of washing off, Rio realized something.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman had given her a little more to work with. Maybe it had been unintentional, but she had slipped something through that Rio suddenly remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quickly, she finished her shower and scrambled into bed, pulling out her Macbook to type something into the Google search bar. The cursor blinked and Rio started to type, but the moment she began, she realized that she needed to stop, assess, and reconsider. Once she typed in an inquiry like the one that was sitting in her head, there was no going back. She wasn't entirely well-versed in the expanse of the internet, but she knew enough to understand that she might be thrown on some sort of watch list with a search like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a resigned sigh, Rio shut the laptop and slid it back into its place in the nightstand drawer. She needed to sleep, and yet, she knew she was stuck in the same pattern that had been plaguing her since the beginning of the week. She tried to lay back, to relax and close her eyes, but she was lost in the same repetition of thoughts that she began to consider she might never escape.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest of the weekend, she had done as she had promised Alice and spent the weekend on the couch with Phineas, cooking frozen ramen kids and living off naan and hummus. She started Nightwatch from the beginning and while normally, she often fantasized about Holly Monteleone, this time there was absolutely no compulsion to do so. Instead, she was staring straight through the screen and all she could see was that woman's fucking face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those blue fucking eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     That damning fucking grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those beautifully deadly fucking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of which had been around Rio's throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had fucked herself in a similar fashion three times the following two days, enough that by the time she had rolled into work on Monday, the overall annoyance had nearly left her. There were remaining traces, especially when she looked at the weekend log and saw that the weekend coroner was the one who had autopsied the man from Friday night.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was okay. It was Monday. If it
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     Rio's appearance that had caused her change in schedule, that would no longer be an issue and she should be on track.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio went home Tuesday, she'd needed to choke down her irritation long enough to drink a couple of beers with Alice at Roscoe's. All she wanted to do that evening was forget about the fact that there had been no body.
    </p>
    <p>
     The same happened on Wednesday, but that time Rio bought herself beer and pouted in her apartment as Phineas pestered her the entire night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thursday brought more of the same, and by the time Friday was an exact replication of the mundane and not a trace of Her to be found, Rio found herself to be irrationally upset. She should have known better. She should have known that with the way things had crumbled during their last meeting, the woman no longer had any desire to keep entertaining her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was upset.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     They didn't talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice's invitation that Friday night had been cordial and genuine, but she didn't take it as personally when Rio had gently told her she wanted to tend to her errands and try to catch up on some much needed sleep. This time, there had been no lie woven into her words, no deception to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as it had all began, it was over and that was it.
    </p>
    <p>
     They'd parted ways at the end of the day and Rio had headed home to shower and change before tending to such errands. She needed groceries, cat litter, needed to pick up a dress from the dry cleaner's. Setting about it, she knew she'd be home no later than eight. As predicted, when she started to head home, it was a quarter to eight.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had taken her two blocks to notice it, but for the strangest reason, Rio felt like someone was following her. The suspicion had no foundation, no actually basis for her to find truth in it. That didn't seem to matter to her gut, though, and the way her stomach had started to churn like an angry, angry sea during a storm for the ages.
    </p>
    <p>
     To test her theory, Rio made a left hand turn. A moment later, the car behind her did the same. She could feel, in her neck, as her pulse began to thud a little harder. There was a prickling of heat that danced up her neck and spread onto her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ten seconds. Fifteen.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Those same headlights.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't go toward home. That was not an option. If she was being followed, the last place she could ever go was home. But who would be following her? More importantly,
     <em>
      why?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't cause problems, didn't make waves wherever she went. She didn't pick fights or start arguments because it simply wasn't worth her time. What on earth would have given someone a reason to start following her through the Chicago streets at eight in the evening? She didn't have those answers and so, she committed to a series of turns that led her to the outskirts of town.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every single turn was matched by the car behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time the street lamps lessened and she was headed for country roads, she was hardly maintaining the ability to keep her soul contained in her body. Someone was tracking her, following her, stalking her through the streets and she had no fucking clue where it was she was supposed to go. She clearly couldn't lose them and her car was not built to rocket down back roads.
    </p>
    <p>
     Panic had started to take her over and then something caught her attention that nearly made her drive right into the fucking ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
     The car behind her flashed its lights.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her chest was heaving and quaking over her unsteady breaths, feeling like her heart was lodged in her throat and she could do nothing but try to swallow it back down. Whoever was following her, they wanted her attention. She didn't know what else to do; she was never going to outrun them and she didn't even know what kind of car it was they were driving.
    </p>
    <p>
     For just a second, she considered flooring the gas anyway, but the thought flickered out and she instead threw on her right turn signal, pulling off to the side of the road. She turned her hazards on and leaned back in her seat, her eyes sliding shut as she tried to run through her own last rites. Whoever this was, they could be the end of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     How ironic, she thought. She had come face to face on two occasions with an actual serial killer and lived to tell the tale. And here she was about to die because of some misconcieved case of road rage.
    </p>
    <p>
     The car did not pull off behind her, causing her heart to hammer even more powerfully in her chest, threatening to crack ribs. Instead, it rolled forward slowly and came into view as the tinted window rolled down, and there She sat, wearing a grin the size of Texas.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, hey there, pretty girl."
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh God,
     </em>
     Rio thought,
     <em>
      that would kill her far quicker than that goddamn collar.
     </em>
    </p>

    <p>
     Okay, so no man in his mid forties was going to whip out a shotgun and blow Rio away from some misunderstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, instead, the literal serial killer that she had not been able to stop thinking about for weeks now had rolled up beside her, looking as vicious and entertained as ever. She was wearing that grin and while it might have stemmed from amusement, Rio knew the true source. This woman was fucking
     <em>
      thrilled
     </em>
     that for the first time since they had met, she'd caught Rio out.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd followed Rio for a half a fucking hour until Rio had made the positively idiotic decision to isolate herself by ducking out into the country. There hadn't even a real plan; if the woman had tried to give chase, the only thing Rio would have been able to do was drive and drive and hope that the vehicle behind her ran out of gas first. She didn't have to do any of that.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     to do right then was decide whether or not she was going engage.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was hilarious.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Of course
     </em>
     she was going to engage.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wanna chat?" the woman offered, her tone so light -- it was almost
     <em>
      playful.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ab-About what?" Rio stammered stupidly, blinking. There was the tiniest pit of indignation in her stomach, one that was filled with every thought she'd had that week when no body had turned up after Tuesday. She wanted to be mad at Her, wanted to accuse her of playing games.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe a Rio who had more courage might have slung that accusation, but the one that sat in that Tiburon, looking through a passenger window at the human embodiment of a black widow spider, she couldn't. Because that Rio? Who was that Rio to sling such an accusation when she was the one hiding behind a barn nightly and fucking herself with regularity to the thoughts of someone whose name she did not even know.
    </p>
    <p>
     So coolly, so casually, the woman shrugged her shoulders. "Don't know. Didn't get that far. But if you come join me, we can figure it out."
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman said nothing else before she rolled the window up ad pulled her SUV forward onto the shoulder ahead of Rio, though she inched a bit further and dipped more into the grass. Rio got the hint and did the same; it would make it less obvious that they were congregating on a country road at eight in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     The engine cut as she turned the key and removed it, her teeth grinding as her gaze fixed on the dark car in front of her. She shouldn't. Rio
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     she shouldn't. She needed to put the key back into the ignition, turn it over, and drive off. She needed to leave that woman and every fucking memory of her in the rearview mirror and not think twice.
    </p>
    <p>
     She opted to look into that very mirror, making sure she didn't look too terrible after her errands, applied a thin layer of chapstick, and fluff her hair instead. Then, she chose to get out of her car to make her way to the passenger's side of the woman's SUV.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was some part of Rio that almost expected the door handle to yank in place and yield no results. She had thought for some reason that the woman might try to play with her, like some predators did right before they consumed their meal whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was but a rodent in the wildlands, scampering and scurrying as this lioness of a woman was hot on her tail, quite literally. She could have tried to keep running, tried to find somewhere to hide, but they were long past that, weren't they? Rio had given this woman the biggest piece of her identity by giving Her a name, and now, there was no going back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, it seemed, this woman was going to turn the tables and let Rio know what it was like to be stalked and followed. Fair, but it had still scared the absolute shit out of her. That was the unfair part; the woman hadn't been scared that Rio had been following her, simply for the fact that she could have just shot Rio directly in the face and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow, none of this had been enough of a deterrent. She was standing there, fingers wrapped snugly around the handle as she gave it a pull and the door swung open. When Rio's gaze found her, illuminated by one of the overhead lights, she was so fucking gorgeous that it actually
     <em>
      hurt
     </em>
     somewhere in the middle of Rio's body. It wasn't even being turned on, it was simply seeing this woman for her true beauty and also knowing just how deadly she could be.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a dangerous dichotomy, a lethal one, but Rio still slid her ass right onto the seat and shut the door. Suddenly, the idea of looking over at the woman made her stomach twist with uncertainty; they were
     <em>
      close
     </em>
     again, much closer than they had been throughout the majority of the time when they occupied the same space. There was less distance, more perfume. Less focus, more opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what might you be up to tonight that brings you all the way out here?" the woman posed, having removed her seatbelt so She could turn ninety degrees in her seat. It afforded her a full-on look at Rio, something She was clearly thrilled about.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't looking at Her. Rio could not tear her eyes from her hands in her lap long enough to look at Her. While she picked at her cuticles and debated on an answer, all she could think about was yet again, for the umpteenth time in two weeks, that she had made a decision that lacked any true thought at all. She'd gotten into that car like this woman could not just speed off and dump her body in a nearby creek.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, that would be too sloppy for Her. She had more finesse than that. Plus, she'd been quite insistent that she did not kill women and she did not want to start with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the fact that Rio was like a thorn in her side, hopefully that had not changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I was going home," Rio informed her, finally making the decision to lift her head to peer over at the other woman. "But then someone started following me and I got spooked. So... You. You brought me all the way out here."
    </p>
    <p>
     The accusation was not harsh, but was merely an indication of the facts. Rio had been more than happy to go home, drink enough beer to get tired and then try to fucking sleep. That was now completely out the window. Now, she sat next to the beacon of her fixation and every nerve in her body felt like it was buzzing with anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
     A snide chuckle fell from the woman's lips, an almost sinister sound that did an absolute number on Rio's stomach and heart at the exact same time. Her heart skipped and her stomach knotted, nearly punching the breath right out of her lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't strike me as the type to run from danger," the woman observed, her tone so chilled and measured that it sent Rio's heart skipping and squeezing all over again in her chest. "In fact, my inference had been that you chase it. Crave it, maybe."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's jaw swelled with the way she clenched her teeth, though she had not looked away. She was trying to focus on those cold blue eyes but her attention kept wandering, as did her gaze. It would trace over a cheekbone, down that gorgeous nose, over Her top lip and back across the bottom one. And then those lips would twitch and move revealing those threateningly pristine teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her dark gaze snapped back up and the amusement the woman was wearing was clearly mixed with something else, something carnivorous. She looked like she could absolutely devour Rio without a second thought and be content to move on about her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you always talk like some kind of DC comic book villain?" Rio questioned before she could stop it from falling out. The moment she heard herself, though, her eyes widened and her jaw hinged just slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Are you
      <b>
       trying
      </b>
      to get yourself killed, you fucking idiot?!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, when the woman laughed, it wasn't just a fucked up sense of delight that had soaked into the sound. The woman actually sounded like she thought Rio's question was truly
     <em>
      funny
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     In their previous encounters, there had been little room for humor. In fact, Rio had been terrified both times, but only in the way that she
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     what the woman
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     do, and not in the way that she thought She would do it to her. Still, their dialogue had been minimal and Rio was quite certain that She preferred it that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hearing her laugh like that, though, it was inducing an entirely new and perplexing feeling that Rio was not quite ready to embrace. She was also doing her best to ignore how fucking
     <em>
      sexy
     </em>
     that laugh was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, not usually," the woman finally responded. Her chest had stopped shaking with the giggles, though they were still just audible enough that Rio could tell by the sounds alone that she had clearly touched a funny bone. More than that, Rio was focusing most of her energy on ignoring how captivating the woman was when her lips spread so wide that several wrinkled appeared at the corners of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I was attempting to be mysterious. First time I've had to work at it, though," She informed Rio, quirking a brow. "Didn't work, I take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head, but her words almost contradicted her answer. "
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     didn't do you any favors, though I wouldn't say you're failing at being mysterious." The astute observation landed in a way that left it displaced as it ran through the other woman's mind, her eyes darting around as she tried to figure it out. Sensing that She was not going to quite get there, Rio offered an addendum. "I still don't know your name."
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman's expression relaxed and that arrogance crept back into her form, her shoulders shimmying as she corrected her posture. It was meant to assert dominance in the enclosed space, but she didn't need to do it. Rio was already afraid. Kind of. Maybe halfway. The other half was a mixture of turned-on and undeniable guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And you don't need to," the woman returned. "This is not a longstanding arrangement."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's brow furrowed in her disdain to hear such words, despite the fact that it was something she already knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then why did you follow me tonight? You could have just... I don't know, fucked off and skipped town and... You know... Not followed me. But... here we are."
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? ALOOF IS NOT THE WAY TO GO!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     There was the angriest, smallest voice absolutely bellowing near the back of her mind. It was her own voice, but it was wanting and demanding that she not fucking blow this. But why? Why should she keep this up? It was literally driving her to the brink of insanity and realistically, it was providing nothing fortuitous to her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     All she had done since the presence of this woman in her city became prevalent in her life was spiral further and further into a put of obsession and desperation. The people around her were beginning to notice. Hell, even her cat had started to notice. Phineas had been entirely up her ass for the last few days and while it was sweet, she was also beginning to get annoyed with him, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     It, of course, only was happening because she was annoyed with herself most of all.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because I saw your car. Very noticeable, by the way. Consider investing in something a little more inconspicuous." The levels of patronization there were off the fucking charts, but Rio did not let it show. Instead, she focused on that razor sharp gaze, those pursed and twisting lips, those pink cheeks in the dim light.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That isn't an answer," Rio finally returned, brow pinching in her hesitance. That critical gaze was searching for the truth, trying to pry it out of the absolute steel trap this woman was. It was not getting her anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I noticed you by accident when you passed me at 58th. And I... I know it's been quiet on my end... So I just wanted to tell you that I'm not going to be around for a little while longer," the woman explained, though her gaze tore from Rio's and dropped to the empty cup holders between them. "I just... Didn't want you to think that I got caught, or that something happened to me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was torn; she wanted to blink away her incredulity at what the woman was saying, what little olive branch she was offering and at the same time, she was terrified if she did it too many times, she would snap-to in her car, driving through city streets to take her home after running errands.
    </p>
    <p>
     This woman who owed her nothing was giving her some sliver of an explanation, some inkling as to what was going on with her, though she offered zero elaboration. They were simple facts. For Her, simple facts were safe. For Her, they could be used as currency, an exchange that might keep Rio at bay and buy Her some time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You... You think I care about what happens to you?" Rio asked softly, not actually thinking through the words she had chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
     In automatic response, the woman recoiled just barely, a stern look crossing her features. Right then, Rio realized she had fucked up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No! Wait, I... I didn't mean it like
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     ," she tried to salvage, feeling like she was choking on her own words. "I... I just meant...
     <em>
      Why
     </em>
     do you think that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman's head tipped to the side in a silent nudge, as if to imply that Rio could not actually be serious.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean... You found me. Followed me. Drove at least thirty minutes out of your way four nights in a row to see me. And you blindly and willingly got out of your car to come sit right here, so... More inferences were made, I suppose," the woman detailed, her criticizing gaze hot and pointed as it searched Rio for any give, for any sign that she was going to try to combat such allegations.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't even try. The woman wasn't wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chose another route instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're not on anyone's radar," Rio informed her, but something deep within her bones felt like the woman was already aware of that. That suspicion was confirmed by the skeptical expression that found its way onto Her features.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know that. It's not why I'll be gone," She returned. Something about
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     answer and the way she said it made Rio curious.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then why?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman chose not to answer right away. All she did in response was spread those lips wide and Cheshire-like, the cruel delight sparkling in those icy blue depths.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     care," She pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, Rio's stomach was sinking, sliding right through her form and transferring via osmosis right into the leather seat beneath her. Sure, it might have been painfully obvious, but having the woman point it out and wave it right in front of Rio's face was making her squirm, as she was certain it was meant to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's lips twisted and pressed in her indecision; she should have gotten out of the car, gotten into her own and just gone home. Then again, a lot of Rio's life since this woman had turned up had been filled with quite a bit of 'should haves' and not enough 'she dids.'
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     doing was playing with fire and having little regard for the imminent injury she was bound to incur.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Does it really matter?" Rio shot back, trying to garner a little sense of rigidity that might make her seem more confident than she was currently feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I suppose not..." the woman mused, her head turning so that she could look out the windshield.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh no. No no no. Rio's aloofness was turning her off. She was trying to seem as cool as the woman liked to tout herself to be, but it was backfiring exponentially. She had to find a way to salvage it, to set things back to how they were when the woman had simply been chasing her for the thrill of it on a Friday evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you want me to be honest?" Rio asked her softly. She, too, turned to tuck her left leg under her so that she could properly face the woman head on. Her question had very obviously pulled at the woman's attention, her head righting as it sat atop her shoulders. Those shocking blue irises locked into Rio's in the dim light of the overhead and she simply nodded her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I haven't had an intellectually stimulating kill since Tuesday. And... It's pissed me off. Because I miss it... I miss..." Rio's focus dropped instantly, watching as she picked at her cuticles to the point of causing them to bleed. "I don't know, I guess I missed you. The way you challenge me, the way I would still have no fucking clue what was happening if I hadn't witnessed it with my own eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Rio felt brave enough to lift her gaze, the sight she was met with made her stomach sink even farther, seeping into the ground below them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman looked impossibly fickle in how fucking giddy she was at what Rio had said. That grin was downright diabolical and she looked like she was staring at a feast for the ages, but she was just staring at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Setting her jaw, Rio pulled out of her slouch, a new found curiosity burning within her. Yes, the reaction made Rio feel about an inch tall, but there was more to it. It made the woman
     <em>
      happy
     </em>
     to hear Rio admit something like that. It wasn't that she felt praised or coveted, but Rio had admitted to
     <em>
      missing
     </em>
     her, to missing her mind. Rio had let her know a little too loudly that her presence was what was missed.
    </p>
    <p>
     In return, she'd unknowingly sacrificed a bit of information about herself; it was in that look in her eyes, the one that lasted all of a few seconds before it disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      She cared about Rio, too.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     No one else had ever had the gall or the brains to figure Her out, let alone catch Her in the act. Even more was the fact that Rio had pushed, had wanted more and more and the woman had been unwillingly serving it up, little by little. Rio had clearly piqued her curiosity, too, and as a result, there were engaging in this strange battle of wills where neither of them wanted to admit to how far they might go to understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So then I suppose it was a good thing I caught you," the woman said, her devious amusement seeming to subside.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I suppose it was," Rio agreed. She was maintaining a level tone, not getting too tangled up in the idea that this had been a courtesy. Sure, maybe the woman found her interesting and gave a shit that Rio seemed to give a shit, but Rio had little reason to believe it to be any more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But you still never answered my question," she added, giving her best attempt at boring a hole through the woman with her gaze. "Why are you leaving?"
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, the woman did not ponder her answer. When she offered it, it was not a jab or a slice. It was simply fact.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have things to tend to. Things that require my full attention, so --"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Like what?" Rio pressed again, eyes narrowing in her scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just because I let you in my car does not mean you get my full itenerary. And the more questions you ask, the less I find it cute and the more I find it annoying." The woman's head turned to the right, glancing out the back windshield before she turned back to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But... I will be back. And... Maybe I hope to see you around." The woman's voice had dropped, smooth like velvet as she made her delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could have said anything and yet, what came out of her mouth was probably the one thing she should
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     have said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You said you'd find me. A lucky pass-by in town doesn't count. Figured you'd be a bit more creative." It was a challenge, a very intentional one that caused Rio's lips to twitch into a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hmph," the woman huffed, turning to right herself in her seat. "Don't know if that makes me want to try harder or if it makes me want to just... forget you exist."
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment those last three words left Her lips, Rio's stomach was right back into her body and it felt like someone had dumped a hefty pour of battery acid right into it. She began to scramble, to find a way to recover, but as her panicked gaze landed on the woman's profile, she was
     <em>
      grinning.
     </em>
     She was
     <em>
      joking.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And She had nearly given Rio a coronary in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go home, Rio," the woman offered gently just before she started her car again. "You will be the first to know when I return."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn't moved. She was still situated sideways in that leather seat, just staring at the woman, silently willing Her to just
     <em>
      look at her.
     </em>
     Somehow, someway, She must have heard Rio's call, because She turned her head, granting Rio one last full view of Her beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I still don't know your name," Rio reiterated, though there was a touch too much longing in her tone than she felt comfortable with. The shame did not touch her expression and she held eye contact with the other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know," the woman returned. After a moment of thought, she leaned a little closer in a way that left her half-way over the center console. She raised a finger, beckoning Rio closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Holy shit. Had that worked? Had that actually worked?
    </p>
    <p>
     Eagerly, Rio's torso tilted forward and her head shifted just enough so that the woman could deliver the holy grail of all Rio had been dying to know straight into her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "We'll get there soon enough. Be a good girl until then, won't you?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Several physiological reactions happened within Rio's brain and body:
    </p>
    <p>
     - The most intense drop of pressure occurred between her legs before it morphed into a full-blown hammering.
     <br/>
     - Every inch of her skin sheeted in goosebumps.
     <br/>
     - At least five beads of sweat appeared simultaneously on the back of her neck.
     <br/>
     - She choked on the breath she had been drawing in.
     <br/>
     - Her own fingernails dug roughly into the skin of her shin in a subconscious reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     In all actuality, Rio was almost certain she had just experienced Living Death.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman pulled back, but she did not go far. Instead, the way they were both tipped left their faces only a breath apart as they hung directly over the center console.
    </p>
    <p>
     All Rio had to do was move an inch. All she had to do was lean a little further and their lips would touch and she would know what it was like to kiss the lips of vengeance herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as she drew in a lungful of courage, the woman pulled away and turned herself toward the wheel again.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      NO! No, turn back! Almost! It was almost magic! It was almost a definitive answer!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have a good night, County Coroner," the woman offered, glancing only briefly toward Rio as she reached to click the lock, although the door had already been unlocked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked no less than twelve times at her before suddenly her faculties came rushing back and she knew her only option was to remove herself from the space. As she complied and planted her feet in the dirt, the woman had something to say before she shut the door. She didn't look over, but she spoke loud enough that Rio heard her clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Try not to miss me too much," she teased, a smirk visible on the right side of her mouth as Rio simply rolled her eyes and shut the door. Before she even made it back to her own car, the woman was off and Rio realized that at least some of her groceries were going to be ruined if she didn't make it home quickly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a slight toe over the speed limit, she had made it home in time, but the feeling that had developed low in her stomach felt like it was going to push her to a mental break.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was trying to run through it, to think about the entire conversation that had unfolded in the front of that car and how she
     <em>
      still
     </em>
     had few answers to the consistent questions that were plaguing her relentelessly. All she knew now was that for some undetermined amount of time, her work days were going to be a little less exciting and her nights would be empty of any hope that She might actually do as she had said.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was not going to turn up at Rio's door.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, if She ever
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     decide to track Rio down, Rio had the theory that she would be audacious enough to simply show up while Rio was at work and strut around that morgue like she wasn't the most prolific serial killer that side of Chicago had seen in some time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman was most certainly brave enough, and Rio would not have put it past Her, but for the sake of her own sanity, she was hoping that She had a little more decorum than that.
    </p>
    <p>
     After putting things away, Rio had slumped into the couch to try and watch something with Phineas laying on her chest. It worked for all of twenty minutes before she was gingerly laying Phineas on the couch and hurrying back to her room. When the door slammed behind her, she had been startled by her own strength. It was a distraction only for a moment before she was tearing into the closet to find something to ease the ache that had been rumbling in her core since the moment her ass touched that leather seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     After fucking herself to two orgasms in the shower with a tie dye dildo suction cupped to the wall, she had dressed in sleepwear -- a white tank top and an old pair of Alice's cheer shorts that she'd gotten before she'd dropped out of cheerleading her senior year of high school -- and opened the door so that Phineas could enter, having been waiting patiently outside in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
     By some miracle, she'd been able to sleep that night. It hadn't taken her long to drift off and she had somehow managed to sleep until her alarm went off the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     The weekend hadn't been awful, but with the understanding that she didn't need to be vigilant and on the look-out for Her, Rio decided to let herself relax a bit. She'd called Alice and they had spent the majority of the weekend together, bouncing around from bar to bar and ordering baked potatoes from a food cart at two in the morning. They'd gotten brunch and day drank until actualizing their limits and still being of the understanding that they both had to work the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow, the time out had served as a rather decent distraction. When Rio returned to work on Monday, the disappointment had resurfaced.
    </p>
    <p>
     By Wednesday night, Rio was driving herself insane again, at least to the point that she had to know more. She had been trying to show some form of self-control, but the only person she'd been lying to in that respect was herself. Not searching had been some kind of moral high ground she had taken, but it was pointless anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck morals.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took several long moments of staring at the search bar for Rio to think her way to a starting point. She tried to dig through the few conversations they'd had, anything that might have been some kind of end to a thread that she could pull on to unravel who this woman was.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, she found it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second night in the barn. Rio had asked her about the collar and she had answered honestly. Maybe too honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
     In went the search:
    </p>

     So she had started in Pennsylvania, all the way back in 2010. Then, there was something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     'IMPERIAL POLICE LOOKING FOR SUSPECT IN SPINAL CORD CASES (SEE PHOTO)'
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio clicked it without a second's hesitation. Inside, she found a photo of an old Toyota with a very clear showing of the Iowa license plate. The county name had been scratched away, but after Rio loaded the photo into Photoshop and spent twenty minutes messing with the settings, she could see the imprint of the pressed metal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Humboldt County.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was typing again, searching, digging, unearthing anything and everything she could about Humboldt County, Iowa. Going back five more years, she found exactly what she had been hoping for.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, buried pages deep in a Google search was a link to the Humboldt County High School Science Club.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were twelve teenagers in the photo, each nerdier than the one next to them. And then, there was a girl on the end with her arms folded and a scowl on her face that was practically shouting that she did not want to be in the photo.
    </p>
    <p>
     That nose, those eyes, that scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <em>
      Her.
     </em>
     As a
     <em>
      child.
     </em>
     A
     <em>
      teenager
     </em>
     , at the very least.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's attention shifted to the text below the photo. She skimmed through it, reading over the names despite the fact that she could have just skipped to the end to find what she was looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Agatha Harkness (far right).'
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Agatha Harkness.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been fucking herself for weeks without question to Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now, she knew her name.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that knowledge and in spite of
     <em>
      Agatha's
     </em>
     absence, Rio had found herself to be in quite the agreeable mood on Thursday, so much so that Alice asked a couple of times if she had gotten laid. She had laughed it off and dismissed Alice each time with a wave of her hand. No, Agatha had not fucked her.
     <em>
      Yet.
     </em>
     But at least now Rio could put a name to all of the ferally filthy thoughts she persistently had about her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had assumed that the following day would be much of the same, leading right into a weekend where she was sure she would wind up at Alice's side, pounding beers and shoving down pancakes at brunch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, when Alice had practically sprinted the cart into the morgue that morning, Rio had truly been stunned when she was informed by her friend that their mysterious serial killer had made a triumphant return. She had been right, as Rio had realized two hours later when she finished to autopsy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was mad.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was more than mad.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt shafted, slighted, like she hadn't been good enough for
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     to reach out to upon her return.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had taken every bit of energy she'd had to get through the rest of the day without alerting Alice to the fact that something had changed and Rio's frustration had mounted. It had been a task, and it felt like being put through the ringer, but she had managed it all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Alice had asked if they were going to hang out that weekend, Rio had manufactured some lie about needing to take Phineas hiking for some fresh air, but added that she would reach out if she had the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, all Rio wanted to do was sulk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her feelings had been hurt; she was so confused about whatever dynamic had formed between herself and
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     , and now it felt like she had been just shoved to the back of the other woman's mind, forgotten as if she had never meant much in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd microwaved a serving of pasta and broccoli with cheese sauce and ate it straight out of the bag as she sat, legs crossed, pouting on the couch. Well, she had tried to eat it, at least. She got about three bites in and decidedly no longer wanted anything to do with it. To supplement for the loss of her meal, Rio retrieved a beer from the refrigerator and took her post back up on the couch, this time with Phineas laying his chin on her thigh, asking that she pay attention to him.
    </p>
    <p>
     A soft and defeated sigh passed through her lips, her hand raising to smooth over the fur between his ears. She'd kept up the motion as she drank a good portion of her beer, only stopping when he snapped his head up and looked toward the door, as if he had heard something.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reaching for the remote, Rio muted the television, listening hard for what it was that might have alarmed him. She didn't hear voices, or any other sounds from the hallway and she was listening
     <em>
      hard.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She was listening
     <em>
      so hard
     </em>
     that when a very loud and very strong knock sounded on
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     door, she nearly jumped right over the back of the couch. With all the grace of a newborn fawn, Rio rocketed to her feet and stumbled over to the front door, peering through it to find nothing but blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Someone was covering the peephole.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can I help you?" Rio called through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of an answer, there was another powerful knock.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, shit. There was only one thing to do that didn't involve calling the cops.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had to open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, she didn't
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to and she probably should have called Alice at the very least to see if it was her, but she did anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     And when she did, she didn't regret it.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, in a deep scarlet evening dress that almost looked like it was made of leather and with her long and wild hair tamed into loose curls, stood the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      There stood Agatha, at Rio's front door.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Holy fucking shit.

    <p>
     Rio blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then she blinked again and again. Ten more times.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well are you gonna leave a girl out in the cold?" Agatha questioned, cocking an arrogant brow, a cunning smirk playing across her lips with sickening ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     There Rio stood in her tank top and shorts with her hair pulled up in the most shoddy bun; she hadn't even really tried. A night in with Phineas had been the only thing on the agenda and so she had felt no need to look any other way than relaxed and comfortable. The last thing she had been expecting after a frustrating day was for
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     of all people to show up at door.
    </p>
    <p>
     For one moment -- all that was needed, apparently -- Rio felt the insult flame up in her belly. Her brow pinched and she wedged herself between the door and the frame, denying Agatha even a peek into her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You told me I would be the first to know when you got back," Rio pointed out sharply. Okay, so maybe that hadn't been the exact promise, but it was close enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     The expression that filled Agatha almost looked wounded as a hand raised to brush fingertips over her exposed chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you not get the body I left you?" she questioned, the gears beginning to turn behind those wicked blue irises. It was as if she were trying to calculate where else it could have gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, I got the body," Rio answered flatly. Her expression had not lifted or wavered from how stoic she was trying to keep it, and she had not budged from the doorway. "You came back yesterday?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I did," Agatha answered with a curt nod, her gaze wandering to the sliver of space between Rio's head and the doorframe. "You should go get ready." By the time she delivered the instruction, they were locked in a stare again and Rio wasn't sure if she wanted to slam the door in Agatha's face to catch a breath or make the decision to
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     let her in.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had little time to make it, or else Agatha was going to decide this was a waste of time and take off. Important information needed to be acquired first, thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get ready for what?" Rio asked; she was genuinely surprised at the strength she was managing in her voice. The fact that it hadn't started to quake once during the interaction to that point was impressive in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dinner," Agatha answered simply, flipping her hair over her shoulder. The confidence that was oozing out of her was delicious but Rio also knew that it could be filled with nothing but poison if she was not careful.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dinner?" Rio returned, clearly confused. And then her eyes began to wander. The way the dress was cut was drool-worthy in its own right, but the way it bunched in certain spots -- like her hips -- and tilted slightly at the hem line, it made Agatha damn near irresistible. Her eyes snapped back up and Agatha was smirking again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes. Dinner. You. Me. Oriole. Made the reservation the night after our little countryside chat." The cadence that Agatha was choosing in those moments was doing something to Rio, something she didn't want it to do: It was melting away the heat of her anger, the anger she had been carrying with her since that morning when that body had come across her table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Rio actually
     <em>
      heard
     </em>
     what she had said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You made the reservation a week ago?" The skepticism was thick and tight, but Rio had yet to move. She was still torn between pouting and engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh. That was new.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     willing to chase and chase and chase, but now that she was the one being chased, she was developing a whole new anxiety. It was a new brand that came with the realization that while she had
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     Agatha to come and find her, the fact that she actually had was mildly startling.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been this idea in Rio's head, especially since her shift that day, that Agatha had moved on. She was tired of Rio and her little games and as such, she had packed up and relocated, even if she had given warning that she was going to disappear for a short while.
    </p>
    <p>
     For her to be standing there in that insane dress looking like absolute royalty, it felt like Rio was experiencing some kind of fever dream. Had someone spiked her beer? That was stupid; she lived alone and Phineas did not possess opposable thumbs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I did. I told you I would be back. And you behaved yourself, it seems. So, I'm here to make good on your reward."
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      My reward would be better if we forget about dinner.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Thankfully, that thought didn't leave the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had not even kissed; Agatha was not going to march right in there and throw Rio around her apartment like a ragdoll -- though Rio had zero doubts that she was entirely capable of it -- and make every stupid and wild fantasy she'd had over the last few weeks come true. It hadn't even been a month and yet, Agatha was all Rio could think about. Now that she was there, in the flesh, Rio had to wonder if it was simply too good to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You really made reservations at Oriole?" Rio asked back finally, just seeking confirmation before she decided to allow a serial killer into her home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I did. And if you take any longer to get ready, we're not going to make them," Agatha informed her, gaze flickering over Rio's shoulder again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Crunch time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had to make a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was running out of time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was going to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha
     <em>
      couldn't
     </em>
     leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was Rio's opportunity, the one she had been practically chomping at the bit for: Agatha was going to give her just a little more. The boundaries of which were surely to be determined, but this was a chance for Rio to know a little more, to get a little closer. She'd been thinking about this woman, about her big and beautiful and twisted brain, for weeks on end and now, she was about to squander the potential to know more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could not fucking do that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, with the tiniest hitching of her lips, Rio stepped back and pulled the door open to allow Agatha entry, watching her as she strode in. The moment she passed Rio, that dark and suddenly hungry gaze dropped down the exposed section of Agatha's back that was covered by her hair, down that plush material to where it hugged every perfect curve of her ass.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      God, she was so fucking sexy.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! You have a cat!" Agatha nearly squealed in her delight; it was such an adverse reaction to what Rio had been expecting. She had expected her to gag, to try to keep away. The fact that Agatha walked right across that living room to where Phineas was sat on the couch and held her hand out? It was surprising in the best way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "His name is Phineas. He's two."
    </p>
    <p>
     What was then
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     surprising was how Phineas lifted his head and sniffed at Agatha's hand. It took him about three seconds before his ears pinned back and a low growl began to vibrate out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, not friendly! Noted!" she declared, righting herself as her focus shifted to assessing the space around her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, Rio felt self-conscious. She had friends over, and Alice had practically lived in that apartment some weekends. Hell, she'd even brought women home when she'd once given a shit about social dynamics enough to sleep around. Right then, having Agatha in her inner sanctum, Rio felt squirmy and uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very... chic. A little lively for the profession, but best not to judge a book by it's cover!" Agatha chirped, spinning on Rio as she clapped her hands together in front of her. "And you are not dressed and ready... why?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Who the hell did this woman think she was to march into Rio's apartment and start ordering her around? Who was she to think that she was the one who could call the shots within those walls? What made her the authority on what Rio chose to do with her time?
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite her desire to be affronted, it was fucking pointless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course Rio was going to march into her bedroom and pick out a dress and accompany this woman who thought she was still without an identity in Rio's mind.
     <em>
      Of course
     </em>
     she was going to scour her closet for the most fucking diabolical thing she could find that would drive Agatha up a wall. If she wanted to play games, Rio was going to play them right back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorry, just making sure he didn't maul you to death before we even started the evening," Rio informed her as she began to pace toward the hall. "I'd say make yourself comfortable, but you'd do it without my permission anyway, so... Have at it." With a gentle wave of her hand, Rio disappeared down the hall and into her bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     The most insane thought crossed her mind:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I hope she just follows me.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alas, she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Rio flipped through her collection of formal wear, trying to discern which option would be the best. There was a deep green wrap piece that showcased her ribs and while it
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     undeniably sexy, there had to be something better.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took her only another minute to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a black dress, one she did not wear often, if at all. It wasn't her first choice for events because it was a little...
     <em>
      ahem,
     </em>
     showier than a lot of the other dresses she owned. After turning on her straightening iron, Rio paced back into the bedroom and began to strip, with a little voice in the back of her head screaming that it hoped Agatha would just barge right in.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't, much to Rio's disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took her little time to get into the dress, which was good for how much time she needed for her hair and makeup.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she emerged from her bedroom twenty-five minutes later, Rio was thoroughly pleased with her appearance. Her heels clicked softly on the hardwood as she strode back to where Agatha was casually observing her kitchen decor. At the sound, though, she spun around.
    </p>
    <p>
     For several long moments, Rio wished that she would have thought to have her phone handy so that she could have appropriately captured the look on Agatha's face when she caught sight of Rio fully dressed and ready to spend a night out eating expensive food and drinking the most expensive bottle they had available, as she assumed this was all on Agatha's tab.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, in three inch strappy heels, Rio stood sporting the most deadly black dress. Her torso was covered in the soft black material all the way to mid-waist almost all the way around. At the very front was a long, flowing piece of the fabric that dropped all the way to the ground between her legs. The dress being sleeveless was not the most skin it showed; there was another long piece of the material that covered the majority of Rio's backside, but the hips were left exposed and only covered by a weaving of straps that created a diamond pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hair was down and straight, falling smoothly over her shoulders and settling in a way that framed her features just right. Lips were red and dark, and only a thin layer of eyeliner accented her lids. She was put together in a fashion that she did not usually commit to, but it seemed as though this was an occasion, one of the special variety.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was little question to be found that Rio had known exactly what she was doing when she had put that dress on. The proof was obvious in the way Agatha's jaw had practically become unhinged and her eyes looked like they were one wrong breath away from falling out of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had gobsmacked her, probably for the first time since they had first crossed paths.
    </p>
    <p>
     Good. She deserved it for doing it to Rio first by showing up the way she had.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You alright?" came Rio's facetious interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I --" Agatha began, but the thought died on her tongue and reformed into something new, something more akin to what Rio expected out of her, even if she didn't immediately understand it. "You dropped the 'n.' Holy fucking shit."
    </p>
    <p>
     Puzzled, Rio's brow knit tight to display her lack of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Catching on, Agatha elaborated.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You went from 'morticiaN' to 'MorticiA.' Fucking hell."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was stupid. It was probably the dumbest pick-up line that Rio had ever heard in her life, but it still somehow ignited a small vat of fuel that had been stored low in her belly for some time. The way Agatha was looking at her, it was as if
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     were the feast, and not whatever half-thousand dollar meal they were about to indulge in.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was sizing her up, checking Rio out and while Agatha had given her more than just a glance before, being in that dress and looking the way she did, Rio
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     there was more there. She knew that this was
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     the kind of rise Agatha had been trying to get out of her, and she could see so clearly in those blue eyes that Agatha was far too smug over it working.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So I take it I look presentable enough to be seen with, then?" Rio posed, offering a true and bright grin for the first time since Agatha had shown up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I almost don't
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     you to be seen," Agatha said back. It was low, almost sultry even, but she did not advance. She didn't pace forward from the lip of the dining room and she did not reach out to touch Rio, much to Rio's own chagrin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Almost?" Rio quipped in return. She sold it as playful, but she was gently pushing, applying pressure to see how much she might be able to get away with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     This, Agatha chose to dismiss. Instead, her shoulders shimmied and her chin lifted as she paced forward and extended an arm for Rio to take. "We ready, then?" she asked confidently, glancing down to her bare and crooked arm, just waiting for a hand to be fastened over it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I suppose we are."
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, the two of them met the night and the awaiting car that Agatha had undoubtedly arrived in and forced to wait at the curb for over a half an hour until Rio had been able to put herself together. The driver was friendly, but he seemed slightly annoyed that he had been waiting so long. When Agatha reached into the brassiere of the dress and produced a one hundred dollar bill and slapped it over his shoulder, the sourness he had been sporting immediately dissipated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although they were close in the back seat of the car, they were not close enough to be touching.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't reach for her, didn't try to hold her hand and so Rio simply recognized that it was best to extend the same respect. She didn't want to blow this before she'd even had a chance to have an actual conversation with Agatha that did not center around murder and her brilliantly violent mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence was almost maddening, even as they made their way into the restaurant and Agatha delivered a fake name -- Amelia Cohen -- for their reservation. Despite Agatha's goading back at the apartment, they were actually a few minutes early.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment they were ushered further into the restaurant, something absentminded on Agatha's part happened: She reached for Rio's hand, using it to tug her like a leash through the tables, further and further into a web that Rio might not be able to escape. Yet, with their palms touching and the sudden booming of Rio's beating heart in her ears and low in her middle, Rio was ready for the reaping.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were seated quickly and a sommelier appeared tableside. Agatha's attention was lifted and focused on him immediately, a warm smile finding her easily.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A bottle of the Chablis to start," she stated and the man gave a nod, disappearing from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knew what she was doing, that much was clear to Rio. She had been there before, had done this dance with God knew how many people.
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     thought gave Rio a sharp pang in her middle, just below her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Ew! Was that jealousy?!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     This was dinner. This was nothing
     <em>
      more
     </em>
     than dinner. It was just a chance to ingratiate herself a little better into Agatha's world, and it couldn't have been any better for the sole reason that Agatha had been the one to extend the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So," Agatha began, scooting her chair toward the table just barely. "Have you ever been here before?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's immediate reaction was to bark a dry laugh that, while cutting, was not exactly loud. "You're kidding, right?" Clearly, judging by the look on her face, Agatha was absolutely kidding. "A single four course here is worth an entire week's work for me and it costs fifty dollars for
     <em>
      them
     </em>
     to uncork wine
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     bring in. No, I have never been here."
    </p>
    <p>
     There was amusement shimmering in those heterochromatic eyes, the lights of the candles on the table showcasing the softest flecks of aqua over azure.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hm,
     </em>
     Rio considered,
     <em>
      hadn't noticed that before.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, there was at least one new piece to a very massive puzzle. It was a minor detail and had no bearing on who Agatha was as a woman, but it was something...
     <em>
      extraordinary
     </em>
     about her, something that Rio might have missed under all other circumstances. It was just a little fact about her, a little ding in Agatha's biology that gave her yet another reason to stand out.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, the nose, the eyes, that charming smile, they weren't enough. She needed that tiny twist of genetic material to prove that she could stand out just a little more in the quietest of ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I suppose you're in for a treat then," Agatha informed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to put a name to the way Agatha was looking at her. It wasn't like she was going to attack her and pick her bones clean, but there was still a predatory undertone to her posture, the way she was carrying herself. She was doing this, taking Rio out and treating her to the nicest meal she'd had in her life, but Rio couldn't help but feel like there was some kind of ulterior motive.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could not let herself believe that Agatha had found interest in
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     the way she had found it within Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was idiotic. Perhaps more so than every other decision she had made up to that point.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was intelligent. She knew a lot of things about the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio also had terrible decision making capabilities and seemed to wrestle with impulsivity to no end. It would explain why she had not shut the door in Agatha's face and was instead sitting across from her wearing a dress that dictated the fact that she could not wear underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wondered if Agatha had paid close enough attention to figure
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     out.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the sommelier reappeared, Agatha still seemed far too composed for Rio's liking. It was clear that she was the one steering how this went, but Rio didn't like that. In fact, while she had agreed to this... whatever it was, Rio was not going to just lay down and submit to Agatha's every demand and whim.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, after the Chablis had been poured and their order had been taken by someone else, it was time to break through that timid casing that had been so snug around Rio since she had first set eyes upon Agatha in that bar. No more pussyfooting around, acting like she wasn't capable of holding her own. It was time to push back and stare directly into the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was that sun. And Rio didn't give a shit if she went blind and got burned in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do I finally get to ask questions now?" Rio challenged coyly, taking a sip of the alcohol as she visually examined Agatha over the rim of her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     "With stipulations," Agatha answered almost before Rio could even finish swallowing her drink. "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And those stipulations are... What, exactly?" came Rio's next pressing. She was testing the waters, seeing how far she might be able to swim out before Agatha tried to drown her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not telling you my name, first off," Agatha announced firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
     In that very moment, Rio was fighting for her fucking life to not let a massive smirk paint itself in its sinister nature across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh, dear Agatha, you don't have to. I already know it.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Second?" Rio encouraged, shifting slightly in her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Generalized questions are fine, but nothing interrogatory. No town names, school names, college names, employer names. Nothing descriptive." As Rio listened to her list off her limits, she found them all to be rather agreeable. She understood that Agatha felt she had to cling to her anonymity like a lifeline, and she could respect that for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is there a third?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was still watching Rio, her eyes only slightly narrowed and her lips pursed the most minute amount. Rio could see it, the realization as it washed over Agatha that perhaps she might have bitten off more than she could chew in one go. Rio had been passive to that point, allowing her obsession and thirst for knowledge push her to lengths she would not normally go to, but that was over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, she had Agatha's full attention and she was not going to squander it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "They have to be... public appropriate. If you can abide by those three rules, perhaps it will afford you a more... private conversations where I could possibly be willing to answer those questions I'd kill you for asking here," Agatha answered, though the haughty laugh that she tacked on to the end of her words made the hair on Rio's arms stand on end.
    </p>
    <p>
     It also made two very prominent pulse points quiver in her body; one was in her chest and the other was smack dab between her legs. The latter was the one that pulled her attention a little more.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could she be so stupidly
     <em>
      sexy
     </em>
     as she was making
     <em>
      literal death threats
     </em>
     as a
     <em>
      serial killer?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can adhere, you have my word." It wasn't light or teasing, it was a serious delivery of intent. Rio could work with those rules; she
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     intelligent after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well then," Agatha acknowledged, holding her glass up. "To a nice evening out. I think we both could use it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Sitting up a little more, Rio picked up her glass and held it in offering, clinking it gently to the side of Agatha's. "To a nice evening out. Thank you for the unexpected deman -- I mean, invitation," Rio poked, her eyes sparkling with her suddenly discovered sense of mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two sipped at their drinks for the longest moment, simply sizing one another up as if they were preparing to enter the throes of combat. Agatha was fastening her armor and Rio was sharpening her sword. Agatha
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     what she was doing by opening this door wide enough for Rio to run through it, and she also was fully aware that it was not a surprise for her to do so in a full-on assault.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Question one," Rio stated in warning, lowering her glass to rest on the table. She leaned toward the table, as if it would help her get a closer look at Agatha. "What was your favorite thing to do in summer?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The briefest flicker of something unidentifiable washed over Agatha, but Rio had glanced away for only a beat to find it gone when her attention returned.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I swam a lot," she answered, though she took little time to consider the answer. That was because she had already realized she needed to be vague, no matter what question it was Rio decided to ask. "Lakes, creeks, the ocean. I just loved to be in the water."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a modest answer, something that felt a little too shallow given what they were doing there and the events that had led them to that point. Rio let it slide, at least for now.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And school? Did you have a favorite subject?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could see it, the mild irritation that was beginning to flare in Agatha. She had laid down parameters, but she'd had no way to know that Rio was going to keep to them in the most fucking annoying way possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I did." It was an answer, one that was surely meant to annoy Rio right back. It did absolutely nothing to deter her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what was it?" she asked, a drops of giddiness beginning to seep into her tone as she realized she was starting to get under Agatha's skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Science."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, that had almost been predictable. Rio's response this time was not a question, but a gentle show of camaraderie.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mine too." It was quiet, without any sense of taunting or teasing. That one was honest, that one was real.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmhm," Agatha hummed, that sharp gaze deducing where, exactly, she was going to cut into Rio first. "Taxidemy, right?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The heat that had been bubbling in Rio's stomach suddenly froze over. That cold and chilling feeling that spread through her extremities felt too intense considering Rio had already had a good inkling that Agatha had done her research. Moreover, why was
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     more jarring than the fact that Agatha had uncovered
     <em>
      where she lived?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes. It was a hobby. Haven't done anything with it in a while," Rio admitted with a shrug as she swept up her glass with a shrug. "College major?" she posed next, trying to keep things moving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's gaze narrowed again in assessment, trying to calculate her next move. Throwing up a brick wall of a deterrent seemed to be her course of action.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not pertinent. My turn." It was clear that Rio's little scoops were effective not in the way that she was actually learning facts about Agatha's life, but they were effective in the sense that she was unsettling Agatha. Now, she was going to take the opportunity to get the upper hand back in her possession.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I thought --" Agatha's hand whipped up in a gesture that silenced Rio in an instant, lips pressing as her mouth snapped shut.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Was your first time in college? Cadaver inspection, I mean?" she posed, raising her own glass for a sip.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well Jesus Fucking Christ. Rio had not anticipated that the topic of dead bodies would come up in a restaurant where the first bite alone was over a hundred dollars. Especially because Agatha's stipulation was that it
     <i>
      had
     </i>
     to be public appropriate. But, then again, an academic discussion was hardly
     <i>
      awful
     </i>
     she supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Rio answered honestly, but before she could offer elaboration, the table was approached by a waiter who introduced the first bite as Irish Blue Lobster with marinated tomatoes and habanero sorbet.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't even want to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dutifully still, she thanked him before he disappeared and she was drowning in Agatha's intense stare all over again. "My dad owned a funeral home."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, that struck a cord of interest. Agatha's brows both arched in her surprised, that scrutiny waning the slightest bit as Rio started to open up a little more.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The first time I snuck in probably would have traumatized anyone else my age but... When the power went out and no one knew I was in there? I didn't want to be found. It was quiet, it was cold. It was... comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was watching in real time as she slowly started to pluck at the corners of the steel plates Agatha consistently used for her armor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I hadn't thought about working in a morgue until after I graduated college and realized that field work wasn't exactly what I wanted. And now, I have a happy home in somewhere quiet and cold and comfortable. I just get paid for it." This time, when she wrapped up her small anecdote, a slight smile tugged on the corners of Rio's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Full circle kinda thing, then?" Agatha posed, leaning forward to examine the food on the table before her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I guess so," Rio responded with another small shrug. She, too, turned her attention toward the plates before them. They were both quiet for the couple of moments it took to devour the first course, simply enjoying the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
     The truth was, Rio had never tasted anything so fucking good in her entire life. It made sense that it was so expensive, and it made sense that this was Agatha's way of flexing. It was her way of showing Rio a good time and proving a few things in the process, like the fact that she had money to throw away like it was nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Rio's turn for a question.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had about three of them she could have asked: 'Favorite way to pass time?' 'Any pets?' 'Best legal way to spend a Friday night?'
    </p>
    <p>
     None of them came out, though. Instead, what fell from her lips caused an angry tide of red to wash over Agatha's cheeks the moment she understood the question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What made you leave home?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The second Rio noticed the flush, she felt her throat close up; it wasn't the lobster as she'd never had a shellfish allergy before in her life. No, it was the way Agatha looked like Rio had stabbed her with a red hot poker.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Agatha clipped in response, her tone tight and surgical in the way it cut a clean line directly over Rio's chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, fine," Rio huffed, leaning back in her chair as she tried to regroup. That rejection had actually offered a bit of a sting that Rio had not been anticipating. She needed to fortify, to root and tower to the best of her ability. "Why did you come to Chicago?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact that Rio was watching as Agatha became more avoidant and her irritation grew, she started to feel frustration building in her stomach. Why had Agatha offered her this opportunity if she was just going to shut down at the most basic questions? Rio didn't care about city names or job titles. All she wanted to know was what made Agatha tick.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why wouldn't Agatha just tell her?
    </p>
    <p>
     "No again."
    </p>
    <p>
     A scowl cinched Rio's expression, her own eyes darkening in her disdain for the sudden left turn this had taken before she'd ever even realized it was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could dredge up a dig about how pointless this was starting to seem, the waiter appeared with the second course;
     <em>
      fucking beets and sake leeks.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     What the fuck actually was this restaurant? The plates were settled and the waiter was gone once more, but Rio had suddenly lost interest in her food. The only thing she was interested in right then was pushing every fucking button Agatha had for wasting her damn time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mom's name? First pet? Childhood street name? Oh! I know! What about your kindergarten teacher!?" Rio fired off, leaning over the table, her legs shifting slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had made a grave miscalculation in her movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had separated her legs. The table between them was not wide at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could process what had happened, Agatha's leg shot up under the table, her foot landing squarely between Rio's legs, effectively pinning that center strip of fabric of her dress to the chair beneath her ass.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was both a very clear threat and a very unintentional smashing of Rio's containment on her lust and desire.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was torn; Rio knew she needed to be scared. She had very obviously pissed Agatha off, enough that she was showing her physical force in a very underhanded and very dangerous way. At the same time, Rio was so fucking turned on that she was ready to unzip her skin and crawl right out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Knock it off," Agatha warned lowly, her eyes narrowing in a glare that was surely meant to cripple Rio in some way. It didn't work though.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why? Afraid I might want to know too much? Just because I'm asking the questions doesn't mean you are obligated to answer them. The fact that you're choosing to get upset about it is more telling than anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not snap back at her, did not deliver any cold or cutting remark she could have mustered. No, Agatha picked up her glass of Chablis and threw back the remainder of its contents before slamming it down onto the table. Her foot jerked away from the seat of Rio's chair and she stood abruptly, her own chair nearly tipping back from the sheer force of the action.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I paid when I made the reservation. Enjoy the fucking meal."
    </p>
    <p>
     That time, those words spat at Rio the way they were, it actually hurt. The venom in them actually did damage. Rio had been prodding, but she hadn't actually meant to push or apparently shove. It had not been her intention to actually anger Agatha, even if the annoyance factor had been a fun idea to toy with. The fact that she looked
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     fucking angry over a bunch of punchy questions and astute observations?
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't seem fair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wait! I was just --!"
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't matter. Rio felt the breeze as Agatha blew by her and stalked her way out of the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know what it was like to be electrocuted.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't know how it felt to be hit by a car.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had never experienced a heart attack.
    </p>
    <p>
     But right then as she took in a breath to steady her wildly beating heart and was only met with a nose full of Agatha's woodsy perfume, Rio was certain that all three things were happening to her at once, even if there was no actual proof for such a deduction.
    </p>
    <p>
     All she knew was that she didn't give a single fuck about the goddamn beets or her half-finished glass of Chablis.
    </p>
    <p>
     All she cared about was getting the fuck out of there and retreating to her apartment to wallow in her own misery.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd fucked up.
    </p>
    <p>
     The worst part about it was knowing she would never see Agatha again.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha still thought Rio didn't care enough to know who she
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     was.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
   </div>
   <!--/chapter content-->
   <div>

   <!--chapter content-->
   <div>
    <p>
     Rio had known, but by the time she made it out to the front walk of the restaurant, Agatha was long gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Shit. Fuck. Goddamnit. Motherfucker.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Reflecting back over the last half hour, Rio knew that she had not actually
     <em>
      pushed
     </em>
     past the limits that Agatha had laid down prior to Rio's inquisition. Sure, she had leaned against them and applied the slightest pressure, but Rio did not ask her name, did not ask for names of any important milestones, and did not ask any publicly inappropriate questions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had kept to the parameters, and Agatha had still gotten angry and stormed out, being sure to drop that cursing on her way out. It was an obvious way to prove to Rio that the buttons she'd chosen to push at that table had been the wrong ones and she had lost her shot at ever knowing more. Now, Agatha was gone. And if Rio's calculations were correct, Agatha would realize that she had cut ties with someone who knew
     <em>
      who she was
     </em>
     and would likely pack her shit and just take off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because Agatha had created a loose end and for as angry as she had looked at Rio's barrage, Rio still did not think that Agatha would actually kill her. She was probably mad as fuck right then as she stormed into her own home and began throwing things around for a quick split, and she was probably thinking of every single way she could string Rio up and flay her alive, but acting on it was something else entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had said, a few times, that killing women was not in her wheelhouse. Rio had believed her the first time, but she grew to believe her even more with each tiny sliver she got to add that might help her see the whole picture better.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had lost focus, though, and had indulged her own need to see Agatha squirm, effectively flipping the table that was supporting whatever game it was they were trying to play.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was over, now, and as Rio watched the city pass by the Uber window on her way home, she felt like a fucking idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being stupid about things like following a suspected serial killer and continuing to engage with her was a familiar brand of idiocy. This form of being an absolute moron was something different, something a little more gut-wrenching.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had not meant to anger her, even if she had meant to toe the line of mystery between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had, though, and she was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, not entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she unlocked her front door and pushed it open, Phineas was perched on the arm of the sofa, staring at her expectantly, like a parent who had been waiting up for their child to come home after they snuck out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't look at me like that," Rio grumbled, kicking the door shut. She took the moment to unlace her heels and stepped out of them and promptly made her way to the sofa, an automatic hand finding the top of Phin's head to scratch between his ears, just the way he liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you behave while I was gone? Because I did not and one of us needs to have a little decorum," came her soft murmurs.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Brrp brrp.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Those tiny little chirps seemed to hone directly in to the path it took to reach her auditory cortex and nestled there like a warm hug. She'd been kicking herself since she'd watched as Agatha disappeared, but seeing that there was still a little soul out there who needed her around was grounding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part of Rio felt like Agatha probably did in those moments. She just wanted to run. She wanted to disappear and forget that any of this had ever happened to her. Rio couldn't do that, though; she had a job where people knew who she was, a job where she frequently rubbed elbows with law enforcement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't vanish because
     <em>
      someone
     </em>
     would come looking for her. If no one else, Alice would never rest until she saw Rio with her own two eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     because she never let anyone in so that they could care enough to go looking when she left.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a sense of care there, for Rio, but she also knew that if she went looking for Agatha, it was going to end nowhere good. It would probably just piss Agatha off more and while Rio did not fear for her life, she also did not put it past Agatha to put her hands on her in anger, as she had already proved she was capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't know enough about Agatha to disprove that possibility. It hadn't lent anything toward her caution, but that was because there was an irrationally mild reaction to the thought of Agatha touching her in fury again. The heat in her palm as it had fastened directly to Rio's throat had been so intense, so thrilling.
    </p>
    <p>
     While not a fan of being physically struck, something completely cracked inside of Rio's brain whispered the fact that if Agatha ever hit her, she'd probably come on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hell, she'd almost done that when they'd held fucking hands, she'd just managed to contain it some fucking how.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, over two hours after Agatha had turned up at her door, Rio was in her apartment alone without a lick of companionship to show for it. Agatha was gone, but the feeling of her foot between Rio's legs was not.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had managed to distract herself for the time it took to get home, but it could have only ever lasted as long as it took her to stop pacing and circling in her own mind. Now that she was still, now that she had taken a breath, everything came crashing back into her before she could brace.
    </p>
    <p>
     That heavy and sharp thrumming had immediately kicked back up between her legs, almost knocking the breath right out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Stop that!
     </em>
     she internally scolded, though her body's reaction was to simply intensify the feeling. It was almost as if someone were simply kicking her, over and over again, and making direct contact with the apex of her thighs. She tried to breathe through it, tried to find some shred of sense to cram back into her head, but as every memory and every trace of Agatha filled her mind, she knew it was hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt so fucking horny it was almost making her sick.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the thought crossed her mind that Agatha should have choked her in the restaurant to truly assert dominance, she was either going to throw up or have to find a way to promptly bury her tie-dye dildo as deep into herself as she could manage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Option 2 won out.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was difficult to ignore the angry and agitated churning in her stomach as she practically sprinted into her bedroom to retrieve the strap. She slipped the silicone through the o-ring and paced back into the living room, heading straight for that damn chair. When she reached it, Rio realized that she had skipped a step in her frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a deep breath and a
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     heavy sigh, Rio turned -- still in that ridiculous dress that had left her with the feeling of slightly sticky thighs as a direct result of her lack of panties -- and dropped her chin to take in the sight of Phineas. He had moved from the arm of the sofa and was curled up on a throw pillow that was smaller than he was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorry dude, one of us has to stay pure," she murmured at him, hunching over to scoop him up into her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     He let out a low meow of protest, but he did not fight her as she carried him back to her room. She could have just dumped him at the door and let him figure it out, but Rio had a little more respect for him than that and placed him on the bed before she bolted out and closed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment it came into view, her eyes were locked onto that strap where she had laid it on the chair so that she could save Phineas from incurring visuals he would never need in his life. Plus, if he threw up, Rio didn't want to be forced to clean it up because there was no one else around to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     At this point, there was little else to do. If she didn't find a way to work this practically painful twisting of lust and aching and yearning out of her system, she felt like she might actually just expire.
    </p>
    <p>
     It fucking
     <em>
      hurt
     </em>
     . It was almost as if she had been denied the ability to know real orgasmic pleasure for years on end and she felt ready to combust. Of course, it wasn't true. However, it
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     like it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a flexibility that bordered in abnormal, Rio managed to get her dress unzipped and started to wiggle her way out of it. Before she could even reach up to pull at the collar, something happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something terrifying happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a loud knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      A really fucking loud knock.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stilled, feeling like she'd been paralyzed. Before it even made sense, she knew who was on the other side of the door. She knew it wasn't Alice, or any of her other friends. She knew it wasn't the landlord of the maintenance guy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was confirmed the moment she looked through the peephole; it wasn't covered this time and although she was
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     out of view, Rio could see whisps and tangles of that wild, wild mane as well as the smallest slivers of that delectable red dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had come back.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      AGATHA. HAD. COME. BACK!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it could be she was there to settle this once and for all with Rio's head on a platter, but that felt unlikely. And... From what Rio could see of that expression Agatha was wearing as she waited in the hallway, she looked... upset? Maybe that wasn't the right word.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio should have said something, but instead she impulsively chose to pull the door open. The moment she did, Agatha's head snapped up and for the quickest flash of a moment, something close to relief skated across those pretty, pretty blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What are you --?" Rio had wanted to ask the question, wanted to demand an explanation as to why Agatha thought she could storm out in a temper tantrum just to show up like this, but Agatha did not give her the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Agatha surged forward -- tossing her clutch to the floor inside the apartment -- and brought both of her hands up, positioning them so that her palms were able to cradle the hard angle of Rio's jaw on both sides. Once her hold was firm, she used it to pull Rio toward her, meeting her halfway so that their lips met in a collision that hurt in the sweetest way. There had been no care or caution there, no attention to speed or proximity. It seemed as though pain didn't matter when Agatha wanted to kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Agatha was kissing her.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      HOLY SHIT! AGATHA WAS KISSING HER!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Snapping back into the moment violently, that sheerly painful throbbing of her core was reaching intolerable levels. It almost tipped the moment her lips parted to deepen the kiss but Agatha's tongue slid into her mouth first. It was hot, it was heavy, it was
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     fucking intense.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hands had landed on Agatha's arms, but there was no pressure or grip there, she was simply clinging to something that she had been convinced immediately was a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was hallucinating. There was no explanation for it. There was no other way to make sense of the fact that Agatha's thumbs were applying pressure to Rio's jaw, or that the tip of her tongue was tracing the inmost parts of Rio's mouth in its hunger. Nothing would ever provide a logical cause for the fact that every single inch of her skin felt like it had been set ablaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite how entirely detached Rio felt from her body, she somehow found it within herself to show initative and kiss Agatha back. It took a moment to truly fall into the groove, but once she did, they were like a pair of teenagers necking in the open doorway, unable to garner enough restraint to wait until they were both inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was Agatha's fault. She had done that. She could have spoken, could have offered any explanation for her behavior, but she had decided to speak with her actions instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her actions right then were making Rio want to completely shred that dress to get it off of Agatha's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few prolonged moments of tongues and sucking and kissing and gently gripping, their mouths found distance as winded lungs craved oxygen. Rio did not open her head in the process of catching her breath and instead opted to tilt her head forward, forehead landing to rest along the slope of Agatha's nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     She needed to pull it together and at least invite her in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, shit. Wait. Not the best idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hand slid up Agatha's arm, her palm canvassing Agatha's touch, feeling almost every carpal ridge beneath her touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Give me a minute,"
     </em>
     Rio whispered in a soft plea, lightly giving Agatha's fingers a squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was distance between them as Rio glanced around the door to spot the harness, knowing she had to be quick in stowing it somewhere out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perceptive as ever, Agatha didn't miss the look on Rio's face as she looked back. When Agatha spoke, it was hard to tell if Agatha was donning that facetiousness again or not.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that Phineas?!" she gasped, pushing past Rio before Rio had a chance to try to stop her. The door had not even clicked shut by the time Agatha's voice sounded again in a soft but surprised
     <em>
      "Oh."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Plummeting into shame, Rio's hand shot up to cover her face and hide the infinite embarrassment that was pouring over her. Well, this had certainly been off the rails since minute one and it surely did not seem to be getting any better.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And... What were you up to before I got here?" Agatha asked coyly, turning her head so that her chin hung over her shoulder, eyes cutting to the side to take Rio in.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nothing," Rio grumbled, the humiliation beginning to swallow her whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That doesn't look like nothing," Agatha returned, waggling a couple of fingers in direction of the strap, untouched to that point other than for Rio to have brought it out and set it aside while tending to Phineas.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I... I forgot it was out," Rio stumbled in explanation, reaching up to run her hand over the back of her neck that was now exposed by having the zipper pulled down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knew it was bullshit. Rio could tell even before she turned around that she absolutely knew Rio was lying through her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha stalked her way back to where Rio was seemingly glued to the floor made Rio's stomach bottom out in a mixture of dread and anticipation. She truly did look every bit a lioness with that wicked smirk on her features and that daring gleam in those cutting blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Were you going to
     <em>
      fuck yourself?"
     </em>
     she purred. She was still closing the distance, but she was taking her sweet time in doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Does it matter?" Rio responded. She was providing an answer in the form of another question, her gaze dropping to the floor. It was making her too pink and too hot to look Agatha in the eye and even try to answer those interrogations.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It does if you were going to fuck yourself to the thought of me," Agatha stated simply, though she was directly in front of Rio as she said it, her hand raising to rest on Rio's mostly-exposed hip. The contact caused Rio's stomach to lurch and her heart took a brief hike and came to rest somewhere in the middle of her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Agatha was touching her.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio still didn't want to dignify Agatha's goading with a response.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Rio's hand flew up and hooked firmly into the back of Agatha's neck, her fingers applying a noticeable pressure as Rio pulled her in and found her lips once more. That kiss started at about the same level of intensity, but it quickly began to creep upward.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hand of Rio's that was not holding Agatha by the neck to keep her in place was frenzied in its search for purchase that felt right. It started on her side, feeling out the plush material of her dress, and began to move to her hip and then back up again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Splitting her focus, Rio had been the one to deepen the kiss, to want more. The tip of her tongue had traced the most taunting line along the underside of Agatha's top lip until Agatha's mouth opened far enough to grant her access.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took her time, letting her tongue explore entirely new feelings and sensations and tastes. Tasting Agatha in that way was something she truly never thought she would get the chance to do, and she did not want to piss it all away because she got a little too lippy. That meant
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     asking Agatha what had caused her to come back, at least not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seemed as though urgency had found Agatha as her hands raised and she began to make a play to get Rio out of that dress, no matter how sexy it was. Before she could begin to pull it over Rio's shoulders, though, Rio jerked back and violently separated their mouths. The taste of Agatha was still
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     on the tip of her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "What?"
     </em>
     Agatha croaked, clearly trying to keep herself from panting. Judging by the way she was sinking her fingers into every spot they touched on Rio's body, she was feeling just as desperate as Rio was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those dark eyes flickered open and found cloudy blues, ones that displayed Agatha's confusion toward Rio's abrupt need for space.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "If we're going to do this,"
     </em>
     Rio panted, her hand still secured around Agatha's neck,
     <em>
      "I need to know something."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of offering to provide an answer, Agatha chose to do something else. She pressed their lips back together hungrily and while the absolutely deprived and horny beast inside of Rio wanted to engage, she had just made a very clear demand that Agatha was trying to ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Noo,"
     </em>
     Rio practically moaned into Agatha's mouth, trying to instill distance again. Again, she succeeded. This time, her other hand lifted from Agatha's side so that Rio could cage her face in, forcing her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You can do
      <b>
       whatever
      </b>
      you want to me,"
     </em>
     Rio told her, that wanting gaze darting over every feature of interest on Agatha's face,
     <em>
      "but first, you have to tell me your name."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     In every spot that Rio was touching, she could feel Agatha stiffen and her muscles as they tensed. They were so close that Rio could actually feel the breath Agatha sucked in as it let her own lips first. Rio had known what she was doing, but she also had a plan. It was a plan that included a very calculated follow-through.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew what was going to happen. She knew it even before she felt Agatha's touch lift from her body and she took a step back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I thought you learned your lesson," Agatha spat coldly as she reached down to fix her dress. Rio should have been worried, should have been panicking a little harder, but she was playing chess and Agatha had not quite caught up yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I did, but you're not teaching me anything I
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to know," Rio argued back, rising to the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't need to know my name. Any name I give you should be good enough," Agatha returned sharply, her tone clipped and cold. With that, she spun on her heel to collect her clutch so that she could leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't going to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you change your mind," Rio challenged, but she paused so that she could draw in a breath to steady herself, knowing
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     what she was about to do. "You know where to find me...
     <em>
      Agatha.
     </em>
     "
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was not facing her, and she had not quite extended all the way down to pick up the clutch, but the moment the name touched her ears, she snapped upright and her posture was as rigid as stone. Rio wanted to see her expression, to know what that had done to her. She had been taking these shit-ass potshots at Rio all night and now, Rio was the one who finally had the upper hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, Rio was the one holding the reigns.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, Agatha turned around and Rio got exactly what she was looking for: a full-on look at the expression she had caused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's face was flushed, redder than those weird beets they had been served just before she had stomped out of the restraint and left Rio alone, looking every bit the idiot she had felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "What the fuck did you just say?"
     </em>
     Agatha snarled, muscles tensing again as though she were preparing to pounce, claws out, and tear Rio to absolute shreds.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I said..."
     </em>
     Rio returned, her own voice have lowered exponentially,
     <em>
      "you know where to find me, Agatha."
     </em>
     She did not move from her spot, did not budge even an inch. She was done backing down, done rolling over to show Agatha that she was soft.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was proof that Rio was not going to endanger her, or throw her to the wolves. This was proof that Rio knew how to keep a secret and was damn good at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio considered for the briefest moment that she had broken the woman before her. She looked wild and like she was seconds away from going on a rampage, but she didn't move. Hell, she wasn't even blinking. She was staring Rio down, those hot blue irises emotionless as they burned holes into Rio's form.
    </p>
    <p>
     All it took was a single blink. Rio chose to blink, and when her eyes opened again, Agatha was on the move. Her hand was snapping up and finding a familiar and thrilling home around Rio's throat, making that sickness she had been feeling all night double in power.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Why the fuck did you need to know it so badly? Why couldn't you leave well enough alone?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     There was an option to be scared, to be worried, but Rio wouldn't take it. There were still moves on the board to be made and she
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     to see this out. Agatha was the queen and was more than tricky to capture, but Rio was going to box her in, give her nowhere else to move.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was going to teach Agatha her own lesson, one in how to fucking trust someone for once in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Rio's hands shot up, gently prodding and pulling at Agatha's wrist. It might have seemed as though she were trying to get free, but she wasn't. All she wanted was Agatha to loosen her grip enough that she could speak. Agatha understood and relaxed the tiniest amount, enough that Rio could force the words up her throat and off the tip of her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I needed to know what name to moan when I was fucking myself nightly to thoughts of you,"
     </em>
     Rio admitted. Her tone might have been as strangled as she was in the moment, but the absolutely sick and wicked sound of her laughter as it shook around the contact did something
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     primal to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was what she had wanted to know when she had first turned up, and now she had her answer. With her hand around Rio's throat and her face the color of a fire engine, Agatha's pupils swelled almost instantaneously. She looked like a predator who had gotten their first whiff of blood after being starved for some times, a predator who was ready to feast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her jaw tensed and bulged, those almost-black eyes darting frantically over Rio's face, as if looking for any sign that she might have been lying. And then, Agatha turned her head to look at the chair and what was laying on it. The pieces clicked into place and Rio found herself looking right back into that very very treacherous gaze. What she saw there was something new, it was hunger mixed with lust and desire.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "That what you were about to do, thinking you wouldn't see me again?"
     </em>
     Agatha growled lowly in question. When Rio attempted a small nod, Agatha pulled her forward by the grip she had been maintaining around her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were close, now, so close that Rio could still smell the Chablis that she had been tasting on Agatha's teeth when they had kissed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Y-yes,"
     </em>
     Rio sputtered. It didn't matter that she was struggling to speak; it didn't keep her from leaning into the contact, forcing more pressure out of Agatha's hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dangerously, Agatha was calculating and Rio could see it. She was searching for the right order to give, the right way to handle this new information. It was clear that this had struck a match within Agatha and she was doing what she could to temper the heat so that she could keep the control she had over the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Well then,"
     </em>
     she breathed, seeming to have made her decision.
     <em>
      "Don't refrain on my account."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the pressure of Agatha's fingertips on Rio's neck relinquished, something in Rio dropped like a stone. And then, what Agatha had actually said began to register.
     <em>
      Don't refrain on my account.
     </em>
     <em>
      Don't refrain. Just because she was there.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was suspended in a state of shock, just staring at Agatha without blinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was she serious?
    </p>
    <p>
     Did she mean what Rio was assuming she meant? She... She wanted Rio to ride that fucking armchair
     <em>
      in front of her
     </em>
     ? Clearly, because she was making no move for her clutch or the door. Rio's suddenly self-conscious gaze flickered to the chair and then back to Agatha. She wasn't looking at Rio, though, her focus at dropped to Rio's hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh, you're something else,"
     </em>
     Agatha huffed with a snide chuckle.
     <em>
      "I just realized you couldn't have worn panties with that dress. Little slutty, hm?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was still whirring and processing, gears clicking and synapses firing to no avail.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I'm actually disappointed I didn't notice before."
     </em>
     Agatha's voice was so rough the lower it got. It was doing things to Rio, making that sickness fester within her. Agatha had made a demand that would alleviate her symptoms and yet, she was stuck in place and unable to comply. But before she could actually
     <em>
      try
     </em>
     to move, Agatha was speaking again.
     <em>
      "You gonna keep it on, cowgirl, or are you gonna let me see all of you on your ride?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The question alone was enough to make Rio's knees knock together, but the way Agatha extended two fingers and traced them over the rugged landscape of skin and fabric strips over Rio's hip made Rio feel like she could very well just pass out. Her vision was hazy, the heat in her body felt like she had been dropped into lava, and she was not entirely certain how she was still standing with the way her legs had started to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "D-Do you want to see all of me?"
     </em>
     Rio whispered, though it was broken and uneven as she forced it out. It sounded like she was seeking Agatha's approval, but she wasn't. Rio was simply trying to figure out in real time what it would take to please Agatha, what it would take to drive her fucking wild.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha formed her response, the double meaning almost soared right past Rio, but hooked into her at the last second.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I want to see what you're willing to show me."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That had weight. That statement
     <em>
      meant
     </em>
     something. It was Agatha's way of telling Rio that
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     could be willing to show more, but she just needed a little more time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Rio could help that decision along a little more but choosing to shed her armor, first, in a figurative sense, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Do you want to help me, or are you wanting a show?"
     </em>
     Rio asked her, those hooded and heavy dark eyes lifting to traverse Agatha's expression in search of an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a tentative step forward and then another to the side. Understanding what it was she was doing, Rio turned to her left, pulling her hair over her shoulder to allow Agatha the ability to slide the zipper down a bit more. Once satisfied, both of her palms pressed to Rio's back and slid beneath the material of the garment, pushing it out toward Rio's shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bare back she was met with when Rio slipped out of the torso of the dress caused Agatha to inhale an impossibly sharp breath. What had initially been a touch to help her disrobe quickly became something else the second a couple of Agatha's fingertips graced down Rio's spine. It caused her to shiver; Rio could fuck, but it had admittedly been a while since she had felt another woman's hands on her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't want it to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stepped closer, the front of her dress making faint contact with the skin of Rio's back at the same time Agatha's hands fell to her sides. They began gently prodding and kneading inquisitively, just feeling out the new scape beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like she was well practiced, those deft and nimble fingers began to slide and trek downward in a way that caused the fabric to bunch around Rio's waist. Keeping such a pace, Agatha began to meticulously gather each strap that framed Rio's hips beneath her thumbs, pushing further and further until she could no longer reach without bending over. That, unfortunately, was not possible without repositioning.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the slightest shimmy of her hips, the dress dislodged and slipped the rest of the way down Rio's legs, pooling at her ankles.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was all it took, all that was needed to leave her standing in the middle of her living room, back to a very thrilled and devious Agatha, butt naked from head to toe.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha stepped forward, her lips
     <em>
      so fucking close
     </em>
     to Rio's ear, and reached around to palm and caress Rio's breasts, nearly causing her to black out on the spot, had Rio ready to be the first to purchase a ticket to absolute transcendence.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Agatha spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Saddle up, pretty girl,"
     </em>
     Agatha instructed in a smooth purr. Her grip released and she instilled a small distance between them. It was just enough that when she cocked her hand and gave a heavy smack to Rios left asscheek, the most enticing crack sounded in the air around them.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Rio, it was an encouragement, one she took to immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Agatha wanted to see her ride, she was going to ride like her fucking life depended on it.
    </p>

    <h2>
     There's a Part of Me That I Forgot
    </h2>
   </div>
   <!--chapter content-->
   <div>
    <p>
     For the eight million, three hundred and forty six thousand, nine hundred and seventy eighth time in the last month, Rio was making a
     <em>
      terrible
     </em>
     decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have kicked Agatha out. She should have told her that this was hostile and volatile and just
     <em>
      wrong.
     </em>
     She should have told her that she wasn't a toy, that Agatha could not just march in and tell her what to do, thinking she'd simply buckle and comply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more, there were
     <em>
      so many things
     </em>
     that Rio
     <em>
      should
     </em>
     have done, and yet she did none of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she moaned at the feeling of that slap on her ass and took the initiative to start moving. The chair was not far, but getting over to it felt like she was walking her last rites into an endless ocean that she might never find her way back out of. It was agonizing, feeling Agatha's eyes on her bare ass as she finally reached her destination.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she heard a strange sound behind her, Rio looked over her shoulder to see Agatha dragging a chair in from the dining room. She stationed it a few feet from the armchair, facing it full-on before she placed herself in it and crossed her legs at the knees. Rio had only glanced, and Agatha had been quick, but Rio was almost positive that Agatha wasn't wearing any panties either.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could have volunteered that little piece of information earlier. It would have been nice to know, at the very least.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to swallow, but she couldn't. It was the strangest sensation as she tore her gaze from Agatha to look at the mess of straps carrying that ridiculous tie-dye strap that she was rather embarrassed of, especially when Agatha stated an observation she made.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Six and a half? Or seven?" Rio's head snapped up again, her brow furrowing. Perhaps in any other instance, she would have understood instantly, but the fog that had filled her brain at what it felt like to be undressed by this woman was making it difficult to reach any foregone conclusion without a mental brawl. Agatha's stare dropped from Rio's face to the seat of the armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right. She was asking about the strap.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Six and a half," Rio answered meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked down at it again, still unable to swallow. What the fuck was sitting in her throat that was making it impossible to perform an automatic function? At the same time she reached down into the seat, she drew in the deepest breath she could through her nose and tried once more to choke down the excessive saliva that had started to pool in her mouth. That time, it worked, but it almost hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't hurting nearly as bad as her pussy was. She could already feel the damp stickiness that had been there since before she had left the restaurant; it had been prevalent before, and she had been on her way to fixing the issue when Agatha had showed up. As a result Rio was certain she was so wet that multiple casualties as a result of drowning could have been likely.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hope Agatha brought her snorkel.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio actually snorted softly as the thought crossed her mind. It was so out of place, so fucking random, and for a moment, she'd almost forgotten that there was someone else in the room. She was reminded when Agatha spoke, nearly scaring her out of her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Something funny?" she posed curiously. When Rio looked to her, she was still poised in the chair with her legs crossed, but she had folded one arm over her middle and had the opposite elbow propped on the back of her hand so that she could hold the other to her mouth. Rio realized quickly that she was chewing at her thumb nail.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, so flawlessly cool and calm Agatha had a tick, a nervous habit.
    </p>
    <p>
     That meant Agatha could get
     <em>
      nervous.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Noted.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Did she think Rio was going to chicken out? Worse, did she think Rio would kick her out and declare that this was all an act of humiliation?
    </p>
    <p>
     With the way Agatha was looking at her, Rio was all too aware that this had absolutely
     <em>
      nothing
     </em>
     to do with humiliation. In fact, the longer she took, the more she could see something she recognized all too well as it began to write itself across Agatha's face:
     <em>
      desperation.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, no... Sorry..." Rio murmured, cheeks flaming even darker red as she turned back to her task. She wasn't exactly stalling, but her nerves were weighing her down and keeping her from sprinting forward. She took hold of the harness and pulled it up, taking only a moment to arrange it as needed on the arm of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where she had placed it, though, wasn't going to work right. She slid it back a little further, glancing over to make sure that where she would be kneeling would leave enough room for her foot to tuck behind the cushion. Once she was satisfied, she pulled in another slow breath. She realized by that point that there was not an inch of her skin that was not flush with her heat and embarrassment under Agatha's hawk-like gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment her lungs emptied, Rio swung her leg over the arm of the chair and situated her leg the most comfortable way she could manage. Every time she'd done this before, she'd been facing the back of the chair and not the front. The mechanics were surely the same, even if the leg positioning was different.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she was comfortable, a hand wrapped around the shaft of the strap and moved it back just a hair more, enough that it was directly beneath her. As she started to lower enough that she could initiate her own brief form of foreplay, she was startled out of her focus by the sound of Agatha clearing her throat. Her heart leapt into her mouth and her head snapped up from what she was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was staring at her, directly in the eyes. She was no longer chewing on her thumb, but was cradling her chin in the crook between her thumb and pointer finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I want you to look at me," Agatha informed her. It wasn't a harsh demand, but it was a very clear one.
    </p>
    <p>
     For only a second, Rio wanted to ask her why, but the word was never going to produce itself. She silently complied, not tearing her focus from Agatha's face, even as Agatha's eyes traced lines down her body, waiting for her to resume her work.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was difficult to not look at what she was doing, but Rio managed it as she shifted her hips enough that she could drag the tip of the strap through her own slick, letting it skim over her clit in a way that caused her thigh muscles to twitch in both legs. A soft sigh escaped her before she duplicated the motion, another twitch, another sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was still fixated, just watching intently as Rio worked through the process, dragging that silicone through her own pleasure. She didn't look away, but she had something to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can't tell me you're this quiet when you're home alone," she stated. Again, her focus didn't shift, but she did lick her lips. The mere sight sent a ball of fire directly into Rio stomach, melting anything and everything that had previously been there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You like 'em noisy, do you?" Rio dared to challenge back. Some part of her wanted to stay silent the whole time just to see what Agatha would do, but after having made such a point of knowing her name, it seemed moot.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I want to hear you enjoying yourself," Agatha returned, shifting slightly in her chair. With another pass over her clit, Rio released a soft whimper and as she had suspected, she watched as Agatha's thighs squeezed together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't like to be told what to do. Right then, Agatha could have told her to walk off the ends of the earth, and Rio would have done it with gusto. She would have dropped to her knees before Agatha and submitted to any demand she made, because the way Agatha was looking at her right then, absorbed in her every movement to position the tip of the strap against her entrance?
    </p>
    <p>
     That would have been worth it, all of it, any of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever it would take for Agatha to keep looking at her like that, Rio would have fucking done it, any consequence be damned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Taking a page out of Agatha's book, Rio licked her lips at the same time she lowered herself onto the strap, an actual moan escaping her at the instant stretch, her head tipping back as it carried like the sweetest song to Agatha's ears. Rio didn't stop, instead sinking her hips lower, embracing the fullness that happened as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh, fuck,"
     </em>
     Rio hissed at the exact same moment Agatha cleared her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Chin snapping down, Rio fought to keep her eyes open so that she could find that keyed-up expression carved into Agatha's features, looking like she were bordering on turning downright rabid. They locked gazes for just a moment, but the moment Rio's hips began to work, sliding up and down that length of strap, Agatha's attention dropped and her thighs pressed together even tighter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I... I can't..." Rio attempted, her eyes slipping shut.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's gaze had torn from the source of those wet, lust-filled sounds that stemmed from between Rio's legs at her words, pinning Rio despite the fact that her eyes were still closed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio," Agatha ordered, and Rio realized that it was the first time since the night they had met that Agatha had called her by her name. The thought alone sent Rio's heart galloping away, soaring cleanly through the cage of her ribs. Then, she gave another command. "Open your eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
     With just how close Rio already felt to orgasm, she knew that if she complied, it was going to be instantaneous.  She wanted to drag it out a little longer, to put on the show she knew Agatha wanted to see. Her right hand sat atop her thigh as her hips began to work a little quicker while the left one slid up her torso and latched onto her right breast, squeezing instinctively, as if it were nothing more than automatic.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio," Agatha cut again, but Rio's eyes did not open. The exact opposite happened; her hips worked faster and her hands were squeezing and pulling at the skin beneath them at the same time her head tipped back, chin pointed toward the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not demand that she open her eyes again, which Rio figured was only because of the whimpers and moans that began to tumble from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kept it up, kept working her hips down so that every single inch of that six and a half inches was consumed by her core. Each time, her moans got a little louder, lasted a little longer. She was so lost in her pleasure that the cognitive function had been shut off in its entirety. That meant that when she rattled her vocal cords to speak, it wasn't to voice a message that came from her brain, but rather from the stuffed cunt she was working over on that damn dildo.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh, fuck Agatha. Feel so good,"
     </em>
     Rio groaned, her hips canting and stuttering before she shifted into a new rhythm, one that was a little slower and more deliberate. Realizing what she had said for just a moment, Rio wanted to force her eyes open but was so tangled in the pleasure that she was not sure she knew how to anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     At least, that had been the thought until a response came to her pathetic whining.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "How good?"
     </em>
     Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     The startling part about her question was how it sounded like it came from less than a foot away. It was so soft but
     <em>
      so loud.
     </em>
     Rio eyes snapped open at the realization to see Agatha standing directly in front of the arm of the chair, using one hand to reach back so that she could unzip her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's breath snagged and hiccuped in her chest as her hips slammed down onto the arm of the couch, a guttural moan ripping from her lungs at the way the strap landed inside of her as a result. The very moment Agatha's hand raised and pushed one of the shoulders of the dress off, revealing a breast in the process, Rio was completely done.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was hooked like a baitworm, just skewered and waiting to be devoured by a larger predator, waiting to be devoured by Agatha. Her eyes were stony in their movements as they rolled down Agatha's chest and breast. By the time the second one was free, there was no more trying to hold out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hips rocked forward, her clit skimming the base of the harness in a way that gave her exactly what it was she'd been trying to prolong. Both of her hands rocketed from her skin and landed on the arm of the couch so that she could support herself as her pleasured cries hit the air around them. In the middle of her orgasm, Rio lifted her head again just as Agatha wiggled the dress over her hips and Rio's previous theory was confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had not been wearing panties either.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "F-fuck, Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio panted, legs still trembling as she straddled the chair arm, the entirety of the strap taking up residence inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're not done already, are you?" Agatha rasped, her voice low and husky, thick like honey laced with poison.
    </p>
    <p>
     Staring up at her in nothing but objective awe, Rio simply shook her head in response, still trying to catch her breath. "Good. Because you're just getting started," Agatha informed her, stepping forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha never broke eye contact with Rio, not as she reached down to grace her fingers over the fabric on the armrest, or as she shuffled forward and hiked up her left leg. She didn't look away even as she slid her knee onto the seat of the chair until it was flush against Rio's and she was a mirror image of the pathetic heap Rio was, just with a little more vigor and a little less strap.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, Agatha's hand raised, those fingertips brushing over Rio's temple before they slid into her hair, hooking around the back of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Need a little fuel to get you going again?"
     </em>
     Agatha murmured. She both leaned in and pulled Rio toward her until they met in the middle in a kiss that was... Well, it was pretty fucking vanilla given their current positioning. Rio was practically warming her own strap while Agatha's glistening and soaked pussy was surely about to bore stains into the poor arm of that chair that Rio had only prevented because of the harness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, Rio didn't give a fuck about the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     All she cared about was the way Agatha's teeth sank into her bottom lip and gave a rough tug that also pulled on a moan that had been lying low in Rio's lung. She could feel instantly as Agatha huffed a pleased chuckled against her face. Rio hardly had time to consider before Agatha's tongue was hard at work, barging between her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha kissed her, it had to be unique. The way that she could feel every inch of Agatha's mouth as it tried to consume her, to swallow her whole, it caused that pulsing to return, but this time it was around the silicone still within her body. That alone pulled another broken moan from Rio that spilled into Agatha's mouth and trickled down her throat. Somewhere on the way down, Agatha turned it into something else, something primal that sounded too close to a snarl.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she retracted, she did not go far. She had a message to deliver, an encouragement that she thought Rio needed to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Giddy up, cowgirl."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The saddest most inhuman whimper squeaked its way out of Rio's throat as Agatha sat back, her hands folded over one another in front of her on the arm of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't argue, didn't try to be a brat. What was the fucking point? This was so far beyond any fantasy she could have been sick enough to conjure up that she hardly knew how to keep breathing, let alone make any intelligent sounds or decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, Rio did as she was told. Her hands found the tops of her thighs and she began to move again, the strap sliding in and out with ease at the amount of arousal that had gathered from the last twenty minutes alone. It didn't take her long to feel fidgety, especially as she tried to focus on keeping Agatha's gaze held evenly. Agatha wasn't moving, but she was watching with laser precision, absorbing every single move that Rio made.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had started as an irrational thought, a compelled action; Rio's right hand began to leave her thigh, gliding its way up her torso. The moment it reached between her breasts, it became a conscious thought. She'd intended on going for her chest again, but staring Agatha in the eye like that? She had a much better idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     That touch drifted higher and higher, her long and nimble fingers spreading the most minute amount as she hooked her hand around her own throat and gave a hearty squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     The look that crossed Agatha's face was something similar to one that she might have worn if she had been hit with a taser or a cow prod. Her skin blanched of all color and she sucked in a breath that she did not exhale. To dig in even deeper, Rio squeezed hard enough that by the time she made her next sound of ecstasy, it was strangled by her own hold. It was intentional; Rio knew how to choke safely, but this was on herself and she could gauge her own limits with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh, God, Agatha. Fuck, m'so full."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had not been expecting the reaction she got: Still pale, Agatha sputtered and coughed before her skin seemed to fill with color again, returning to normal before a deep scarlet flush filled her neck, her cheeks, her chest. Rio wasn't quiet through, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Wish it was you,"
     </em>
     she whimpered, not needing to actually work at making it sound so fucking pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had
     <em>
      meant
     </em>
     that she wanted Agatha to be the one sporting the strap, not the fucking armchair, but Agatha's wild and intense brain got a different message entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still watching, still locked in, still staring, Rio was completely fixated on the woman before her despite the steady and pleasurable rhythm she had developed as she worked herself over on that strap. She had not been expecting Agatha to reach toward her. Or toward her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Then let it be me,"
     </em>
     she husked, her thin fingers gently working their way between Rio's palm and her neck, loosening the hold she had there. Rio whined in protest, but Agatha applied a little more pressure, finally coaxing Rio to let go. The moment she did, Rio understood the request that she couldn't compute in words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scooting her hips forward slightly, Agatha's hand reached for and hooked around Rio's neck. That time, Rio's eyes physically could not stay open as her hips canted and bucked wildly as the second and entirely unexpected orgasm hit her, causing her to cry out into the air as Agatha safely gripped a little tighter at her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't stop," Agatha egged on, hand slipping the tiniest bit to help her secure a better grip.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Ag-Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio whined, though she was fighting the shake in her legs to keep her hips moving per Agatha's demand.
     <em>
      "I... Fuck. Th-the real thing's so much nicer."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes were still good, which was probably good given the absolutely depraved look that befell Agatha, her thumb shifting to lay right over the pulse point in Rio's neck. "You do this all the time, do you? You have a thing for being choked? Hm?"
    </p>
    <p>
     That sultry snarl, that delectable venom in her voice was like a drug Rio feared she might never get her fill of.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "N-No,"
     </em>
     she whimpered back, her hips working a little faster.
     <em>
      "Not until th-the night -- ohhhhhh! Fuck! -- the night. Oh. God. At the. At the barn!"
     </em>
     She was practically wheezing her way through the answer, the sheer pleasure becoming almost too much to take. It got ten times worse when Rio forced her eyes open.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have felt it in the way Agatha was gripping at her neck, but she didn't; Agatha had started to rut against the arm of the chair, her hips rolling down to create as much friction as she could manage. She was like moving poetry, so confident as she stared at Rio's body, her hand on Rio's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Agath-Agathaaa,"
     </em>
     Rio moaned, wanting to throw her head back but not wanting to pull away from Agatha's grip on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You sound as pretty as you look," Agatha managed, her own breathlessness beginning to take her under. Her pace had picked up and her other hand moved, unexpectedly gripping at Rio's breast, pulling and kneading. It took no time at all before she had pinched Rio's nipple between her fingers and gave a rough pull that elicited another delicious moan. "So this is what you've been doing in my absence? Stuffing your own pussy and wishing it was me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to answer, but the vocalization never came. It died before it even formed and she could only managed a weak bob of her head, not even something that could have been officially dubbed a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's rutting increased in speed again, her hand flexing into Rio's neck in the most tantalizing way, the way that made her vision cloud around the edges as the flow of blood to her brain began to ebb from the pressure. It was the most delightful feeling, one that made Rio feel positively weightless.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're going to come again for me, right here, right now," Agatha informed her, somehow managing to speak so firmly, so loudly, without stuttering or catching up on just how submersed in pleasure she had to be right then. "And then you get what you've been fantasizing about. You can do that for me, right pretty girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha cooed those instructions at her might have been considered as barking orders by anyone else, but it was everything Rio needed and more. Her hips didn't falter, but she needed more this time. Her hand landed on Agatha's forearm and then began to travel, first to her wrist, and then to canvas her hand where it was latched to Rio's neck. All she did was squeeze and it was the only thing Agatha needed to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her own grip flexed again, offering Rio a high that she had never experienced before. It only got better when Agatha crushed their mouths together at the same time she apparently reached her own climax, yowling like a wild animal as she came, those sounds burying themselves deep into Rio's lungs as they kissed. Her body was twitching in a way that Rio could feel in her touch, adding an entirely new sensation into the mix.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was all Rio needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her own hips rolled down hard as she came, dredging up Agatha's noises to turn them into her own and fire them right back. Her long, loud moans likely could have shattered windows if not for the fact that Agatha put forth every last bit of effort she could into consuming them with fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way she had locked down, hips cemented to the arm of the chair, Rio rocked toward Agatha unintentionally, but it did not unsteady Agatha. In fact, she was quick as her free arm released Rio's nipple and wrapped around her, holding her steady so that they did not topple off of the arm and onto the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Good girl,"
     </em>
     Agatha praised as she let go of Rio's throat, though her touch landed close by on Rio's shoulder, rubbing soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, with her forehead pressed awkwardly to Agatha's collarbone, was almost certain that she was not even in her own body. It was the lightest feeling, like she was floating above them, simply observing as her own body wracked and trembled with her pleasure and Agatha just... held her, rubbing lightly at her shoulder while the pleasure was simply drowning her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha's head turned and her lips landed near Rio's ear, but were obstructed by her hair, the words she whispered there tugged Rio from her spot near the ceiling, pulling her back into her physical form.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Breathe, beautiful. Can't pass out on me now. We've got so much more fun to have."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     God fucking damnit. How the
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     did she do that? How did she say these things that would have repulsed Rio off the lips of anyone else and instead could have Rio bent over every which way at her mercy?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio listened, though, taking in slow and long breaths as the shaking in her limbs finally began to quell and lessen.
    </p>
    <p>
     She finally found the wherewithal to lean back, her heavy lids lifting as she took in the sight of the woman before her, the woman who had taken to cupping her cheek in her palm. The same woman who had that burning heat flickering in her eyes like she was nowhere near done lighting Rio up like fireworks on the fourth of July.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you need help getting up?" Agatha asked and while there was an undeniable snarkiness to her tone, the offer read as genuine in her features.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still winded and a little dazed, Rio tried for words but ended up nodding again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha began to shift and move, dislodging herself from the couch so that she could stand at Rio's side. Rio had wanted to look at her, but that dark and wanting gaze dropped to the arm of the chair, Agatha's cum stain looking like a giant snail had traversed the fabric again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was a stain that was
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     coming out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey, eyes up gorgeous," Agatha cooed at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Normally, Rio felt that pet names felt manufactured most of the time, but each new one that Agatha whipped out seemed to pull Rio down even further into her expansive depths. Rio was ready to drown in her, so much so that if she did not get to taste the sex she'd been dreaming about for weeks, she was certain she would simply die.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, they were clearly a very long way from getting to that point. Right then, Agatha needed something. She needed something that was currently pinned between the chair and Rio's core.
    </p>
    <p>
     "C'mere," Agatha offered, lifting Rio's limp arm up to slide under it so that she could help Rio to a standing position.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second Rio felt the dildo slide out of her, an incredibly pathetic and sad whimper escaped her before she could stop it. The emptiness was almost painful, even if she knew that it was not going to last for long. Agatha was being so careful with her as she managed to swing her leg over to plant both feet firmly on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     On unsteady feet, Rio used Agatha's assistance to move to the chair Agatha had previously been occupying. "Real quick," she voice as Rio slumped against the back of it, a bit mystified by how she was still just... floating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes did not close, but instead followed Agatha as she went back to the chair and collected the strap from its dutiful position. The way she moved, slipping her legs into the harness had that quivering in Rio's cunt start up again, like an engine that had just been shut off only to be fired right back up again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was paying her no mind, which was probably good considering the way her hand had slowly and limply landed between her legs, fingers running mindless lines up and down her own slick as she watched, stunned by the effortlessness Agatha exuded in such a process. This was light work for her, something she had probably done a hundred times before, and the confidence was
     <em>
      fucking hot.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     As she tightened the last strap along her hip, Agatha lifted her head to land her attention on Rio who was still lazily dallying about in her own soaking wet arousal.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't stop, do you?" Agatha scolded playfully. The way she was standing, Rio had a full view of her profile. From head to toe, Agatha was a fucking specimen, especially with that strap protruding proudly from her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're... You're hot, what can I say?" Rio breathed at her, fighting to maintain some level of volume.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," Agatha began, turning to walk toward where Rio was crumpled in that chair. "If you come like
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     just
     <em>
      thinking
     </em>
     about me being inside you, I can't wait to see what you're like when it's me you're stuffed with."
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh fuckkkkk.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She could have just come at hearing those fucking words, but somehow managed to stave it off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rocked forward, fully intending to stand on her own, but Agatha didn't let her. She bent down to slink beneath Rio's arm again so that she could lift her up, supporting a decent amount of her weight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bed. Bedroom."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha understood and led them toward where Rio had cast her gaze, stopping at the closed door at the end of the hall. She opened it before Rio could think to stop her, but it didn't matter anyway. The moment the door swung open, Phineas didn't even stop to look at them before he bolted out and down the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, at least that had been easy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio almost didn't want Agatha to let her go, but as she dropped her gingerly onto the bed and straightened up, that gentle tenderness was gone just like that. What replaced it was the same ravenousness Rio had seen in Agatha's eyes on the arm of that chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, well, well," Agatha crooned from her place at the foot of the bed. "It might have been what you've been dreaming over, but this is a moment I've thought about since you got out of the car that night."
    </p>
    <p>
     A shiver ran up Rio's spine at this information and a new cold sweat broke out on the back of her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to ask what Agatha was going to do to her, but Agatha somehow answered before it ever left her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm going to make your fucking fantasies look like goddamn child's play."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh. Fuck. Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio managed a sound, a small sound, but a sound nonetheless.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Do it, then."

     Rio liked to think herself a logical person. She tried to make rational decisions and truly take things into consideration before running headlong into danger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, she
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     thought herself that person, at least until a month ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman who was near the edge of the bed as she stared up in stupefied wonder at the living goddess before her? She didn't know what logic was and had never met it in her life. That Rio, the one who still felt a deep hollowness between her legs, would have done more than questionable things if it meant that she got to experience the true euphoria that she'd only been able to
     <em>
      try
     </em>
     and produce in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had spent almost an entire month thinking about Agatha, about her mind, about her method, about her snarls and sneers, about that light but sharp tone of voice she often chose, mostly because she was angry and irritated each time she and Rio ran into one another. The one time before that night she hadn't been was the night they'd sat in her car and talked.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been mild, then.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, her heat made the Scoville scale look tame.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't help but wonder if Agatha had spent any minute of time consumed by thoughts of Rio, just like Rio had spent far too many minutes consumed by thoughts of Agatha. She could have asked, but she was fully aware there was a time and a place, and the time and place where Agatha was standing in Rio's bedroom wearing her strap like it was a fucking weapon were not the ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Judging by that look in her eyes? Maybe Rio didn't need to ask after all. Maybe the answer was already directly in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was just standing there, just looking her over, as if she were planning her assault on the war map of Rio's body. Her eyes would hesitate on Rio's chest, or her abdomen. The way they damn near glazed over as they dropped to the dark patch of hair at the apex of her thighs that was already irreparably soaked felt like Rio had grabbed hold of a live wire.
    </p>
    <p>
     When it moved, Rio was still buzzing, but she realized that Agatha's attention had fallen to her hand, her wrist where they were offering support in propping her up. She was staying there just a little too long, long enough that an idea sparked in Rio's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     With no warning, she scooted herself toward the end of the bed, placing the back of her hand to Agatha's abdomen to gently nudge her back. Rio didn't look up, didn't steal a glance at the undeniable confusion that had likely written itself over Agatha's demeanor. She just slipped off the end of the bed and stumbled her way toward the dresser, acting like nothing she was doing was interrupting the beginnings to a marathon.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took only a moment for her to pull open the drawer, rummaging through it until she found what it was she was looking for: a deep navy silk rope.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha must have been watching her, because the moment the realization kicked in, Rio could hear her draw in a quick breath, almost like a gasp but not quite. In response, Rio lifted her head and looked to the other woman, still standing there like she did not know where else to go. Maybe Rio could offer a bit of a jump-start to get her moving again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can you tie a good knot?" she posed innocently, turning to showcase the rope as it lay loosely coiled in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a stammer in time, this little hiccup that dislodged them from natural progression. Rio only knew it was there because the two of them both stopped breathing at the same time, their eyes locked and nostrils flared. Rio had expected her to answer, to deliver some cunning and clever retort about what her hobby was and how
     <em>
      of course
     </em>
     she could tie a good knot.
    </p>
    <p>
     That wasn't what Agatha did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha surged forward, backing Rio right into the dresser in a manner that caused the strap to angle upward before being smashed between them. The way the handle of one of the drawers pressed into her ass was uncomfortable, to say the least, but Rio had a feeling that it wasn't something she was going to have to get used to. In the next motion, Agatha took hold of the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can," she answered, her face only an inch or two from Rio's, her hot breath filling every sense Rio had, from the taste of it to the smell of it to the feel of it on her lips and cheeks. Sliding the rope from Rio's grasp, Agatha spoke and tossed it aside. "But not tonight. Tonight, I want to feel you touch me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio barely had the time it took to process that moment before Agatha was pressing against her even more, a move that afforded her the ability to seal the space between them with a kiss that was so hot and demanding Rio thought her essence might be pulled right from her chest. Agatha was kissing her like nothing else in the world mattered at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Rio kissed her back the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was, quite frankly, a mess. It was tongue and lips and sucking and biting. Rio was almost positive that she had never had parts and pieces of her mouth ravaged like that in her entire thirty-six years of existence. It felt so
     <em>
      fucking good
     </em>
     that she didn't care. Agatha could kiss her absolutely raw and Rio would have been fucking
     <em>
      tickled
     </em>
     over it.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was little time before Rio's hands were moving, to do as she was requested. Agatha wanted to feel Rio's touch? Rio would make it happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her palms landed flat on Agatha's chest as they kissed, but they did not idle for long. One slid upward, surfing up her neck to tangle in the waves of her hair, fingers curling amongst the strands. The other palm dropped and canvassed Agatha's breast, gripping feverishly in her desperate wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
     That drew a reaction, a half-moan, half-wine that crawled from Agatha's throat, rattling Rio's teeth just enough to stimulate a deeply forgotten about part of her brain. Rio gripped harder, as if she were trying to create pressure that might simulate pain.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't want to hurt Agatha, but she desperately wanted to
     <em>
      hurt
     </em>
     Agatha, and be
     <em>
      hurt
     </em>
     by her in the same measure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hands were not the only ones on the prowl, though Agatha's were
     <em>
      much
     </em>
     more frantic. She was sliding them over Rio's sides, her hips, what bit of her ass she could reach. She was pressing and pulling and grabbing and squeezing in the most stimulating way. By that point, Rio had simply accepted the fact that her pussy was not going to stop that incessant pounding until she was either asleep or too numb to feel it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some fucked-up part of her was hoping for the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finding herself utterly invested in their kiss, Rio was actually startled and disappointed when Agatha ripped her mouth away, severing the contact without any heads-up. Her hands were still exploring and feeling out every bit of Rio they could reach, but the lack of a kiss made Rio feel deprived, like she was being punished.
    </p>
    <p>
     A soft and disgruntled whine left her, but it quickly warped into a worked up sigh as Agatha's face buried into the crook of Rio's neck, immediately kissing and nipping in her lust.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt unreal, the way her body was so incomprehensibly alive, every nerve ending open and receptive to anything Agatha had to offer. She was pliant, there against the dresser, and there was not a thing in the entire universe that Agatha could have done that Rio would have objected to. It wasn't that she was willing to bend on any limits, but there was this conviction within her that knew whatever she let Agatha choose to do to her, she was going to make sure it felt
     <em>
      fucking incredible.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't even trying at that point and Rio felt ready to simply float off into the next plane of existence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed higher, toward Rio's ear. With a surprising and breath-stealing move, she sunk her teeth into the silicone tunnel that was housed in the lobe of Rio's ear, giving it a rough tug that practically turned Rio into a puddle. She had wanted to react, to do something other than paw at Agatha's breast and keep into the air, but Agatha was far quicker in her next move.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those wandering and greedy hands moved in unison, this time, as they slid down Rio's hips. Agatha leaned into her, forcing her to bend backward over the dresser just enough that Agatha could reach her true destination: the backs of Rio's thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rough hands hooked around them, fingertips feeling like razorblades to Rio's heightened senses. In one smooth motion, Agatha lifted Rio's legs and used the contact of their hips to push her back at the same time. With a startling ease, Rio was suddenly perched on that dresser, piping hot skin reactive to the cold wood beneath them as her knees tried to squeeze together. It never would have worked, not with the way Agatha was placed directly between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You don't need a bed, do you? Not to be fucked the way you want to be,"
     </em>
     Agatha hummed in her ear, just before the tip of her tongue skated along the shell of Rio's ear, skimming a couple of her piercings in the process. Her hands were still as they rested on Rio's hips, devoting more of her attention to the kissing and licking and sucking she was doing that was sending Rio right over the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I want to be fucked any way you'd fuck me,"
     </em>
     came Rio's low whine in response. Her head tipped to the side, as if offering a silent encouragement for Agatha to explore more, to traverse a more open terrain, one she could mark up and destroy for all Rio cared.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Are you this desperate for every woman you fuck, or am I a special case?"
     </em>
     Agatha rasped as she kissed lower, down Rio's neck. Before Rio could form an answer, she felt very acutely where every single point of Agatha's teeth sank into her skin, causing her to yelp in surprise, but not pain.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pain wasn't painful, but pleasurable. It didn't make her retract or cower. If anything, it made her scoot forward on the dresser. She found a new sensation in doing so. While the strap had been angled a bit awkwardly at first, Rio's shift in position wedged it between them, pressing directly against her core, surpassing the apex of her lips and ending a bit below her bellybutton.
    </p>
    <p>
     The feeling was overwhelming in the best way and it, coupled with Agatha's teeth and tongue getting their fill of Rio's skin, she could do nothing but moan helplessly, her own hands having dropped to support her weight atop the dresser.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Special... Special case,"
     </em>
     Rio responded, though she was quickly moving again. It seemed as though her hands could find no home, nowhere to rest and stay because she was leaning forward to bury her fingers in Agatha's hair, cradling her head as she began to kiss even lower.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Mmmm,"
     </em>
     came a low hum of satisfaction, though Agatha was still suckling and nibbling the further she went. Her head diverted to one side, kissing over the supple flesh of Rio's breast. Immediately, Rio's fingers flexed into her scalp, her head slumping forward as she fought to maintain enough focus to watch what Agatha was going.
     <em>
      "Does that mean I get special treatment?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You get whatever you -- FUCK! AGATHA!"
     </em>
     Rio had been in the middle of forking herself over entirely when the most crippling sensation emanated from her nipple and the way Agatha's teeth were sinking viciously into it. Rio was suddenly gripping a fistful of her hair, but she knew better -- even in her sex crazed fog -- that to yank back. She might lose a nipple in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha released and then soothed the impact with a measured circling of her tongue before she pulled it into her mouth, sucking intently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been watching her, enthralled with her every move. Then, Agatha did something Rio had not been expecting: Still hungrily feasting upon Rio's breast, Agatha's head tipped and those terrifyingly starved blue eyes darted upward, locking into Rio's.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were absolutely no words in any fucking language that would have accurately explained the feeling that took over Rio as she stared down in some kind of stupor as Agatha burned a hole right through her like it was nothing. She was licking and sucking and biting and Jesus fucking Christ, hadn't they already gone through fucking foreplay?!
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt so impossibly good, but something else in Rio's brain finally triggered. She'd gotten so lost in almost every other sensation that she'd forgotten about the advantage provided to her by the way she had scooted forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she began to work her hips, creating the slightest friction between her core and that stiff silicone pressed against it, Agatha knew what she was doing and tried to discourage the behavior by biting at Rio's nipple again, her other hand flying up to pinch the opposing one at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     That wasn't a punishment. That was enticement.
    </p>
    <p>
     It showed in the way Rio attempted to roll her hips faster. Instead of offering a physical scolding, Agatha did something far worse.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let go, unlatched, and stepped back, standing at full height.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You could just ask,"
     </em>
     she panted, her chest heaving in spite of the fact that she had been the one pressing every button there was to be pressed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I think I've been pretty clear about what I need,"
     </em>
     Rio snapped back lowly, still heaving from the sudden and intense coldness she was feeling without Agatha pressed against her.

     <em>
      "But do you want it bad enough?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     A sinister mix between a snarl and a chuckle left Rio's lips as she leaned forward on the dresser. Her eyes dropped to Agatha's chest and the hair that was hanging there; she was close enough that Rio could make a play.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a whip, Rio's arm was up and her fingers wrapped around a large chunk of Agatha's hair, pulling her back toward her so that they bodies were flush once more. Somehow, even the startled squeal Agatha let out made Rio even crazier. She pulled hard enough that Agatha had landed exactly where Rio wanted her, between her legs and face looming over her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "If you do not fuck me right now, I'll get the rope and tie
      <b>
       you
      </b>
      up so I can get it,"
     </em>
     Rio growled at her. She gave Agatha no time to argue or banter with the way she crushed their mouths together. Agatha's hands immediately fell to her thighs, fingers sinking easily into pliable flesh as she gave a pull that forced Rio to lean back slightly. Agatha followed, not breaking the kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her hold, Agatha lifted up on Rio's legs, molding her exactly how she wanted her. When she had Rio exactly where she needed to be, Agatha separated their mouths, the force of her breath smacking Rio in the face. Her head tipped quickly, though, looking down at that perfectly displayed pussy before her, puffy and pink and practically screaming for her with the flexes and flutters she could see with her own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deviously, a rough chuckle passed through Agatha's lips and she pushed a little harder at the undersides of Rio's thighs, exposing her just a little bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had discarded any and all expectations about how this was going to go, but when she watched as Agatha's lips pressed and her jaw swiveled almost imperceptibly, Rio hadn't understood it. Not, at least, until Agatha's lips parted and a thick dribble of spit fell between them, dropping straight down onto Rio's core.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Ohwhattheactualfuck.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Agathaaaaa,"
     </em>
     Rio cried, fingers nearly making indents in the wood beneath her.
     <em>
      "Fuck meeee."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's lips twisted into a devilish smirk as she reached between them, taking hold of the silicone protruding from her body. Her other hand remained where it was, holding Rio in place by her thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted it. She wanted it so fucking bad that she was convinced she'd already died at least six times while waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved concisely, carefully as she gave one single swipe of the tip over Rio's clit before landing at her entrance. She was focused on her work, but the moment she was poised and ready to press her hips forward, she lifted her chin enough to pin Rio, pupils consuming almost any trace of iris they could.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You're gonna look perfect when you cum on me, aren't you, beautiful?"
     </em>
     she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio began to nod, but Agatha didn't actually want an answer. She knew that answer already. She proved that by pressing her hips forward; it wasn't slow or gently, but it wasn't feral and entirely unrestrained. There was enough force that Rio immediately gasped before a deep and guttural moan filled the entire room around them. Her hand landed on Agatha's shoulder and she fought to pull herself up more, close enough that her face fell right against Agatha's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she had skin before her, Rio began to chomp and lick and suck, trying to do anything that would distract her from the fact that she already wanted to cum. It didn't help that her own automatic reaction the moment Agatha let go of her thigh to find purchase on her hip instead was to wrap her legs around Agatha's waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having found an absolutely delectable rhythm and with how sensitive Rio already was from having cum three times, she could not find it in her to stay quiet. It wasn't just deliberate and specifically elicited moans. No, as Rio's arm wrapped around Agatha's back and she sucked hard at a patch of skin on her neck, she could not mute her whimpers and whines, the moans and groans that happened every time Agatha thrust into the exact right part of her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Marking me up, then?"
     </em>
     Agatha managed in a heavy rasp. Despite the admonishment, her head tipped back to expose more skin for Rio to devour, and she took the opportunity without hesitating for even a second.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio sunk her teeth into Agatha's trap muscle, she felt as Agatha's hips stuttered and broke pace with the way she practically slammed forward, burying that strap so deep inside Rio's worked-over core that Rio was almost certain her stomach was relocated by a half inch minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "OhhhhmygodAgatha!"
     </em>
     It was all she could manage, all she could even consider saying at the way her breath had been knocked cleanly out of her lungs. It took her a moment, and Agatha had started to find that motion again, but Rio needed to find her words first.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Again,"
     </em>
     she choked out, pulling Agatha even closer -- though that was a feat -- though it happened to be a little vague and Agatha didn't quite catch on.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You came?"
     </em>
     Agatha questioned back, but Rio was immediate to shake her head in answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Do
      <b>
       that
      </b>
      again. H-Hard. Harder."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment it dawned on Agatha what Rio was asking for, her eyes widened and her hand found a sizeable amount of Rio's hair, clutching it tightly before she gave a rough pull to detach Rio from her buffet of sweat slicked skin. Their eyes met and while it would have been commonplace for Agatha's deviousness to make an appearance, Rio beat her to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     That grin that found her wasn't just wicked, wasn't just sinister. It was downright
     <em>
      evil.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked stunned for only a beat before she understood and even more so as she
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     what such a request did to her own body.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Lean back,"
     </em>
     she commanded. With that kind of authority in her voice, Rio never would have tried to resist. She did as Agatha commanded, not surprised when Agatha's hands found the backs of her thighs again, pushing them up even higher so that she could get as close as humanly possible with each thrust going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You want harder? You'll be sorry,"
     </em>
     she tried to warn, but Rio simply squirmed as her only answer, her gaze tearing from Agatha's face to look at where that tie-dye strap was half buried in her cunt, causing her stomach to boil over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whimpered, and Agatha finally complied.
    </p>
    <p>
     The force was startling, but not unwelcome, as Agatha swung her hips forward. It was the most intense rush as they smacked against Rio's skin. At the same time, she struck something inside Rio that caused her eyes to roll back into her head as she cried out in her euphoria. She was trying to hold herself up, but with each new powerful thrust, Rio could feel every point in her body that was turning into jelly.
    </p>
    <p>
     While thoughts were a rare commodity with Agatha penetrating into her fucking soul with each fevered thrust, something in Rio sparked, something akin to deviousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Th-Thought. Thought you said... I'd be. S-sorry,"
     </em>
     Rio offered in the form of a taunt, causing Agatha's attention to snap up from where she had been watching herself working in an out of Rio's destroyed cunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh, you will be. I didn't say it would be instant,"
     </em>
     Agatha jeered back.
     <em>
      "But I want to see you cum pretty for me the first time before I have you in tears."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh good fucking lord. Agatha's dirty talk was doing exactly what she hoped it would, especially in tandem with the way she was throwing her hips wildly into Rio's like a feral and primally horny animal.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was going to hurt for days in the best way and honestly, Rio hoped that it extended into weeks if she had to go that long without seeing Agatha again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to talk back, wanted to prove that she could hold her own, but the moment Agatha gave another shove to her thighs and swung her hips down and left them there, Rio completely shattered.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had known that the orgasm was coming, but that final blow had completely blown her apart. Her hands were on Agatha's arms, nails digging into her arms as a keening wail released from somewhere hidden inside of Rio's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was unreal, how animalistic and downright raw the sound was, but Agatha was eating it up, loving every last minute of it as she watched Rio, her head thrown back as her arms gave out under her weight. She had started to drop, but Agatha was quick to scoop her into a firm hold, letting Rio's legs drop limply at her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was shaking, trembling like a leaf in a hurricane as the orgasm completely pulled her under, scrambling any shred of sense that might have been kept inside of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the most irrational thing, really; Rio had fucked women, and had been fucked by women. She wasn't deeply immersed in the world of kink, but she had studied and read up enough to know that some things she held interest in and some she would never even read descriptions of again. The fact that she had cum at the mercy of this woman and she sheer strength she possessed was an entirely new level of freak that Rio couldn't say she was mad at.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time, Rio couldn't say much of
     <em>
      anything,
     </em>
     even if she tried. She was still limp in Agatha's hold, trying to at least find a way to lean forward, to grasp a hold of the only stable thing in front of her: Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Fucking hell, Rio,"
     </em>
     Agatha hissed at her, biting her lip as she maneuvered enough that she was able to look between them. The slight falling of her features perplexed Rio, but it also worried her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "What is it?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's lip jutted out in a pout as her gaze lifted. She might have been
     <em>
      trying
     </em>
     to pout, but Rio saw a determination in her eyes that she was clearly trying to hide.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I was hoping you'd be a squirter,"
     </em>
     Agatha revealed, feigning disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was well aware of her body's own capabilities, and that, she was certain was not one of them. It had never really happened before, except for
     <em>
      one
     </em>
     time that had been a complete fluke while she had been masturbating. She had tried to replicate it, tried to get it to happen again, but she'd never had any success.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Sorry to disappoint,"
     </em>
     Rio returned, finally managing to catch her breath, though stringing together any sentence longer than 3 words felt like an impossibility still.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh, pretty girl, no disappointment here. Tis but a bonus. Plus, it doesn't sound like I even need it, does it?"
     </em>
     Agatha gave a jostling of her hips, one that shoved a moan out of Rio's mouth at the same time a wet, sloppy sound hit the air, too. Agatha hummed, clearly pleased with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was obvious that round one had come to a close, especially when Agatha started to move.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fearing that she was going to pull out, something reactive in Rio's brain forced her into movement, her legs swinging up to lock tightly around Agatha's waist. Once more, Agatha was quick to hone in directly on Rio, her expression asking two things: 'What the fuck?' and 'Why are you such a fucking freak?'
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Don't,
     </em>
     " Rio mewled, that piteous inflection denting her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "But it's time for a venue change,"
     </em>
     Agatha tried to argue, but that wasn't what Rio was asking. Her legs tightened again as her hand found its way to Agatha's back, fingers tangling in her hair. Rio wasn't quite clinging, but she absolutely could not bear the thought of letting Agatha get away, not even an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "But..."
     </em>
     Rio offered in quiet protest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, Agatha seemed to hear the conversation that was not being had in words. Rio wasn't objecting to a move. What Rio was objecting to was Agatha pulling their bodies apart to accomplish it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The understanding settled over her and she began to move, positioning her arms and hands appropriately so that when she stood up and lifted Rio off of the dresser, she could support her weight steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio felt herself floating again, this time in the actual physical sense, her arms moved on their own, wrapping around Agatha's neck as she braced for the relocation. With such positioning, though, their faces were
     <em>
      so close
     </em>
     and Rio found herself fighting the urge to completely smother Agatha in another demanding and needy kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only thing that stopped her was the expression Agatha was donning.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't
     <em>
      tender
     </em>
     , but it was softer than she had been all night, even if not by much. It lasted a little longer than Rio had thought it might, but it ended when Agatha kissed her, hard and heavy. They were just there, Agatha standing in the middle of the bedroom floor, wearing Rio like she was some kind of puppet as they made out with Agatha's strap buried inside of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio was the one to pull away, she ducked forward over Agatha's shoulder, he teeth catching one of the piercings at the top of Agatha's ear. She gave it a light tug before she breathed her next demand into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Give me more."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she felt numb already, maybe she didn't know what she was actually asking for, but it was all Rio wanted in the moment. She wanted for Agatha to take her somewhere that nothing else mattered other than the endless waves of pleasure that had not stopped rolling through her. She wanted Agatha to use every last bit of her body that she could access, and she wanted her to feel powerful while doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was on the move, pacing around to the side of the bed so that she could lay Rio carefully down atop it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was still nestled between Rio's legs, not having moved even an inch -- though she couldn't have gone far with Rio's calves secured around the small of her back like that -- but she was clearly calculating again, building a plan in that fucked up brain of hers, or so Rio had thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha spoke, it genuinely caught Rio by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "How do you want it?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was doing something Rio had not expected her to do: while still being in total control, she was able to offer Rio a choice. Surely, she could have worked with anything Rio came up with, but for her to consider what Rio wanted in it all, other than to be fucked eight ways to Sunday, it meant something. It meant something, even though Rio was not in a place where she could communicate it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Pick me back up,"
     </em>
     Rio whispered in soft demand. Agatha responded in kind, lifting her up so that she was able to look down at Agatha, at those puzzled but amused blue eyes. Her hands landed on each of Agatha's shoulders as she parsed out the right phrasing she wanted to use. Her hands were once more ingratiated into Agatha's hair, but she wasn't offering any kind of pull or tug. Instead, she was just... playing with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Sit down,"
     </em>
     Rio instructed, though as she did so, she let their lips brush in a faint contact. Obediently, Agatha complied and place herself on the edge of the bed.
     <em>
      "Do you want to stay here, or do you want to move up the bed?"
     </em>
     Rio asked her, placing a kiss to the corner of her mouth, then one to her cheek, and finally her jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't verbalize a response and instead kept her strong arm secured around Rio, using the other as leverage as she artfully began to shift and adjust, scooting them back until her back was to the headboard, her head thudding into it softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "This is what I want. What I've always wanted."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a triumphant declaration, one that Rio found pride in. She'd been longing, yearning, begging the universe to have this moment, and it was right there in the form of Agatha between her legs, that strap still stiff as ever and waiting for Rio to resume her work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their lips met in another warm kiss, but when Rio pulled back, she had an intention this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Now, let's see if I can make you cum pretty, too."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha's jaw hinged, it was an indication that she had not been expecting Rio to dish out what she had been taking so willingly throughout the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     The absolutely raw need to prove that Agatha could do as she commanded Rio to do was instant as it took over her whole demeanor. Her hands found Rio's hips and she sat up lightning quick to crush Rio's lips with a sweltering kiss. It didn't last long, but it was because Agatha had something to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Yes, let's."
     </em>
    </p>

    <p>
     If Rio were capable of thinking, actually thinking, she would have noticed the things that were seemingly passing her right by; Maybe she would have picked up on the fact that while Agatha was surely having the time of her life completely wrecking Rio's body with excessive use of pleasure, there were the smallest gives that this wasn't solely about the absolutely carnal fuckfest that was transpiring between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those gives could be found in the way Agatha touched her, in the way she held Rio as she had shot forward in the middle of her orgasm. Those gives were obvious in the way that Agatha held her authority and brandished it like a sword, but when Rio made a request, Agatha met it. They were the tiniest tells, ones Rio could pay no mind to due to the fact that her head was miles away, swimming in an endless ocean of euphoria.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, Rio had been so fucking horny it had felt like a sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also yes, she had
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     considered the idea that Agatha would ever actually engage with her in such a manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hell, before that night, they hadn't even kissed and the most skin-to-skin contact they'd had was Agatha's hand clamped to Rio's throat like a vice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hadn't owed her a goddamn thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, as she sat poised in Agatha's lap, her needy cunt filled with the length of the strap on Agatha's hips, Rio knew Agatha was willing to give her
     <em>
      everything.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And while asking was nice and Agatha had made it clear she loved to hear it, Rio knew she didn't
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to. Agatha would have done it anyway, just by reading her body language. It was this unspoken agreement that while neither of them had any idea what this actually meant, it didn't matter. There was an invisible contract, one that had both of their names signed to the bottom, one that stated the conditions of that evening: use one another until the point of no return.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was
     <em>
      more than happy
     </em>
     to use Agatha to her heart's content, and Agatha seemed just as happy to let her.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a safe starting position, Rio's palms fell to Agatha's chest, but she did not begin to move her hips. Instead, she just let herself explore, let her fingertips feel out every protrusion of bone beneath skin and the soft thrumming of Agatha's pulse in her neck. She had been focused on her work, so much so that she had not been paying Agatha's face any attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     When that changed and Rio's gaze lifted, she was actually shocked to see Agatha with her lids shut tight over those beautiful blue eyes. Her lips were parted and the breaths passing through them were stuttered and uneven. Rio's movements didn't stop, but she was entirely fixated on the way Agatha seemed to be eating up ever minute of Rio's touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hand turned, palm facing up, so that she could drag two fingers along the length of Agatha's jaw, all the way to her chin. Once there, Rio's palm was down again and those tentative fingers lifted to trace the lightest line over Agatha's bottom lip.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't even startled when Agatha nipped at her fingers, a pleased smirk filling her lips a moment later as she opened her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You like to bite as much as you like to be bit?"
     </em>
     Rio asked her lowly. She already knew the answer to that; Agatha had almost taken her nipple off to prove it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand was moving again, this time to cradle the corner of Agatha's jaw so that she could drop her head. It was not a kiss she delivered but a sinking of teeth into that same lip, giving a tug on it. At the same time, her hips began to lift and shift so very slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Wouldn't you like to find out?"
     </em>
     came a murmured response against Rio's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "It was rhetorical,"
     </em>
     Rio mused back before silencing any continuation of the conversation with an aggressive kiss. She coupled it with the beginnings of a rhythm as he hips rolled down into Agatha's.
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, Rio knew she should have tapped out at that point. Her body was already starting to ache, but it felt so fucking good that she didn't care. One more, just one more, and then they could turn those tables. Well, she hoped they could. It was anyone's guess if she would even be able to move thirty minutes from then, but she had faith in herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     No matter how exhausted she was or how completely wrecked she felt, if Agatha walked out that door without letting Rio taste her, at least, Rio was going to be highly upset.
    </p>
    <p>
     That thought was a little louder as they kissed, sparking the beginnings of an idea in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew what Agatha was wearing, how it was hooked around her hips and thighs and what areas were left open and exposed. Rio knew because she'd worn it on several occasions. As such, she knew what it was she wanted, and she knew exactly how to get it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Letting that rough and hungry kiss last just a little longer, Rio finally made the decision to execute her plan of attack. She pried their lips apart and leaned back, allowing Agatha a full view of her as she began to truly sink some effort into the way she was sinking her body down on that strap, taking every bit of it with each pass.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of her hands had started to wander her body, skimming over Agatha's hold on her hip before it ran over her stomach, her chest. The other had shifted back, winding around behind her. Agatha had not been paying attention to such movement, too fixed on the way Rio had started to pinch and pull at her own nipple. The pressure of Agatha's fingertips sank into Rio's skin, pressing into bone, and she was fully stuck on the sight before her, enraptured by Rio's every movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     dialed in that when the hand that had wound up behind Rio made contact with her absolutely drenched cunt, her head threw back and slammed into the fabric-covered headboard, a moan ejecting out of her with relentless force.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a touch, and then it was a caress, one that coated Rio's in the viscous arousal that had been pooling in Agatha's core, even having desecrated the top portion of her thighs. She was a sticky, hot, wet mess and Rio could not have wanted her any more. In fact, that was
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     true that Rio felt like she needed to prove it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled her hand away, causing Agatha to release the most agitated and disappointed whine, but her head was still tipped back against the headboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio rasped, her hips maintaining their pace despite the fact that Agatha was gripping them so tightly that Rio
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     they were going to bruise. All Agatha did in response to her beckoning was whine, so Rio tried again, this time a little more demanding.
     <em>
      "Ag-Agatha. Agatha, look at me."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That one worked. Agatha's eyes snapped open and her chin dropped, doing as she was told. First glance would have offered nothing out of the ordinary, but with just a few seconds of patience, Rio brought her fingers up to her mouth. That heady scent was barely there, but Rio caught it right before she tucked them between her lips and began to suck the taste of Agatha off of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Ohhh, what the fuck?"
     </em>
     Agatha groaned helplessly. The grip she had been keeping on Rio's hips turned to pressure instead, forcing them down as her own lifted in desperation. Surely, she was wanting to fuck Rio senseless, but the way her pupils had blown entirely at the display before her screamed to Rio that she, too, wanted something out of this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had never doubted that, and she had her own intentions of a follow through, no matter how spent she was. She had fantasized about what Agatha would taste like, about just how much of her slick she might be able to consume and devour.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Mmmm,"
     </em>
     Rio hummed, though the way Agatha bucked up into her caused her hand to rip from her mouth and smack against Agatha's shoulder, her nails pressing into Agatha's skin as she tried not to let the sudden interruption break up her rhythm. That hum had become something else entirely, a keening cry that could not be contained.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fighting to stay upright felt like climbing a mountain with no oxygen, but she could feel that orgasm building, starting to threaten her as if she ever could have been scared. She was
     <em>
      welcoming
     </em>
     to the fact that her body was about to wrack and flutter and quiver for the fifth time that night. Maybe she should have tried to swap out the count, giving Agatha more than she'd given that stupid chair, but it was well past the point of being important.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I... I'm g-gonna,"
     </em>
     Rio tried to warn, but it came out weak. Her hands was moving again, fingertips skimming Agatha's thighs unintentionally before Rio found what she wanted even more.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took her only a moment to feel Agatha out, to slide down that intense and thick pool of her cum until Rio reached her entrance. Then, it took her no time at all to sink two of her fingers directly inside of Agatha's body, ripping the most animalistic and disembodied sound Rio was certain she'd ever heard in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     The noise, the vocalization of such an intense pleasure, it was enough to give Rio a hefty boot to the chest as she was kicked off of the precipice she had been stalling on, finally succumbing to the free fall of pleasure that came in the form of the orgasm that nearly crippled her. She started to snap backward, but Agatha's hands were quick as they slid up her ribs and caged her back to keep her from bending in a way that might actually hurt her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha had moved to sit up to catch Rio had enabled her to come face to face with Rio's chest. While she was still grunting and groaning at the feeling of Rio's fingers still inside of her, Agatha began to pepper kisses across Rio's sternum and breasts, simply paying her attention as she experienced those ripples of pleasure over and over until they began to calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was still a bit bitey and was leaving her fair share of marks, but Rio couldn't bring herself to care. Agatha could have peeled her skin off with nothing but her teeth and Rio would have let her. If she wanted to leave bite marks and hickeys, Rio was not going to be the one to stop her. Maybe, Rio considered, if Agatha disappeared again, she'd at least have something to remember her by.
    </p>
    <p>
     Giving one last taunting curl of her fingers as cognition seemed to find her again, Rio removed her hand and placed it on Agatha's shoulder so that she could gently push off of her. It took some effort, but as Rio swung her leg over and collapsed onto her back, she was convinced that she had died and was simply experiencing heaven in its truest form.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every limb and digit she was in possession of tingled and vibrated, humming at a high enough frequency, a frequency of pleasure, that could not be heard by the human ear. That didn't matter; Rio
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     it. She felt it so intensely that she found not one thought drifting to what it felt like to be empty, to not have Agatha hip-deep inside of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's brain was just buzzing, filled with nothing but hazy thoughts of the woman next to her whose chest was also heaving in a display of her effort.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having slept with her fair share of women, Rio knew that sex was great. It was better with some than others, but it was still a general pleasurable experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     That? Whatever the fuck the last two hours were?
    </p>
    <p>
     That wasn't just sex.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was feral and primal fucking in a way Rio had never experienced before. Her body felt almost new, sensations occurring that she'd never felt before. While she wanted to live in a little while longer, a new conscious thought found her that rooted her right back in that
     <em>
      need
     </em>
     for more.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't more for Rio in the sense that she thought she could take another orgasm without needing to be hospitalized, but it was more in the sense that in the way that as much as Agatha had wanted Rio and Rio's body, Rio wanted just the same in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha's hand landed on her bicep, a light tracing up and down her skin, Rio's eyes finally opened and shifted to her, taking her in. She bore flushed cheeks and still had not managed to catch her breath in its entirety, but she somehow found a way to form her request.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I want you."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled, that touch lifting from Rio's arm to push back the damp, sweat-soaked hairs that were stuck to her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You're actually fucking insatiable,"
     </em>
     Agatha informed her, her head tipping in her taunt. She was grinning, though, that sparkle of admiration so bright in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's head lulled on the pillow, back and forth, as she tried to shake her head.
     <em>
      "Not what I mean."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Just slightly, Agatha's brow pinched and then smoothed a moment after when Rio brought her fingers to her lips again, tongue poking out to collect what of Agatha's sex had not started to dry.
    </p>
    <p>
     That startled shock that Agatha had worn at least once before in that evening returned and she was just staring, unblinking so that she would not miss a single minute of the display Rio was providing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's arm raised lazily, the back of her hand giving Agatha's thigh a pathetic nudge.
     <em>
      "Give us a taste,"
     </em>
     Rio beguiled, a spent grin curling her lips.
     <em>
      "I think I more than earned it."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The second Agatha's cheeks flamed a dark red, Rio's grin somehow found the ability to widen, touching her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You know what?"
     </em>
     Agatha offered in return. Before she continued, she started to move to her knees, hands finding the straps of the harness so that she could loosen them for its removal.
     <em>
      "I actually agree with you."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Rio was quite certain it came close to killing her, that intense heat she'd felt all fucking night flared in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Earlier in the night, she'd been so desperate for release that she'd felt sick over it. Right then, she felt so thoroughly fucked and used that every quiver of her cunt felt like it stopped her heart. She didn't care; she could ignore it if it meant Agatha would give her the last thing she actually wanted out of that encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched her, so reverent as she observed Agatha's grace and finesse as she worked her way out of the harness and began to scoot forward on her knees toward Rio's torso. There was not another word exchanged between them as Agatha lifted her leg and shifted to straddle Rio's chest, adjusting so that her legs were comfortable and not awkwardly positioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hottest thing about it was that Agatha hadn't broken eye contact the entire time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who the fuck was this woman?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio still did not have answers to those question, not in ways that mattered, but what Rio
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     know was that she wanted to find out. She wanted more of Agatha's time, more of her effort, more of her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been fixated before, that much had been obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nearing the end of their journey that night, Rio had the tiniest thought that maybe she had become
     <em>
      obsessed.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That was only bound to get worse once she got a taste of Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow, as Agatha raised herself off of Rio's chest, leaving a smattering of cum on her skin from where she had been sitting, Rio found the strength to lift her arms, hands hooking into Agatha's hips from behind. She could have begged, could have been a demanding brat, but Agatha heard her desperation without her breathing a word and lowered her hips into Rio's awaiting and starved mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was measured at first, giving only one tentative swipe of her tongue before she withdrew it, shifting her head to achieve another goal instead. The tip of her nose skimmed along the topmost part of Agatha's mound, letting the hairs there tickle and taunt as Rio breathed in the scene of Agatha's desire.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was all for
     <em>
      her.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That was all for Rio.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Rio did that to Agatha.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And now, she got to taste the sweetness of her reward, the highest and juiciest peach on the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a gentle tug, Rio pulled on Agatha's hips again, lifting her head enough to press her mouth directly to Agatha's core. She was measured and precise, flat swipes of her tongue running from entrance to clit before repeating. She was slow, deliberate in each pass, seeking a specific reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Agatha's hips began to roll, Rio knew she had it. Her fingertips were digging into hip bones as she pulled down harder, trying to get even closer, to consume even more of Agatha, as much as she could manage. In the process, her eyes had fallen shut. It allowed her to hone in her focus, to pay explicit attention to every move she was making with her head between Agatha's legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, Agatha spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "H-hey,"
     </em>
     she gasped, her left hand squeezing at her own breast. Rio didn't acknowledge her, keeping to the task at hand. When Agatha realized Rio was not going to listen, the hand released her breast and fell, fingers sliding between strands of Rio's hair atop of her head, giving a gentle tug.
     <em>
      "L-Look at -- ohhhhh, fuck. Rio, look at me!"
     </em>
     she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't want to. She wanted to keep going, to not have to split her focus. When Agatha pulled her hair again, she listened and forced her dark eyes open to take in the sight above her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Rio had thought Agatha just wanted to be admired. Maybe she had thought that Agatha just wanted to put on a show. Whatever it was that Rio had considered half-heartedly that Agatha was wanting was nowhere near what she
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     was requesting Rio's attention for.
    </p>
    <p>
     Poised perfectly and still rolling her hips, Agatha was holding something in the hand that was not in Rio's hair. She was holding the harness. And she was holding it up. And then...
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a fight not to sputter into Agatha's cunt the moment, eyes locked with Rio's, she ran her tongue up the length of the silicone before pressing it past her lips, sucking the taste of Rio right off of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, Rio didn't know what it meant to be human. That? That feeling? That sheer ripping of her soul from her physical body as she watched Agatha suck on that fucking dildo with her own tongue buried in Agatha's pussy?
    </p>
    <p>
     Was that
     <em>
      actual
     </em>
     death?
    </p>
    <p>
     She sure as fuck wasn't breathing, and she definitely wasn't thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like an overloaded outlet, everything within her was short-circuiting in a way that left her with the ability to do only one thing: she moaned directly against Agatha's clit. The sound mixed with the feeling caused Agatha to shift down, hips canting out of rhythm for just a moment before she found herself again.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha removed the strap, she did so while still sucking -- hard -- and it gave a loud
     <em>
      POP,
     </em>
     Rio was not certain if she was going to remain in control of her faculties long enough to confidently give Agatha the orgasm she deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes the fuck she was. There was absolutely no other option here.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     to make Agatha cum, and she'd die trying if she needed to.
    </p>
    <p>
     In her mission, Rio was gripping hard and pulling in a more demanding fashion. Her tongue began to work harder, faster, but not losing an ounce of its finesse. When she pulled Agatha forward first, it was to position her tongue at her entrance. When she pulled her down next, it was to press it inside, nearly squirming at the feeling of her walls fluttering around it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Jesus fucking Christ,
     </em>
     Rio thought to herself as Agatha gripped and pulled at her hair again,
     <em>
      I could die right now, and I would have lived a life worth living.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's other hand was now free, having discarded the harness, and had flown to the headboard to steady herself. That, plus the way her hips had started to work a little more erratically, told Rio that she was close to the edge, close to reaching the same orgasmic high she had been proving to Rio all fucking night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to goad, to prod and poke, but she was enjoying her feast far too much to free her mouth up. That did not mean she had to stay quiet, though. Another raw and low moan reverberated out of her, straight into Agatha's cunt just before Rio removed her tongue and let it drag upward through her slick, taking as much as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she reached Agatha's clit, her lips pursed and sucked, the tip of her tongue gracing it artfully and intentionally.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been ready to put in the work, to take however long she needed to, but like a bolt of lightning, Agatha's grip tightened again and she yanked hard on Rio's hair. At the same time, her hips rocked forward, filling every bit of Rio's mouth that could hold her as she came. Her thighs were instantaneously trembling on either side of Rio's head and she was gasping for air like she hadn't been able to breathe for days.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her whimpers and cries were nothing short of absolute music to Rio's ears, a cacophony of pleasure and ecstasy and absolutely guttural euphoria and it made her want to keep going despite the fact that she could not breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha's hips had landed against her face, her nose was slightly smashed and her mouth was very obviously occupied, and as a result, drawing in a breath wasn't exactly possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't give a shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was cumming in her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who fucking cared if she suffocated in the process?
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite that train of thought, her fingers dug and pinched at Agatha's hips, alerting her to the point that she lifted some of the pressure. It was enough for Rio to catch her breath, drawing it in one forceful inhale at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way in which Agatha removed herself from her position above Rio was almost comical; she lifted her still-trembling knee -- undoubtedly to swing it over -- but lost her balance and toppled back onto the mattress, dangerously close to the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hand shot out and while she found purchase on Agatha's shin as her leg kicked out, she knew it was nowhere near enough of a grip to actually prevent her from falling off the bed. She was thankful, then, when she did not. It didn't stop Rio from devolving into a fit of quiet giggles, lifting her head to survey the other woman where she had landed, her head near Rio's thigh and her legs bent awkwardly to keep from kicking the headboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a long moment, Rio just watched her as she stared up at the ceiling, the most ridiculous grin on her face. The slope of her nose, the curling of her red and raw lips, that tiny little dimple in her chin... They were all markers that Agatha was beautiful, that she was captivating and enchanting.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, Rio remembered, she was a serial killer.
    </p>
    <p>
     One who knew how to
     <em>
      fuck.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That could be a moral dilemma for the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I take it you're not a cuddler,"
     </em>
     Rio surmised through a yawn. One hand raised and tucked behind her head; the other lifted enough that she could drag her fingers up and down the length of Agatha's shin.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Mmmm,"
     </em>
     Agatha returned, but she did speak to qualify it.
     <em>
      "I knew you were a smart girl."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, on the other hand,
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     a cuddler. She liked physical closeness, liked feeling someone else's skin against her own. She liked being able to hear the heartbeat of the person she'd been with, just to remind her that the experience was real.
    </p>
    <p>
     But for Agatha, Rio could get over that.
    </p>
    <p>
     What it all came down to was that there was no actual name for whatever the fuck this was. Rio had admittedly stalked her -- twice -- and then Agatha had returned the favor -- also twice. They had tried going on a date (as if they could have ever been normal people) and that had bombed spectacularly. Then... Well, Rio was going to be feeling what had happened after for the next several days, she was positive.
    </p>
    <p>
     They weren't dating, this wasn't a relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
     But still, Rio didn't want this to just be... it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to talk to Agatha about it, wanted to have some kind of conversation where she could request more of Agatha's time and not seem desperate about it, but she was quickly fading. Impressively, she had managed to keep cognition throughout pleasuring Agatha, but the heavy weight of exhaustion was beginning to anchor her consciousness, pulling it down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lips parted, as if to ask for Agatha to stay a little longer, or perhaps to request that she lock the door on her way out, but before she could muster even a sound, Rio had fallen asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been an impossibly long time since Rio had slept more than five or six hours in a night. It was something she had accepted as commonplace, something she knew she likely could not change.
    </p>
    <p>
     So when she woke the next day, she had expected it to be no later than eight or nine in the morning. When her eyes opened, Rio was not surprised in the least to see no one on the other side of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course Agatha had left. Rio hadn't
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     thought she would stay, even if some stupid part of her hoped she might. When she rolled to her side, there were about four very vivid reminders of her inside Rio's body, though, and what they had done the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze landed on the empty pillow in front of her and what she saw there
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     surprise her.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a phone laying on the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she picked it up, Rio realized it was not her phone. It was a generic smart phone, one that had an awaiting message and no pass code. Rio swiped up, opening a message from the only contact: 'A.'
    </p>
    <p>
     There were three messages.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first one read:
     <em>
      'Text me when you wake up.'
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The second?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a picture. It was a picture Agatha had apparently taken before she'd left the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her shoes had been discarded by the dining chair she had first placed herself in, but in the photo, they were barely visible. That was because Phineas had curled up on them and was fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     The third was technically part of the second, but it made Rio smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      'I will win him over yet.
      <br/>
      Ps. Don't forget to text.'
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had encouraged her twice to reach out, which was enough to say that what had happened the night before was not a complete one-off, but that wasn't what Rio was focusing on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was just reading that second message again and again, but only the first sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wanted Phin's approval, and she was making a statement that she was going to garner it. That meant more time, that meant more of getting to be in Agatha's presence. She was surely a busy woman, had a job and a deadly hobby that occupied great portions of her time, but in those six words, she said so much more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The grin that found her as she began to type her response was giddy, growing when she sent the message.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Good morning, you psycho. Who the fuck leaves a burner phone as a morning-after gift?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's response had her in giggles, only moments into consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh, so I should cancel the breakfast order I just placed to be delivered? Or... Brunch, rather. It IS almost 1pm."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the panic at the hour, Rio's grin grew wider still.
    </p>
    <p>
     For any and every doubt that Rio had toward the idea of this thing between them somehow finding a way to go on, as she read over the text again where Agatha admitted to buying her food, they seemed to just... disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
     In that moment, Rio knew one thing for certain:
    </p>
    <p>
     She had not been able to get her fill of Agatha
     <em>
      before
     </em>
     the evening they had spent together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now?
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, Rio was in big fucking trouble with how badly she wanted more.

    <p>
     The last time that Rio had sunk further into bed after sleeping in far too late while holding a phone close and grinning at almost every response that came through had been when she was still a teenager, and she felt like an entire dumbass for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was thirty-six years old. She had a career that she had invested herself into, had a life that she had built for herself, things she could be proud of. She should
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     have been proud of the fact that she was reduced to a pathetic school girl, pink-cheeked and delighted by having a conversation with a pretty woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, no. Calling Agatha
     <em>
      pretty
     </em>
     should have been a crime for how much of an understatement it was. Agatha was much,
     <em>
      much
     </em>
     more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was captivating. She was remarkable in every way imaginable. Her beauty was stunning in ways that Rio could hardly make sense of. Agatha was like knowing darkness for so, so long before finally seeing the light.
    </p>
    <p>
     So to call Agatha
     <em>
      pretty
     </em>
     , Rio almost had half a mind to instill some form of punishment on herself in reprimand. Maybe a thought for another time. Right then, she needed to respond to Agatha's text about the breakfast that was apparently on the way to her home.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have said 'thank you,' or at the very least told her it was kind of her. Rio's still partially-asleep brain fired back a response before actually thinking it through.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "...Did you poison it so no one will ever know?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She grinned as it sent, the little
     <em>
      zzzp
     </em>
     sounding in confirmation. She watched the screen, her eyes flickering to that contact name, just the lone 'A,' before a small bubble appeared to indicate that Agatha was typing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first thing that sent was a lone emoji with two puffs of air leaving its nose, brow pinched tight in frustration. Her actual response came right after.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "That's not a very nice thing to say to someone who fucked you into a coma and is having breakfast brought to your front door."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Well... Agatha wasn't wrong. At the same time, could she really blame Rio for being skeptical? This dance they had been doing, it was dangerous for both of them for vastly different reasons that had the same end consequences: prison or death.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made sense to Rio that Agatha could see her as a loose end. She could show up one night and simply decide that the risk of keeping Rio around wasn't worth the reward of whatever the fuck the night before had been and then some. Rio was realizing very quickly how that was not a decision she would have any say in; Agatha was very capable of making very consequential choices and staking around the repercussions. Tying up that loose end might have been worth the moral anguish of breaking her own code.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ha. Agatha having a moral dilemma. It seemed so unlikely and yet, Rio had seen it. She had spotted those brief flashes in Agatha's eyes that made her seem as though all was not as composed as she tried to make it seem. Agatha was not infallible, but Rio had yet to pinpoint a single weak spot, other than her inability to turn down a good fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, until that text message.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps Agatha had done an impeccable job of maintaining her armor of indifference, but here she was, texting Rio on a burner phone she'd left instead of just giving Rio her fucking number. Why did she have to be
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     extra? More than that was the gesture of breakfast, even if Rio's suspicion had not been entirely snuffed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Can you blame me? It WAS only our first date. And... We didn't even finish dinner."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She had expected push-back on that one, for Agatha to offer some cutting quip that would hurt in the best way. Rio was very quickly learning that she liked pushing Agatha's buttons because Agatha tended to respond with force and whether it was physical or verbal, it caressed all of the right spots in Rio's brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     thought Agatha would admit to being a snoop.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Yeah, well... I looked in your fridge. Spicy V8 and Modelo do not a breakfast make. Are you actually okay?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The quick whip of indignance that flared somewhere in Rio's middle was quickly gone as she rolled her eyes in response. Before she offered back a response, she flopped to her back, squealing in her shock when she realized for the first time that Phin was behind her. He let out a low meow of disapproval, but did not move and forced Rio to scoot forward to achieve the ability to lie flat on her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And when did you come in to say good morning?" she asked him softly. The phone dropped to her stomach for a moment so that she could turn her full attention to the way she ran her fingers through her fur, eliciting the quietest purring of contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thanks for being a good sport about last night. And the shoes? Nice move. But still growl again next time, yeah?" she murmured at him, the softest huff of a chuckle puffing through her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     A little too long into paying him attention, she realized that she had not actually responded to Agatha's previous message. She pulled the phone back up and formed a response that was short and sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I don't eat breakfast."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew it was bad for her, knew that per her physiology, a healthy meal in the morning would be best for her, but there was no interest in there when she could chug three cups of coffee to power through her days and fuel her quippy and fun sarcastic demeanor. Who needed a banana and oatmeal when Death Wish Coffee existed?
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, Rio found herself staring at the bottom corner of the conversation, waiting for the bubble to appear that would signify Agatha had something to say, but it took... too long. Rio had been ready to lock the phone and get her day going, but just as she pulled it away, she caught sight of those three little ellipses as Agatha composed her response.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "And you don't get fucked like that every day either. Look at you, trying new things!"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's laugh was loud and instant, so bright that Phineas startled and shot to his feet, though he realized quickly that Rio was just being ridiculous -- and annoying. With a disgruntled chirp, he paced in a small circle before tucking himself back into a ball once more, clearly not done with his rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the strangest aligning of events, two things happened at exactly the same time: there was a sharp rapping on the front door of the apartment
     <em>
      and
     </em>
     Rio's phone started ringing somewhere from the direction of the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quickly, thumbs were moving to at least offer a half-assed response as to why she might
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     respond otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Food's here. Thank you... A. (;"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tossed the burner to the mattress and scrambled out of bed, nearly dropping to her knees the moment she let her weight sink down onto her feet. Immediately, she was hit with the full gravity of what the night before had done to her body. It wasn't
     <em>
      painful
     </em>
     , but hurt in the most delicious way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Annoyingly, she could feel her core clench at the mere thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow, without tripping over her own legs, Rio made it to her closet and yanked down an oversized hoodie, one that would cover enough bits and pieces to allow her to answer the door without taking the extra time to put on more clothes. She had shaken it down enough by the time she reached the door, pulling it open with an exaggerated grin to greet the delivery man.
    </p>
    <p>
     In his arms was a box from Gotham Bagel Company with a bag that surely had a couple of different schmears inside. Rio simply rolled her eyes, though her gine didn't really go anywhere as she thanked him and took the food. Finally, her phone had stopped ringing from behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you get tipped? I think I have a five in here?" Rio asked him, glancing over her shoulder to try and locate her wallet, finding no lucky.
    </p>
    <p>
     "On top of the thirty?" he asked back and Rio wanted to simply cackle at the absurdity of it, though for his sake, she managed to stuff it down. "I'm okay, thank you. Have a good day, though."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You too!" Rio called as he turned to head off down the hall. She kicked the door shut and turned to see Phin sulking toward the kitchen, heading right for his empty food bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright, alright. We eat together," Rio mused softly. She paced into the kitchen and set down her morning's feast so that she could fill his bowl, but in the process of doing so, her phone started ringing again. Taking the time she needed to get the cat kibble in his bowl, she was quick as she rushed to the living room and scoured it for her phone, finally finding it shoved into the cushions of the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio could see the screen, she was not surprised to see it was Alice. As fast as she could, she answered, throwing the phone up to her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey! Shit, sorry, was that you that just called a minute ago? I was at the door grabbing breakfast. Got Gotham because why not?" Rio was trying to sound casual, trying to act like she wasn't so fucking sore that it was making moving around the house feel like an entire task.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good, you're alive!" Alice chirped over the line, though it was almost a little too hard to hear her over the noise in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Uh, yeah? Why wouldn't I be?" Rio questioned, the nerves suddenly tangling around her wildly beating heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Maybe because I've been texting you since nine and you never answered? I'm at Ipsento, do you want some coffee? I can grab it and bring it to you," she offered. It was a sweet gesture, but at the same time Rio was absorbing it, she was walking by that armchair. Indubitably, her gaze dropped and her stomach followed suit.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was absolutely no missing the two stains on the arm of the chair; not only was there the larger one that Agatha had left behind, but there was also a smaller one where Rio's own excitement had reached a little further than it had in her previous self-satisfaction sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Uh --" she choked back, trying to think of a reasonable excuse as to why Alice could
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     come into that apartment. Rio was certain that if she took a step out into the hallway and took in several breaths, the moment she retreated inside of the apartment, her olfactory senses would be assaulted with nothing more than the sheer stench of sex.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would likely stay that way until she found a way to saw up and burn that chair into fucking dust.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the only possible solution as how she could continue to keep living in that apartment. That was a tricky line of thought; she was obviously not going to do away with the dresser, but it probably
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     need a thorough wipe down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck, Agatha was going to have to stop coming over or they were going to end up desecrating every flat surface in Rio's apartment and probably end up traumatizing Phin in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you think maybe we can hang out at yours today? You have the balcony and it's supposed to be beautiful out. We can grab some Zing Zang and vodka and day drink?" she supplied, working her hobbling out into something that could be considered more of a gait or stride as she trekked back to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, that's fine," Alice answered, but suddenly the sounds of the cafe were replaced with the sounds of the city streets. "I can be there in ten. Will you be ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Ten minutes was not a long time, and most likely not long enough for Rio to shower, at least towel off her hair, and change, but she could try to make it work.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I might not be right at ten minutes, but if you'll wait the extra few, I'll be out?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice chuckled and Rio could practically hear over the line as she rolled her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, gotta kick out last night's conquest and scrub the evidence?" Alice jabbed.
    </p>
    <p>
     While every last bit of Rio knew that she was just joking as she always did, that arrangement of words hit a chillingly cold nerve in Rio's middle. Thankful Alice could not see her expression, she used that to her advantage and offered a laugh that she hoped sounded genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course. Now let me go shower!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright alright! I'll be waiting in the visitor's spot. See you soon, Rio."
    </p>
    <p>
     "See you soon, Alice."
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Rio disconnected the call and tossed her phone to the one undefiled piece of furniture -- the couch -- and booked it for the bathroom, though her pace was hindered a bit by the current state of her physicality.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she climbed into the shower, Rio found herself thinking those familiar thoughts from the night before and earlier when she had woken up: How had those parts of her body never been touched like that before? How had she slept with enough women that she'd lost count and still had never been so thoroughly fucked into place like that in her life?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was... She was something fucking else, that was one thing Rio knew with a painful and absolute certainty. The authority she carried with her at every second was bewitching and the fact that she knew how to back up every bit of that talk she so casually fired off?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been trying to focus on the non-sexual things about Agatha that were so damn appealing to her, but when a little voice in the back of her head piped up -- and sounded a
     <em>
      lot
     </em>
     like Agatha's -- as if ripped right out of the night before, Rio wanted to completely forget that Alice was coming to pick her up and just try for
     <em>
      one more orgasm
     </em>
     within a twelve hour window.
    </p>
    <p>
     No!
    </p>
    <p>
     Be a responsible adult!
    </p>
    <p>
     More importantly,
     <em>
      don't be a shitty fucking friend.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finished washing up and dried off with as much haste as she could manage, her hair still measurably damp by the time she had pulled on a pair of leggings and t-shirt. Not wanting her shirt to get too wet, she decided to throw her hair into a clip and set about locating her necessities. Once she had her phone, her keys, and her wallet, she collected the box of bagels, as well as the schmear, and called to a Phineas she could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Behave, Phin! I'll bring back some fabric refresher... Or a steam cleaner! Don't open the fridge again!" With that, Rio let herself out and locked the door behind her. When she made it out into the parking garage, Alice was waiting as Rio knew she would be. Thankfully, she was looking at something onf her phone to it gave Rio those couple extra moments to sort herself out. When she slid in with her bounty, Alice's expression lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You brought them with you!?"she asked excitedly, as if the answer were not already in front of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I cannot eat them all and I don't know how good they'd be if I waited to bring them in on Monday, so we can day drink and eat bagels I guess," Rio suggested, her lips tugging up at the corners in an endearingly sweet smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're the best. Why did you even buy a dozen?" came Alice's inquiry as she started the car and back out to drive them to her place.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I didn --" Rio abruptly cut herself off, pressing her lips together as she redirected and steered in a different direction. "I didn't mean to. I thought I was only getting six. So, hope your funny neighbor guy likes poppyseed bagels."
    </p>
    <p>
     They both fell to a soft chuckling that then turned into casual back and forth about the happenings of the weekend and any recent drama either of them had heard about -- which was nothing that week. It had been enough to fill the time it took to stop at the liquor store and then make it to Alice's.
    </p>
    <p>
     Calmly, Rio lifted herself from the car and walked ahead up the front path to Alice's house, bagels secured snugly in her arms. She was not sure what in the world she would have needed to have done to prevent Alice's next statement, but she would have done anything in the world to have seen to it that the words never left her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh my
     <em>
      God, Rio!"
     </em>
     she exclaimed her voice jumping at least one octive at her humor. Alice surged up to Rio's side, turning her head to gawk. "You really needed the extra time to kick someone out?!"
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Ugh. Alice. Fucking perceptive Alice. God damnit.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Rio answered truthfully. She hadn't needed the time to kick Agatha out, she'd needed the time to wash the absolute filth of the night before off of her skin and out of her hair. She needed to remove any trace of Agatha that might have been visible to anyone else, especially Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're lying. You got laid." It was an astute and pointed observation, but it was one that made Rio's jaw clench. She was
     <em>
      trying
     </em>
     not to grind her teeth to prove Alice write, but she was suddenly watching as the circus of her life began to devolve into obvious madness.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can you maybe... I don't know? Unlock the door and let me in so I can set this stuff down?" Rio huffed, her annoyance sharp and bitter on her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jeez," Alice grumbled, shuffling forward to unlock the door. "I thought you laid would make you less grouchy."
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you stay still too long," Rio clipped back, nodding her head toward the inside of the home for Alice to continue, "I'm going to kick you on my way in."
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it wasn't exactly common for them to pass up on an opportunity to gossip about their sex lives, but it had been no secret that Rio's had been rather lacklustre as of late and Alice never missed the opportunity to poke fun of her for it. Meanwhile, Alice's latest conquest was a woman that worked in the County Title Office. She'd been rather tight lipped about it, so Rio felt as though she could take up the same stance here, keeping this one a little closer to the vest.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if Alice was ever going to let that happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     She did give in to Rio's direction, tucking inside as Rio followed, but she was quick to relieve Rio of the box. They both wound their way to the kitchen, Rio's eyes wandering over the interior of the home. It was comical, really, the way it was never the same each time Rio came over. It wasn't always a massive change, but Alice was the restless type, never able to stay in a pattern or pocket for too long comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took to rifling through the bagels and picked out two everything for them and set about the work of slicing and toasting them. Half-way through, she glanced over her shoulder at Rio who stood staring into the fridge.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You have nothing to put in a bloody," Rio pouted, kicking her foot in a feigned tantrum.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So who is she?" Alice asked, hoping to be so curt and sudden that it threw Rio off.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't work.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you have any of those bleu cheese stuffed olives left?" Rio questioned, surveying the various jars in the shelves of the door. She was finding nothing suitable, but she was still trying to pretend like she was looking
     <em>
      really hard
     </em>
     for something that might improve the quality of their drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where did you meet her?" At this point, Alice was an absolute mockery of herself, bent at the waist with her elbow on the counter and her head propped on her fist, staring up at Rio with a playfully inquisitive gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you not even have any celery? Anything?!" Rio was ignoring her. On purpose. Because she hadn't concocted quite the right lie to spin here and lying to Alice was hard enough as it was. She didn't need the pressure of a deadline creating unnecessary nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio, come on," Alice pleaded, wanting the tiniest crumb. She just wanted to be let in on a secret that Rio was clearly very terrible at keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heaving a sigh, Rio leaned forward, as if inspecting more of the contents in a way that might show her something she had not noticed before. She even bent a bit, sticking her head inside as if it might offer her an out in relation to the conversation Alice wanted so desperately to have.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Was she at least good in bed?" Alice attempted, hoping Rio might bite.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was an asshole. Of course she would bite, very facetiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh yes, absolute killer."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had expected a laugh, a snort, for Alice to throw something at her. When Alice fired a retort back that pierced through Rio's entire body, her reaction was instant.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What, you fucked the serial killed?" Alice shot back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to stand up, completely forgetting that she was hunched over with her head stuck in that refrigerator. The moment she did, the back of her head slammed into the bottom of the freezer door and she yowled in pain. Her hand flew up to cradle the back of her scalp, stumbling back enough that her back hit the opposing counter.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Motherf --!"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio!"
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Rio stopped seeing stars long enough to realize where she sound of Alice's voice was coming from, she had no time at all to formulate any plans of attack on how to field what was bound to come her way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No fucking way, Rio," Alice pressed, stepping forward to shut the door before she turned on her friend. "Please tell me there is a perfectly logical explanation as to why you reacted that way when I suggested you are fucking the serial killer we have suspected to be a woman without telling me that you are fucking the serial killer we have suspected is a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was still rubbing at the back of her head, trying to soothe the miserably sharp pain that had happened as a direct result of the contact. She had suspected she might have split skin, but the lack of anything warm and sticky negated the possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can I... Just tell you that there is just not a perfectly logical explanation and we just leave it at that and eat our bagels and drink our shit-ass excuses for bloody Marys?" She was grumbling now, wanting to find a way through this conversation that did not involve her revealing anything crucial.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio might have been an idiot, but she was not a nark. She was not going to rat Agatha out, not even to her best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stop it right fucking now," Alice admonished, stepping closer to pick apart Rio's expression with her pointed and hot gaze. "You really found her?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can you like... Go back to what you were doing before this turned into the Spanish Inquisition? My soul is far from saving, Alice."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was trying to prompt her to let it go, but she had already known it was never going to work. She had given too much away, just enough for Alice to surmise that she wasn't lying and was instead trying to hide her impeccably poor decisions beneath a stony blanket of poorly compiled humor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio..." Alice tried again, but this time the look she was wearing was much softer. "If you're being serious... You can tell me. I'm not going to fuck off and run to the cops."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was still rigid and unnerved, her back awkward in its positioning against the counter, but she did not slacken or back down. Her dark gaze swept over Alice's features, trying to find even a twitch that might tell Rio she was being dishonest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew Alice better than that, though, and she always had.
    </p>
    <p>
     What had started as a working relationship had formed into something stronger, something that was perhaps even a little too well-seeded to be called just a typical friendship. The platonic love they had formed for one another was a true showing of a different kind of devotion, one that was about to prove itself then and there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And no calls to county for a psych admittance?" Rio pressed, both trying to see how far Alice might be willing to compromise and also to gauge where her true loyalties were going to lie.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio... Am I going to
     <em>
      think
     </em>
     you're insane and making terrible choices if you're being honest? Of course, but that's because I'm your best friend and I'm allowed to tell you when you're being insane. But... I'm not going to turn you over to care of the city." Alice paused, considering for a moment as she chewed on the inside of her lip. She wanted to say the right thing, but she also wanted to make sure that Rio understood that their friendship truly was a safe place for her to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's lips worried and twisted in her indecision, her stomach churning like it were being torqued with a cement mixer. How did she tell Alice the truth? More than that,
     <em>
      how much
     </em>
     of that truth did Rio tell her?
    </p>
    <p>
     She had known all along that this was stupid, but she had been hoping that her acting abilities had gotten better since she was a child. As it turned out, that was not the case. Instead, Alice had pinned her pretty quickly and there was little salvaging what had remained of her ruse.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was all Rio said, and it wasn't a direct answer to any questions Alice had asked, but it said all she needed it to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     The shock filled Alice in the blink of an eye, her own going wide as it registered that Rio was being honest, that she was choosing to tell Alice a very big and very dangerous secret. That startled gaze was daring everywhere on Rio's expression, trying to locate a jumping-off point, somewhere that she could propel this conversation from, but she was coming up empty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Alice chose to state the obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, first off, you're a fucking dumbass. Second... What's her name? Is she hot? Can she fuck?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice had pressed forward, picking both of Rio's hands in her own as she fired question after question, not actually giving Rio any time to answer them before she was offering the next.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alice, Alice," Rio tried to calm, her fingers fastening firmly around Alice's. "Listen, I am more than willing to answer most of the questions you probably have, but I'm going to need to down at least one full glass containing liquor before I do. Can that be arranged?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew what kind of choice she was making, and she knew that she was going to have to be very, very careful about what she revealed. She could offer a made up name, one even different from the one Agatha had used at the restaurant the night before, and she could fudge a job title. That one wouldn't be as hard; she didn't actually know what Agatha did for a living anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     The difficult one was going to be knowing how to field the true reason for her search; the knowledge. Rio had sought this woman out because she'd possessed questions that she had needed answers to. By standard reasoning, admitting to the fact that they had fucked implied that she had at least bare minimum knowledge about the mass murders that had been going on.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't quite so simple, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thing that made it so complex was that Rio had agreed to be a witness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not once.
    </p>
    <p>
     But twice.
    </p>
    <p>
     That bit of information perhaps needed to stay under a little more lock and key than some of the more vague pieces she might have been able to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice had agreed to alcohol with ease; they prepared their drinks and headed to the balcony where they spent the majority of the afternoon and early evening discussing the basics. There had been only once or twice where Alice had pushed for a little more information that Rio had been willing to give, but when Rio made the line known, she backed off.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seemed, more than anything, that Alice was just fascinated. In the way that Rio had been driven by her need for answers, Alice was driven by her need to observe and assess the complex dynamic that had been built between Rio and this woman who was literally picking men off like they were cherries on a tree and she had the world's largest step ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
     She found the fascination in it that Rio had known she would, the one that Rio herself had that had started this entire thing to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Rio realized she should be getting home to feed and check on Phin, she had divulged as much to Alice as she could without crossing any hard set boundaries. She did not divulge information about the phone, or that she had any way at all to contact Agatha -- who she had taken to calling Amelia, after all -- and that Rio was sure she would reach out when she was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio's Uber messaged that he was approaching, the two shared in an embrace by the front door and Rio bid her goodbyes to head home.
    </p>
    <p>
     The car ride home had been painstakingly long, most likely because of the state she found herself in where she was sort-of drunk but not-quite-actually drunk. It was annoying more than anything else, but she did her best to set it to the back of her mind and wait for her body to tip one way or the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had let herself into her apartment, stopping the moment the door shut behind her, stunned by how right she'd been with her earlier thought. She had been a little too buzzed to remember to grab the fabric spray and as a result, the first thing she smelled as soon as she was inside was a very stark and heady reminder of all that she had been up to the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas was perched, front paws tucked together, at the threshold from the living room into the dining area, his eyes pinched in a squint of scrutiny. Or, maybe he'd just woken up. Either way, Rio was painfully aware of something.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if she could find a way to eradicate the smell, there were still very vivid and present reminders of Agatha in quite a few spots located throughout that apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Coming home had been enough on its own to kickstart that irrational lust in her brain and she knew that it was not going to go away if she chose to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heaving a sigh, Rio dug her phone out and dialed Alice's number, putting her on speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey, Rio! You alright?" came her brightly tipsy greeting, though she did sound genuinely concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cleared her throat and matched Phin's stare as he watched her expectantly, silently demanding a break from whatever the fuck it was she had done to that apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, no, I'm fine. But... Phin and I are going to come stay for a couple of days, if that's okay?" she half informed, half asked. Before she even finished the full question, Alice was laughing, clearly amused by the fact that Rio couldn't seem to stand the idea of keeping residence in her apartment after the tour of the spiritual plane she'd taken the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pack a bag, get him on a lead, and get on over here. If you have any Spicy V8 left bring that, too. I'm out."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's grin on her side of the line was bright, so vibrant that she knew it had to carry over the line.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thank you, Alice. You truly are the best friend a girl could ask for."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Remember that the next time you're able to get your transport license. I need someone to cover my shifts every now and again."
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, Rio was laughing, tickled by the bartering system Alice was choosing to use in that instant, one that never would have worked out even it if
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     made sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Anything for you, Alice."
    </p>
    <p>
     The thing of it was, Rio meant it. How many women could say with total honesty that they told their best friend they were fucking a serial killer and jail or loony bin were not immediate options?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could, and that meant everything to her.

    <p>
     There was a perk to choosing to stay at Alice's place: Rio didn't have to drive herself to work. She'd offered on a couple of instances, but the deeply paranoid part of Alice hadn't been willing to give up such control. She was probably the most defensive driver Rio had ever met in her life and more often than not, it came in handy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio would let her have it and enjoy the ride each morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     She would also fight every burning desire to rip that burner phone out of her messenger bag and check to see if Agatha had texted her. She'd been rather quiet since the weekend, but Rio found herself staring at the last message she had sent, just reading it over and over again until she had read it at least a thousand times. She did it in private, but the image had been burned into her mind's eyes for easy recall whenever she wanted, like on those car rides to work at 7am.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Don't make plans this weekend. You're mine for 48 hours."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Those words brought with them a flaring of intense heat, one that came from a pained yearning deep within, right between Rio's legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now that she had put forth the effort of committing it to memory? She had really fucked herself over. She could access it easier, sure, but she had also opened the door to the possibility that it was going to appear unsolicited times as well. One of those times had been the day when Rio had been at her desk -- presumably alone -- and had been signing off on a couple of release forms when she thought about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She thought about the phone in her desk and how she had turned up the volume just enough that she would hear if Agatha finally decided to message her. Thinking about the phone led to thinking about the message again, a dangerous and slippery slope. It had only been a couple of days and already, she... missed Agatha?
    </p>
    <p>
     Or was it her hands Rio missed? Those collarbones? Those sharp and beautifully harmful teeth? Those soft and driven lips?
    </p>
    <p>
     The softest worked-up sigh passed through her lips as her thighs squeezed together and shifted slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You okay?" Alice asked, causing Rio to plummet into a reality where she had not known Alice was even in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Christ! Yes! When did you get here?!" Rio snapped, though the blush on her cheeks was a true showing that she was embarrassed more than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
     It also caused Alice to smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know how I always say I would have loved to have been friends with ferally horny teenager Rio?" she asked, though that smirk amplified into a bright and annoying grin that almost started to grate on Rio's nerves, but only because she knew what was coming. "I think I'm friends with her now and I gotta say, I love it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's lips dropped at the corners and her brow furrowed at such an accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've been laid before, Alice," Rio returned bitterly as she sent in the last form. She leaned back in her chair, looking up at her friend with a disgruntled sense of being misperceived.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You wouldn't know it with the way you've been acting the last few days," Alice teased back; Rio still wanted to guard against her, but what was the point? She'd already given away far too much in regards to whatever the fuck it was she was doing with Agatha, even if it wasn't much at all. The sex was the most prominent headline there and it had sort-of dominated the conversation. Rio wanted to keep it that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     The less Alice knew about Agatha, the better.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't feel all too difficult to maintain that air of mystery, but things had definitely taken a hard right turn that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two of them had eaten lunch in Rio's office; bread bowls with broccoli cheddar soup just before Alice departed for her first afternoon run. When she had come back, it was with a twenty-three year old male who it taken a tumble -- to put it gently -- off of a forty foot bridge and had met his untimely demise at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had set to work immediately, but Alice's lack of another run left her with little else to do that sit at Rio's desk, calling out crossword clues for Rio to guess at while she worked.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been nearing the end of the autopsy when the sound of a phone notification dinged from Rio's office. It hit her ears and as such, she assumed it was her actual phone and did not hesitate to make her request.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can you check that for me? Passcode's still the same!" she called over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a brief moment of silence, but then the sound of Alice's feet scuffing over the tile hit her ears. "Uh, there's nothing here?" Alice spoke, holding the phone up for Rio to see for herself, as if she might have thought Alice was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing it triggered a slightly panicked thought: the burner phone. It was also a thought that made her want to bite her lip and giggle like a kid with a crush. She was in the process of figuring out something to say when another notification sounded, causing her skin to blanch.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You have another phone!?" Alice all but squealed as she rushed back into the office, leaving Rio's hands inside this dead man's chest while she wanted to plead and scream that Alice needed to just leave this alone. It was too late, though, Rio could already hear the scratching metal of the desk drawer being opened.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was silence and then --
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, what the FUCK!? Rio! Who the fuck is A and what the fuckkkk?!"
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't the easiest feat in the world to embarrass Rio Vidal, because she had very low levels of shame, but right then Rio wanted to do nothing more than crawl into some hole and forget that this had ever happened to her. She didn't even know what the fuck Agatha could be sending her that could have Alice reacting in such a manner, but Rio needed to find out.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was hasty as she finished stitching up the man on her table and tucked him away into storage so that she could rush back into the office. She was
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     quick as she blew into that office that Alice had never had a hope of seeing her coming.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Give me that!" Rio cried as she snatched the phone right out of her grasp, not slowing in the least as she kept barreling around where Alice sat in the office chair. She didn't know
     <em>
      what
     </em>
     was on that phone, but she knew she wanted to be alone when she found out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you not gonna explain why you have two phones?!" Alice called after her, leaning far enough to watch Rio disappear out the doors toward the lobby bathroom that she almost fell out of the chair. Thankfully, she was smart enough to catch herself on the edge of the desk for.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt red and hot at such a a question; she wasn't ready to answer that and Alice had also just shouted it. No one would actually give a fuck, but Rio felt like she'd been put on the spot and she needed a moment to regain a modicum of composure. She needed to re-center, to remember that while Agatha was implementing the schedule and rules here, Rio still had
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     control over her own  life.
    </p>
    <p>
     She made it to the bathroom and tucked herself in the farthest stall from the door, not actually having to use the restroom but needing the privacy regardless. She laid down three of the seat covers and sat, pants still all the way up. It would take away any temptation to be an irrationally irresponsible idiot at work.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she opened the messages, she was
     <em>
      so thankful
     </em>
     to thirty-seconds ago Rio for being the executor of that decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     The very bottom image -- the last one Agatha had sent -- was clearly her thighs, cutting off at the top
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     before reaching whatever panties she might have been wearing... or
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scrolled up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Above it, there was another photo. This one was very clearly of the upper part of Agatha's body. Her shoulders were visible enough that Rio could tell she wasn't wearing a shirt. She didn't need to see nipple to know that much. That wasn't the most
     <em>
      riveting
     </em>
     thing about that photo, however.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, the part of the photo that made Rio wish her pants were around her ankles was Agatha's gorgeous, pale, bony, veiny, ring-adorned hand was secured around her throat. Her head was also tipped back and her chin was just out of frame by less than an inch. Rio could already picture it in her mind, the way Agatha's hair was flowing so freely down her back, the way it was likely tangled as a result of her day's effort.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could untangle it for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could untangle Agatha in her entirety, if Agatha would let her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, so maybe those were thoughts best saved for anywhere other than work. Alice's wasn't going to be a much better place to be having them, but at least she had a hand with her and could be quiet if she needed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kept scrolling upward, finding the very first photo Agatha had sent. Agatha had clearly laid the phone on a flat surface and set the timer so that she could take it; both of her hands were clearly in view, a display of her most powerful weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, did Rio know how powerful those weapons could be.
    </p>
    <p>
     In reverse order, the photos had been
     <em>
      hot
     </em>
     , but understanding them in context had been even hotter. It was only fucking Wedsday and she still had two more days until Agatha
     <em>
      might
     </em>
     decide to make an appearance. Sure, she'd talked her shit and spit her game, but Rio was a firm believer in the follow-through. She thought that unless you truly meant something, you simply shouldn't say it.
    </p>
    <p>
     So until Agatha showed up, Rio would tell herself she wouldn't get her hopes up. In reality, she was calculating the hours until Friday night each and every time she glanced at the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thursday morning, when Alice had rolled in per routine on her second delivery, there had been a strange look on her face. She was
     <em>
      smiling
     </em>
     , but there was a dangerous flickering of knowing in her eyes as she strode in, pushing the cart with a bounce in her step.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your girlfriend's in town, then?" Alice mused, glancing down to the body bag before her as she let herself into the autopsy room.
    </p>
    <p>
     From her place at her desk, Rio's booted feet dropped from the corner and she was on them in an instant, a scowl finding her with ease. "She's not my girlfriend," Rio reminded her sharply. She knew Alice thought she was being funny, but Rio was strict about boundaries, and she and Agatha were absolutely
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     dating.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio suddenly realized was that Alice was asking was because her second pick-up had been very indicative of Agatha's handiwork. This caused an entirely different form of umbrage to form in Rio: Agatha had sent her those fucking photos with a
     <em>
      'To get you through til the weekend xx'
     </em>
     and then she'd just... gone out and killed someone without saying anything?
    </p>
    <p>
     "And also, I'm not her babysitter. I don't get to tell her what to do, or when to do it. Nor does she run any schedule by me." The way Rio was stating each fact, she was doing it more to remind herself than she was to remind Alice, but Alice was taking it a little personally, judging by the look on her face as Rio moved to the foot of the cart and looked up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, Rio needed to find herself and recognize
     <em>
      who exactly
     </em>
     she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was a county employee. One who had developed a very strong obsession with a lethal and deadly woman. They had spent one insane night together, one that Rio could still
     <em>
      physically
     </em>
     feel the reminders of, even if they were beginning to ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was also Alice's friend and this entire charade of being selective with information was new for her and it was putting a weight on the tie between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was being a bad friend, full stop. She was letting this woman play games with her head and as a result, she was become a little snappier, a little more quick-tempered. Alice didn't deserve that out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorry, yeesh," Alice murmured as they moved the body to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Drawing in a breath, Rio's hardened expression dissipated into something that conveyed a little more guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be an asshole." Rio sighed softly and took the clipboard Alice had held out, looking at her expectantly. "I didn't know about this... I haven't talked to her since the messages yesterday. But, neither here nor there as I won't see her at least until tomorrow night, if not Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice didn't deserve any ire in this situation, as she was not a responsible party. If anything, she was the only outlet Rio had in regards to any of it, and even then, she had to be very, very careful about what she revealed. Rio wasn't a complete idiot; she knew she needed to find a way to break it to Agatha that Alice was at least aware of her presence in Rio's life, but she had no idea how Agatha would take to such news.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was like she would be angry and as such, Rio had a rather good feeling that Agatha would end up splitting and leaving her high and dry, blaming herself for every inability she had to keep an entire secret. Lying had never really been her forte and it was so obvious why in the simple fact that Alice knew as much as she did, not matter how little it truly was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, it looks like she had her hands full last night. This one actually had five little tears in his shirt where the bruising usually is. Not sure what's up with that," Aliced informed her before she backed the cart out and moved it toward the entry way by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you have another run?" Rio called as she set to the work of removing the man from the bag and getting his clothing cut off of his body.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't! Not yet! So I'm gonna eat this apple and pester you!" she called back from the office with a laugh. Rio lifted her head to see Alice through the blinds, assuming the position of boots on the desk corner that Rio had been keeping previously. She pulled the paper off the desk and began to read, giving Rio the permission to begin her work.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was about halfway through the autopsy, the man -- Jed O'Leary, by name -- was cut open and half empty with Rio's scrubs were dirty with the result of her efforts. With her hands in his chest cavity, she heard something from the next room over.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Alice, she was asking Rio a question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shit! You ordered lunch from Lou Mitchell's? What did I do to be so lucky?!"
    </p>
    <p>
     This struck Rio as odd for one primary reason: She had
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     ordered them lunch from Lou Mitchell's. In fact, she had not even thought about what she was going to be doing for lunch that day. Before she could process and offer some kind of response, she heard Alice again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey, you can't-- !" she tried, but whatever was happening that she was trying to stop happened anyway. Rio lifted her head from her work to source where the sense of distress was coming from, but what greeted her caused her stomach to pit out and drop into her toes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was standing in the doorway to her autopsy room, a bag from Lou Mitchell dangling from her fingertips. That wasn't what was most noticeable, though. The most painfully noticeable thing about Agatha right then wasn't her form fitting business attire, or the way her hair was artfully braided again. No, it was that vicious and impossibly smug grin that filled her face. It was predatory in a new fashion, one that said she was quite enjoying flexing this little...
     <em>
      whatever it was
     </em>
     between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio would be the first to admit that Agatha was displaying intense amount of moxie in those moments, but there was little Rio could do right then -- elbow deep in Agatha's latest victim -- to try and communicate all the things she needed to communicate to both of them. She needed Agatha to not say something stupid and she needed Alice to act like she had no idea who this woman was the moment she realized who this woman was.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first qualification?
    </p>
    <p>
     Out the fucking window in a heartbeat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm quite certain he looked better last night," Agatha mused right as Alice appeared in the wide doorway at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jesus fucking Christ. The following ten minutes were going to be the most painful and awkward of Rio's life and she had never wanted
     <em>
      so badly
     </em>
     for Alice's pager to sound as she did in those minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hello," Rio returned, completely ignoring Agatha's comment to seem as nonplussed and collected as she could possibly manage. "It's very kind of you to stop by..." Rio's gaze dropped to the bag and swept back up. "With lunch. Were you planning on joining me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Both Agatha and Rio were very obviously ignoring the fact that Alice had completely morphed into a golden retriever at Agatha's side, looking between them like she could see the sparks flying back and forth. If Rio didn't know any better, she was certain she could hear Alice's tail as it thumped at the ground in excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I was, but if you have company..." Agatha returned, giving the most bodacious but critical side-eye to the woman next to her. "I would be happy to leave this for the two of you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, Rio began to panic. She didn't want Agatha to leave. She wanted her to stay, to enjoy the forty-five minutes of lunch she might get with her before she had to wait at least another day until she could see her again. She was trying to be patient, trying to tame her desperation, but it wasn't proving to work out thus far.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Rio was standing there with her hands in a dead guy while having an inner war of wills for the ages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was fucking
     <em>
      bold.
     </em>
     She had some serious brass tacks to be showing up in that building at all, much less to bring Rio lunch. Those walls were crawling with law enforcement and it seemed as though Agatha had not a care in the world for that very fact. She was a brave and gutsy woman, Rio would give her that much.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was also
     <em>
      at work.
     </em>
     And having Agatha there would only serve as a distraction, but it was not one she wanted to sacrifice, especially not at the risk of Alice staying.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus, the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't want to give Alice the boot, but she wanted Agatha to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the grace of any and all Gods to ever exist, Alice seemed to pick up on the slight tension and vocalized a third option.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When you're finished, I'll run and grab myself lunch so you guys can eat together," she offered brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Inwardly Rio was fighting to keep Agatha's gaze locked with her own. She did not want Agatha to look to her side and see the absolutely devious and disastrous shit-eating grin that was canvassing Alice's entire face. She knew who she was standing next to, but Rio couldn't risk breaking her grip on Agatha's attention to deliver Alice a silent warning to keep her mouth shut without Agatha picking up on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, with that settled," Rio voiced decisively, standing stalk still until she could resume her work, "I would like it if you stayed. I should be done within about ten or fifteen minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's grin dimmed but her lips remained pulled tight in a vicious smile. She recognized easily that she had caught Rio in her snare, that she had gotten under her skin and she was eating it up. What Agatha likely did not realize was why.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had said too much. Rio always said too much, and now she was going to have to put on the show of her life until she could shoo Alice out the door. Surely, a new conversation was going to be needed, but Rio was almost confident that over the course of the following ten minutes, nothing was going to happen that would make her regret not having it sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was also an entire fucking dumbass who should have known better,
    </p>
    <p>
     The drawer clicked shut to the cooler and Rio began to strip out of her protective wear, shedding her face shield and gown to pace back into her office. The moment her foot crossed the threshold, she announced a fact that both women in that room would have known for different reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Same COD. Severed spinal cord. Another to add to the list, I suppose," Rio voiced, trying to be casual, trying to make it seem as though she were having the conversation explicitly with Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Alice had to go and speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes swept from Rio to the other woman and her mouth was moving far faster than Rio ever could have to shut her the fuck up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So how do you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh God. OH GOD.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      OHGODOHGODOHGOD.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      NONONONONONONONONOOOO!!!!!!!!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was practically screaming herself hoarse in her own head, wanting nothing more than to leap over the desk and tackle Alice to the ground. From there, Rio could have just
     <em>
      smothered
     </em>
     her and everything would have been fine.
    </p>
    <p>
     While it seemed like a viable and reasonable option, Rio's attention snapped to the chair on the far wall that Agatha was perched in. Rio watched in real time as Agatha's skin darkened and then reddened, deeper and deeper until the paleness was nothing but angry crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a total of maybe five seconds that Rio had to figure out what the fuck she was going to do. That was
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     enough time.
    </p>
    <p>
     They passed in the blink of an eye and Agatha shot up to her feet, eyes white hot and angry as she snapped her head to look across the space between them at Rio, irate and downright pissed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wait! Just give me a second -- !" Rio tried, but Agatha was lightning quick as she grabbed up the handles of the bag and whipped it forward, slinging it across the room until it hit the desk and dropped to the ground. The likely outcome there was that everything inside was ruined, just like everything inside Rio's body as Agatha snapped to the other direction and stalked toward the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started to follow, but she heard Agatha's angry question first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How the fuck do I get out of here?!" she shouted, but Rio did nothing to answer aside from pressing the button to open the doors. Agatha shot out of them like a pent up racehorse, but Rio was quick on her heels. She did
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     want to have this conversation within those walls, but she was also a little weary about following Agatha outside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside, there would likely be no filter and Rio was not thrilled with the idea that Agatha might feel she had free reign to pick Rio apart, even if she deserved it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hit the afternoon air to an empty parking lot and Rio was still close, but not within arm's reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey, can you just --" Rio tried, but Agatha cut her off.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No! I'm not doing a god damn thing for you! Are you fucking kidding me? Have you ever kept a fucking secret in your life?!" Agatha shrieked, making a charge for her Lexus as it sat parked at the far end of the lot.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I haven't told her anything more than she hasn't figured out herself! She knew, okay?" Rio attempted again, but Agatha simply waved her off. It was just a dismissal from the conversation they were having, but something deep in Rio's bones felt like it was more than that. She felt like this could very well be the reason Agatha might have been looking to run away. That was not something she had wanted out of this.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look -- Can we just... talk please?" Rio asked as she swung around the end of the car to see Agatha reaching for the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "About what?!" Agatha bellowed back, spinning on Rio to stalk toward her until they were chest-to-chest. "About what a fucking idiot I am?! About how I thought for two stupid seconds that I might have found someone I could trust? And you're just walking around like a fucking talking head with all in the world to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No!" Rio argued back, but it felt pointless. Agatha was never actually going to
     <em>
      hear
     </em>
     her. "She knows the fake name, but nothing else. But... Fuck, it's not like I expected
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     to show up at my fucking
     <em>
      job!
     </em>
     "
    </p>
    <p>
     "I was trying to be nice!" Agatha snapped back, her gaze so wickedly angry, burning so very hot with the rage she was obviously feeling. More than that, Rio saw something else: Agatha was panicking. She didn't realize that she was
     <em>
      safe
     </em>
     with the two of them, with Rio and Alice. "But clearly, not a great idea. Won't happen again."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, come on. Wait a minute!" Rio pressed as Agatha stepped away to let herself into the car. "Please don't go. Or... If you do... Come over tonight? So we can talk properly?" She was scrambling, trying to prevent Agatha from leaving. She was afraid. She was afraid that if she let Agatha drive out of that parking lot, she was never going to see her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Toss the burner," Agatha clipped at her, jerking the door open.
    </p>
    <p>
     She said it, and maybe she thought she meant it, but Rio saw something on her face that told her it was a demand made out of fear and fury. She was angry with a choice that Rio had made, one that effected them both and not just herself. She was angry that Rio didn't seem to be willing to apologize for that choice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wouldn't, either, at least not until Agatha was willing to listen to her reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she slammed the car door and turned the car on, Rio realized that she might never get to have such a conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha peeled out of the parking, leaving a frustrated and pissed off Rio alone in her wake, Rio felt like it was probable that she was never going to see Agatha again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hadn't meant to fuck this all up; telling Alice had been rather innocent in regards to intentions and yet, Agatha was all the way pissed off. She probably felt panicked, felt like she had been outed and was at risk of being caught out. Rio wasn't going to let that happen; telling Alice had been a calculated decision, one that she'd found an ability to justify after the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was all she wanted, to just tell Agatha that much, to tell her that her secret was safe with them and even respected by them, but the parking lot of a County building was not the place to be having that conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, the only place to have such a conversation would have been behind closed doors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, Rio realized that Agatha was not going to grant her such a privilege. If anything, Agatha was making it apparent that Rio should just do her best to forget her existence altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she was serious, maybe she was just angry. Whatever the case was, as Rio trudged back inside, the ominous feeling that had taken up residence within here was unlikely to vacate any time soon.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she hated it.

    <p>
     Rio wasn't mad at Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew even before Alice rushed to explain that it had been nothing more than a foot-in-mouth moment, a brief skip and time where Alice's curiosity had escaped her before she had a chance to cage it in. Rio had been guilty of the same, hadn't she? Didn't that explain how she had even crossed paths with Agatha in the first place?
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice just wanted to know, the same way Rio had, only Rio wasn't going to tell her and had made that painfully clear that afternoon on the balcony. It wasn't Rio's place and she owed Agatha that respect.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time that Rio wasn't made at Alice, she wasn't really mad at Agatha, either.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could she be? Agatha had felt trapped and cornered, like she was a step closer to losing her hold on all that she held dear. Even though she had never said it in so many words, Rio knew that this process for Agatha, this ability to enact justice beyond the walls of the law, was Agatha's holy grail. It was something that made her feel like she was doing the world a favor, a power that she got to wield and use to cull the world of all she deemed unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was only one person to be mad at in all of this, really.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was angry with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Did she still think it was rather innocuous that Alice knew what little bit she did? Of course. Alice wasn't going to sell Agatha out the first chance she got. She wouldn't do that because she knew in some way, it would sell Rio out too, even if she did not know to what extent. Despite her poor choices and mindless light stalking, Alice knew who Rio was as a person; she was a
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     person, and if she saw something in this woman? It had to be for a reason.
    </p>
    <p>
     That evening, Rio had clocked out from work and rode quietly back to Alice's in the passenger's seat. They had already said most of what there was to say back in the morgue office and as such, Rio was taking the quiet time to decide what it was she was going to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time they'd pulled into Alice's driveway, she'd made her decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm gonna pack up and grab Phin and go home," Rio stated, but she realized that there needed to be an explanation. She turned to Alice quickly who was well on her way to apologizing again. "It's not that I'm upset or angry with you. I just... think it would be better if I got out of your hair for a little bit."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio..." Alice attempted, but just looking at her, Rio could tell that Alice knew she was right.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Plus, if she's put a tracker on me at all, would be safer if I was alone," Rio attempted to joke, but it fell flat between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't have to go," Alice tried to reason. She probably thought it was pulling away, that their friendship was going to be under some strain, but that wasn't the case at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know. But I want you to have your space back. I promise, we're fine. But... I need to clean my apartment and can't keep putting it off." Now that much was absolutely true. That apartment was undoubtedly rank as fuck and it needed tending to. The longer she put it off, the worse it was going to get.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice heaved a light sigh, glancing out the windshield for a moment before she turned back to Rio. "Okay but... Please remember that my door is always open to you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew she meant it. Rio knew that deep down, Alice cared about her and wanted to see her happy. She had never meant to cause any kind of issue or give Rio any unneeded grief, but it had happened anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know. And I thank you for that. So how about before I go, I'll buy us dinner?" she posed, as if it were some sort of consolation for her deciding to abruptly pack up and essentially run away with her tail tucked between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright deal," Alice conceded, a gentle smile filling her face. It
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     touched her eyes, but Rio could tell she still gelt guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio spent the following hour doing all she could to make Alice understand that everything was fine, that Rio was not really upset with her, and that they would resume their typical shenanigans over the weekend now that her days had opened up exponentially. It wasn't a fact she was all too thrilled about, but Rio had a feeling that if she
     <em>
      tried
     </em>
     to text Agatha from the burner, it wouldn't lead her anywhere good.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had been very clear about what Rio should do with that phone and each time Rio dared listen to her tone in her head during the replay, it made her stomach knot worse than the time before it.
    </p>
    <p>
     So they'd eaten their sushi and Rio had collected her things, including Phin, and headed home. She made a stop on the way at the local Home Depot; something akin to industrial strength cleaner was going to be her only hope for cleaning the stains in her life --not just her furniture -- Agatha had left. It wasn't even about the chair anymore, it was trying to find a way to remove any trace of her if Rio hoped to keep living there.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was stupid; she shouldn't have cared. She should have simply stated that her life would be better off without the presence of a serial killer in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was a fucking lie and she knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha provided her a challenge, something to actually pick apart and understand. Agatha showed Rio what it was like to think
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     critically and still not be able to find the right answers. It was the most beautiful form of frustration, mostly because the answers
     <em>
      were
     </em>
     there, but it required a keenly sharp mind to even start to understand what they could possibly be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was different. There had never been any question about that, but it was why Rio felt so drawn to her. Not only was she deadly, but it was only in the most intelligent fashion. She had committed herself to the idea of this crusade, taken the time to mentally develop a device that had kept Rio perplexed for weeks, and moved around like a ghost in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her beauty offered a helping hand, but it was her charm that truly did the trick.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even as Rio sprayed and scrubbed and sprayed and scrubbed, she was only removing the physical traces that Agatha had left behind, not the images embedded in her brain. She could still picture, with crystal clarity, as Agatha had said poised in that damn dining chair in the middle of her living room, hand moving easily around her mouth and chin in her observation.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had obviously been beholding something she quite liked. That had been a good feeling, to be looked at, appraised,
     <em>
      watched
     </em>
     by Agatha like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     An angry grunt passed through Rio's lips as she scrubbed hard at the arm of the chair; it wasn't getting moved by only her any time soon and she wasn't ready to ask Alice for
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     kind of help. The only option was to try with all her might to baptize it with as much Kaboom! as she could possibly manage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Twenty minutes into her effort, Rio had thrown the bottle of cleaner across the room and slumped against the couch to pull out her phone and place an Amazon order for a chair cover. It was fabric, of course, as she wasn't ninety and didn't wish to have her furniture covered in plastic.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then again...
    </p>
    <p>
     No! That chair was not getting defiled ever again. She would get rid of it when the opportunity presented itself, but for now, it had to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it would forever be a memory of the time Rio rode that stupid fucking strap while Agatha rutted herself to climax right in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha might have made the choice to walk away, to leave, but the truth for Rio was that the idea of her was not going anywhere any time soon. She was indignant about it; Agatha was very clear that Rio's consequence for her poor choices was watching her walk away with the promise that she was not coming back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had seen it, that hot ire in her eyes as she had turned on Rio, her voice so loud and so commanding. If the context of the conversation had been vastly different, Rio probably would have been turned on to the point of being reduced to her knees, but she wasn't entirely void of emotion. She knew she had made a mistake and while she wished Alice wouldn't have said anything, it came down to Rio's inability to keep her mouth shut.
    </p>
    <p>
     The furniture had been scrubbed -- including the small spot on the dining room chair that Rio had almost missed -- and the sheets had been thrown into the washer. The carpet had even been vacuumed, even if Phin was pissed about it and tore around the house like some embodied version of the Tasmanian Devil. She had even given the dresser a full wipe down, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could have sucked everything in that apartment into a comically large shop-vac and it wouldn't mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those walls could have been bare, that entire apartment could have been empty, but Agatha was still there.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no way to get her out.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio woke up the following morning, the first thing she did was open the drawer to her nightstand and remove the burner, taking a deep breath that instilled a trace of hope before she lit up the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hadn't texted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stupidly, Rio had hoped she might.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew it was a long shot, and she knew even more that she didn't really deserve it. Rio had just been hoping that she could have been the one to tell Agatha, that
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     could have been the one to explain the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice wasn't an idiot and Rio let out just the tiniest sliver of too much information. Those two things together had been an unfortunate combination, but even worse when applied in the wrong setting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Work that day had started off tense, but solely because Alice still felt bad. Rio had been quick to ease those worries.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't blame you. If I wouldn't have told you, there would have been nothing to ask," she stated calmly from behind her desk as Alice stood awkwardly by the entryway. It was almost as if she thought Rio might bite her if she got any closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But... You haven't been laid in decades and I fucked that up for you," Alice half joked, half excused.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will be fine, Alice. So long as I keep my doors locked and windows closed. I don't put it past her to scale my wall like a cat in an attempt to behead me," Rio teased back, wrinkling her nose with a smile. Her eyes flickered down to the newspaper before her, then back to her friend. "Now what's a seven letter word for 'barely runs?'"
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice grinned in response, a laugh finding her for the first time that morning. "Streaks?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tapped her pen to her lips, visualizing the letters in the little blocks they should belong to. "You know what? I think you're right!"
    </p>

    <p>
     Rio's weekend was... fun?
    </p>
    <p>
     That wasn't really the word for it. She had a good time; she and Alice had more or less agreed on a bar crawl on Saturday, starting and noon and only ending when Alice was doubled over behind Roscoe's at 11pm heaving her guts out.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the grace of
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     God, Rio had managed to load her into the back of a cab that took them to Rio's apartment which, with the windows having been open most of the day, actually smelled like the strawberry and jasmine wax burner she'd turned on and forgot about before they'd set out on their adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sunday had been a day filled with nothing but recovery from the day before.  They'd laid around on the couch and ate burgers they had delivered to the apartment. They drank the remaining beers that had been in Rio's fridge for a kick of hair of the dog and it had seemed to level them out a little more. After a handful of ibuprofen each, they'd both been right as rain.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't encourage them to do anything other than lay around watching television while they scrolled through their phones, showing each other stupid memes and videos when they would come across them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe they were in their thirties and should have shown a little more maturity, but sometimes life just called for a wild weekend.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had helped quite a bit that they hadn't talked about Agatha once.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't stop Rio from thinking about her entirely, but it was more of a fleeting thought every now and again than it was something that consumed her every waking moment. Even having Alice at the apartment made it a little easier to stay distracted over fixated.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Alice left Sunday night, though, Rio plummeted pretty quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been laying on the couch, Phineas and all twenty-two pounds of his thickness were pooled on her stomach and chest, his happy purrs getting louder and louder the longer she scratched at his ears. He looked so happy and content there that it had been easy enough to pay attention to, but the moment his head dropped and he fell asleep, Rio found her gaze wandering.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it landed on that fucking chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hadn't checked the burner since Friday morning before work. It hadn't been her plan, but filling her time with Alice and shenanigans had distracted her enough that she hadn't needed to. She also hadn't needed to be hit with the rejection of an empty inbox.
    </p>
    <p>
     By Monday morning, that was out the window.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had laid on her side for several long moments after her alarm had gone off, just staring at the nightstand. She shouldn't open the drawer. She shouldn't pull out the phone. Most importantly, she
     <em>
      should not
     </em>
     check the text messages.
    </p>
    <p>
     She did all three of those things in rapid succession and was thoroughly disappointed when she found what she
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     had been awaiting her: nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's silence was shouting at Rio now, telling her to let it all go and do as she had been instructed by tossing the phone out and never thinking about Agatha again.
    </p>
    <p>
     How was that supposed to work? How was Rio supposed to just navigate away from the most fascinating human being she had ever crossed paths with? How the
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     was she supposed to forget about the woman who was not only beautiful and cunning, but could fuck like that?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was quite certain that she'd never had such an experience with another woman and it was almost impossible to scrub from her memory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Did they make a pill that could be Kaboom for her damn brain?
    </p>
    <p>
     They did, it was called cyanide.
    </p>
    <p>
     It just so happened that an unfortunate side effect was death.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio would simply live with the memories long enough until they finally faded away. She wasn't sure how long it would take, but time eventually grabbed at all things and buried them deep enough that they might only be found with intentional and purposeful thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Work had been... work. There had been nothing exciting, nothing challenging. Two OD's, one suicide by firearm, an elderly man who had suffered a heart attack, and a teenager that had quickly faced the repercussions of distracted driving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not one of them had a severed spinal cord but looked the picture of living health.
    </p>
    <p>
     None of them had been taken from the world by a swift and clean jerk of their head.
    </p>
    <p>
     No one had faced Agatha's wrath the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was off schedule again, and Rio wasn't sure if she needed to be alarmed or pissed off at herself for the scene she had inadvertently caused the week before. All she wanted was the chance to explain, for Agatha to just take the time to hear her out. Agatha wasn't the type. Rio had known that and yet, she'd still hoped for the briefest conversation, one where she could try to justify her actions, or at least offer comfort in the end result.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hadn't wanted it. She hadn't wanted to hear why Rio had put her at risk. She didn't want her hear Rio make excuses and not take accountability.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, if Rio was good at anything, it was accepting responsibility when she fucked up, intentional or not.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had made a mistake. If there was anything in the world to be done to amend for that, she would have done it. She would have taken any chance thrust at her feet, even if it meant bending the knee to Agatha and whatever it was she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tuesday morning, Rio had
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to check the burner phone, but after a twenty minute long war with herself, she had decided against it. She needed to get used to the idea that there was never going to be an incoming message. There was never going to be a little envelope on the screen to tell her that Agatha wanted her attention ever again.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was shitty, and it fucking sucked, but Rio knew that there was little to be done over it. Even if she tried to text Agatha, it was highly unlikely to garner a response and Rio felt that she had done enough damage to Agatha's sense of certainty as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, ignoring her own impulses was to benefit someone else. This time, Rio could cap her self restraint if it meant making Agatha's life a little easier when she'd already mucked up so much.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tuesday at work had been more of the same. It was her job, and it was something she knew she could do well, but Rio was suddenly bored by any incomprehensible standard. Nothing felt challenging or perplexing. Nothing made her feel excited about the fact that she was at work. Maybe that line of thought was fucked up in and of itself; death and determining its cause should not have been
     <em>
      exciting
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was when Agatha was in the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
     By Wednesday, Rio was beginning to feel like she was being tortured. It all seemed so mundane, so dull in comparison to what had come before. Alice was succeeding in keeping her spirits up, but Rio was still haunted by the ghost of Agatha and simply wished that she would just choose to come back.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio had clocked out at the end of the day and collected her things, she should have been annoyed at the lack of any man who came in with a severed spinal cord, but instead she was just sad.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been a week.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had left. Packed up. Vacated. Disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was likely onto the next highly populated city that she could disappear within to skulk around and claim an entirely new subset of victims.
    </p>
    <p>
     It meant that Chicago was no longer her home. All because Rio had opened her big mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     That evening, Rio had returned from the market with a week's worth of groceries and an extra bag of cat treats. While she put everything away, she turned on her speaker and threw on some random mix of songs that had no true theme or purpose, simply a compilation that Spotify thought she would enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three songs in, it wasn't wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was enjoying herself as she shimmied around her kitchen, stowing things and then preparing to start her dinner for the evening of tostadas with black beans, corn, avocado and her own specially crafted and blended salsa.
    </p>
    <p>
     The music filled her ears, every beat reinvigorating her more than the one before it. Because it was
     <em>
      all
     </em>
     that filled her ears, she could hear little else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like the perpetual ringing of inbound calls and incessant dings of incoming messages to the burner phone that was shoved in the back of her nightstand drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was content for what felt like the first time a week. It was also the first time in a week that she had been able to stop thinking about Agatha long enough to accomplish something with purpose. It felt
     <em>
      good.
     </em>
     Her life was slowly getting back to normal, one boring day at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Would she miss the thrill and excitement? Of course. Would she miss the insane sex? Even more. But, Rio would keep moving forward as she always did in life, knowing she simply did not have any other option.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finishing dinner, she shut the speaker off and migrated to the living room so that she could eat while Nightwatch played in the background, an episode she'd selected because it was her favorite. One of the EMTs, Holly, was dealing with a man who was heavily intoxicated. In speaking with him, he tells her that he's chosen to drink so much because it was the anniversary of his daughter's death.
    </p>
    <p>
     Holly's dialogue over it had always intrigued her; it was a lengthy monologue about human connection, about the desire to just be seen. It was an echoing of things that had passed through Rio's mind a time or two in her life, more frequently since she had met Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     This woman had been running most of her life. Sure, there was still so fucking much that Rio did not know, but she knew enough to understand that Agatha knew not what stillness was. She didn't plant roots, didn't land anywhere for too long. When she got spooked, she just took off and started somewhere new.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wondered where that Somewhere New might be for her now.
    </p>
    <p>
     After eating and washing up, Rio was right back on the couch with Phin wrapped up in a tight ball on her abdomen, another episode of the show popping on automatically after the previous one had ended.
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, Rio was getting tired.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been a long week and there were still two days left in it, two days where she was going to turn up and work and be reminded of Agatha
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     as Rio was starting to get her out of her head. At home, surprisingly, it was easier. But that was only because at work, she couldn't help but wonder about every body Alice brought in, waiting for her to announce that Agatha had made her triumphant return.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't going to happen. That was the reality now. There was no more pining, no more hoping, no more wishing. Agatha existing in Rio's world as any more than a figment of her imagination was an impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was gone, period.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio...
     <em>
      missed her?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Gross.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      couldn't
     </em>
     miss Agatha. Agatha wasn't hers to miss. Never had been, never would be.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio couldn't help but wish she would just... show up.
    </p>
    <p>
     After three more episodes, Rio had started to doze. It was a exhaustion that came from both the physical act of not sleeping well and the emotional wringer she had been putting herself through since Agatha's departure. Slumber had seeped in, almost completely pulling her under when something loud and incessant startled her awake.
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas leapt off of her stomach, nearly ripping up the carpet in an attempt to take off toward her bedroom and his massive cat cave that was tucked inside the closet. Whatever the intrusion on their night was -- at nearly eleven -- he wanted absolutely nothing to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio careened back into consciousness, she realized what the sound was: someone was knocking on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, they weren't just
     <em>
      knocking.
     </em>
     They were
     <em>
      fucking pounding.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The jump-start back into alertness had been enough to send her heart racing, but the moment she realized how much force was being applied to every swing at the door, her stomach completely bottomed out of her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why the fuck was someone at her front door, beating it down with urgency? There were no calls, no cries for help. Whoever it was, they were not trying to make themselves known in any way and for that very reason, Rio considered the possibility that she needed to call the police. Whoever it was, they could be angry. They could try to hurt her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, the pounding stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
     A voice came through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio, open the fucking door. Please!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Holy shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     HOLY SHIT.
    </p>
    <p>
     That sounded almost
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     like Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no fucking way in any universe that -- a week after she had walked away and told Rio to piss up a rope -- Agatha was standing on the other side of that door, practically trying to beat it off its hinges.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Or at least answer the fucking burner! I know you didn't throw it away!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was causing an entire fucking scene in the middle of Rio's hallway and there was only one way to get her to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although there was no need to sprint across the living room, Rio did it anyway. She got to the door and pulled so hard to open it that she was sure she bent a hinge.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, looking pristine, if not a little drunk, stood Agatha, clad in an impossibly beautiful silver evening gown with a portion of her hair pinned back while the rest of it flowed down her back and over her shoulders, passing the top hem of the dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh! Rio!" she chirped, snapping into a completely horizontal position, though it was only a couple of inches off from where she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hi, Agatha... I just --"
    </p>
    <p>
     She just what? Woke up? Wanted to say she was sorry? Wanted to grovel for the mistakes she had made? Wanted to drag Agatha in and peel her out of that dress?
    </p>
    <p>
     None of it mattered because, just like history repeating, Agatha grabbed her face and pulled her in for a kiss that tasted of little other than gin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stunned for the longest moment, Rio didn't know how to respond. She just... let Agatha kiss her. After seeing her so angry the last time they'd been in one another's presence, Rio had never thought she would be met with this kind of opportunity again in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, reality kicked in. Agatha didn't appear to be sloppy drunk, but that pink tint to her cheeks gave away that she felt buzzed, if nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Do you want to come in?"
     </em>
     Rio whispered against her lips, still not having found the wherewithal to actually return the exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even before Agatha stepped into her and kicked the door shut behind her, the part of Rio that had been trying so fucking hard to forget about Agatha and everything included knew she was going to regret asking.
    </p>

   <div>
    <p>
     Rio knew this wasn't a good idea, if for no other reason than the fact that it had taken Agatha even a bit of liquid courage to show up after a week of no contact. She had actually convinced Rio that it wasn't going to happen, that she was long gone. Rio had started to believe it, started to understand that she was staring at the biproduct of her own recklessness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was measured, cold, calculated. Everything Agatha did, she did with a purpose. Or, at least that had been the case until that particular moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     In
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     moment? Agatha's hands were on her face and all she seemed capable of doing was kissing her. She didn't seem like she wanted to talk, but Rio felt like it wasn't fair of Agatha to just barge in again and fuck her on every horizontal surface that was readily available in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, Rio tried.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled away the moment she felt Agatha's tongue pressing past her lips. All it did was deepen the redness on Agatha's cheeks, those crackling baby blues flying open in her petulance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, wait. I --"
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't matter. The half-baked request died the moment Agatha consumed it, placing her mouth aggressively to Rio's. Her intention was to stifle the sound, to silence any objections to her physical needs, but again Rio wasn't ready to let it go so easily. She wasn't some booty call, some piece of ass that would just bend over and put out because Agatha wanted her to.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Ha! Yeah fucking right.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That was absolutely what she was, but she was a piece of ass who wanted to have a conversation about the fact that they had parted angry. Well, that Agatha had been angry. Rio had just felt like an entire dumbass.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, Agatha's tongue made it into her mouth. She still tasted like gin, but it wasn't overpowering as if she had been pounding back drinks for hours. It was something more like the need to ebb nerves and urges.
    </p>
    <p>
     The gin must have been gone, then, because Agatha's hands were on Rio's body and she seemed to be indulging each and every urge that was popping up in her mind. Rio could have gotten carried away, could have let herself melt like hot wax in the palm of Agatha's hand, but she knew she had to at least put forth another effort to thrust a stopper in Agatha's passion long enough for the two of them to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gentler this time, Rio pulled her head back, effectively disconnecting Agatha from the thing she seemed to want most.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha --" and for the third time, she struck out. Agatha was kissing her again, hot and hungry like she'd been starved of such a delicacy for far too long.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio really
     <em>
      didn't
     </em>
     want to stop her. She didn't want Agatha to stop kissing her like that, like she had to taste every inch of Rio there was available. She wanted to feel the rush as Agatha stripped her out of her stupid cut-up t-shirt and shorts that she'd had since she played volleyball in high school.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio needed Agatha to
     <em>
      listen
     </em>
     first.
    </p>
    <p>
     That might have been more of a feat to accomplish since Agatha had apparently been consuming alcohol at whatever event had her dressed to the teeth in that breathtaking gown. It was insanely heinous just how good she looked in formalwear and also felt a little unfair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let it linger, let the kiss last for
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     a beat longer than she should have as Agatha pressed her back further into the apartment. Knowing what was snowballing her way, Rio
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     to pause. Both of her hands lifted from the automatic placing they had found on Agatha's sides and lifted to her biceps, gripping gently as she gave one last valiant effort at breaking the kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she succeeded, Agatha did not look happy. She was so unhappy that she did not give Rio time to speak, as was becoming normal for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you wanna fuck?" Agatha snapped, her scowl as dangerous as the tone she was using. Her hand lifted inside of Rio's caged hold, her thumb jerking back toward the door. "I can leave." The threatening tilt of her lips into a conniving smirk had Rio's stomach doing backflips to tie itself into a knot.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't want Agatha to leave. But she also did not want to fuck Agatha eighty-nine different ways all over that apartment if Agatha wasn't willing to hear her out first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I do," Rio managed back, slightly winded from Agatha's initiation of such an aggressive make-out session. "But I have something I need you to hear first."
    </p>
    <p>
     That glassy look in Agatha's eyes didn't really fade as she rolled them, but Rio knew what was coming even before Agatha tried to step away from her. In accordance with the panic she felt at the thought, Rio held her arms tighter, keeping her right where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let me go," Agatha growled, but she made no move to fight against Rio's grip.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No. Just listen."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't want to hear you say or do anything that isn't my name in a moan," Agatha spat back, trying to duck down to take a kiss that Rio would hopefully not break.
    </p>
    <p>
     It never got a chance to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you want to fuck me angry six ways 'til Sunday, that's fine," Rio argued as she ducked her head away from the contact. "But you have to listen to me first."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could see it, the need Agatha had to turn and sprint away as fast as she could in those heels.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, I'm
     <em>
      sorry.
     </em>
     "
    </p>
    <p>
     At this, Agatha just... blinked. She looked like Rio had smacked her across the fact with a leather belt, pink-cheeked and all (even if the other matched). For the briefest moment, Rio found herself wondering if Agatha had
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     heard anyone apologize to her in her entire life. Before she could even consider voicing such a question, Agatha jerked back, breaking Rio's hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Don't,"
     </em>
     she hissed sharply, that look of shock quickly morphing into a scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm serious," Rio returned. "I violated your trust, and I genuinely am sorry for that. But I also need you to know that I wouldn't have let slip the
     <em>
      tiny
     </em>
     bit I did if I thought it could endanger you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha appeared to be listening, but Rio could no longer feel her skin beneath her fingertips to know if she was trembling even the slightest bit or not. She still didn't look thrilled with the revelation, but she also did not appear as though she was going to start spitting nails in her anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not saying we will ever cover for you -- well, at least Alice won't -- but you have two people who... Who have figured out enough to know why you do it. And... Let's just say for me it could be morbid curiosity, but for Alice it... It goes a little deeper than that. She's not going to rat you out, I promise." Rio knew she wasn't relaying what she meant the best way possible, but the words she needed to be more concise were simply not finding her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Full lips worried for a moment as she considered; maybe spilling all of Alice's beans wasn't the
     <em>
      best
     </em>
     play, but offering Agatha a small sliver in the same respect she'd given it to Alice wasn't the worst idea Rio ever had.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alice's best friend in college was a victim of domestic abuse. She did not make it out in time, despite Alices best efforts to get her away from him. So..." Rio let a soft sigh escape through her nose, though her stare had not left Agatha. "You're the embodiment of someone she could simply never be, but probably wishes she could."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's blue eyes were darting over Rio's features, scrutinizing every single micro expression she might be emitting. But Rio was calm. She was still, placid. Not a ripple of uncertainty touched a muscle in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let it settle, let Agatha fully grasp what it was she was attempting to convey. Then, Agatha finally spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why was it so important for you to tell me that?" she asked sharply, brow still furrowed, though her scornful demeanor was beginning to melt, little by little.
    </p>
    <p>
     Didn't Agatha get it? Didn't she see what Rio was trying to do?
    </p>
    <p>
     She was trying to offer comfort and whatever peace-of-mind she could. She was trying to tell Agatha that both herself and Alice knew that murder was inherently
     <em>
      bad
     </em>
     , but there
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     be moral qualifiers that made it... less bad.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because," Rio began, taking a step closer, shaving off a bit of space between them. "I needed you to hear me tell you that you're not in danger here. And... I don't want to see you storm off so fucking angry again and not know if you're ever going to come back."
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it was stupid to admit something so soft, but there was another underlying admission there: Rio's attachment had not weakened in the least. Whatever this fascination was that she had developed for the stunningly beautiful woman before her, it wasn't going anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't like it was
     <em>
      emotional.
     </em>
     Not only would Rio fight to keep herself from catching a bad case of the feelings, but she also had a strong inkling that Agatha would
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     be the type to let her emotions dictate anything she did in life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even more than that, anyone who went on date with Agatha usually ended up dead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Granted, Rio knew deep down that Agatha did not have any nominal amount of attraction toward the men she went on dates with. Could they really have even been called 'dates' when they were nothing more than Agatha tenderizing and playing with her food? They served a purpose, more than their intended one, but there was no need for connection for Agatha. Staying
     <em>
      disconnected
     </em>
     was actually the most vital part for her, they key to what made her so successful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the flurry of thoughts blowing around Rio's mind, what felt like ten minutes was maybe thirty seconds. Agatha was just standing there, digesting everything that Rio had just provided her with. She hadn't consumed it willingly, but she had stayed long enough to listen. If she still chose to leave, there was nothing Rio could do to stop her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt like standing on a bed of needles, waiting for Agatha to do
     <em>
      anything
     </em>
     that would provide an answer as to whether or not this was already over. It felt agonizing to wait, but the reward that came immediately after was well worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't a slow person; she was observant and studious in most situations. Nothing about possessing those traits would have ever prepared her for the complete bolt of speed Agatha became when she surged forward and lifted her hands, grappling onto Rio's jaw with pressured fingertips.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wouldn't have prepared her for the violent way their lips smashed together, Agatha's hot and needy desire tasting as sweet as mead on the tip of Rio's tongue. It did still taste like gin, too, but it was very quickly overpowered by the intensity of the sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha might have been drunk earlier in the night -- as Rio would discover when she checked the messages Agatha had been sending to the burner phone -- but right then, she wasn't as hammered as Rio had initially surmised. She was tipsy, at the very least, but it was clear in the way Agatha was nearly clawing at her jaw that she was in control of her own faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha was kissing her made Rio wonder if maybe Agatha had doubts or regrets about the week-long disappearing act she had pulled. It was a brief thought, one that floated away the very second Agatha's razor-sharp bite sank into her bottom lip. With the rush of dopamine that Rio hadn't felt in some time came a low moan. With little other hesitation, Rio was throwing herself into the kiss, and into Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Toned arms raised and secured around Agatha's neck, giving Rio the leverage she needed to pull herself closer, to press her t-shirt to the front of that jewel-encrusted brassiere of Agatha's dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     All she wanted was to be closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     The move forced Agatha to shift, her hands dropping from Rio's face to first land on her waist, and then slid around; one hand stationed itself between her shoulder blades and the other found the small of her back, holding her steady so that Agatha keep kissing her as long as she so chose.
    </p>
    <p>
     What had been lips and teeth turned to lips and teeth and tongue. Rio wasn't a
     <em>
      loud
     </em>
     person, but there were the slightest shifts, the tiniest decisions that Agatha made that pulled quiet moan after quiet moan from the hollows of Rio's throat. It happened when the hand on the small of Rio's back slid lower, grip firm and heavy on the left side of her ass, like Agatha was trying to pull her closer. It happened almost every time Agatha's tongue traced a line over the roof of her mouth, right down the center. It even happened when Agatha's hand felt around like there would be a bra strap to unhook, smoothing out again once no purchase was found.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know if she could
     <em>
      get
     </em>
     any closer without crawling inside Agatha's skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     That didn't sound like the world's worst idea, truth be told.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite pulling her closer, Agatha initiated a relocation. Her legs were moving, one purposely landing between Rio's so that she could step forward, pressing Rio backward. With little thought, Rio fell in-step -- or, rather, in-shuffle -- with her, it was as if Agatha knew exactly where she was going. She was shifting Rio, backing her to the left just enough that it only took a few more steps to get them to her intended destination.
    </p>
    <p>
     Artfully, Agatha's mouth had not stopped working the entire time. That tongue was
     <em>
      starved
     </em>
     as it consumed all that was within reach and those lips were already making Rio's own feel raw in the best way.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the lower part of Rio's ass made contact with the edge of a table, a surprised squeal sounded. Rio had not actually known where it was Agatha had been steering her, but she found herself delighted that Agatha seemed to not give a single fuck about trying to make it to the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a precision that Rio would have likely thought impressive had she not had her tongue shoved down Agatha's throat, Agatha's hips pinned hers roughly to the table. Instead of finding it impressive, she just felt turned on, and it showed as she jerked her head back, only to drop it to Agatha's shoulder. Realizing the opportunity she now had in front of her, Rio's teeth sank into Agatha's skin. A smirk wanted so desperately to form, but the mouth full of skin and muscle prevented it from happening at the guttural and pitched moan Agatha released.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a little more thought to be had now that she wasn't entirely focused on their kiss, Rio's hips attempted to press forward. The moment Agatha sensed her intention, her own were thrusting right back, digging the edge of the table into the pliable flesh of Rio's asscheeks. It hurt, but in the most exhilarating way.
    </p>
    <p>
     For never having been loud, that sure felt like nothing more than a folk tale; every single thing Agatha was choosing to do was plucking whimper after moan straight from Rio, leaving her wanting more than anything for Agatha to simply make up her mind and get naked.
    </p>
    <p>
     It appeared as though getting to Rio's body was higher on her priorities list.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her hips firmly locked in place, Rio had nowhere to go -- not that she would have wanted to -- the moment Agatha's hands were removed from her body. They lifted and did not land again, but instead flew to the hem of Rio's shirt, bunching it up quickly. With the way Rio had taken to kissing at her neck, it was likely she suddenly felt an urge to move a little faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha leaned back enough to pull the shirt over Rio's head but still kept her hips fixed in place was a display of her physicality and Rio wanted nothing more than to see her do that naked. At that point in time, she didn't exactly have the words to say as much. Instead, outstretched fingers hooked into the top of Agatha's dress, pulling her back in for another kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was still hot, almost furious with Agatha's aggression, but Rio didn't care. Agatha could kiss her until her lips started bleeding. Even then, if she told Agatha to keep going, she probably would have. The freak she was, the taste of Rio's blood on the tip of her tongue would probably make her spontaneously combust.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling Agatha's fingers nimbly tucking into the waist of her shorts, Rio's own hands were moving, traversing her sides to the back of her dress. The moment she caught hold of the small dangle of the zipper, Rio gave it a pull, loosening the hold the dress had been maintaining on Agatha's lithe and slender frame.
    </p>
    <p>
     It truly was a beautiful dress, remarkable in its craftmanship, but Rio didn't give a fuck about it right then. She wanted it gone instantly, a cloud of smoke instead of the effort it would take to get Agatha out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once again, Agatha's plans seemed to lie elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     The very second Rio's arms retracted, Agatha let up the pressure she had been maintaining so that she could slip the shorts, as well as Rio's boy short underwear, down her legs. When they were nothing more than a pool at her ankles, Rio had been anticipating Agatha to pin her to the table again. Instead, Agatha bent enough that she could grab hold of the backs of Rio's thighs, lifting and then pushing so that bare ass met cold polished wood.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the second time with Agatha between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just in a different room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, Rio made a desperate grab for Agatha's dress, one that was afforded with more give because of how it had been unzipped previously. This time, finding her voice was a possibility, even if it was rough and low.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Off. Want it off,"
     </em>
     she commanded, but it was met with a dancing of amused lights in Agatha's eyes, a sneer curling up her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Making demands, are we?" Agatha returned, her own voice close to a growl.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could feel every single place Agatha was touching her, everywhere that skin met skin and skin met fabric. She wanted the fabric gone, wanted every inch of skin on skin she could get. She was greedy, needy, and there wasn't going to be a moment where she got her fill of the enigma who's dress was currently brushing tauntingly against Rio's core.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I can ruin it with the way you're standing,"
     </em>
     Rio offered, a smirk finding her.
     <em>
      "But trust me, cum stains aren't the easiest to remove if they're deep enough."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked both horrified and turned on at the same time; the thought of ruining a multi-thousand dollar dress was likely not an enticing one, but apparently Rio discussing deep cum stains had upped the wattage on Agatha's horniness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having no time to catch up, Agatha separated their bodies and was hasty in her removal of the garment, stepping between Rio's knees once more. There was something in her gaze, though, as it dropped to Rio's chest, finally seeming to catch sight of the ink there.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tipsy part of Agatha reared its head as she asked a curious question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Was that there last time?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know whether she wanted to laugh or scream, so she did neither and shot a hand up instead, tangling it in Agatha's hair to pull her in for another sweltering kiss, one that had Rio sinking like a stone. That feeling only intensified as Agatha's hand moved between them, her fingers skating over the skin between Rio's breasts and a bit lower, the spot where the ink resided.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a dash of hilarity to be found in the fact that Rio had fucked herself to three different orgasms right in front of Agatha and she had been too focused on other things to have a loggable memory of seeing it. Regardless of her previous perception, it made Rio
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     something to be under the scrutiny of Agatha's touch, especially when her tongue was half-way in Agatha's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stepped closer and pulled Rio a bit more toward the edge of the table, skin meeting skin again in the most beautiful and euphoric union, a weak whimper sounding low in Rio's throat. One of her hands remained tangled in Agatha's hair while the other paced up and down the length of Agatha's side.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss wore on, never lowering in intensity, for several long moments. Agatha would rock her hips forward -- though Rio was not entirely certain it was a conscious choice -- and bump against her desperate and wanting cunt, and every time Rio felt as though she were toeing her way closer and closer toward the mouth of a volcano, ready to dive in and burn up without regard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's lips were the one to part, though their hunger was insatiable for the taste of Rio's flesh, kissing her jaw, and then her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     When her hand found Rio's middle again, Rio was somehow aware that Agatha was gracing the same place she had been before. It was the lightest caress, but it did not stay for long. It began to travel lower, dropping between the tiny pocket of space she created when she shifted her hips back.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio felt Agatha's touch, first around her outer labia and then deeper, into dripping heat, one that was far more intense than Rio had been aware of.  Her head dropped back, a pathetic whimper passing through her lips as her hips shifted to try and gain immediate access to more contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha
     <em>
      made
     </em>
     her aware the moment she breathed the most devious chuckle over the skin of Rio's neck just before she nipped at it. The provocative muttering that followed first sent a chill up Rio's spine and also caused a pit to form in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Were you about to fuck yourself before I got here?"
     </em>
     she rasped, tracing the tip of her tongue up the side of Rio's neck in a way that caused her whole body to tense in anticipation. It grazed the lobe of her ear before those carnivorous fangs sank right into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "No!"
     </em>
     Rio yelped back and while it didn't
     <em>
      sound
     </em>
     honest, it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Hmm,"
     </em>
     Agatha hummed, lips pressing to the shell of Rio's ear as she continued.
     <em>
      "It's cute that you're dripping from a make out session. You always so easy or is it all for me?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned in response, but she chose not to dignify it with an articulate answer. She wasn't quite ready to damage her own pride that way.  What she chose to do in direct opposition was turn her head so that she could attempt to kiss Agatha to get her to shut the fuck up.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't work, but only because Agatha was already pulling away. The hand that now bore two wet fingers raised and surfed up Rio's body, gliding over her abdomen, over that tattoo, right between her breasts until it found the place Rio thought Agatha's hand should
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     be: around her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no immediate grip, much to Rio's disappointment, but there was a different kind of pressure in its place. Agatha was pushing her, pushing her backward. Catching the hint, Rio complied, laying with her back flat to the cool table. Her skin flared with goosebumps and her breath caught.
    </p>
    <p>
     It did it again when Agatha leaned over her, the tips of her hair gracing Rio's skin in the most chilling fashion. It was hot and yet, it sent shivers everywhere, including right between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been of the impression that Agatha's intent was to kiss her, but she quickly realized that they were long past that. What Agatha chose to do worsened that deprived aching and pulsing sourced right from her pussy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha dropped her head and kissed Rio directly between her breasts. The first kiss was firm, but it was just a showing that Agatha was there, a waving of hello before she began to wreak her havoc.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kissing, licking, biting, and sucking that followed over the course of the next five minutes had Rio writhing beneath such scrutiny, though the moans that broke from her were encouraging enough to detract from her appeared attempt at escape. The wriggling and squirming only seemed to be egging Agatha on. Her bites were sharper -- even to a point where Rio thought a couple of times that she might have broken skin -- and she was certain that the hickeys Agatha was taking her time to leave would end up a deep and dark purple.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's lips were brushing over skin until she found one of Rio's nipples and pulled it between her lips, sucking softly. The way her tongue laved at it with intention had Rio whining like a pathetic and sad bitch in heat, begging to just be fucked already.
    </p>
    <p>
     With one last taunting swipe of her tongue, Agatha decided to resume her prowling of the luscious landscape of Rio's body, now covered in dark spots and the tiniest ruts left from the dentition Agatha possessed. Her lips ventured lower, taking a moment to pay special attention to the ink that was forever impressed to Rio's abdomen. She took a swipe at it, too, before kissing even lower.
    </p>
    <p>
     Choosing that particular moment to stall left Rio feeling as though her skin was crawling with her utter desperation, her stomach a tumultuous pit of burning fire. She was squirming again and although Agatha's hands had raised to hold her hips still, Rio fought against her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted
     <em>
      more.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha found humor in her pathetic neediness, blowing a huff of hot air against Rio's stomach with her snide chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Someone's a little desperate,"
     </em>
     she snickered mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hands had been restless throughout the process, laying on the table, pressing to her forehead, gripping at the breast Agatha hadn't been paying attention to. At Agatha's words, she knew a good place for one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     It almost felt like muscle memory, the way Rio's hand found Agatha's hair and gripped at it hard, securing a good handful tightly in her fist. With that hold, she leaned up
     <em>
      just enough
     </em>
     to tug Agatha's head back before she pressed down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shouldn't have been surprised, but when Agatha resisted the hold only to look up at her from beneath her brow, gaze bright and vicious and a sneer to match?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You want me to eat you out?"
     </em>
     she questioned, her voice so sharp Rio felt as though Agatha could have flayed her alive with her taunting alone.
     <em>
      "Oh, pretty girl, I might drown down there."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Should have brought your fucking snorkel, then, huh?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Thankfully, such a thought did not leave the house, clamped down and completely shuttered away from making an appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio half-snapped, half-groaned.
     <em>
      "If you don't get to work, I'll shove you into one of those fucking chairs and rut on you until you need a fucking squeegee to clean it off."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed again, or at least she tried, but it would up sounding like a half-strangled moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oooh, that is pretty tempting. But... Will you get your friend out and let me watch instead?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Exasperated, Rio dropped back to the table, her head landing with a soft 'thud' at the same time she groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha! Fuck me!"
    </p>
    <p>
     The instantaneous grin Agatha sported was too bright with how ferocious it was, causing Rio's heart to pound in about eight different spots she could actively assess. The most powerful one wasn't in her chest. No, it was inches away from Agatha's mouth and that fucking downright evil grin she was wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "All you had to do was say the magic words, beautiful."
    </p>

    <p>
     Agatha was moving, and quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled away, hissing when Rio did not immediately release her hair, pulling on it by accident. Rio did not giggle, did not find it cute. No, that pointed and dissatisfied look Agatha threw in her direction only made her wish Agatha would hurry the fuck up with whatever it was she needed to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, her heels.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had backed up enough that she could bend over to unfasten the straps to kick them off. Once she had managed that, those hungry eyes lifted to traverse the length of Rio's body, eating her up one square inch of skin at a time. The way Agatha looked at her, the way she was so studious of every blemish, every hickey and bite mark left, it made Rio feel invincible.
    </p>
    <p>
     This wild, dangerous, impossibly
     <em>
      hot
     </em>
     woman was looking at her like she'd be well-fed for days after she finally got a taste of what Rio wanted her so desperately to have.
    </p>
    <p>
     That stare of assessment lasted a little too long for Rio's liking. A forearm raised off the table, hand landing on her stomach before it began to inch lower. The very second Agatha gauged the movement, she was smacking Rio's hand away, a sharp
     <em>
      tsk tsk tsk
     </em>
     sounding in disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hands to yourself," Agatha admonished. Both of her hands landed on the tops of Rio's thighs, squeezing in a display of just how strong her grip alone was. Any harder and there would have likely been ten finger-sized bruises every single spot that Agatha pressed into her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Agatha, please,"
     </em>
     Rio whined, her hips shifting despite the awkward pressure on her thighs.
     <em>
      "I'm begging you."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't looking at her, head having fallen back to the table in annoyance that she could feel that utterly painful thrumming between her legs. It was a good thing, because the look that fell on her features, wicked and delighted, would have given her a heart attack.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're
     <em>
      begging
     </em>
     , are you?" she purred, the sinister amusement so prevalent in the tone of voice she chose to you.
    </p>
    <p>
     With effort, Rio's head picked up off the table, her piteous gaze landing on Agatha, bare and beautiful between her knees. She was grinning
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     fucking wide that Rio was almost certain she was in pain, and if she was, she only enjoyed it and tried to grin even wider to increase the hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I am. Please, Agatha. Need to feel you."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That string of words, coupled with the desperation dripping off of them, set something ablaze within Agatha. She did not hesitate or tease another moment longer, dropping to the floor on her knees. Her hands were moving, repositioning Rio's legs in a way that would better accommodate what it was she was hoping to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no more banter, no more backtalk, not when Agatha turned her head to kiss the inside of Rio's left thigh, once, twice, thrice until --
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment her warm and ravenous mouth made contact with Rio's soaked and desperate core, Rio's hand was back in her hair again, back arching off of the table in reflex to the immediate assault on every nerve located there. She was even aware as Agatha brought one hand up to caress and massage around the outside of the space she was beginning to consume happily. Her fingers would part, two on each side, pressing and rubbing to offer additional stimuli.
    </p>
    <p>
     It occurred to Rio that herself and Agatha had not found themselves in such an entanglement during their previous rendezvous. By the moan Agatha let loose after the first pass of her tongue, Rio had a feeling Agatha might have found herself of the mindset 'the riper the berry, the sweeter the juice,' but such a musing was never going to find form in words.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Rio's fingers gripped a little tighter at Agatha's hair, but no additional pressure was applied. She did lift her hips, but it only made Agatha moan again, louder that time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sounds, the physical vibrations, the way she could still feel Agatha's hand working over her skin, occasionally tugging enticingly on the hairs there, it almost felt like too much, but Rio wouldn't have ever tapped out. Not when Agatha's mouth on her body felt like
     <em>
      that.
     </em>
     In fact, if her nervous system shut down as a result of not being able to tolerate any more pleasurable impetuses, it would have been
     <em>
      the
     </em>
     way to go out.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Ohhh, fuck, yes!"
     </em>
     Rio gasped, back arching and hips shifting again as she tugged at Agatha's hair again, this time in a demand that came unspoken. She wanted more, wanted the
     <em>
      most.
     </em>
     What she wanted was for Agatha to utilize that hand for other things than stimulating the outside of her body. Rio wanted it
     <em>
      inside
     </em>
     , but she had a suspicion that demanding, or even asking as much would be met with smug resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had found a pace that seemed to work for herself and also seemed to be eliciting the most vocal response from Rio, a quaking moan trembling its way out each time she finished a delectable lick with the quickest flick of her tongue against Rio's clit. By the fourth time, Rio's pressure on the back of Agatha's head wasn't intentional or even a conscious action. She just simply couldn't get enough, couldn't feel enough of Agatha in any way imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cognizant of Rio's need, Agatha switched tactics, her lips pursing and sucking at Rio's clit. Once more, Rio was a perfect geometric arch as her shoulder blades slid along the smooth wood beneath them, her thighs tensing but not quite enough to pin Agatha's head between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "M-More! More of that!"
     </em>
     Rio squealed through the deliberate kitten licks Agatha began to make use of directly against her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was a live wire right then, sparking from every single inch of skin she possessed, but especially every wet and hot part of her that was in direct contact with Agatha's tongue and lips and teeth. It was as if she were caught in a lightning storm and every strike was finding its way to her every single time Agatha made a pass at her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hand that was not threaded into Agatha's now-tangled mane slid up from where it had been resting on Rio's stomach, fingers finding a stiff nipple with ease to pinch and pull at. When
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     was the one to rumble out a low, loud moan, Rio's head snapped up in attention, a reaction she hadn't been in complete control of.
    </p>
    <p>
     What met her was that electric blue stare, dancing with that predatory glimmer as Agatha got exactly what she had been wanting. The sheer impact of the eye contact on Rio's dopamine receptors was insane and caused her to release a deep and disbelieving groan. It duplicated when she noticed something she had not before.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     it, the way Agatha's shoulder was shifting beneath her right leg, but it was too miniscule of a tidbit to have garnered any attention. What she
     <em>
      saw,
     </em>
     though, nearly made her cum on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not only was Agatha staring her down, tongue still deliberate in its ministrations, but she was
     <em>
      fingering herself
     </em>
     at the same fucking time. Oh, the absolute audacity she had to deprive Rio of giving her her first orgasm of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey --
     <em>
      Ohhh, fuck, Agatha! No!"
     </em>
     Rio attempted in protest, but it was of no use; she was too close to the edge that the entire set of circumstances had tipped her
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     all the way over. And then, the very exact and precise movement of Agatha's tongue coupled with the way she released a volumous and wild moan -- presumably as she had fucked herself to orgasm -- caused Rio's own orgasm to slam into her like a fully loaded freight train.
    </p>
    <p>
     It literally took her breath away, a final gasp being the last sound she made for several long seconds as her entire body tensed... and then that delicious pleasure washed over her, lapping at her wave after wave.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio finally remembered what it was to have to breathe, she drew in a sharp breath that left only by way of a long and deep moan, her fingers still flexed into the back of Agatha's scalp, even if she'd stop trying to push her down minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Agatha sat back on her heels, eyes still fixed into Rio's, her hand raised from between her legs to hesitate in front of her, lips curling into a devilish smirk. As Rio watched -- somehow still managing to hold her head up despite herself -- Agatha's lips parted and her two middle fingers tucked inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was holding her breath again, watching as Agatha got the first opportunity to know what they tasted like
     <em>
      together.
     </em>
     Her lip jutted in a pout, brow furrowing as she struggled to push herself up, muscles still limp in her post-orgasmic haze.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're an asshole," Rio grumbled. "You couldn't even wait?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha still looked like the cat who robbed the cradle, but she scooted forward on her knees an inch or two.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Quit whining," Agatha chastised, though she still looked predatory with that threatening glint in her eyes. "I'm not finished."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, alright then.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could quit whining for
     <em>
      that.
     </em>
     And whatever it entailed.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that didn't mean she could quit being a brat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Going back for seconds?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shut up and lay back," Agatha returned in a growl, a hand planting on Rio's chest to push her back. She did not resist, but a little voice in the far reaches of her brain whispered that a pillow would have been nice right about then. Instead, her head rested against the hard wood, her eyes slipping shut as she felt Agatha's touch begin, just two fingertips, between her breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
     A tight sigh escaped through parted lips, chin tipping back in bliss as Agatha's feather-light touch began to dance its way lower, through the valley that ran the length of her abdomen. There were thousands of tiny bumps prickling all over Rio's skin and somehow, she could feel that need building right back up again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been so focused on the feeling of Agatha's two fingertips skating off to her left hip that when she felt Agatha's other hand on the inside of her opposite thigh, the immediate physical response was to tense, but the hold released only a second later, causing Agatha to hum in satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinking that would be it, Rio braced herself for whatever was coming next.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha didn't stop the light work of her tracing. She was brushing those fingertips over the tops of Rio's thighs, even reaching around them to make it easier on herself. Then, the insides of them. When she ventured toward the apex, the holy grail, Rio was
     <em>
      ready.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And then... she just watched her fingers as they traced around Rio's pink and swollen pussy, triggering every nerve along the way. Rio was practically shivering with the way her body was twitching every other second, Agatha's touch gracing all the right parts and pieces of her skin. Her sighs were heavy and labored, but the whines were what was bringing Agatha the most pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     After several more excruciatingly long moments of that taunting while Agatha proudly donned an impish grin that Rio could not see, she simply could not take it any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Up on her elbows again, Rio's expression was quite pitiful despite the griping to be found when she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you just gonna see which finger can run around my pussy faster, or are you actually going to let me feel
     <em>
      you?
     </em>
     " she questioned sharply, but she wasn't selling it as well as she was trying to. Agatha was staring right at her, unblinking, unfazed, and still wearing that look that said she was not to be trifled with.
    </p>
    <p>
     She asserted that by shifting her left hand just slightly, widening her cheshire-like grin as a way to keep Rio distracted so that she could bunch together her first three fingers, pressing them against Rio's entrance before sliding them directly inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, Rio had kind of earned that one hadn't she?
    </p>
    <p>
     Her head whipped back as a thunderous moan filled the air, so loud it could have rattled the frames that hung on the walls. It was such an intense feeling because she simply hadn't been expecting it. Then again, she hadn't exactly thought that Agatha would play gentle with her. Even so, the immediate stretch she felt nearly dropped her down to the table, but she somehow sourced the strength needed to keep her up, even if her head remained dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was clear that Agatha knew exactly what she was doing, starting with a slower pace to give Rio's body time to adjust. When she realized that she could pick it up a little more, she took to it immediately, though she chose to spread her fingers in a way that offered an entirely
     <em>
      new
     </em>
     sensation within Rio's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Look, Rio was no fucking virgin, but whatever the fuck Agatha was doing to her body sure made her feel like one.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "
     </em>
     F-Fuck, Agatha! Sh-Shit... I -- Oh! L-Like that!" she tried to encourage, though it was almost forming in shouted commands than it was an actual request for her to not desist in the exact thing she was doing that was causing Rio's toes to curl.
    </p>
    <p>
     For once, Agatha had no witty retort, no goading that would surely nudge Rio a little closer to her second climax. Instead, she turned her head and bit right into Rio's thighs. That wasn't just a nudge, that was a kick to the back that knocked the wind out of her. Her thigh tried to clench inward, but Agatha kept her steady, though she did choose to release her hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     It accomplished what she'd wanted it to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was close.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she was getting closer with each thrust Agatha made, growing in intensity the more she realized Rio was getting nearer to cumming again.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the tell-tale signs started to show themselves in the way her hips canted and her breathing became too shallow to be sustained for much longer, Agatha decided
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     was the time for her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Eyes on me, princess," she demanded, though the heat in her words was damn near searing as they all but branded into Rio's ears. "Let me see that pretty face when you come on my fingers."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to obey, wanted to give Agatha all that she was asking for, but it felt impossible. Her head was weighted, pulled down as if it were filled with nothing but the lead poundage of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Rio,"
     </em>
     Agatha ordered again, her tone a little more urgent. The moment Rio felt her start to slow down though, she managed to lift her head, expression contorted in ecstasy. It was
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     the thing Agatha wanted to see. She shifted again so that she could turn her hand so that her palm was toward the ceiling and so that those three fingers could curl upward.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Rio, Agatha was working her to another blinding climax. For Agatha, she was trying to find the right button -- or combination of buttons -- to press that might surprise them both. She could try her hardest, but every effort she was providing was falling rather flat. Well, only in the extent that she didn't get what she was after, but what she
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     pry from Rio's fluttering walls was the most intense, soul-shattering orgasm Rio was almost certain she'd ever felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her head started to fall again, but she caught herself mid-tilt so that Agatha could see every pinch and twitch of muscle, the way Rio's eyes rolled back in her head, and the way her jaw dropped to allow the most excessive howl of a moan to echo and bounce off of every single surface around them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's right, cum for
     <em>
      me,
     </em>
     " Agatha snarled, her free hand raising to press down on Rio's lower stomach as she continued to fuck her roughly
     <em>
      through
     </em>
     the orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "For. For you. All for you."
     </em>
     It was the weakest blubbering, but it was also an agreement. It was one that Rio meant. Whatever witchcraft Agatha dabbled in as it pertained to the magic of how to fuck like an animal, she had Rio spellbound, sound in the idea that she had never been fucked in such a way before and likely never would be again unless Agatha decided to come around again.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was too much. She was reaching the tail end and Agatha sensed it with ease. Her motions slowed and them came to a halt, a silent permission Rio took to lower her head back. Another half-moan, half-cry sounded in response to the way Agatha removed her touch and a new emptiness suddenly consumed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had known how much she'd
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     that before Agatha offered it to her, but she had not known just how much she had
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jesus Christ, Agatha," Rio breathed, chest still heaving as she seemed to relocate most of her faculties again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I should get that on a plaque," Agatha mused aloud. She was pulling herself up, careful to keep her fingers from touching Rio's leg as she got to her feet. It wasn't curteous; of course it wasn't. No, Agatha had a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once righted, Agatha was wearing
     <em>
      that look
     </em>
     again, the one where Rio knew she was about to do something that was going to make Rio feel like she was going to burst out of her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the hand she had kept free and clear of any contact -- the hand that still bore 3 fingers wet with Rio's cum -- she reached between her legs, dragging them through her own slick, combining them.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a grin that bordered on immoral, Agatha stepped forward to place herself between Rio's knees. The dry hand raised and, automatically finding a familiar home around Rio's throat. She was moaning again, a reaction that happened with no thought at all, but Agatha didn't stay there long. Her hand moved, raising so that she could lock a firm grip on Rio's jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You were so jealous," Agatha murmured, holding her other hand up to brandish those delectable cum-soaked fingers. "So open up."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't have to think; her mouth dropped open on command, more than desperate for the reward Agatha had to offer her. At a painfully taunting pace, Agatha slowly pressed her fingers forward, past Rio's raw and sore lips. The moment they landed on the surface of her tongue, Rio's eyes rolled back into her head and she moaned with a full mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having known what Agatha tasted like, and unashamedly having tasted herself on occasion (though not as of late), Rio never could have dared dream of how the combination would land on her tongue. It was sweet, salty,
     <em>
      sharp.
     </em>
     It somehow turned her on even more.
    </p>
    <p>
     No!
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha got to have her fun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now it was Rio's turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she finished laving every bountiful drop of their cum off Agatha's fingers, she was going to get down to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she took her time doing that, first.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had glanced up at one point in the process, Agatha's fingers still tucked snugly between her lips as she sucked them clean, to see that Agatha looked like she was only seconds away from pinning Rio to the table and attempting to suffocate her again. That was something Rio could absolutely get behind, but --
    </p>
    <p>
     She backed her head away, raising a hand to lightly hold Agatha's wrist so that she could pull it down.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Bedroom," Rio stated. The lone word was enough, she felt, and Agatha seemed to understand. Or, at least Rio thought she did until she did not step away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Agatha stepped into her, hands lowering to tap at the sides of Rio's thighs in encouragement. At first, Rio didn't understand. Upon realizing this, Agatha's hands slid to the undersides of Rio's thighs, lifting them and pressing them to her sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
     She was getting a lift!
    </p>
    <p>
     Eagerly, Rio leaned forward to secure her arms around Agatha's neck at the same time her legs wrapped tightly around Agatha's waist. Confident that Rio was secured, Agatha lifted her off the table. She turned her body toward the hallway, but did not immediately make the journey. Instead, her head turned and dipped so that she could survey the small puddle of Rio's cum that was left gathered there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Admiring your handiwork, are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's head snapped back, though her focus fell to Rio's completely bruised and hickied chest, lips spreading wide to reveal those vicious, vicious teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sure am," Agatha responded, her eyes finally lifting to Rio's so that when she snapped her jaw, her teeth clicking, it had a little more effect. It worked and showed in the way Rio's legs tightened around her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     The back and forth could have continued, but Agatha was moving through the apartment, headed straight for the bedroom. When she crossed the threshold, an idea flashed through Rio's mind, her own grin wide and wicked in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You should let me strap you this time," she suggested, mischief sparkling in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's derisive snap of a laugh wasn't wounding, but it was certainly unnerving. "Princess doesn't always get her way," she returned, clucking her tongue in a discouraging fashion. "We aren't there." It was silly that Rio waited about three seconds for her to follow it up with a 'yet' but she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it wasn't the answer Rio wanted, but it was the one she expected to get. So as Agatha made it to the foot of the bed, Rio quickly devised another plan.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So does that mean you'll let me pin your knees to your chest and eat you out until you can't take it anymore?" she questioned, unable to fight the smirk that found her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha located a smirk that matched Rio's, a brow arching in curiosity. "Is that a threat or a promise?" she hummed in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio ducked her head to bite down into Agatha's bottom lip, pulling on it as far as she could before she released it, letting it snap back into place. "Trust me when I say it can be both."
    </p>
    <p>
     With the way Agatha's hands were canvassing each cheek of Rio's ass to support her weight, it also gave her the leverage needed to do exactly what she wanted. First, she closed the space between them with a steamy and sloppy kiss, one that lowered Rio's guard enough that she loosened the hold her legs had around Agatha's middle -- exactly the way Agatha wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of a sudden, the kiss was severed cleanly, but not because either of them pulled away. No, it was because Agatha used her hold and paired it with her impressive strength to toss Rio back onto the bed like she were slinging a bag of rocks with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yelping in surprise in the two seconds she was airborne, Rio's eyes snapped up to Agatha, but she wasn't talking forward. Not yet. Instead, she tipped her head back in instruction, requesting Rio move up the bed. When she did, Agatha was on all fours on top of the mattress, taking her time in prowling her way up it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She passed over Rio's legs, her hips, her abdomen, her chest, but Agatha didn't kiss an inch of skin. Not until her face was hanging only an inch above Rio's, breath hot on her already pink cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took her at her word, offering no further commentary before their lips were crushing together again. She did not drop her weight, did not lay it against Rio's body. Instead, she was opening the door and seeing whether or not Rio would run through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio understood, she was fucking
     <em>
      sprinting
     </em>
     through it. Her knees lifted and locked tightly to Agatha's hips. Her hands slid their way around Agatha's back, also cementing into place. With all the strength she herself could manage -- which paled in comparison to Agatha's pure prowess -- Rio flipped them over so that Agatha was on her back and also moaning into their kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could take little more of that, or she was going to end up fucking herself the same way Agatha had, third orgasm or not.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tore their lips apart and began her own assault, kissing Agatha's neck, her ear, her neck again. When Rio decided to be a brat in her own way, starting to suck a little roughly on the side of Agatha's neck, a hand whipped up and lightly smacked the back of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Nothing visible,"
     </em>
     Agatha snipped. Rio couldn't see the glower she was wearing, but she didn't need to because she heard it. Obediently, Rio kissed lower, lower, lower still until her mouth met one of Agatha's breasts at the same time a hand met the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had missed this, missed Agatha. She had missed being told what to do, being touched by rough and violent hands that had no desire to hurt her in any way she didn't like. She missed the banter that only seemed to turn her on, though it never would have worked in any other physical relationship she'd ever had.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of all, Rio had missed -- and longed for -- the taste of Agatha's skin, salty and damp with her sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's legs were up and around her rib cage, trying to pull her closer, but Rio resisted. She continued to circle the tip of her tongue around Agatha's nipple before stiffening to flick against it tauntingly.  When her teeth caught hold of it and she pinched forcefully at the other,
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     drew a reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     It came in how Agatha's back arched, lessening the space Rio was intentionally keeping between their bodies, but not quite making contact. At the same time, a delicious moan poured from her lips and landed in Rio's ears like the sweetest song, compelling her to do it again. So she did. And Agatha moaned
     <em>
      again,
     </em>
     but it was louder this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hoping for just one more before she moved on, Rio bit down and pinched, but pulled her hand and head back while in possession of both nipples. Agatha's back arched once more, trying to prolong the contact, even as her breasts lifted from her chest. With no warning, Rio released both and dropped to kiss at the apex of Agatha's ribcage.
    </p>
    <p>
     She carved a path downward with kisses and nips and licks that seemed to be getting to Agatha a little more as they went on. She was starting to squirm the smallest amount, like she
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to, but was fighting against the impulse. Rio didn't care, that gave her an ego all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's legs had slowly eased, but her knees remained bent enough that as Rio made it below her bellybutton, hooking her hands beneath Agatha's thighs was easy as pie. Her grip was unrestrained and firm as she leaned back, piercing dark gaze landing on Agatha's bliss-ridden expression as she waited for what she knew was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had threatened/promised, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a quick and sudden shove, Rio used her hold to press Agatha's legs back, following through on exactly what she said she was going to do. Agatha's hips lifted off the bed, knees meeting her chest in a way that caused her to groan in anticipation, body shifting under Rio's weight but not managing to go anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dropping her gaze, Rio found herself licking her lips at the display before her. Pink and so wet that there were smatterings of her cum in her dark bush, Agatha's cunt was there for the taking, however much Rio wanted of it. It was everything she wanted and more, especially with the way Agatha had willingly put herself at Rio's mercy, and the mercy of her insatiable hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze flickered up and, as she knew she would find, Agatha was staring at her. She wasn't smirking, wasn't smiling. No, she was biting on the thumb of her left hand, and hard while staring Rio right in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not look away, did not divert her attention. Instead, she wallowed up a wad of saliva and, unblinking, let it pass between her lips, and drop straight onto Agatha's already soaked pussy. This time, Agatha was the one to break the stare as her critical blue eyes rolled right into the back of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     The howl that left Agatha's lungs was more of a desperate yelping, as though beholding such a sight had done something to her that she had not been expecting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Agatha found the ability to bring her head forward again, Rio was through with waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like she'd not had a proper meal in days, Rio began to feast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Initially, she had every intent of being just as taunting and teasing as Agatha had been when she'd been between Rio's knees. With intent, the tip of Rio's tongue traced along one side of Agatha's outer lips and then down the other. Her plan was to touch every bit of Agatha she could without actually touching
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     quite yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not seem like the type to give the satisfaction to a lover by making noise, but Rio could tell that she wanted to. She could hear the tiniest choked whimpers fighting their way out, but Agatha was resisting. Clearly the first one had been a lucky hit, but Rio wanted to hear more. She wouldn't demand it or poke it out of her. No, Rio would find a way to make it happen with only her actions.
    </p>
    <p>
     The very first time she pressed her tongue flat against Agatha's entrance and licked her way up to Agatha's clit without actually touching it, she felt Agatha shiver beneath her. So she did it again, and once more, Agatha shivered at the sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a little more urgency, Rio's tongue flexed and pressed inward, sliding into Agatha's body the most minute amount before withdrawing. That time, Agatha got a little closer to letting out what wanted to be a moan, but it left in little more than a meek squeak.
    </p>
    <p>
     The time for teasing was over and Rio made it known, sucking Agatha's clit between her lips, giving it several intentional flicks with her tongue in a way that had Agatha actually moving, squirming, shifting her hips to try and get more, even if it was out of her control. This was gratifying to Rio, filled her with a small well of satisfaction and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was measured and precise with the way she continued to devour Agatha to the best of her abilities, licking and sucking and even biting a time or two -- like when she latched on to one of Agatha's inner lips and gave a light tug -- while she consumed everything available to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first time Agatha came, Rio almost thought she was going to be overpowered as Agatha's legs tried to jettison forward, but Rio fought back, pinning her down with a little more force. What happened in tandem, though, was the treasure Rio had been seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
     The most primal and devolved sounds escaped Agatha as her body tensed and wracked with immeasurable pleasure, consuming her whole. It was so fucking intense, filling Rio with a feeling that she did not know how to translate into words. It was heat, burning hot heat, and it was all-consuming.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was why she continued to feast, reveling in every taste she got of Agatha's needy cunt, and procured two more beautifully loud and wild orgasms from Agatha's body. The third one had been the most dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
     That time, Agatha
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     overpower her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her legs pressed against Rio's hold so forcefully in a way that Rio hadn't been expecting, knocking her off balance from where she had been compacted on her knees. She was knocked backwards, landing in the plush fluff of the mattress. Even though Agatha was still moaning, Rio had started to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <em>
      funny.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd made Agatha come
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     hard that she'd been knocked off of her own ass.
    </p>
    <p>
     After only a moment of residing in her humor, Rio was moving in an attempt to untangle herself from Agatha's legs so that she could crawl up the bed. She was on hands and knees when she peered down at the other woman, making sure she was okay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes were closed, but those cheeks were a deep crimson color, the orgasmic bliss written over every inch of those gorgeous features. She was
     <em>
      so fucking beautiful
     </em>
     as it was, but right then? The word 'beautiful' was the world's largest understatement.  Agatha was something to behold, something to revere. She was a wonder of the world, in more ways than one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew the rules here, established in the subtext of the short conversation they'd had the last time they'd fucked.
    </p>
    <p>
     With such knowledge, Rio placed herself on her back, chest still rising and falling a little too quickly to be normal, next to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     They weren't touching, exactly, but their arms were close enough that they might as well have been. Agatha's own breathing was still ragged and rough as she tried to come down from the high Rio had been so kind to provide to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, Rio felt something as her face dropped to the pillow, gaze finding Agatha's profile with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the tiniest twitch of Agatha's fingers, her knuckles bumping into Rio's that were right next to them. Rio had thought it a mistake, an accident, but then... it happened again.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha's pinky finger curled around hers
     <em>
      just barely
     </em>
     , Rio grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if Agatha was acting like it wasn't happening, it still was, and Rio would find giddiness in that for days to come.
    </p>

   <div>
    <p>
     Scaling a mountain had never been on Rio's list of hopeful accomplishments, but laying in her bed next to Agatha, their pinky fingers only woven but not completely secure, Rio felt like she was at the highest peak of the highest mountain in the world. She wasn't looking to domesticate this wily and wild woman, no. Agatha Harkness would forever be undomesticated for so long as she lived, that was something Rio was confident of.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she had also made a very soft choice, a very loud but quiet way to say that whatever had brought her back, it was enough to make her want to know that there was
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     form of connection there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had wondered several times -- mostly when Agatha demanded for Rio to look her in the eye -- if Agatha had ever known what it was like to feel a connection with another human being. Did she search the eyes, the windows to the soul, to find something she might be able to understand and relate to? Did she discover what she was hoping to? What
     <em>
      were
     </em>
     her hopes? What was it that Agatha wanted out of life?
    </p>
    <p>
     They might have been somewhat reasonable questions for pillow talk, but Rio did not want to push too hard and end up pissing her off again. She had just come back, had just decided that Rio was worth coming around for, even though Rio had undoubtedly pissed her off and startled her at the same time. She would have had infinite reasons, all of them valid, to have never thought about Rio again. It would have been faultless on Agatha's part, something Rio would have understood.
    </p>
    <p>
     By telling Alice, Rio had fucked up. Did she think that it would have negative consequences otherwise? Of course not, or she wouldn't have buckled under Alice's interrogative pressure. Rio could also admit that she'd made the mistake and attone for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio did not realize was that the few moments she had taken to slow Agatha down, to focus her tipsy brain, to
     <em>
      apologize?
     </em>
     Those moments were the
     <em>
      real
     </em>
     reason she could feel Agatha's pinky finger between her own pinky and ring fingers, curled ever so slightly. What Rio did not realize was that she was the first person in Agatha's life to look her in the eye and mean it when they said they were sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, there they lay, on their backs with the smallest amount of contact between them as they stared at the ceiling. Their chests were still moving a touch faster than normal, but the steadiness seemed to be finding them again. Rio had been so in tune to the sounds of their breathing, the quietest melody to her ears, that when Agatha spoke, it startled her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So... Taxidermy, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's head turned to the side, cheek warm against the jersey sheets. There was a very apparent confusion in her dark eyes, but Agatha was not looking at her to catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Was this her idea of pillow talk?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     A thought found her immediately after: Had Agatha ever actually had a conversation with someone she was
     <em>
      genuinely
     </em>
     interested in, in her life?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had her own theories, ones that had kept her up until the early hours of the mornings after she had spent herself riding that stupid armchair. Agatha was a very... cold human being. It wasn't a bad thing, at least not to Rio, but it was very obvious that attachment was not her style.
    </p>
    <p>
     So why did she keep coming back?
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently, it was because she wanted to know more. She had shown Rio hers, now it was time to return the favor.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      But what did it mean?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is... there a question in there somewhere?" Rio returned, still watching Agatha's profile. Even from that vantage point, there was still so much to see and understand.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the corner of Agatha's mouth lifted toward her eyes, it was a short trip, but her eyes fluttered shut regardless, as if she found deep humor in Rio's response. She did not offer an answer right away, but exhaled a soft
     <em>
      hmmm
     </em>
     instead. Rio wasn't even sure there was a breath left in the conversation, but she didn't care.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was just watching Agatha and that... peaceful? Was that the right word? That
     <em>
      peaceful
     </em>
     look on her face, it was calming by its own measure.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha finally provided Rio with an answer, her voice was softer somehow. It was smooth, serene even.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What made you want to do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     All Rio needed was to hear the first three words to know that Agatha was asking her a question she didn't typically like to answer. It was why she had given it up, why she had nothing to show for the few years she had invested countless hours into the hobby. It was also why she did not like to talk about it the majority of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, Rio realized, she was laying in bed with a woman who had paralyzed six men and killed many, many others. If anyone on the face of the fucking planet was not going to judge her for her answer, it was going to be the serial killer that was inevitably going to fuck her to death.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've always been... fascinated, I guess, by the concept of death. And, really, existence in general," Rio started. Her head lulled back into the pillow, eyes finding the ceiling for a moment. She wanted to avoid any chance of Agatha trying to look over while she was making such an admission. "And that young... I just wanted the answer to the question
     <em>
      'What happens when death comes and goes? What gets left behind?'
     </em>
     And... That was the closest I could get to finding out."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't looking, but she could see in her periphery that Agatha's head turned, that Agatha was
     <em>
      looking at her.
     </em>
     She didn't move. For a few seconds, she didn't even breathe until she realized it probably looked a little suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And how do you feel about death now?" Agatha questioned lowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     This took a beat for Rio to truly give thought to. There were a variety of answers she could have provided to such an inquiry, but she chose the one that felt right in the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That most times, it's inconsequential. Inevitable. We all meet it at our end, but the unpredictability of
     <em>
      when
     </em>
     is what seems to scare people the most." It was honest, and it was something that Rio would never have admitted to anyone else, not even Alice. They had their dark humor, but this wasn't exactly funny. It was real. And the only time Rio had felt so far that she could be
     <em>
      real
     </em>
     was right there, with Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And does it scare you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes closed, but her lips pulled apart and a quiet chuckle left her. "Agatha, you could have shot me in the face in the middle of the road while dressed like a million dollars. And then I willingly followed you to an objectively well kept barn that would never flag as 'murder shack.' And then... I mean, then, you could have easily overpowered me and strapped me to the table and severed
     <em>
      my
     </em>
     spinal cord. But I chose again and again to come back anyway. So... no, death doesn't scare me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not respond. She was quiet, but Rio could tell she was still watching her, not having moved her head back. Rio could also sense what it was Agatha wanted her to say, what Agatha
     <em>
      hoped
     </em>
     she would say.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was silent a moment longer before she offered such reprieve.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't scare me, Agatha."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio meant it as a comfort, but she still panicked when she felt Agatha's pinky twitch. She was scared for two brief seconds that the contact was going to vanish, that Agatha was going to retract and recoil from what had been an honest sentiment. In the third second, it hooked a little tighter than it had been before, though it still wasn't fully wrapped around Rio's own finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment had gone a little heavier than Rio was sure either of them had intended, but it was another open and truthful exchange. Of course she wanted it to be mutual, wanted to ask Agatha her own questions but Rio knew that -- as Agatha had said earlier -- they weren't there and she couldn't risk chasing Agatha off.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, Rio found another avenue to guide their conversation down, as it was apparent that Agatha was in no immediate hurry to whisk back out as quickly as she had blown in.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What if you taxidermied the shitbags you killed?" Rio posed, her eyes wrinkling at the corners with the smile she formed as her giggles took her over.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio, what the fuck?" Agatha immediately sounded back, though she had started to laugh, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean, okay, just hear me out," Rio began to reason, though she chose to open her eyes so that she could land them in Agatha's as she turned her head on the pillow. "Do you know how fucking confused everyone would be? Especially if you were doing that shit before I knew you? I'd probably be even more pissed off than I already was at not knowing how you were doing it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's quiet laughter hadn't really stopped, but it had started to get louder the longer Rio went on. Her left hand had come to rest on her stomach, as if it would help quell the amusement at Rio's insane musings.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're actually fucking insane," Agatha told her. She might have meant it, but Rio could tell by that delighted gleam in her eyes that she liked it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, well, I spend the majority of my time in the company of dead people. Madness breeds fiercely in the quiet," she stated simply, threads of conviction tight around her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know you meant that in an informative way, but that's some serious Poe shit," Agatha informed her, still shaking lightly with her laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I missed my calling as a mid-eighteeth century poet, I guess," Rio said with a light shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha must have thought that she was going to pull away because for the first time since Rio had landed on her back, Agatha's pinky finger curled fully and tightly around hers. Rio's heart skipped a beat in her chest but she did not let it grace her features. Placidity was a newly found trait for her, but it worked in the moment and kept Agatha calm, kept her there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could offer further conversation, a yawn took Rio over, reminding her that she was rather tired despite being lost in conversation with the woman beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Close your eyes," Agatha instructed; it was almost soothing, but there was a sternness there that was also... kinda hot.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm fine, I'm not --"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio, close your eyes," she demanded again. God, when she did that stupid thing where she offered Rio's name first before delivering an instruction made Rio so fucking weak. She felt like a serf, a slave, someone who was damn near conditioned to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
     With what she knew would likely be her last look of that beautiful face for the night, Rio gave Agatha the smallest smile and listened, letting heavy lids fall shut.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not going yet," Agatha told her softly, not having released the hold on Rio's pinky finger, "but you have to work tomorrow and you need to get some rest."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's lips lifted again in a sleepy smile, a soft hum escaping her. "Don't you?" she asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't I what?" Agatha returned. Rio couldn't see her, but she could feel Agatha watching her, tracing over her face with that warm blue gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have to work?" Rio answered, another yawn consuming her as she felt even heavier with the weight of exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Maybe," Agatha returned.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And where do you do that?" Rio murmured, voice slurring the slightest bit.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not tonight, princess," Agatha crooned.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the last thing Rio heard before she fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     She did not hear Agatha's breathing as she laid there for almost ten minutes longer, fully aware that Rio was asleep. She did not hear her get out of bed and make the trip to the dining room to recover her dress. She did not hear Agatha's soft sigh to discover that Phineas was curled up and asleep on her dress. She did not hear as Agatha came back into the bedroom and plucked Rio's Roscoe's sweatshirt with a rainbow that ended in a pint of beer off the door handle, or as she rummaged through the dresser for a pair of leggings. Agatha was even dead silent as she snatched a pair of slides out of the closet, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she left, the last soundless thing she did was rummage through the nightstand drawer to find the burner phone, placing it on the pillow next to Rio's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, she dressed herself and departed, leaving a satisfied and overall content Rio to slumber in her bliss until she woke the next morning to the sound of her alarm going off in another room.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shot upright in an instant, scrambling out of bed to locate her phone -- which she found easily on the couch -- so that she could silence her alarm. It had only been going off for three minutes, so she wasn't going to be late, but it had scared her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment it was quiet again, Rio's tired mind caught up to the fact that she was standing naked in her living room with her cat rubbing against her leg to inform her he needed to be fed. It found every memory from the night before, from the way Agatha had looked like drunken royalty when she had first shown up to that wild look on her face when Rio had apologized to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     That tired mind woke up more and more as she thought about the way Agatha had shoved her onto that table, the way she had given
     <em>
      incredible
     </em>
     head, the way she'd done that
     <em>
      stupidly fucking insane thing where she'd coated her fingers in both of their cum and shoved them into Rio's mouth.
     </em>
     That was actually fucking insane that it was something she could say she had lived to experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, the entire thing with Agatha could have fallen under that, but in a sexual capacity, that had been an entirely new experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     One Rio thought about during her eight minute long shower where she was able to rub one orgasm out of her body, thankful for the slight boost to begin her day. It had given her the pep needed to scramble around and get dressed -- a black camisole beneath a white blouse that would be tucked under her white coat once she got to work, a pair of black skinny jeans and a pair of Doc Martens -- and take care of picking up around the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had gone back into the bedroom for her earrings when she realized for the first time that the burner was on the pillow again, right next to where her head had been. With a small smile, she made her way to the side of the bed and picked it up, seeing that there were five missed calls, three voicemails and eight text messages.
    </p>
    <p>
     Checking the time, she knew she had enough of it to go through them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The messages were... pretty funny.
    </p>
    <p>
     Missed call.
     <br/>
     <em>
      "are you home??"
     </em>
     <br/>
     <em>
      "rio????"
     </em>
     <br/>
     Missed call.
     <br/>
     <em>
      "hey answer your phone."
      <br/>
     </em>
     Missed call.
     <br/>
     <em>
      "I'm calling Again. answer me."
     </em>
     <br/>
     Missed call.
     <br/>
     <em>
      "rio???? why arnet you answering?? I know you didn't throe it away even tho I told you to."
     </em>
     <br/>
     <em>
      "can I come over??"
     </em>
     <br/>
     Missed call.
     <br/>
     <em>
      "I'm coming over"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, there was another text, one from presumably after Agatha had made it home. It was simple, short, and to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Thank you for the apology. You were heard. Have a good day."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Moving onto the voicemails, the first two were only a few seconds long and it sounded in the background like Agatha was struggling to disconnect the call. The third one, though, contained a lot more noise, a lot more distraction. And then came Agatha's voice, crystal clear and annoyed all to hell.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ack, fuck! Would you move?!" It sounded a little distant, but it got louder when she spoke again. "Rio? Rio, did you answer this time? Rio?!" She let out a grunt in the message, huffing as she presumably pushed past someone. "Fuck, why aren't you answering me? I just want to -- oh my GOD! Would you fucking MOVE? Fucking Christ! Okay, okay, Rio I'm coming over. Oh, it's -- It's Amelia by the way. Okay, bye."
    </p>
    <p>
     So Agatha
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     been drunk when she had been wherever it was that she'd been dressed so nicely for. She had sobered considerably in the time it had apparently taken her to get to Rio's, which left Rio wondering where the hell it was she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     Second to be noted there was that she sounded
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     drunk and still knew to use her cover. It made Rio wonder just how long she'd been using it, how far beneath it she had buried herself.  That would be a thought to ponder when she did not have to get her ass to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeding Phin was the last item to tick off before she was out the door and on her way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Work was normal. Rio was normal. Kind of. She was trying to be, at least. It seemed to be working considering that Alice had been in and out twice and had not made any jabby or poky comment about the fact that Rio was in a good mood.
    </p>
    <p>
     In Alice's world, Agatha had walked out of Rio's life and it was probably for the better.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the time being, Rio wanted to keep it that way. Or, she had.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then she had to go and spill her coffee on herself when Alice had come in for the third time. It hadn't even been a thought for her to whip off the stained and ruined blouse, slinging it toward her office chair as she rushed to the cabinet for the napkins she had stashed there. Her back had been toward Alice as she started dabbing away at the hot coffee that had managed to soak into some of the camisole she was wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she turned around, Alice actually screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "OH MY GOD! RIO?! WHAT THE FUCK?!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Scared half to death, Rio's head whipped up to find Alice staring at her in abject horror, looking genuinely concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's just coffee, and it's a black camisole, Alice, it's --"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No!" Alice shrieked back, pointing. "What the fuck happened to your chest?!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Confused, Rio's head dropped so she could try to understand Alice's extreme overreaction, but when her eyes fell to her own chest... Well, she couldn't say she didn't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had done a fucking
     <em>
      number
     </em>
     on her chest. There were hickeys and bruises that were the perfect shapes of Agatha's bite marks. It looked like she had been full-on assaulted, and yet, looking down at the battery, all Rio could do was grin. She was trying to do it without lifting her head, but it didn't matter. Alice saw it anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, fuck," she mused, sounding rather impressed. "You moved on fucking fast."
    </p>
    <p>
     Reaching up to rub the back of her neck with the hand that was not dabbing at her shirt, Rio exhaled a rather sardonic chuckle. "Heh, yeah." It was weak, and it was not convincing in the least that she had moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice understood what that meant
     <em>
      immediately.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh my God. She's
     <em>
      back?!
     </em>
     She came back?!" she fired, surging forward so that they could continue the conversation at a lower volume.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," Rio responded nonchalantly, resuming her task of trying to dry the camisole. "She came back. Last night."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And you're being a fucking cucumber over this why?!" Alice asked, her voice brimming with her excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because I am going to try and be more reserved with what I share," Rio answered honestly. She wasn't trying to be an asshole, but she also knew that she could not stand to watch Agatha walk away again. "And you know it's not you. She's just... skittish. And maybe... Maybe some day she'll be okay with you knowing more, but right now it's just best if I'm quiet about a lot more."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't looking at her, but Alice was rolling her eyes the moment Rio finished speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, I don't really give a fuck about her life story, I'm interested in the wild fucking sex you must have had last night that your chest looks like
     <em>
      that.
     </em>
     "
    </p>
    <p>
     Alright, Rio would give that one to her, that was a fair ask.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, as Rio autopsied her latest delivery, she told her. Not in vivid detail, but enough that it qualified to be respectable girl talk when it came to sex. Alice had
     <em>
      definitely
     </em>
     shared more about her escapades, but Rio was still trying to find her footing in a world where it might be a commonplace conversation for her to be having every so often.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay so what I am learning here is that either your pussy is a fucking honeypot, or you're secretly a lot more of a demented freak than I give you credit for," Alice had gathered by the end of the conversation. She was laughing, and she probably thought it was a joke, or at least the latter part, but Rio knew it wasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was something
     <em>
      wrong
     </em>
     with her, but it had been left alone because she was harmless. Hurting another being was not something Rio ever wished to do in her life and that was still something that held true, no matter how deep this obsession with Agatha had taken her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wouldn't you like to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "...No, actually. I don't, for the sole purpose of plausible deniability."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was smart for that, really.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest of the day had been rather busy; Rio rarely having a moment to breathe before Alice came bustling through her doors again with another silver cart. Rio was efficient, but that day had been
     <em>
      excessive.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     They'd grabbed a bite to eat after work at a nearby cafe and went their separate ways, both thankful that the following day was Friday and the week was drawing to a close. Alice had asked Rio if she wanted to do something over the weekend, but Rio hadn't been certain on what her weekend might look like now that Agatha was back in the picture. She was honest about it and when Alice seemed excited for her, it felt genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest of her night had been quiet, sipping at a beer while she watched old Jeopardy reruns on Hulu, Phin being an absolute menace as he constantly moved around in an attempt to get her to pay him more attention. It was around ten pm when she heard something in the bedroom. Her brow pinched and she listened, hearing it again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The burner!
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas was unhappy, but Rio shifted him to the side and was up from the couch in a heartbeat, breaking off toward the bedroom to grab the burner from where she had left it on the nightstand. She did not return to her spot in the living room but instead placed herself on the edge of the bed, swiping up the screen to reveal the two messages Agatha had sent her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Pack a bag. I'll pick you up after work."
      <br/>
      "6pm."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was grinning at first, but then another thought struck her. She was typing back quickly, hoping she could still catch Agatha's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "If I'm packing a bag, that means a couple of days. I can't leave Phin alone that long."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She sent it and it took mere seconds for Agatha to start typing her response. Rio chewed on the inside of her lip while she waited. It took but thirty seconds before Agatha's response came back.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Bring him. I saw the harness and lead hanging on the wall. See you tomorrow xx."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Damn. She really thought of everything, didn't she? It was becoming very apparent that when Agatha wanted something, she would utilize every detail imaginable in order to get her way. Whatever she wanted Rio to join her for could apparently be pet-friendly, shutting down any opposition that she might have had.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     opposition she would have had.
    </p>
    <p>
     While she was beginning to get dangerously lost in the high of being in Agatha's presence, Rio knew that Phineas was still a living being that depended on her for attention and care. He had been hers for two years and she had never been gone longer than a night before. The fact that Agatha was so quick to include him, to insist he come along, it went a lot further with Rio than Agatha might have thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio typed back one last response, knowing Agatha wouldn't send another text.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Goodnight, A. See you tomorrow. &lt;3"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She typed it, but then she hit the backspace.
    </p>
    <p>
     What the fuck was that heart?
    </p>
    <p>
     Was she a teenager?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Goodnight, A. See you tomorrow."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, much better. Less needy schoolgirl with a crush, more stoic middle-aged woman who wasn't a giddy asshole over the fact that she was being offered a weekend of Agatha's time. It had been a plan before, but it was one that had never come to fruition.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, assuming that she didn't completely shove her foot in her mouth between that moment and the one where she was beside Agatha again, she was getting to see it fully bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio set the phone down and returned to the living room to finish her beer and shut everything off. For once, she was going to try and get a reasonable amount of sleep, and she truly did try.
    </p>
    <p>
     After forty-five minutes of thinking about Agatha, about their conversation less than twenty-four hours before, about everything that had preceded that, Rio found herself rummaging through her drawer to remove the silicone ring vibrator that had been stored inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Flat on her back, it took Rio less than two minutes to have her first orgasm. It felt great and she was happy with it, but she wasn't
     <em>
      satisfied.
     </em>
     By the time -- four minutes later -- that she'd had her second one, she realized something really fucking annoying:
    </p>
    <p>
     Orgasms were great, but they were fucking mind-blowing when Agatha was the one giving them to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Irritated and a little pissed off about it, Rio had somehow finally fallen asleep in time to get just over seven hours of rest. The irritation was gone by the time she opened her eyes the next morning, remembering that when she got off work and came home to throw a bag together and suit Phineas up in his harness and lead, Agatha would be on the way to get her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had made getting ready for work seem like a treat, a step toward getting what it was she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hell, it had even made work seem like a cakewalk for the majority of the morning. Successful autopsies, no spilled coffee, and she'd gotten fries and a Frosty for lunch, shamelessly combining the two despite Alice's goading and chastising that she was being disgusting.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You have no whimsy," Rio scolded back, shoving an ice cream covered french fry into her mouth before chewing it with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I have the stomach of a woman in her fifties. I know better than to do that to myself," Alice informed her with a laugh as she stood to depart for her afternoon runs. "Try not to yak by the time I get back."
    </p>
    <p>
     It had only taken her an hour before she was throwing the doors open with the far end of the cart, a grin on her face. Rio knew what that grin meant, knew what Alice was about to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You could save yourself the time and just make it look like you did the work," Alice advised brightly, clearly too tickled by her latest pick up.
    </p>
    <p>
     A man with a severed spinal cord.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had been on the prowl the night before, apparently as she had been texting Rio at ten the night before. Had she been sitting next to this stupid man who thought he could actually gain the interest of someone like Agatha? Had she already slipped the Rohypnol in his beer and taken a moment to shoot a message over to Rio that they had weekend plans? Maybe she had been sitting in the front seat of her car, this idiot slumped and passed out in the passenger's seat, thinking about how now that her hunger was satiated in that regard, it was her turn to get her fill of Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know if any of it was reality, nor did she care. All she cared about was finishing the rest of her shift and getting home to set about her weekend.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd managed to get through three additional autopsies that afternoon, still buzzing from the one fresh off of lunch. Agatha had killed again. She was staying. For now. For the weekend. The weekend she wanted to spend with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know where they were going or what it was that Agatha had planned, but she didn't care. The most pertinent thing about the invitation was solely that Agatha wanted to spend time with her, wanted to be around her. Rio didn't care where they went, so long as she got more insane sex and pillow talk about weird shit like taxidermy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being with Agatha in that capacity, laying next to her and talking about the dark shit no one really liked to have conversations about, it was a weirdly liberating feeling in that Rio had never felt more like herself before in the presence of someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was she going to go out and start her own murderous crusade? Of course not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Would she defend Agatha's right to keep to her own? Absolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had taken Rio little time to get home, an eager Phineas greeting her when she strode in and shut the door behind her. Squatting down, the gave him the rougher pets he often liked and grinned as he purred in response.  Her head tilted as she kept at it, his large head forcefully rubbing against her palm in the places he wanted her to pay attention to.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know you're not fond of travelling, but we're going on a little trip for the weekend. So... just prepar yourself," she murmured at him, giving him one last scratch between the ears before she stood and set to packing things for the weekend.
    </p>
    <p>
     After grabbing clothes (including Agatha's dress that had been left behind), toiletries, cat food, cat treats, and Phin's travel water and food bowls, she was certain there was nothing left behind. When the burner sounded from where she had stowed it in her back pocket, she knew that Agatha had likely arrived. The text confirmed as much.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "In the parking garage. Take your time."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned and shot back a quick response.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Getting Phin dressed now. Be out in a minute."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It took her a little longer than a minute, but after getting Phineas suited up in his harness, she let him walk her out of the apartment and to the elevator, her overstuffed backpack secure on her back. When they reached the doors that opened into the garage, she leaned down to scoop him up, gathering him in her arms so she could venture outside.
    </p>
    <p>
     To the right, there was a black Escalade with tinted windows sitting, waiting with the tail lights on in the dark garage. Rio's gaze swept the rest of the garage, looking for any sign of Agatha, but found none.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been in the process of pulling out the burner so that she could ask Agatha where she was when she heard a window on the Escalade roll down.
    </p>
    <p>
     From inside, a voice called out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ride's over here, princess. You just gonna stand there and look pretty?"
    </p>
    <p>
     That was Agatha's voice. And the back passenger's side window was rolled down.
    </p>
    <p>
     With uncertainty steeling over her nerves for some reason she did not understand, Rio made her way to the open window, peering inside to see Agatha, a bright and delightedly wicked grin on her face. Rio's gaze flickered to the driver's seat as it was occupied by a large, burly man with a head of thick dark hair that was tied in a neat bun near the back of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, that's Francisco. He's my driver," Agatha told her, waving a hand toward him in introduction. He lifted a hand off the wheel without turning around, offering a light greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Evening, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's attention snapped back to Agatha, confused. "You have a driver?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Doubles as personal security, too, but yes."
    </p>
    <p>
     At this, Rio's eyes narrowed, shooting a threatening glance through the window. Agatha did not need personal security. In no reality did Agatha need anyone to protect her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So, are you going to stand out there and interrogate me on my method of transportation or are you going to get in so that we can set about our weekend?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas was starting to squirm in her hold, wanting to be put down, so Rio simply gave a nod that encouraged Agatha to lean over and open the door. Once everything was tucked inside, Rio slid in as well and shut the door behind her, settling into the seat as Phineas took up the space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So... Where are we going?" Agatha asked her as Francisco began to drive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was looking out the window when Rio asked the question, but her head turned just enough that she was still not looking directly at Rio, but could still see her when she delivered her answer. It was an answer Rio didn't understand, one that she wanted to request elaboration on, but the way Agatha said it felt so... sure, that she just let it be, if only for a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Home."

    <p>
     Home?
    </p>
    <p>
     Like... Chicago home... Or... Iowa home where surely too many answers were buried and hidden?
    </p>
    <p>
     She had a driver.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was not about to drive them to fucking Iowa.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Home, huh?" Rio asked quietly. She knew there were other ears listening, that she had to be coded and soft-spoken. It was a dangerous question to be asking, but she was framing it as innocuous, innocent, just a way to understand the circumstances she had found herself in. The circumstances where this woman she had been convinced was so solitary and withdrawn was being chauffeured around the city with
     <em>
      personal security.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was a fucking serial killer. What kind of life was she living that this was a daily appearance for her? What did she do outside of the only way Rio had come to know her? She was obviously important and obviously... rich.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was something Rio had gleaned already, but right then as Agatha sat next to her in that dashing heather grey suit, Rio found her mind running away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had so many new questions, so many things that she had never dared to consider before. Agatha had been reluctant to give up pieces of herself and now Rio understood a little better why that was. It was because whatever side of herself she presented to the public, it was someone who had some accredited authority to her name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fake name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fake name that she had made up to hide who she truly was.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew who Agatha
     <em>
      truly
     </em>
     was, and she was beginning to understand that she might have been the only person in the world who did.
    </p>
    <p>
     She might have been the one person on the face of the earth that had uncovered the truth and lived to tell the tale. But how? How did Agatha move about the world wearing such a well-crafted disguise when murder was her hobby? How was she so composed, so put together that not a single person in the world would have had any inkling that she was
     <em>
      deadly?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had thought Agatha to be interesting enough as it was before, even if it was in a morbidly obsessive way. Right then, Rio's interest was at an all time high. She had thought that she'd been putting the pieces in the right places, and that she had assembled enough to see a true picture of Agatha, but that wasn't the case.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it was. Maybe Rio
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     see the picture of Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the picture of Amelia that was tripping her up and causing her to stumble.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was a complex human being, that much Rio already knew. But these different facets to her were bringing Rio right to the understanding that there was still
     <em>
      so much more
     </em>
     of her to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had started to spin and weave those thoughts, but Agatha answered her question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes. Home," Agatha confirmed with a nod of her head, though she still was not looking at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And where might 'home' be?" Rio pushed again, her volume still dropped and a tender care to her tone, a showing that she was not trying to press for the sake of pressing, she was simply curious.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Water Tower Place," Agatha answered easily, as if that wouldn't have had any impact.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio choked. On her own spit, no less.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're full of shit," she accused, her head jerking to the left to look over at Agatha, who had taken to petting gently between Phin's ears, even if she wasn't looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, fine," Agatha returned, shrugging her shoulders. "Don't believe me. Maybe you'll get there on the elevator ride. It's seventy two floors, so should give you enough time for it to sink in."
    </p>
    <p>
     It almost sounded like a joke, like a taunt that Agatha was throwing her way that they could laugh about when they showed up to some tiny brownstone tucked away in some corner of the city. However, there was something about the half of an expression that Rio could see in the dim passing streetlights that told her Agatha was actually being truthful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Water Tower Place was... Well, it was
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     . But it also fell in line with the fact that they were sitting in the middle row of seats in a 2025 Cadillac Escalade while being driven around by a man that likely weighed twice as much as Rio did.
    </p>
    <p>
     What the fuck did Agatha do for work that she could afford a condo in
     <em>
      Water Tower Place?
     </em>
     That was where the greats had lived, where celebrities and other people of elevated reputations who resided and worked in Chicago took up residence. Rio wasn't sure that she actually bought it, but Agatha was wearing her conviction like a suit of armor, honesty nearly bleeding from her despite being so impossibly stoic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio realized what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had company. They were in the presence of someone who could hear the discussion being had, and as such, Rio needed to cater to the intrusion. She needed to remind herself that the Agatha that Rio knew?
     <em>
      No one
     </em>
     knew that Agatha aside from herself. No one knew who she
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     was.
    </p>
    <p>
     This Agatha -- or, rather, this
     <em>
      Amelia
     </em>
     -- was someone worthy of respect, someone important. So how did Rio not know about her? How had she never heard a thing about this wealthy and pragmatic woman who rode around Chicago in her man-bun drawn carriage? She wasn't in showbusiness, didn't hold galas in her own name. She didn't front charities or run organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
     So who the fuck was she?
    </p>
    <p>
     Who the fuck
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     Agatha, in all of her iterations?
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Rio would never know. Maybe she would never be given that kind of access, because for all she knew? For all Rio knew, there were tens of them, if not more. Agatha had been moving in the beginning, so how had she wound up in Chicago? How had she established
     <em>
      this kind
     </em>
     of reputation for herself?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's list of questions seemed to be perpetually growing, getting longer and longer the more time she spent with Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is..." Rio started, but Agatha's gaze remained cast out the window. "Is that the only plan for weekend?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was one question, but there were two in there if Agatha was listening hard enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     a) Are we actually doing something together?
     <br/>
     and
     <br/>
     b) Is your plan to lock us up in your ivory tower and use me like some kind of sex slave?
    </p>
    <p>
     Any answer to either question would have suited Rio just fine, but her curiosity was evident; Agatha had clearly formed some sort of a plan, but Rio wanted to know to what extent. What even could this be called, really?
    </p>
    <p>
     They were not dating. Period. End of sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't because Rio didn't
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to, but rather because she knew that Agatha was
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     the kind of woman who dated or did relationships. If Rio's inclination was right, Agatha had never even really spent honest time with someone she actually found herself interested in. Maybe it was because she had never been interested in someone enough to want to commit that amount of time to...
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, Rio realized, that was what this was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was interested, and she was making time for them to spend together. But in what capacity? The majority of the time they had spent together up to that point, Agatha had been either angry or horny. She'd either been yelling and irate about Rio's overstepping or fucking her brains out (and choking her when she felt like it, which was always a plus) and so, the only true moments of connection between them had been Agatha's gift of the burner, Rio's apology, and the very strange -- and probably unsettling to anyone else -- and rather deep pillow talk they had shared Wednesday night.
    </p>
    <p>
     That had been enough?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had told her she'd been heard, but
     <em>
      to that extent?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're in the car now, so I suppose you will just have to commit to waiting so that you can find out," Agatha answered. It was smooth, it was rich, and there was just enough inflection there that it answered for her since she would not choose words to do it for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever it was, whatever they did, it was calculated, it was considered.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that made Rio feel... Things? Special? Appreciated? Like she was going to inevitably read into it too much?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was clear to her, with that answer from Agatha that they were not going to speak about anything of note in that car and while it was fine, Rio couldn't help but feel rather detached from the woman across the bench seat. So she did the only thing she could: she reached between them and began to pet Phin as well, her fingers just barely brushing against Agatha's as a reminder that she was right there, no matter the space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only a few minutes later, the Escalade was rolling to a stop... Right in front of the residential entrance to Water Tower Place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had been telling the truth. She really
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     live in a seventy-eight floor condo-filled high rise in the heart of Chicago. And if she'd also been telling the truth about the elevator ride, her own home was over seventy floors up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio reached down for her bag and the other supplies she had brought along, but when she grabbed for the lead, it moved too quickly. It took only a moment to register, but Rio suddenly understood what had happened even before she lifted her gaze to see Agatha coaxing Phineas to hop down out of the car so they could stroll lazily into the building together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling like the third wheel, Rio threw her sack over her shoulder and bustled around the back of the car to try and catch up to the two of them. How the fuck had Agatha just... shown up and commandeered Rio's entire existence in mere minutes? She had Phineas following her like she was waving a giant fish in front of his face, bewitched by her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there was Rio, right behind them both, doing the exact same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was quiet, observant, just pinning every point worthy of remembering that she could think of, trying to lock everything away from the over-the-top and too-large lobby to just how stupidly fucking nice the elevators were. In that building, the wealth accumulated there had to total into the billions and it showed through the interior alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas was losing his entire mind. He was pacing the elevator as they rode up, yowling so loud that trying to converse over him felt rather pointless. Rio had attempted it once, but Agatha had just tapped her ear, making a face with raised brows that stated she could not understand. The moment the door opened, Phin might as well have been a dog with the way he bolted forward, wanting out of the new and unfriendly enclosed space.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had no clue where he was going, but he didn't care. When Rio followed, she realized that it wasn't just an elevator that took them to the floor Agatha lived on. It took them directly to her apartment, which Rio should have guessed by the keycard she had swiped when they had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
     The immediate area outside of the doors was a foyer in ways, but was open and expansive. Directly across from her was a wall filled with nothing but windows that stretched from the floor all the way up to the ceiling. The furniture was of a luxury quality and there was far too much of it for just one person, but Rio already knew that Agatha
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     to live alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jesus fucking Christ, Agatha," Rio breathed, still clutching at the strap of her backpack as she knelt down to unlace her boots so she could take them off. Once righted, Rio's eyes scanned the available area again, still filled with absolute wonder that this was... it. This was Agatha's dwelling, the place she could fully be herself with no judgement.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <em>
      massive
     </em>
     and Rio was certain that she had only seen a fraction of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you buy this from Bill Gates?" Rio cracked, watching the way Agatha was just... following Phin around with the lead dangling from her fingers as he sniffed around and gauged the new space.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oprah, actually," Agatha called back over her shoulder. The answer immediately caused Rio to laugh. It was loud, a full-bellied laugh that showed just how funny she thought the joke to be. But Agatha did not look back and she did not laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shut up," Rio shot back, disbelieving as she made her approach to land at Agatha's side, watching Phin the longer he inspected anything he came into contact with. "You did not."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, but I did," Agatha responded coolly, tone steady. "Two million over asking, actually. But only because it was the cost of her leaving it fully furnished."  Agatha finally knelt down, gingerly pulling Phineas to her so that she could remove his harness. He didn't fight her, mostly because he knew it meant freedom. From her knees, Agatha's head tipped and she donned a bright but cunning grin. "Joke's on her, though. I sold everything for eight million and bought my own. Turns out, people are really willing to pay up when they see 'As Used By Oprah!' in the item description."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're being serious," Rio deduced, though the look on her face as she stared down at the beaming Agatha was certainly still filled with traces of incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course I am. Why would I lie?" she asked, standing again. She glanced over her shoulder for just a second before meeting Rio's inquisitively dark stare. "Would you like a tour?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to ask her if it was the entire floor, even if that was a stupid question. Then again, how stupid of a question was it when the elevator was her front fucking door? Instead, she decided she could probably get such an answer by telling Agatha yes.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she nodded. "That would be nice."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held out a hand, but it was one that offered direction, one that indicated that Rio should follow her, and so she did. "This is the living area, obviously, " Agatha informed her, waving toward the large sectional, the actual couch, and the two large armchairs. There were two coffee tables as well as several end tables. Even a faux stone fireplace was fitted into the wall, even if it was only for show. It added to the elegance of the space, elevated it just that much more.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dining room," she voiced as they walked over to the open space that was occupied by a table that sat ten, made out of what looked to be some kind of dark wood... Rosewood maybe? It was
     <em>
      massive
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your table's a lot bigger than mine," Rio mused with a soft chuckle. She was a step behind Agatha and could not see her face, but she knew she rolled her eyes. Rio gave a light swat to the small of her back. "Oh, come on. You can't tell me
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     don't have your own fantasies."
    </p>
    <p>
     At this, Agatha halted in place so suddenly that Rio accidentally bumped into her. She recoiled instantly, stepping back with an apology on her face as Agatha turned to face her. Rio hadn't meant to offend her, but when the look Agatha was wearing finally registered, Rio realized that wasn't what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was wearing a familiar rapacious expression that made her look so threateningly beautiful and the gleam in her eyes was nothing short of vulturine.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, Rio," she admonished, pausing only to lick her lips. "I have my fantasies. And none of them are as boring as a dining room table."
    </p>
    <p>
     Before giving Agatha's words a proper run-through, Rio caught the tail end only and pouted, her lip folding outward. She was trying to be offended, trying to act like Agatha had scorned her by calling her apartment boring in a roundabout way, but with that downright shit-stirring sparkle in her crystal blue eyes, how could she?
    </p>
    <p>
     And then she played through the entire sentence again in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a lightbulb had gone off of her head, sparked only by the electric jolt she got per understanding, Rio brightened up, a deep grin of her own forming. "Share with the class?" she prodded, but Agatha didn't bite.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Kitchen is over here. Anything not already out is likely stowed under in cabinets, such as toaster, kettle, blender."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was rattling these things off like it would be helpful to Rio, like she might need
     <em>
      any
     </em>
     of those appliances in her two day stay there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Groceries were delivered this afternoon, so help yourself." Agatha was being informative, but she was also still moving and expecting Rio to follow her. She was like a cloud, rolling over the gorgeous hardwood floors, clearly the most comfortable Rio had ever seen her within the walls of her own sanctuary.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was trying to take it all in at once, trying to absorb it all, but she already knew it was going to take some time. That thought only solidified itself when Agatha opened the first door on the right that was on the far side of the dining area. When she flipped the light on, Rio was not sure what she had been expecting, but it was not what she saw.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the windowless room was a good handful of old paintings stacked against a wall, all dingy and a bit dark from what Rio could see of them. There were a couple of high wooden tables that were covered in different metal cylinders with different warning labels on them, as well as empty containers that were likely used to mix product.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the middle of the room was a stool that was placed before an easel. On it, there was a landscape of a painting, one that was about sixty percent old and forty percent... rejuvenated.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that a Niemann? The Wight of Edmund?" Rio asked curiously before Agatha could explain the purpose of the room that was already apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know art?" Agatha asked, sounding surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not much," Rio answered with a shrug. "But enough about English art from a college friend to know what that is. And what you're doing with it." She stopped for a moment, surveying the room before she looked back to Agatha. She could have tried to hide her perplexed amusement, but she didn't. "You're full of surprises. Next thing I know, you're going to tell me it's your personal mission to put a man on the moon."
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha snorted, Rio hadn't been expecting it and cut back to her suddenly to verify that she was okay and was not choking. She was grinning again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You good?" Rio offered, but Agatha simply dismissed her with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Anyway," she segued back to their purpose for being there, "if you cannot find me, I will like be here. It's a way to keep my skills sharp and usually can make a pretty penny off of some finds."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You afford this place on turned around art?" Rio asked her, disbelieving.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I didn't say that was my only way to make money," Agatha corrected her, striding back toward the doorway as she flipped the light back off. "Just one of them."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio backed out into the hallway so that Agatha could shut the door, turning to her right to venture further down the hall. She opened the next door, revealing a spare bedroom but did not turn on the light. "There's an ensuite, but it's more just inclusive of the tour than anything you should need. But here..." She shut the door again and crossed the hall to the door on the left; Rio had noted that there were not other doors on the left, but she thought nothing of it. "Here's the true beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been expecting her bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio had
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     been expecting was a wide and spacious room that held minimal furniture -- a couple of lounge chairs and an oversized ottoman that could likely fit three people comfortably -- and had a fucking
     <em>
      pool in it.
     </em>
     It wasn't large, but it was of a decent enough size to be startling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This cannot be fucking real," Rio muttered, shaking her head. "What the fuck do you mean you have a pool in your condo?!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "In my defense," Agatha voiced, flipping on the majority of the lighting, "it came with the condo. This was not my doing. Oprah, remember?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, so she had a fair point, but still. Who the
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     had a condo with a damn pool in it?! Agatha Harkness -- shit,
     <em>
      Amelia Cohen
     </em>
     -- did. Rio was almost compelled to ask her again what she did for work, but it felt useless at that point. Agatha would tell her when she was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I still think I'm going to wake up and realize this was a fucking fever dream," Rio offered in response, and she meant it. There was no way that she had been spending the last months thinking that Agatha went home to some tiny little townhome or brownstone that blended in and made her look like everyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not expect her to be high up in her castle with her massive condo that had its small pool and room full of ancient and pricey art.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had floored Rio, truly.
    </p>
    <p>
     None of it had come close to any theories that she had spent months forming and it was more than a little jarring.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was more than Rio had been giving her credit for, and there was a
     <em>
      lot
     </em>
     of it being given there. She had just been applying it to the wrong charges.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not
     <em>
      hide.
     </em>
     She did not sulk in the shadows and try to disguise this cover identity. No, she had very clearly gained status and notoriety for choices she had made in her life. She had become
     <em>
      someone
     </em>
     to the world, Rio just had yet to figure out how. By day, Agatha had carefully crafted this persona, one that suited her needs.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, at night, she went out to bars in fancy dresses, drugged men, and then broke their necks in a barn forty minutes outside of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right, Rio remembered, she was still a murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
     A murderer with a cushy condo and more money than she clearly knew what to do with.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The bed's kinda high so make sure you don't roll out," Agatha teased back, leading Rio out of the pool room to shut the door. "Please, by the way," Agatha added, indicating the door with two fingers, "use at your leisure."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I didn't --" Rio started before she caught herself, even before Agatha grinned at her again. "No one's going to see me naked if I skinny dip, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I wouldn't say
     <em>
      no one
     </em>
     ," Agatha informed her, those little embers beginning to burn in her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Noted," Rio fired back quickly with a lively grin, one that Agatha almost missed because she was moving on to continue the tour. Once more, Rio was hot on her heels, interested to see what other surprises were held within that condo.
    </p>
    <p>
     They passed through the main area of the dwelling again to the other side, one with a much shorter hallway. There was a bathroom, a linen closet, and at the end of the hallway was one large and rather ornate door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, the true holy grail.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pressed on and pushed the door open, striding right through it into her bedroom. When Rio entered behind her, she found herself... puzzled. That was the right word, wasn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had clearly been building her own preconceived notions about what Agatha's life would look like beyond the scope of their interactions and yet, she was surprised with each and every single door Agatha opened. The bedroom was fucking
     <em>
      huge
     </em>
     , as most was in the condo, but it was also wildly impressive. There was a grand armoire against the wall, set next to a matching dresser. A chaise had been placed in the corner close to the windows, likely a good reading spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Several pieces of framed art hung on the walls, midieval pieces, ones that offered a new darkness that could not be found in the rest of the house. They were morose in fashion, think pieces, but also ones that had connotations of pain and suffering.
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     was more the Agatha that Rio had come to learn about and attempt to understand. It made perfect sense, really, that her bedroom was where she kept the visuals of those feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Against the wall to the left of the doorway was the largest bed that Rio was sure she had ever seen. That was not a California King, like the one Alice had at her house.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What the fuck is that?" Rio questioned. Agatha spun to see what it was she was pointing at, following to the bed. Her brow knit before she looked back to Rio, clearly confused.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A bed?" she answered in a question, not seeing what was hanging Rio up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "For like forty people? Is that like a Russia King or something?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughed, and while it probably shouldn't have, it made Rio feel like a total fucking idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's not a real thing," Agatha dismissed, finally pacing over to Rio to relieve her of her bag. Rio handed it over, eyes still wild over the sight of the bed. "It's an Alaska King. Hundred and eight inches by a hundred and eight inches."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, what the fuck do you need a bed this big for? Do you throw orgies here every other weekend?" Rio's line of questioning felt legitimate in her mind, but it was clear that Agatha was finding nothing in this but unadulterated humor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why? Wanna be invited?" Agatha returned over her shoulder as she moved over to the side of the bed that would clearly be Rio's for the weekend, setting her bag down by the nightstand. When she turned back, she looked pleased with herself, like she'd gotten in a dig that wouldn't hurt but might entice Rio to say something daring.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Rio's turn to not bite.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't have any televisions?" Rio asked pointlessly, not actually caring, but she hadn't caught sight of one to that point. "You have a pool, but don't like to watch Netflix?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clucked her tongue as she began to float around the border of the bed to her side. Scooping up a small remote with ease, she turned and pressed a button, one that dropped a rolled screen from the ceiling, right in front of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're
     <em>
      so fucking extra.
     </em>
     What do you need half of this shit for?!" Rio asked her, doing what she could to not fall into an endless pit of hysterical laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't need it," Agatha told her, pointed stare finding Rio across the bed. "I want it. And what I want, I take."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been kidding, mostly. She didn't
     <em>
      care,
     </em>
     exactly, that Agatha had acquired so much pointless and excessive shit, but it was more than a little mind-boggling. But Agatha's response?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's response as enough to make Rio want to vault across that gigantic bed and lift her up onto it and spend the next twelve hours bending the knew to whatever it was Agatha
     <em>
      wanted.
     </em>
     She did it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shoeless and clad only in her jeans from her work day and her half-buttoned blouse, Rio took off, clamoring up on the bed and then across it, depositing herself on her feet directly in front of Agatha, eager and willing. Before she dove straight in, she had something to say first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that why you brought me here?" Rio asked her, stepping closer so that their faces were so close she could feel Agatha's warm breath as it rolled over her lips, her chin, her cheeks. "To take me away?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Her voice had dropped low and the entire atmosphere in the room had shifted with that single statement from Agatha and the look she had been wearing to drive the point home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn't intimidated by the show Rio was putting on, but she did seem to find it appealing. She licked at her lips, eyes dropping from Rio's gaze to her lips and back up again. Agatha stepped forward with nowhere to go, forcing Rio to take a step back at the same time she raised her hands to grasp at the open collar of Rio's blouse. It was a way to keep her close, to make sure she didn't try to get away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't going
     <em>
      anywhere.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well?" Rio challenged, an obvious enticement to get Agatha to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I brought you here," Agatha told her, voice low and gravelly, "because I think you needed a little more freedom than you'd ever find in your routine."
    </p>
    <p>
     It sounded like a threat, but it was an
     <em>
      exciting
     </em>
     one.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what am I supposed to do with that freedom?" Rio questioned back, voice only slightly louder than a whisper. Her head had moved forward slightly, just enough that she could
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     Agatha's lips so very close to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Whatever you want,"
     </em>
     Agatha whispered back, but she didn't let Rio offer a quip in return before she bit down on her lower lip, pulling on it in a taunt that made Rio's stomach bubble with lava.
    </p>
    <p>
     The move in and of itself felt crippling to Rio's thought process, as if her brain had been tossed into a blender that was whirring at full speed. It was why what came out of her mouth severely lacked finesse and any trace of tact.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "All I want to do is you,"
     </em>
     she managed, sounding nearly choked by how suddenly turned on she felt with their proximity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't quite laugh, but a breath of one left her in some state of amused horniness, but the second it was over, it was
     <em>
      on.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jerking on Rio's collar, Agatha's grip of both hands tightened as their lips collided in a messy and chaotic kiss, one that did not stay solely lip-on-lip. Suddenly, there were teeth in lips and tongues in mouths. It was a flurry of who could kiss harder, who could kiss deeper, and Rio never wanted it to end. If anything, she wanted Agatha to throw her around, right onto that bed, and let their night and her tour -- this time of Agatha's body -- truly begin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still holding onto that collar, it felt like Agatha was absolutely gunning it in terms of fervor and desperation, but Rio's hands showed more restlessness. They had landed on Agatha's hips when the kiss began, but they were moving before long. They roamed her sides, her back, her hips, her ass.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha had shifted them, pressing Rio's own ass to the side of the bed, every single green light in Rio's brain was lit up, bright and undeniable. She was fucking
     <em>
      ready.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as Agatha's lips tore from hers and pressed instead to her neck, Rio's heart nearly beating out of her chest in anticipation, there was a trilling from the main part of the condo, a ringing that did not sound like a phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     There it was again.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a groan, Agatha lifted her head and separated them with a look that said she was both sorry and annoyed she had forgotten something.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she left the room, Rio simply... blinked. What had just happened?
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning to follow her, Rio spotted Agatha by the elevator doors, pressing a button that was located within a gold plate on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes?" she nearly snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ms Cohen, your order from Wollensky's is on its way up. Wanted to notify you in case you missed the notification." It was a woman's voice, one that sounded professional and crisp, one that sounded like she knew who it was she was talking to, even if she had no clue at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ooh,
     <em>
      and
     </em>
     a nice dinner in? You really did think of it all, didn't you?" Rio teased, approaching Agatha's side in front of the elevator doors.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Agatha responded flatly, though Rio swore she could hear... irritation?
    </p>
    <p>
     "No? What didn't you think of?" she questioned back, looking over to Agatha's profile beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How hard it was going to be to walk away from wanting to fuck you to fulfill priorly established obligations."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," Rio mused, rocking onto the balls of her feet with a vicious grin. "Suppose I'll just have to make it up to you later then, won't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Agatha looked over at her, a grin of equal measure filling her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I suppose you will."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
     Up in that ivory tower, life was different.
    </p>
    <p>
     That much was becoming more apparent with each and every moment Rio spent with Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood back, simply watching as Agatha collected the bags from the cart in the otherwise empty elevator and turned to face her, once more wearing that Cheshire-like grin. A bag dangling from each finger, she surged forward and blew right by Rio, who was left marinating in her awe and confusion for just a moment before she brought herself to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I didn't know what to actually order for you, so... There's chicken, there's steak, truffle mac and cheese and a couple of salads to choose from. I didn't want to be
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     asshole, but I also did not want to wait even later or it would have been eleven before it got here."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was rambling. She was talking and talking like Rio would have given a shit either way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't care.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was too fixated on the fact that Agatha had clearly indicated there was a full refrigerator and she had still ordered them a
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     nice meal. More than that, she'd ordered
     <em>
      too much
     </em>
     because she did not want to control Rio's choices or force her hand even in a matter as small as a meal.
    </p>
    <p>
     The longer Rio existed in the condo, the more she was beginning to actually figure Agatha out. This whole charge, the removal of lives who wrought nothing but pain, it was vigilantism in a true form. Agatha wasn't a bad person, not inherently. Did she make terrible choices in the name of what she thought was right? Perhaps. But... In no reality could someone who cared enough to provide options and comfort to someone they found interest in be
     <em>
      bad.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "The chicken and salad would be okay," Rio informed her, landing at the opposite corner of the table. She glanced down at the bounty Agatha had unpacked as she began to sort it, setting Rio's food toward where she was standing before gathering her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     When her head lifted and they were eye-to-eye again, the expression that found Agatha was somehow softer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Would you like to eat in here? Or at the island in the kitchen?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shot a glance to the stools in assessment before making her decision, though it felt more natural anyway, despite her snap to choose.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can we eat over there? This table is kind of intimidating," she admitted with a light shrug. It might have sounded stupid, but it was just the two of them. They didn't need to sit at a table that was meant to hold eight more people to enjoy their meal together. Maybe what Rio really felt about it was that it was just so
     <em>
      impersonal.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio collected her things and departed for the island, sliding onto the stool easily. When Agatha sat next to her a moment later with two glasses of wine, she didn't move her own stool and it left their knees just barely touching on Rio's left side.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't much from an objective perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
     From Rio's perspective, it was a small showing of Agatha's presence, a way for her to assert that she was
     <em>
      there
     </em>
     , that she was existing in the moment with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     They ate in relative silence for the most part, though Rio had commented a couple of times that the food was phenomenal. When Agatha let her steal a bite of the macaroni and cheese, Rio had nearly fallen off of her stool with how good it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now she understood why Miranda Priestly liked Smith &amp; Wollensky's so much.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they were almost finished, Rio found herself with a question, one she could bite back no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When you're here alone, do you eat at the table?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It might have seemed like a stupid question, but Rio had her reasons for asking. She wanted to know if Agatha, this confident and bordering on arrogant woman, sat at the head of that cherrywood table and looked out at the endless expanse of city and night sky on her own, contemplating all there was for her to contemplate.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I do," Agatha answered, laying her napkin on the countertop so that she could collect her wine. The way she sipped at it told Rio she was not going to elaborate.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Rio would make her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not take a beat, did not reflect on the answer she provided, she just simply gave it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because that's what it's for."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's lips twisted, her brow furrowing as she contemplated the several layers to that answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Top layer: The obvious. Agatha was right. That was what it was for.
     <br/>
     Middle layer: It gave Agatha a place to be, if only for a meal.
     <br/>
     Bottom layer: It was a nightly reminder of just how empty her life was and how no one chose to occupy those seats.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe they should have eaten dinner at the table, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     There would still be time for that.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Would you like more wine?" Agatha questioned, gathering the remnants of their meal to throw away, which she got up immediately after to do. "We can migrate to the living room, watch television, whatever you'd like to do."
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't being stiff or cold, but Rio could see that she might have touched a nerve. It wasn't intentional, but her curiosity had gotten the best of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Glancing over her shoulder, Rio found herself facing the same observation she'd found earlier in the evening, one she had even pointed out. "There's no --" she began, but when she looked back to Agatha, she had already figured it out. "You're going to tell me it's in the wall, aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't speak, but she did offer a light nod of affirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're obnoxious," Rio accused with a roll of her eyes. She gathered her glass and slid off of the stool, but instead of departing to the living room, she appeared at Agatha's side, giving her a light nudge as she held up her glass, thanking her softly when she refilled it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was almost strange to see Agatha appear so... docile.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't seem like she was upset, or having any second thoughts about having asked Rio to stay, but the air of calm she was carrying around her was new. As such, it was leaving Rio wondering more and more if this was who Agatha really was, who she could be when no one else was watching.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio was watching. And Agatha was still choosing to unwind, to stop carrying that arrogant and haughty aura around her like a full-bodied shield.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was Agatha at peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     It just happened to be a little jarring.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Rio had expected for her to be different, but she wasn't sure this was the form she thought it might take.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once Agatha emptied the bottle into her glass and set it aside to be disposed of, she turned to Rio and held her glass out expectantly. Rio eyed it for a moment, then found herself looking back to Agatha in question, as if waiting for her to offer a toast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha considered for a moment, her lips pulling into a warm smile, one that was startling only in that Rio was quite certain she had never seen Agatha smile that way since they had met.
    </p>
    <p>
     "To the weekend," she offered, raising the glass a little more. In the time it took Rio to blink, Agatha's smile deepend into a grin, almost threatening. "And to all the fun we may have within it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Now that, Rio could toast to.
    </p>
    <p>
     "To our fun," Rio returned with a bright grin of her own, clinking their glasses softly together.
    </p>
    <p>
     After their toast, the two of them meandered to the living room and settled into the sectional with the tiniest bit of space between them, just enough for Rio to
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     it was there. The snarkiest laugh escaped her when Agatha gathered a remote and pressed a button, causing a section of the wall to slide down. As it did, it revealed an 86" television behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, I hate you," Rio shot with a laugh. "Do you really... I mean. I know I already asked... But is it necessary?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is anything?" Agatha asked back with a flash of teeth before the television sprang to life. The size of it alone was enough to draw attention, but the sounds that emanated in accordance did not come from the television. They came from... everywhere?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Of course this extra-ass bitch had surround sound.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Here," Agatha voiced, holding out the remote as an offering, proof that Rio more than had a say in the things she had planned for them. It was underhanded, quiet. It was a whispering of 'what you have to say and what you think matters to me.' It felt... almost
     <em>
      soft
     </em>
     in its generosity, but Rio let the thought pass by instead of trying to cling to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Remote in hand, Rio took little time in heading to the Peacock app before throwing on the original run of Unsolved Mysteries. When Agatha saw the title tile, she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I should not be shocked," she mused, but silenced herself with a sip of her wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a strange charge to the air as they sat, a mere inch apart, and watched television together like they were longtime friends who did this on the nights they got too bored. It wasn't a bad thing, persay, but it was a feeling that Rio had not anticipated only in that she had never expected it out of Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio thought about Agatha, she thought about the power, the beauty, the attitude. She thought about the women that likely came through her revolving door -- which was actually a fucking elevator -- and the endless hours of sex she probably had. Rio thought about her hosting dinner parties and big events for the tens of people she knew and had charmed with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio thought about Agatha, she didn't think about her lounging around on a couch or perched on a stool restoring old artwork. She didn't stop to consider the image of her making herself a smoothie, or sitting at a large table, eating her meal alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was gripping at Rio most was her inability to use every bit of this to understand Agatha. Some of her questions were answering themselves the longer the night wore on, but not many. Agatha was still... a mystery? A riddle? An improbable amalgamation of an insane set of circumstances?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was all of those things and more.
    </p>
    <p>
     The episode drew to a close and the credits began, but before Rio could move onto the next one, Agatha was on her feet, picking up both of the empty wine glasses. "I'm going to open another bottle," she offered, heading toward the kitchen. "Would you like more?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I would, thank you," Rio offered back, sinking back a little further into the couch. For the briefest second, she caught a flash of grey out of the corner of her eye, the tip of a tail as it swung back and forth from underneath the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, good.
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas had found himself somewhere to hide.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha returned, Rio thanked her once more for the wine and picked up the remote to begin the next episode. As Agatha sat down, though, she made a deliberate choice.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat almost
     <em>
      on top
     </em>
     of Rio. There was no overlap, but only because she slid down enough that their thighs were flush, pressed together without an inch of space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was sweating instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Up to that point, it had almost been painfully similar to her dynamic with Alice. They hung out, they drank, they watched TV and shot the shit. It was casual, it was relaxed, but most of all, it was platonic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever the fuck was going on between her and Agatha was nowhere near
     <em>
      romantic
     </em>
     but it sure as fuck wasn't platonic. Agatha was providing a very real reminder of that by her choice of placement, as well as the way her hand settled on Rio's thigh when she leaned back after depositing her wine glass on the coffee table.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were still clad in their daywear, but Agatha had shed her blazer and waistcoat, leaving her only in a blouse that she had loosened up a bit more by popping a couple of extra buttons. Rio was still in her jeans and blouse, too, despite the fact that she could have made the choice to change and get more comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had felt pointless.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew she was going to end up naked regardless of what she was wearing, so what was the sense in changing?
    </p>
    <p>
     The episode began to play, but it held her attention for only a couple of minutes. She was trying to focus, trying to put her attention on the television and not how Agatha's hand was sat warmly on the top of her thigh. It had been going decently, at least right up until she felt Agatha's fingertips begin to dance along the inseam of her jeans, then up along the top of her thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was deliberate and calculated, a call for her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't heed it, at least not right away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Rio sipped at her wine and tried to seem as distracted by the 90's television program as she possibly could. The higher Agatha traced up that inseam with each pass she made, the more difficult that became. Rio was trying to hold out, trying to make Agatha work for it for once, but what was the use?
    </p>
    <p>
     The very moment Agatha's touch met the denim-covered apex between her thighs, Rio's resolve had been thoroughly smashed. She leaned forward, sliding the glass onto the table with a quickness and then began to move, rearranging herself on the couch so that she could toss a leg over Agatha's lap. Her hands landed on Agatha's shoulders, her face hanging above the other woman's in a falsely menacing fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?" Agatha questioned innocently, though that daring look in her eyes gave her away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's fingers wrapped tightly into the fabric of Agatha's blouse, though she did not make any kind of pull using that hold. No, Rio was simply just... feeling Agatha's existence between her fingertips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know what you've been doing," Rio muttered back, dropping her head just enough that their lips were but a breath apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you mad?" Agatha posed, feigning innocence again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could have answered, but why?
    </p>
    <p>
     Why would she answer when she could just kiss Agatha to make her stop talking instead?
    </p>
    <p>
     So, she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dropping that much more -- which, really, was maybe half an inch -- their lips met in a warm kiss, one that was full and sincere, but not quite soft. Nothing the two of them were capable of together would
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     be considered soft. It was why Rio was so enthralled, why she let herself get so wrapped up in every single bad thing Agatha was, and had no doubts about doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     That abnormal kiss lasted only a few seconds before it seemed to catch up to Agatha that she had fallen out of her primal facade and thus, might have given Rio the idea that the door was open to any kind of tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was quick to course correct.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha kissed her back was nothing short of deprived, starved. Her lips were rough, her tongue was demanding. Everything Agatha poured into that kiss was everything Rio had left out of it at first, and Rio was eating it up.
    </p>
    <p>
     This had been inevitable. It was always inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe they... Maybe they were inevitable, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being susceptible to Agatha's influence was always going to happen, no matter how hard she might have tried to stop it. It didn't matter where they were, what they were doing beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
     This?
    </p>
    <p>
     This hot, heavy, bottomless pit of agonizing desperation?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was who they were, and who they might always be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Loosening her hold on Agatha's collar, one of Rio's hands slid around the back of her neck, pressured fingertips hooking in along her vertebrae. It was a firm hold, a statement of her presence outside of that wild and untamed kiss, the one that had Agatha's tongue scouring her mouth for every bit of Rio she could devour.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio provided pushback, another showing that she was an active and eager participant, aching to be closer, to put up a fight, to prove to Agatha that she had not made a mistake by bringing her there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever had been falling over them that night, it seemed but a mere memory as they devolved into the passion that was so ready to drown them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tongues were strong and deprived, seeking out anything and everything they could get. Lips were rough as they rubbed, and the moment Rio broke them apart for a breath, teeth -- Agatha's teeth -- were sharp as they found purchase in Rio's lower lip as they had earlier and gave a pull. She moaned in automatic response, her hips rocking down just as Agatha's hands found them, gripping at them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmmm, s'that all you got?" Rio murmured, tone husky and uneven the moment Agatha released her hold of enamel on flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Be careful what you wish for" Agatha returned, tone haughty and sharp as it matched that expression she was wearing. She was biting back, giving Rio the banter she was clearly seeking while simultaneously applying pressure to her hips, pressure that granted friction.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh, Agatha,
     </em>
     " Rio breathed at her, sliding her hand from around the back of Agatha's neck to cradle her jaw, thumb landing directly in the center of Agatha's bottom lip.
     <em>
      "I wish for you always, even when I can't have you."
     </em>
     It was true, but it was also something for Agatha to chew on while Rio pressed down on her lip, revealing her lower row of teeth before she kissed the upper one, sucking it softly between her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     That declaration did something to Agatha. She was shifting, almost
     <em>
      writhing
     </em>
     beneath Rio's weight while concurrently pressing down on Rio's hips, as if it would offer her any kind of release. She let out the softest whine of displeasure, very obviously wanting more, much in the way Rio constantly did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, Rio wanted Agatha so bad it fucking hurt. It hurt in the way her heart was hammering into her ribs, and it hurt in the sheer pounding between her legs. It was the pulse of her yearning mixed with her lust and it was never going to end until she got what she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Until she got Agatha, every last bit of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss she had initiated never fully formed, left abandoned by the way Rio dropped her head to the crook of Agatha's neck, kissing and nipping at the warm skin there gently, a light taunting. Agatha was groaning instantly, shifting and wiggling more and more as Rio seemed to be pressing every correct button in driving her wild.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was new, Rio being in Agatha's lap and wielding
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     control, but she could tell that it was leaving Agatha feeling quite restless.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed higher, sucked a little harder -- though the first time Agatha smacked her on the back of the head again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm being careful!" Rio growled in defense, biting Agatha's earlobe instead. The movie pulled a low, long moan from deep within Agatha's lungs, one that Rio hadn't exactly expected. Her body answered in kind, hips rocking again in an attempt to find relief from the intense throbbing that felt damn near crippling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another bite a little higher caused Agatha's hands to grip tighter, pushing again as her own hips raised to meet the contact, though there had not been but a hair of space between them to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Ohhhhh, mmmm, Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio rasped in her ear. She felt it acutely as Agatha's hands moved, sliding around to land on either side of her ass, gripping and kneading in her desperation. It was melting Rio further, reducing her into nothing more than a turned-on pile of mush.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once again, just from a make-out session, Rio was certain her underwear were soaked.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was quite insane, really, how all Agatha had to do was just touch her and she was ready to dissolve into a puddle of cum, waiting to be lapped up and swallowed whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha was grabbing at her, it was firing her up, setting off multiple little explosions inside of her brain that wanted more,
     <em>
      ached
     </em>
     for more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hungry lips were back on the attack, kissing Agatha's chin, the corner of her mouth, and then her lips in a kiss that somehow drew a new heat more intense than the one before it. Her hands were moving, rubbing and flexing into Agatha's shoulders, her torso. In doing so, Rio realized something that annoyed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were both still fully clothed.
    </p>
    <p>
     To remedy that, Rio's fingers were quick and deft as they dropped to blindly pop the buttons of Agatha's blouse. The moment she was done, she grabbed the open ends of the shirt and was first pulling, encouraging Agatha to sit up just slightly, and then pushing, getting that blouse off of her as quick as she could manage.
    </p>
    <p>
     The true miracle there was that their lips had not parted once through the accomplishment of such a task.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was certain by the time Agatha severed it to kiss at her neck that not only were her own jeans completely soaked, but she had most likely stained the front of Agatha's trousers, too. She didn't care.
    </p>
    <p>
     She especially didn't care when Agatha bit down with force into the side of her neck, ripping a strangled and feral moan straight from her, so deep it began in her belly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha," Rio managed, though it was a choked cry as Agatha bit at her skin again, this time toward her shoulder. "Agatha, I need you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Truer words had never fallen from Rio's lips before.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a couple more kisses placed along the length of her neck as Agatha's hands applied a pressured pacing to her hips and ass, Rio knew she wasn't going to last.
    </p>
    <p>
     She needed it,
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     Agatha and she was willing to do anything to get there.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha was taking her time.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it was driving Rio insane.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her lips still kissing and sucking at the upper portion of Rio's neck, as well as her ear, Agatha had apparently decided that being the only one in her bra was no longer tolerable. She was humming contentedly against Rio's skin, distracting her from the feeling of Agatha's fingers as they worked each button free.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she was finished, she pulled her head back only to get the garment off, tossing it aside unceremoniously before snapping her attention back to what was right in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was right there, and she would have done just about anything Agatha asked of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a good thing that Agatha's following ask was an easy one.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Bra. Off."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was quick to comply, reaching back to unfasten the clasp along her spine so that it gave way with ease. At the exact same time, Agatha sat up enough to do the same, shucking the garment before plucking Rio's the rest of the way off her arms so she could throw them both behind the couch, little care to where they landed.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, it seemed as though Agatha had more important things to be paying attention to. It was apparent by the way Agatha was looking at her, taking a moment to stare at those perfect, perky breasts Rio had always been so proud of, and her vast scape of smooth and tanned skin. Those critical blue eyes raised, lifting higher until they landed in Rio's darker ones and Rio saw what it was that Agatha truly wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was her.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the very same way she wanted Agatha, Agatha wanted her right back. And that felt fucking incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We need to move," Agatha husked, her breathing a little heavy and her eyes just wild enough that Rio could see her sudden urge to want to relocate.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio began to comply by removing herself, she was surprised as Agatha's hands landed with a rough smack to both of her thighs.
     <em>
      "Nuhuh,"
     </em>
     she muttered, pulling Rio closer, so close that Rio wished for a second that they were already naked and Agatha was hip-deep inside of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was still time.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had an entire weekend ahead of them, and if they did nothing but stay locked in that condo, void of clothing and any rational sense about having an itinerary, Rio would have been happy.
    </p>
    <p>
     She would likely leave Agatha's place feeling like she did the first morning after they'd been together that initial time, wobbly and sore with a new awareness of certain parts of her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that would have been fucking fantastic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to raise question, tried to ask Agatha why she was keeping her there if she was so insistent that they needed to relocate, but Agatha provided a wordless answer -- not soundless, as she released a couple of grunts in the process -- in the way she scooted forward toward the lip of the couch, Rio still poised on top of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a familiar motion to when Agatha had picked her up off of the dining room table in her apartment days before, Agatha's arms secured around and under Rio so that she could stand, lifting them both to full height.
    </p>
    <p>
     Under any other circumstances, Rio might have squealed or let out a tickled sound of delight, but that was not on her list of committable actions. Instead, her face dropped into the crook of Agatha's neck but before she placed any kisses there, she let out a relatively emphatic moan, one that echoed the slightest bit off the walls around them.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could feel in both spots as Agatha's hold tightened, keeping her close. Her face lifted from the sanctuary of Agatha's neck so that she could kiss hungrily at her ear, her jaw, her cheek. The only reason she chose not to escalate it further was because Agatha was guiding them and if Rio chose to distract her? Well, ending up with her back being slammed into the corner of a doorframe didn't see the best way to spend their weekend.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio's back was getting blown out that weekend, it wasn't going to be because of some stupid fucking doorframe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Making their return to the bedroom, Rio was still kissing at Agatha's skin, licking tauntingly at the shell of her ear in ways that drew the most strangled noises from deep within Agatha's throat. She was also anticipating that Agatha, much like she had before, was going to toss her directly onto the bed to begin her assault.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which was why it was a shock to the system when Agatha set her on her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her brow wrinkled, but Agatha was back on the prowl, holding her face, kissing her again with a fervor that felt positively intoxicating. It was more lips, more tongue, more moans and more hands until finally, Agatha was reaching between them to unfasten Rio's jeans and shove them with haste down her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was quick to return the favor, but she lacked the amount of finesse that Agatha had seemed to exude in the act. Still, Rio didn't care, and Agatha didn't seem to, either.
    </p>
    <p>
     All Rio cared about was getting to feel Agatha again in the most pleasurable way imaginable. She was quick to communicate as much through quick but hungry kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I. Want. You. Now. Agatha. Please."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Every word punctuated by another hungry lip lock, increasing in demand until Agatha was the one to sever it completely, leaving Rio confused once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't waste even a single second before she was shedding her underwear, her last remaining article of clothing. Snapping to attention, Rio did the same, leaving them bare and naked before one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was when Agatha reached for her hand, securing it gently in her own grip, that Rio wondered what fucking planet they had landed on that Agatha was
     <em>
      holding her fucking hand.
     </em>
     She didn't ask aloud, didn't try to gain any understanding. Instead, she just followed as Agatha gently guided her through the room and toward what appeared to be a closet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once inside, Rio realized it
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     a closet, one that was big enough to be an entirely new bedroom. That, too, was a very Agatha thing to have existed, just another showing of exuberance and overcompensation that was disguised in wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What are we --?" Rio started to ask, but Agatha was pulling her further inside, turning toward the right as they ventured deeper in.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she came to a halt, it was in front of an antique looking chest, leather with gold fastenings around the corners. It didn't seem out of place, but it
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     feel a little too regal to be shoved into the back of a closet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stopped beside her, fingers still wrapped snugly in Agatha's grasp as her dark gaze lifted. She found Agatha grinning down at the receptacle before her, already knowing what was inside. Rio, on the other hand, had zero clue what to expect when Agatha knelt down to open it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once she unhooked the lock and lifted the lid?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's jaw dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      OH.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     This was Agatha's toybox.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was where the fun was kept, where she stowed the things that gave her power, that let her be
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     who she wanted to be. Rio had officially entered Agatha's domain, and yet...
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright," Agatha voiced, pushing off her knees to stand up again. "Choice is yours."
    </p>
    <p>
     The choice? What choice? Rio glanced to the chest, seeing the several silicone -- and one glass -- dildoes lined up neatly next to one another in order of length. They were different colors, different girths. It was a literal toybox, anything and everything that Agatha could have ever wanted or needed to keep her content and satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, Rio understood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wanted Rio to choose what it was she wanted to be fucked with.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning her head to gauge Rio's expression, Agatha was wearing a look as she did so that was downright fucking evil. She knew that she was putting Rio on the spot, that she was turning up the heat
     <em>
      that much more
     </em>
     to try and see if she might rattle.
    </p>
    <p>
     While Rio was entirely floored by the fact that she was being offered the option, she knew it was also a power play for Agatha, trying to make her squirm.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't going to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she was shocked, sure, but she wasn't going to cower from the opportunity. No, Rio would choose every single time to rise to the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally lifting her eyes from her options and taking in that deadly smirk on Agatha's lips, Rio straightened up the slightest bit, meeting her evenly. Her expression was placid, at first, but quickly, a smile grew that was bright, but it was also dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha might have started the fire, but Rio was the one who appeared to be holding the can of fuel to dump onto it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was she turned on? Of course. Did she wanted to reach in and grab whatever one her fingers touched first? Absolutely. Did it really matter in the long run what she chose when they could, and likely would, try something else if the need were to arise? Not at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as Rio simply stepped forward, purposely brushing her arm against Agatha's right breast as she passed, she was ready to play the game Agatha seemed to think she was so damn good at.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knelt, much as Agatha had, before the chest and peered inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were six options to choose from, seven if she counted the glass one, but that felt better suited for another night, not that one. Nothing was outrageous or meant to have true shock value, but the latter two on the right side were
     <em>
      impressive
     </em>
     , if not visually appealing. The former two... they were out based on length alone, but Rio still picked up the first one on the far left.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was roughly five inches, maybe a little more. The clear exterior, ridged and ribbed in specific ways, showed the pink interior; Rio knew what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Glow in the dark, huh?" she questioned, lifting her head to peer up at Agatha with a sharp and mischievous grin. Agatha didn't say anything, although Rio had been hoping she would, and just flicked her gaze toward the chest again. It was very apparent that she already knew Rio wasn't going to want it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing that her plan was working and Agatha was beginning to rile, Rio slowly laid it back down and picked up the one next to it, seemingly careful in the inspection that followed. It was slightly larger, but it was bigger around and the entire shaft was swirled in two different shades of purple, one dark one light. It would have worked just fine, but if this was how their weekend was beginning?
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to leave a mark.
    </p>
    <p>
     And also, she wanted Agatha to leave hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next one, a lilac that was a gradient into an aqua blue, was about the same length as the one Rio had at home, but the shape was different. There was a heavier girth toward the top, curved a little more than the others. It was tempting, but she set it back down.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd known, almost the moment she saw the collection, that the fourth one was the one she would likely go for. When she went to reach for it, Agatha stomped her foot and let out a frustrated grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay! You made your fucking point! Would you just
     <em>
      pick one?!"
     </em>
     she all but demanded, staring down at Rio expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio tipped her head back to peer up at her, a lazy grin pulled at her lips, showing just enough teeth to be annoying.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's the matter,
     <em>
      my queen?
     </em>
     " Rio drawled back, acting as if she had no idea why Agatha was growing agitated. "Is it only you that gets to be an absolute shit?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," she snapped back. "Move it along, would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Still grinning, Rio's chin dropped and she grabbed hold on the fourth dildo in the line; it was a decent girth and, if she had to guess, it was seven inches. The one next to it appeared to be eight and while that felt like a challenge, it was their inaugural night in Agatha's home and Rio didn't want to wreck herself night one before she had the opportunity to check herself first.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The one she chose, it was a tie-dye like pattern, but in pinks and purples and oranges. It was the shape that had convinced her; the way the last inch or so curled up was designed to reach her g-spot. Rio knew that by presenting Agatha with such an option, she was going to try a little harder at something she
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     , even if Rio had informed her it was an impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Agatha
     <em>
      thought
     </em>
     she might be able to make Rio squirt, it might convince her to go a little harder, to toss out any reservations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wouldn't hurt to find out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or if it did, it would be in the most delightful way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Feeling brave, are we?" Agatha called from behind her, arrogance thick on her words like venom.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If I was feeling brave I would have gone far right," Rio told her with a soft snort, pushing to her feet. When she turned to face Agatha, they were almost a mirror image of sinister desire, corners of all four eyes wrinkled as a direct result of mischievous grins. Rio broke first, posing a question. "Do I get to choose your harness too, or do you have a favorite?"
    </p>
    <p>
     For the briefest moment, Agatha's expression wavered and Rio could see that she'd knocked her the
     <em>
      slightest bit
     </em>
     off balance, just enough to throw her. She hadn't been expecting Rio to keep pushing, to keep putting up a small fight. Once it wore off, she looked... thrilled?
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you insist."
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck. She's better than I thought.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     In the safety of Agatha's home, playing these little mind games didn't feel so dangerous. It didn't feel like there was much to lose in that whatever happened between them, the worst result was her winding up at home with Phineas, sad and alone, before the end of the weekend. While it would have been the worst, it also felt the least likely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took the few steps over to a tall chest of drawers, pulling open the second one down before waving a hand to indicate that the choice was once again Rio's to make.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a kid in a candy store, Rio giggled and pressed forward, forking her first selection over to Agatha so that she could make her second. There were fewer options on that front, but four was still a reasonable amount of harnesses to own when you were filthy fucking rich. That was made even more apparent by the quality, the design.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could feel Agatha just behind her, almost as if she were breathing down her neck, willing her to hurry it along and make a damn choice. Rio ran an exploratory finger along them, some of the straps. There was one, the straps
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     like silk, but the rainbow pattern on them was indicative that they were not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Based on that alone, Rio grabbed for it, even more convinced when Agatha let out a light hum behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are we going pride themed tonight?" she teased lowly, finally cutting through the space she had been instilling between them while she allowed Rio to make her decisions. Her hands landed on Rio's hips, but the left one couldn't lock in due to the dildo that pressed to Rio's skin, keeping them apart in that one spot. The right one, however, made up for it, grip strong and rough right into Rio's hipbone.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried to answer, but the way Agatha reached up to move her hair so that she could kiss along the length of Rio's neck distracted her. It forced her to draw in a sharp breath, not having been steeled for the contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     "N-Not intentionally," she answered honestly, but she didn't think Agatha actually gave a shit. it was another way she could dig and prod and annoy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do y'wanna put it on my couch?" Agatha inquired lowly, pressing yet another button. "I don't mind the steam cleaning bill."
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio hadn't already been red from head to toe because of the heat pooling in her stomach, it would have happened immediately at such a remark. All she found herself capable of was shaking her head, forcing out the meekest response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Need it to be you."
    </p>
    <p>
     With another playful bite, Agatha released Rio's hip, but only to run her palm down her forearm to her hand, gently plucking the harness from her grasp. She was still kissing, though, still nipping and licking at Rio's neck for just a moment longer until she separated them completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't feel her, not her hold, not her front as it pressed to Rio's back. She was just gone and for a quick moment, Rio felt
     <em>
      cold.
     </em>
     And then, with the heat of a thousand suns, Agatha's words set her on fucking fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go get on the bed." It was a deep and rich command, one that made Rio's knees buckle beneath her. When she turned, Agatha was staring her down, daring her to provide any fight. Rio considered it, if only for hope that Agatha would choose to just completely manhandle her to get her there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, there was plenty of time ahead of them to push the limits.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Which continent?" Rio offered sarcastically. It appeared as though she was going to listen, but as she began to pass by Agatha, she was stopped by a sudden and firm hold on her jaw. Her eyes were wide as they cut to Agatha who was once more looking at her like she were an entire meal. There was something more there, something
     <em>
      hotter.
     </em>
     Something... far more intense.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That mouth," Agatha admonished, clucking her tongue. "It's going to get you in an awful lot of trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha spoke to her, that look in her eyes, the pressure of her fingertips as they pressed into Rio's jaw, they were all culminating to overload her senses in the most intense way. In spite of it, Rio managed to form an answer anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can't wait to see how much."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a little muffled by the way Agatha was holding her face, pressing slightly into her cheeks, but it still landed
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     how she hoped it would, causing the flush on Agatha's skin to deepen. When she barked her next command, her voice sounded positively starved.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Bed. Now."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't quite shove Rio away, but there was a light push back as Agatha released Rio to obey her command, watching her expectantly. This time, her demand struck a cord within Rio, one that vibrated through her entire body before settling right between her legs. She nodded and scampered off to vault onto the bed, placing herself near the top, directly in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
     With just a couple of moments to herself, Rio should have found herself asking all of the questions that made sense. She should have been asking herself what she thought she was doing, who she thought she was to be tangling herself in Agatha this way.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have asked herself if this was the best idea, but then she thought about the conversation they had over dinner, the one where Agatha was vulnerable, if only for the blink of an eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was what Rio
     <em>
      wanted.
     </em>
     It didn't matter to her that it could have been questionable or controversial.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     , she thought as her hand began to wander, landing in her own slick to tease and caress, was for Agatha to take anything and everything from her that she dared to. She could take it all and Rio wouldn't have cared. It wouldn't have mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
     What mattered was that she was where she needed to be, completely dripping and waiting to be fucked into the next century by the most vexing and visually stunning woman Rio knew she had ever laid eyes on.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been of that mind before Agatha stepped out of that closet, but when she finally made her appearance?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt like she could cum on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     The room itself had fallen dark, but the light on in the closet lit Agatha up in the most breathtaking way. The shadows licked at her, dripping down her form to that secure harness and the seven inch protrusion at the front of it. In her hand was a bottle, likely lube -- but Rio wasn't sure she would need it -- and she looked as fucking primed and raring to go as a human being possibly could.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You just gonna stand there?" Rio realized, interrupting the feast that Agatha was consuming with her eyes. The sight of Rio on that bed, fingers teasing her hot and deprived sex. They'd been playing this game, but Rio was tired of waiting. "Or are you going to get the fuck over here and make me regret running my mouth?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could see it, the way Agatha's posture stiffened and that wild look flashed bright across her eyes: Rio's challenge was only going to make this worse for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     what Rio was banking on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not bolt toward the bed but instead began a leisurely stroll around it, taking her time as she dropped a bit of the lube into her palm. She was watching Rio the entire time, even as she reached down to run her hand over the shaft between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was cruel, Rio thought, the way she was fucking
     <em>
      dragging this out.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     So Rio could be cruel right back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Breaking their eye contact, Rio's head tipped back as she began more deliberate motions with her fingers. She was circling her clit as a show that if Agatha was going to take too long, Rio was going to satisfy
     <em>
      herself.
     </em>
     And she was not going to be quiet about that, evidenced by the enticing moan she let out.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a cry of "I can do it all by myself!" that was meant to spur Agatha on.
    </p>
    <p>
     That time, it worked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hoisted herself onto the bed and wasted no time in making her way -- stalking was actually probably a better word for it -- toward where Rio was poised against the pillows, pleasuring herself because Agatha was simply taking too long.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a rough grab around Rio's wrist, Agatha was suddenly on top of her and forcing her hand away, clearly displeased with her antics.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Impatient, are we?"Agatha snapped at her, pinning her wrist to the bed so that she could support her own weight as she loomed over Rio, ominous and hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio struggled the most minute amount, nothing more than show as she stared up into those burning blue eyes, her own dark and nearly nothing but pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Could probably do the job better myself anyway," Rio leered back, a dangerous smirk finding her lips. She wanted to keep going, to root a little deeper. As she opened her mouth to speak, any sounds she tried to make were swallowed whole by Agatha as she sealed their lips together in another sweltering kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     The duration of it was too short, but when Agatha pulled away, it seemed as though their prolonging this had lasted long enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you want?"Agatha asked her and Rio immediately understood
     <em>
      what
     </em>
     it was she was wanting to know.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a light touch to the center of Agatha's chest and their faces remaining a breath apart in their movement, Rio gently pushed Agatha back. With no shame and no hesitation, Rio repositioned herself, turning over so that she could post herself firmly on his hands and knees.
    </p>
    <p>
     The deep, satisfied laughter that sounded behind her was fucking sinister, and it only turned Rio on more. So much so that she found herself begging.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "
     </em>
     Please. I need this. I need
     <em>
      you, Agatha."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was both honest and a ploy to provide encouragement, to turn up the heat just that little bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha met her cry.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was moving, placing herself behind Rio as palms met hips and began to explore, to feel, to simply touch. They wandered up her sides and down her back. They caressed and then grabbed at her ass, causing her to moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio did
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     realize was that she had adjusted the strap within the harness so that it curved downward, better suited for what it was Rio was asking of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When a lone finger slipped between her folds, meeting weepy and hot slick, Agatha's pleased hum was drowned out by Rio's keening wail. It was a taste of what she was wanting but it wasn't nearly enough. She wanted Agatha inside of her, making her babble and weep and sob with every bit of pleasure she could provide.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could feel it almost everywhere as Agatha's fingers dragged from entrance to clit and back up again, causing her hips dropping back into the touch. The moment Agatha realized how desperate she was, she pulled it away, drawing a different, more animalistic sound from low in Rio's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were no words. The want was
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     bad at that point that all Rio could do was whimper and shift her hips,
     <em>
      begging
     </em>
     to be touched again. It was downright pathetic in its neediness, but Rio didn't care. The more she writhed under Agatha's touch, though, the longer it was taking.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a sharp smack to the right side of her ass, Agatha barked another order.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Move the pillows," she demanded gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't want to, she wanted to make her own demands, but she did it anyway. What it revealed made a low whine leave her, heat sinking deeper into her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, threaded through the slats in the headboard, was a long and bunched up ribbon, though it was too dark in the room to make out the color. Rio knew what that was for, and Agatha only confirmed that with her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you can't hold still, I will
     <em>
      make
     </em>
     you hold still."
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, Rio felt so many things at once that she hardly knew how to comprehend them, let alone identify them. The only physical response she could find was to press back again, whining once more in need.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will. I'll hold still," Rio agreed, but only because she was not sure how much more of this sick and too-long taunting she could take. Would she hold to it? Probably not, but if saying she would might somehow propel Agatha into action, she was willing to lie.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, she'd gotten
     <em>
      too
     </em>
     good at that.
    </p>
    <p>
     What that lie garnered her in return?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Good girl,"
     </em>
     came Agatha's praise, her fingers smoothing over the red mark that had probably resulted from her generous slap to Rio's bare skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment those words touched her ears, crawling into them and burrowing deep within the crevices of her brain, Rio felt like she was going to black out. She had no fucking clue how the hell she was managing to keep herself held up when every single limb she owned felt less than solid, as if they were the consistency of Jell-O.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hand moved again, planting firmly on her back as Rio felt her scoot forward on her knees, that much closer, and then --
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      FINALLY!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The mere feeling of pressure at Rio's entrance caused her elbows to buckle enough that she dropped just over an inch, mewling in her desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Please,
     </em>
     Agatha
     <em>
      . Please."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thought she knew what was coming. She was ready for it, feeling as though she had waited far too long. And then, something else happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rapidly, Agatha's hand that had been on her back decided to move, rocketing up her spine to finger purchase in a fist full of Rio's hair, gripping it tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh!"
     </em>
     Agatha exclaimed. "Was that always there too?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew what she meant, but there was
     <em>
      no
     </em>
     way they were going to engage in conversation about her fucking tattoos again. Not this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Agatha!"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     With a rough tug on her hair, Agatha's other hand worked to keep the strap steady as she pressed forward, sinking it easily into Rio's sopping and aching core.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sad part?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't even bottom out before Rio's body committed the ultimate betrayal, her orgasm smacking into her so hard that her arms gave out and she fell face-first into the mattress. It felt
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      so fucking good
     </em>
     , but there was a loud voice in Rio's head screaming at her for being so downright pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What was that?! What the fuck?! Are you serious?! Jesus fucking Christ, Rio. Get it together!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was too late for the last one, but everything else? Totally applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
     That voice got a
     <em>
      lot
     </em>
     louder when Agatha's voice sounded behind her, cutting through the thundering of her heartbeat in her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you just cum before I could even get halfway in?" she asked, but Rio could hear that she was warring between being smug and dissolving into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't answer. She just whimpered, limbs still trembling beyond her control. As Agatha started to withdraw, Rio's arm flew back, slapping and grabbing at whatever part of Agatha she could reach, but her fingertips only brushed over Agatha's hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, you're not done?" Agatha purred, slowly easing her hips forward. It was a process, but only because of the way Rio was shaking below her. At the same time she pressed deeper, Agatha was also leaning over Rio's back, her hand sliding from her hair, right to where Rio wanted it most:
    </p>
    <p>
     Around her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Concurrently, Agatha's hips met the flesh of Rio's ass as she bottomed out this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more, and unfortunately for Rio, her body began to wrack and tremble as she felt another orgasm tear her from limb to limb, leaving her yowling like a pinned animal as she clawed so tightly at the sheets her knuckles were white.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was
     <em>
      so fucking close
     </em>
     to her that this time, when she lost the battle and succumbed to her laughter -- directly into Rio's ear -- at the realization of what had happened, Rio was almost convinced she was she was having an orgasm
     <em>
      within
     </em>
     an orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Orgasm-ception?
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything was white and nothing hit her ears that did not sound like television static at full volume.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <em>
      stupid,
     </em>
     it was
     <em>
      embarrassing,
     </em>
     but it felt
     <em>
      so fucking good.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to beat herself up, wanted to berate herself for being so goddamn easy, but it wasn't worth it. It was never going to be worth trying to resist the pleasure that made her body feel as though it were humming with electricity. Nothing would
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     be worth fighting that feeling as Agatha's body weighed on hers and her core simply fluttered and gripped at the silicone inside, beat after beat, pulse after pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you want me to stop?" Agatha questioned, voice rocky and ragged with her breathing, though Rio felt she hadn't actually
     <em>
      done
     </em>
     much to have any huff and puff to show.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's head shook weakly, but she was trying for more, trying for words.
    </p>
    <p>
     What sounded was once more pathetic, but it was sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
     "P-Please d-don't," she forced out, her voice nearing a pitch that was capable of cracking glass at that volume.
     <em>
      "
     </em>
     Don't. Don't stop."
    </p>
    <p>
     The snide chuckle that passed through Agatha's lips shot a chill directly up the length of Rio's spine, freezing her completely for the amount of time it took Agatha to right herself, hands finding a strong hold on each of Rio's hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Whatever princess wants,"
     </em>
     Agatha growled, drawing her hips back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still grappling with the sheets, Rio attempted to lift herself to her palms again, but it was a fucking
     <em>
      effort.
     </em>
     Once she got there, Agatha truly started to have her fun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her grip was steady, solid, and held Rio exactly where she wanted her as her hips rocked forward again, her pace impossibly slow for how badly Rio
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     she wanted to rip right into her. It was a kindness, one that Agatha did not
     <em>
      need
     </em>
     to have, but was still choosing anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she found a rhythm, she was still moving with what felt eerily like care, but her pace was beginning to quicken. Those fingers were absolutely damaging in just how deep they were attempting to dig into Rio's bones but Rio didn't give a shit. Agatha could have left her black and blue for days to come, and it wouldn't have mattered one bit to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You like that, pretty girl?" Agatha rasped, hand sliding up Rio's back again, though its pace was much slower that time.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Y-Yes,"
     </em>
     Rio cried, but her voice cracked something fierce over the lone word.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What was that?" Agatha grunted, thrusting with more force. It was almost enough to cause Rio to buckle again, but she fought the urge. "I couldn't hear you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha utilized the hold she had on Rio's hips to push them down the most minute amount, just enough to create a better angle for herself. As she did so, the curved tip of that fucking dildo hit directly against her g-spot, making her cry out in ecstasy before she could repeat herself. Once she caught enough of a breath directly after, the projected answer that fired from her was made even louder by the relentless thrusting Agatha had finally reached.
    </p>
    <p>
     "YES! YES, AGATHA!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew it was coming. She knew it was going to happen the very second Agatha's fingers tangled in her hair again and gave a harsh pull.
    </p>
    <p>
     "F-FUCK! I'm gonna! Oh, Agatha! I'm gonna cum!" she blabbered, and Agatha took it at face value.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took approximately two well placed and intentional thrusts for Rio's core to seize and spasm around Agatha's strap for the third time that night.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <em>
      by far
     </em>
     the most intense one to that point, leading to her collapse again as she whimpered and cried and shook and and fought to breathe. It was the most delightful sense of drowning, a haze where she did not care if she ever took another breath as long as she lived if it meant she could bask in
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     pleasure forever.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was so impossibly deep in it that the disappointed whine Agatha let out behind her missed her completely. As did the protruding lip Agatha was wearing when she realized once more that Rio had been completely honest in detailing what her body was capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she backed away and removed herself from Rio's body, there was nothing else to keep her upright, as the muscles in her thighs has become utterly useless. It was truly sad how she just... dissolved into a heap of nothing more than dopamine and sweaty skin, but she didn't care. She didn't care about a goddamn thing right then.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her head felt so light, so far away as she tried to recover that she was barely cognizant of the fact that Agatha had placed herself on her side next to her. Rio's face was turned in the opposite direction, eyes shut as she tried to find herself again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she felt a light touch on her back, a barely-there tracing of fingertips up and down her spine, she was plummeting right back to earth. It was an earth where Agatha was touching her like that, caressing her, paying attention to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "S-Sorry," Rio panted, though it was slightly muffled by the way her cheek was smashed into the mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's laughter was soft, but it was amused, as was her tone when she spoke. "Why are you sorry? That was hot as fuck. I don't think I've ever made a woman cum on just the tip. Ego boost, as if I needed it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pathetic," Rio attempted to explain. She tried to move, but the most she was able to manage was lifting her head so that she could turn to face Agatha, eyes finally opening for the first time in several minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "No,"
     </em>
     Agatha countered,
     <em>
      "Hot."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers didn't stop their motions, dancing the faintest lines up and down Rio's sweat-stricken back. Even if Rio would have wanted to argue, it was moot with how incapacitated she felt. So, instead of trying to brat her way into another round that she was not sure she could handle right then, she just let Agatha touch her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha touched her for quite a while.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she finally lifted her fingers, she rolled to her back, shifting around enough that she was so impossibly close to Rio that their arms had but a centimeter between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something came over Rio in those moments, something she knew she shouldn't have acted upon, but she just could
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     help herself. When she found the voice for the question, it was a quiet one, one that teetered into the territory of being little more than a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know the rules," she began, her dark eyes falling into Agatha's bright blues, even in the dark. "But... Can I just... Can I just lay on you, maybe? You... Don't have to hold me. But... I just want to feel you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Christ, maybe that was more pathetic than coming before the fucking strap was even actually inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't react right away, just stared back at Rio in the dark of the room, only dimly lit by the light from the still-open closet. Rio knew what was coming, even before she had asked, but something had still pushed her to do it anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     So when Agatha spoke, Rio was genuinely shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like, hit with a taser shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
     There were no qualifiers, no stipulations. It was just a soft and simple answer that Rio took for all it was worth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mustering what strength remained in her body, Rio lifted herself enough that she could lay against Agatha's side, head landing agreeably on her chest, perfectly fit in the crook of Agatha's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was warm, it was comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of all?
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of all, even though it made little sense, Rio felt safe.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was mostly silent -- save for the quiet yowling that sounded like it was coming from the opposite end of the house -- around them. Because of it, Rio was able to hear Agatha's heartbeat beneath her ear as though it were the only sound to be heard in the world. It was beautiful, it was fervent, it was steady.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was all of the things Agatha herself was.
    </p>
    <p>
     After several minutes, Rio found herself startled once more as those familiar fingertips found her side and started tracing again, down to her hip and up high enough to almost reach her ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn't holding her, but she was showing Rio that what she had wanted was not entirely unwelcome. It wasn't Agatha's norm, and Rio knew that she might have been a little uncomfortable, but she was thankful that Agatha was willing to let her have it, if only for a short while.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still complacent and content, Rio's mind began to spin back up, those questions starting to cycle again. Only one really stuck, one that Rio had been wondering for weeks at that point.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do I finally get to know what you do for work?" she whispered, her warm breath rolling over the skin of Agatha's chest like a heavy morning fog.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled, her touch growing a little heavier as it paced Rio's side.
     <em>
      "Sure,"
     </em>
     Agatha agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
     That seemed too easy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm a rocket scientist."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn't thought herself capable of much, the spent and used pile she was, but the laugh that escaped her was loud and far more powerful than she'd thought it might be. Her head lifted to pin Agatha with narrowed eyes and a glare that asked her to be serious.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why don't you want to tell me?" Rio questioned back, raising a brow at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The look on Agatha's face did not change, did not crack into a smile as she stared Rio directly in the eyes. She was stoic. She was placid. She was... serious?
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean, the correct industry term is aerospace engineer, but..."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     serious.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're a fucking
     <em>
      rocket scientist
     </em>
     and you never thought it was pertinent to mention?" she interrogated, brows arched and tone steeped in incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha just shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Didn't feel relevant. But... Your 'man on the moon' comment made me snort for that reason. Though we specialize more in satellite design."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was absolutely gobsmacked.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made perfect sense and yet, it was so fucking outrageous that it didn't seem possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha had no reason to lie, which left Rio with no choice but to believe her.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a roll of her eyes, Rio settled back into place, lids fluttering shut the moment her ear pressed to Agatha's chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "
     </em>
     Will you ever stop being full of surprises?"Rio asked through a yawn that turned into a hum when she felt Agatha begin to touch her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Probably not. But maybe. Depends on how long you stay to find out."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to say it, but she couldn't will her brain to make her vocal cords move.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Agatha, I will stay as long as you let me.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I promise.
     </em>

    <p>
     When Rio's eyes fluttered open the next morning, she was not certain that it was morning at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was almost pitch black in the bedroom, hardly a sliver of light to be found. It was disorienting and forced her to replay through what she could remember last to establish where she actually was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was at Agatha's condo.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was in Agatha's bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha was not.
    </p>
    <p>
     That massive bed felt even bigger when Rio came to the conclusion that she was the only occupant. Her head lifted to see the windows across the room covered from top to bottom in blackout shades, ones that worked pretty effectively, if anyone ever cared to ask for Rio's opinion on the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more consciousness filled her form, the more aware she became of other things, like the soft chirps that sounded like they were coming from just below her on the side of the bed. Slowly, feeling like she were comprised of nothing but rubber, Rio lifted herself to peer down, those big and beautiful orange-hued eyes staring up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas chirped again before raising off of his front legs, paws landing on the side of the mattress as he vied for her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good morning, handsome. Hope you slept well," she murmured, her voice still gravelly and soaked in sleep. Her hand dropped, fingers scratching lazily between his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Mrrp.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     He wasn't pissed, so that was good. If he was, at least he was being forgiving about it. After a moment, he dropped to the floor again and took off, straight out the door and into the rest of the condo. In his absence, Rio gathered enough awareness to notice something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     The smell of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hummed softly and finally found the gumption in her limbs to move, even if it felt like she was simply
     <em>
      dragging
     </em>
     herself out of that ridiculously large and insanely comfortable bed. Thankfully, her head dropped to see that her bag was still where Agatha had placed it, as if she had predicted that very moment. She knelt and rummaged through it, pulling out a tank top and a pair of shorts to slide on before she ventured out into the rest of Agatha's domain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could see her, even before she got to the end of the hallway; Agatha was perched at the island, a mug of coffee secured in her hand with the morning paper in front of her. Her legs were crossed at the knee and her foot bobbed as she read.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Saturday edition, huh? Didn't peg you as a 'current events' kinda gal," Rio teased through a yawn, crossing to the end of the island with a gentle smile curling her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I keep tabs," Agatha responded nonchalantly, reaching forward to close the paper as her attention turned to Rio. Those blue eyes were so vibrant in the morning light that filtered in through windows across the condo that it
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     took her breath away.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good morning. There's coffee made, creamer in the refrigerator, and sugar is in the cylinder on the counter," she listed, though she never once tore her eyes away, watching Rio like a hawk, as if she were going to behave any differently after the happenings of the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bricks might have started to crumble toward the top of Agatha's defenses, but Rio was not trying to bust through the wall. She was not trying to unnerve Agatha, or make her feel the need to steel up behind the brick to protect herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     For as safe as Rio had felt pressed against Agatha's side the night before, Rio just wanted Agatha to feel that kind of security in her presence, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gave a nod and set about making herself a cup of coffee, though she could feel Agatha's eyes on her, just watching her, observing her. She tried to move without hinderance, to act as though she felt comfortable and at home. She didn't, not yet, but if she could put off that illusion, maybe she might start to feel it in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was it they always said?
    </p>
    <p>
     Fake it until you make it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Little of what Rio thought and felt about Agatha could have been considered fake, but right then, she just needed Agatha to believe that she was getting there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mid-pour, Agatha's voice carried over Rio's shoulder. It wasn't harsh or demanding, much as it had been the night before, but instead sounded almost... timid? Was that what it was? Was Agatha
     <em>
      nervous?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's something I wanted to ask you last night, but you fell asleep pretty quickly," she stated. It almost sounded like they were about to enter a business transaction, but when Rio looked over her shoulder, she saw Agatha wearing a bright but not-quite-so-dangerous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning back to her coffee, Rio made quick work of adding sugar and cream -- not missing the 6-pack of Modelo tall boys and the bottle of Spicy V8 in the bottom shelf of the door when she went for it in the refrigerator -- so that she could provide Agatha with her full attention and consideration. She turned from her place at the counter and deposited herself opposite Agatha, the island between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go ahead," Rio offered with a tip of her head, raising her coffee for a sip.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm leaving on Monday for Taiwan," Agatha stated and Rio felt her stomach sink.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't ready for Agatha to leave, especially not in two day's time. She didn't let it touch her face, trying her best to hide any giveaway behind her mug.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll be gone for ten days at least, but as long as fourteen is on the table." At this, Agatha picked up her own coffee and drew a long pull from it. Instead of setting it down again, she chose to cradle it in her palms, as if it would keep her hands busy. Maybe she
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     nervous, but Rio didn't understand why.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was the one who felt she had the most right to be nervous. Agatha was leaving. What if she did not come back?
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course she would come back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So..." Agatha's lips twisted in thought, those blue eyes so dark with her indecision. Rio didn't get it, at least not until she continued. "I wanted to offer you the option to stay here while I'm away."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared. And then she blinked. Again and again, she simply blinked at Agatha, as if waiting for her to crack.
    </p>
    <p>
     She did not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's posture straightened and she continued. "It was why I suggested you bring Phin this weekend, in spite of knowing you could have asked Alice to look after him if you really wanted to come alone." She set her mug down, but her eyes were still trained, watching Rio for any sign that she was about to bolt off to collect her things and leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was still thinking, still processing, and while it wasn't intentional, it was beginning to unseat Agatha slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she kept talking.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't have to. And it's no sleight against your home... But I just wanted to make it known that you were welcome, if you wanted. Plus, having a house sitter might not be the worst thing."
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she finished, Rio was already smiling. She could have been soft, thanked Agatha for the invitation, and accepted, but that wasn't who she was. It wasn't who
     <em>
      they
     </em>
     were becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If I watch it close enough, might it do a trick?" Rio posed with a smirk, bringing her mug up to wash it away with coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The pool is heated?" Agatha returned, her nervousness seeming to wane momentarily. Rio had not provided her a direct answer, but the banter offered instead seemed to melt away the frigid anxiety that had gripped her over asking what she must have perceived to be a weighted question.
    </p>
    <p>
     If that was what was putting her on edge, Rio would simply not add to that weight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That would be nice, thank you. A view like that every morning would be a great way to start the day," Rio agreed easily, placing her mug on the counter although she didn't release it. "But only if you're certain. I don't want to intrude on your personal space, and I promise I will not be a snoop." She was trying to provide comfort, reassurance to Agatha that might help her relax and have faith in the idea that asking Rio to stay was not something that would pose a threat to her own well-being.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You saw the fun stuff already anyway," Agatha teased back softly, her nose wrinkling as her gaze finally parted from Rio's face, dropping into her coffee for just a moment. She was looking for something in it, something like... resolve. Her lips pressed thin and Rio remained quiet, studying her as she sat in her contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she pulled herself out of the pits of her caffeine fix and met Rio again evenly, she was smiling. It wasn't a grin, wasn't a smirk. She didn't look hungry, or like she wanted to pin Rio any and every surface available.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Agatha just looked
     <em>
      content.
     </em>
     Maybe even
     <em>
      happy.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's almost noon," Agatha informed her, switching the subject entirely. Rio had agreed, and that seemed to be enough for her. "I figured maybe a light lunch, a dip in the pool. And then maybe after dinner, you might like to go to Navy Pier?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Holy shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had woken up that morning and decided to choose the most beautiful form of emotional violence possible and Rio hardly knew how to process it. The offer itself had been startling, yes, but was she asking Rio
     <em>
      out on a date?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was torn; she wanted to ask, to make Agatha clarify that it was what she was asking, but she also did not want to immediately laugh and poke fun if Agatha was being genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
     She decided on a middle-ground response instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I would very much like to accompany you to Navy Pier. On a normal Saturday night. With no connotations at all." The longer Rio went, the more her smile grew. What provided relief was that Agatha's did, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     The truth was, Agatha asking her to a popular and public place when sunset was imminent sure
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     romantic, but Rio knew enough about Agatha to know that if she pointed it out, it might cause friction between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not dating. Once more, period. No elaboration necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Glad that's settled then," Agatha returned, her smile dimming as she removed herself from the stool and collected her coffee and newspaper to retreat to the living room, no longer feeling the need to give Rio a play-by-play. She had eyes. She had free will. If she wanted to follow, she would.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Grabbing her own coffee, Rio found herself back on that sectional by Agatha's side. She had tried to be considerate and give Agatha even a little bit of room, but Agatha scooted over once Rio was stationary until they were side-by-side. She said nothing for the twenty minutes it took to finish her paper while Rio scrolled through Reddit on her phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Agatha
     <em>
      would
     </em>
     do was make the softest sounds in response to what it was she was reading. A soft hum, a quiet chortle. They would happen every few minutes and while Rio wouldn't turn her head, her eyes would cut to the side to just... watch Agatha. Sometimes, she was smiling, sometimes she wore that pointed but beautiful scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
     The domesticity of them sitting next to one another while the mundane unfolded before them settled strangely within Rio, solely because she knew
     <em>
      who
     </em>
     she was sitting next to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was wild, she was bright and exuberant and was nothing but an overcharged battery at all times, ready to light up any situation she found herself in, in any way she needed to. With Rio, it was a good spark, but Rio had seen that look in her eyes enough to know that she could be nothing short of a Molotov Cocktail in a house of straw if she so chose.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she didn't need to, not with Rio and most certainly not in her own home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was choosing to relax and in that state of release, Rio was realizing that she had been making a lot of assumptions about who Agatha was. None of them had been fair, but the calmness that had befallen them offered her time for further contemplation.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a contemplation that carried on for a short while, even as Agatha announced that she was going to make them lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had followed, like a curious puppy, and watched as Agatha set about preparing them a salad of spinach, mozzarella balls, tomatoes, and balsamic glaze from her place at the island.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the middle of her task, Agatha let out a high-pitched squeal, jumping slightly to the side as though she had been hit with a hot poker. Her head snapped down and her glowering turned into a smile in the matter of a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You scared me," Agatha chastised, though it came out in a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas had come to say hello and Agatha had forgotten he was there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "He's good for that," Rio offered as she slid off her stool and approached the counter, resolutely planting herself at Agatha's side close enough that their arms gently brushed. Phin took to circling around their legs, deliberately rubbing against them because neither of them were paying him any attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she watched Agatha's motions, Rio felt at ease, like peace had found her in the strangest way.
    </p>
    <p>
     There she stood in the middle of a multi-million dollar kitchen, watching as the serial killer she liked made them a fucking salad for lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it felt
     <em>
      good.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't the kind of good that she'd experienced the night before, but rather the kind of good that made her feel like she was where she was meant to be. Maybe she wasn't permitted to be overly affectionate under the circumstances yet, but just being close to Agatha made Rio somehow feel
     <em>
      better.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "That looks good. Do you stick to salads all the time, or can you cook?" Rio inquired. It was light, but she was slipping herself beneath another layer of Agatha, trying to gingerly peel it back. It was a simple enough question, but it could be telling, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can, and I do frequently. Kind of like the restoration, I like to dabble in things like molecular gastronomy. It's fun to play around with and requires a lot of process and attention to detail, something I know all too well." There were little notes of that familiar arrogance clutching her words, a boasting to remind Rio who she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew. And she didn't care. She was never going to care.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So... What is it that you'll be making us for dinner?" Rio teased, bumping into her lightly. Agatha didn't stiffen and shockingly, she actually nudged Rio back.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were baby steps, but they felt like clearing hurdles. Agatha was letting her closer, letting her touch her without recoiling or feeling the need to assert her dominance. She was letting that guard down, an inch at a time, and Rio was finding that it was getting easier and easier to scale. All she wanted was inside of that head, that giant beautiful brain that was jam packed with so many thoughts and theories and questions and ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had so much going on up there that Rio knew she wasn't privy to yet, but... She was hoping Agatha might let her stick around long enough to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's chicken marinating in the refrigerator which I planned to pair with a mushroom risotto, barring that you have any allergies," Agatha responded, moving to grab for a few shallow bowls to hold their lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I actually love mushrooms," Rio informed her. It was just a commonplace admission, but as Rio looked to Agatha beside her, she was smiling again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe, Rio considered, it made Agatha happy when Rio dropped new bits and pieces about herself, her likes, the things that made her happy. She knew she should have let it go, but it felt like another opportunity to try and dig a little deeper, to uncover Agatha's true motives for wanting her there, even when she would not be present.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you like that?" Rio inquired, fighting the urge to just steal a rotten tiny peck of Agatha's cheek as Agatha offered her the bowl, now lush with the light meal she had created for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do I like what?" Agatha asked back, arching a brow. She picked up her own bowl and simply walked away, strolling over toward that large, empty table as she placed herself at the end of it, facing the window.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was right behind her, sliding into the chair on Agatha's left, not so interested in her lunch when a much more tantalizing option was hanging in front of her face: pressing on Agatha's soft spots.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you like it when you learn new things about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't concerned about her food, but it appeared to be Agatha's main focus right then. She was doing all she could to keep from looking up at Rio while she gave the answer some consideration. Rio was perched and ready, waiting for her to offer it, but she simply pressed a forkful of salad into her mouth, humming happily at the taste.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      She's drawing it out
     </em>
     , Rio thought,
     <em>
      but why?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The obvious answer was that it meant being a little more sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
     The other obvious answer was that she enjoyed making Rio squirm.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she decided to finally grace Rio with a response, she was actually floored all over again, completely stumped at Agatha's ability to knock her off kilter with startling ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What I like is that you feel comfortable enough to share."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio just stared at her, completely having forgotten about her lunch despite the fact that Agatha was happily enjoying her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have you always been this vague and mysterious or am I just blind?" Rio teased her, half tempted to stick her tongue out like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not being vague or mysterious. I just..." Agatha lowered her fork and finally looked up, meeting inquisitive and curious dark eyes, ones that would have loved nothing more than to see through the frost covered glass she surrounded herself with. "I don't want you to feel like you
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to share any more than I would without being asked. And that... I suppose that's a personal limit of what I am typically willing to provide. But..."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat back in her chair, having completely disregarded her meal, her focus solely trained on Rio and Rio alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing else in that condo mattered, not even Phineas, who had taken to doing figure eights around Agatha's calves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, at the same time, was transfixed, mesmerized by the true but faint shimmer of vulnerability in Agatha's gorgeous blue eyes. She had gone from being intentionally difficult to hanging onto Agatha's every word in less than a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nothing about you, County Coroner Rio Vidal, is typical. Even that itself is... Not normal for me to admit. As such, please don't ask me to elaborate." Agatha was not being sharp with her, but there was still a hardness to her tone that was a very prevalent indicator that she felt uncomfortable, that she wasn't ready to have big and deep talks about... whatever the fuck this was, at least not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I won't," Rio offered back in consolation, but there was an addendum she felt needed to be added, "but I will say thank you. I can see that this is... may be new for you and while I don't want to harp on it, I recognize it and understand it. I just... enjoy being in your company. And I like that you seem to be enjoying it too."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's demeanor had remained composed and calm, even though that discomfort had wedged its way into her form, but when Rio finished speaking, that little mischievous glint returned to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think I'll enjoy it even more if you eat your lunch so we can get in the pool. And no, I'm not lending you a bathing suit." Agatha was grinning even before she finished speaking, easily finding her fork to resume her meal.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh rats," Rio mused with a coy smirk as she began to eat. "I was really hoping it would give you something to take off with your teeth."
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha lightly kicked her beneath the table, Rio's smirk grew into a truly amused grin, eyes flickering from the bowl before her to the woman beside her, a strange tide of delight washing over her.  It rolled in again even stronger when Agatha didn't move her foot and instead ran it tauntingly along the side of Rio's calf.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beneath the table, Phineas found dissatisfaction in the act and attempted to squeeze himself between the contact, leaving both women to dissolve into laughter at the bout of feline jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once they had finished, Agatha was up and moving with grace as she collected their empty bowls and discarded them in the sink. Without another word spoken, she simply turned toward the right and wandered down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew exactly where she was going.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, she still took a moment to stare after the traces of her left behind, stuck in a state of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha Harkness was something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio was bound and determined to discover every facet of what that might mean.
    </p>
    <p>
     Realizing that Agatha was probably already naked and diving right into that pool, Rio was on her feet in the blink of an eye, hands flying down in the middle of the hallway to strip her tank top over her head. When she jerked the door to the pool room open -- still clutching the tank top -- it was to reveal Agatha sitting on that oversized ottoman, still dressed in her t-shirt and joggers.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she raised her eyes to take in the sight of Rio in the doorway, bare-chested and only wearing that skimpy pair of shorts, her vulturine grin was sweeping and almost startling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "My, my," Agatha crooned, lifting herself to her feet. "Someone's an eager beaver."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah well," Rio mused back, not letting it force her hand this time as she shrugged her shoulders and paced forward. She tossed the tank top to land haplessly on one of the lounge chairs and removed her shorts, too. "You told me I had to swim naked. So... figured it was best to be ready."
    </p>
    <p>
     She was trying to play it off as nonchalantly as possible, but Rio couldn't fight the grin that wanted to take her over after only a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm actually disappointed you didn't beat me to it," she added, stepping close enough to Agatha so that she could hook a finger beneath the hem of that t-shirt. She gave it a moderately forceful tug as she passed by before walking straight ahead and dropping with a small splash right into the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she surfaced, having bent at the knees enough to fully submerge, Agatha was halfway out of her pants and all the way out of her shirt. Rio spun just in time to see Agatha heading straight toward her, in all of her naked glory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew what Agatha looked like naked, but there was something about the way the midday sun hit her body that made Rio melt somewhere in her middle. It defined her more, further convincing Rio that she had been carved by the Gods themselves and she would accept no other answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Much as Rio had done, Agatha plopped right in, making the smallest waves in return. When she surfaced, hair soaked and slicked back, she looked an utter vision with that truly vibrant smile she was wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pretty cool, isn't it? Bet 'midday skinny dipping' wasn't on any list you might have," Agatha mused, letting herself bob around in Rio's vicinity, just held by the water as her legs folded beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You think I have lists?" came Rio's light question, a chuffed smile finding her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only shrugged, lifting her palms out of the water to do so, trying to seem so nonplussed, but it wasn't working. "You seem like the semi-meticulous type that might have 'hope-to's' and 'want-to's' and 'have-to's' scribbled on sheets of crumpled paper somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
     This made Rio laugh. It was full and it was loud, but it was more amused than it was to mock. "I write nothing down, actually. It is... a fatal flaw. And why my refrigerator is empty ninety percent of the time. Never met a shopping list that liked me."
    </p>
    <p>
     And so went their afternoon, light conversation where Agatha learned a few more things about Rio -- like how she adopted Phineas on her birthday as a gift to herself, that she was
     <em>
      incredibly
     </em>
     skilled at the game Go, and that she used to collect glass eyes when she was a teenager (which Agatha had called her a freak for, ironically) -- and in the in-between, Rio learned a few new things about Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio learned that Agatha knew a lot of things there were to know about the world, and a lot of it came from her countless hours as a child with her nose buried in encyclopedias, dictionaries, textbooks, and biographies. There had been little context clues in that conversation that had probably given away more than Agatha meant to; Rio was almost positive that whatever home life Agatha had been given, it had been a curse for her and knowledge was how she had made it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio asked her about where she went to college for her degree, her answer actually left Rio speechless and stunned. She stilled in place as she tried to tread water despite not really needing to.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's brow pinched harshly, confusion scribbled over every inch of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You didn't go to college... But you're an aerospace engineer? How the fuck does that work?" she'd asked, watching as Agatha pulled herself from the pool, a shit-eating grin plastered to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     She paced to a small hutch and pulled out a towel to remove some of the water dripping down her fit and toned form before she perched herself on the front end of a lounger, bemused gaze finding Rio again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You make friends with shady people who are incredibly talented. If you get just the right group, you've got the world at your fingertips." Agatha leaned forward over her knees, the look on her face all but screaming that she knew she was brilliant. "I snuck into lectures at the local university and used a tape recorder so that I could go back and re-listen to anything I missed in my live notations. It took me longer than it would have if I would have just went but... We will just say Amelia has been with me a very long time, and it's her name on that fake as shit degree that has fooled anyone who has looked at it, as well as the paper trail to back it up."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was leaving out details, ones like which college she snuck into and where her degree actually claimed she went to school, but Rio had already gathered the bits and pieces Agatha wasn't ready to share. Thus, Rio did not shove them in her face with the full understanding that it was simply... unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     She did not talk about Imperial, or Iowa, even if the thought had tripped her up in the car. She did not ask why Agatha had chosen that name, or how many places she had lived in her life. Having that conversation, and all of the things Rio knew Agatha was choosing not to say, it introduced yet another layer to this perplexing woman, a layer of additional questions and a desperate need to know more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, it was clear that Agatha was proud of herself for having conned her way to the top, and Rio couldn't say she blamed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had
     <em>
      the life
     </em>
     , as it appeared from the outside. She had a cushy job that allowed her to utilize the incredible intelligence she had been blessed with, had more money than it seemed she had feelings, and lived at the very top of the city, so high up above anyone and everyone she considered to be beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was right there, on the same level, occupying the same space.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha saw something in Rio and while Rio felt it a little more after those conversations, she still didn't know what to call it, so she chose to leave it alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     They spent hours like that, in and out of the pool, chattering back and forth about too many things. Rio wasn't sure how much time had passed, but when they both wound up back in the water again, she had grown a little restless with the lack of true contact between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had brushed over her skin a couple of times, but had not dared to hold her or get any closer than playing with her fingertips as they floated on top of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, as Agatha splashed her as a result of a bickering competition they were having over reality television -- in which Rio found true delight, learning that Agatha watched Big Brother in the summers when she could,  and had given her hell for it -- Rio was tired of the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was tired of being so worried about crossing a line that she was making the choice to hold back, and maybe giving Agatha the wrong impression at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still grinning from her aquatic assault, Agatha had not seen it coming; Rio was quick as a missile as she launched toward Agatha, using just enough force to push her back to the bench seat that was about two and a half feet below the water. It was comical, the way it happened so fast and left Agatha actually shouting in surprise. Rio landed in her lap with Agatha's hips locked between her knees, only flecks of her amusement still dancing in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, hello there," Agatha murmured at her, tilting her head up so that she could pin Rio's gaze with her own. "It's been a while."
    </p>
    <p>
     They were closer right then, closer than they had been all day. It wasn't that it had been weird or awkward, but Rio was trying to gauge the boundaries of what was okay and what might be too much. She didn't want to attach herself to Agatha's hip, and holding hands was very clearly off limits, but Rio wanted to be closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     If throwing herself at Agatha in the pool was how she got there, then that was perfectly fine with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I figured it best to try and not climb you like a tree for at least the first four hours of consciousness," Rio joked, but it was only half of one. What she wasn't saying was that she was not sure yet what was welcome and so, she was trying to show restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it mainly sexual? Yes, of course. Rio was physically attracted to Agatha, every single inch of her, but in this new territory they were exploring, it left Rio wondering what else might be entering the realm of possibility. Agatha wasn't going to hold her hand every five minutes, not like she had when she had pulled Rio into the closet, but could it be okay for Rio to put hers over Agatha's when they were next to each other?
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it okay to rub her thigh when she didn't want to immediately initiate sex? Would Agatha hate it if all Rio wanted to do was touch her, and just run her fingers over the skin of her arm when they were sandwiched together on the couch? Would it be alright if she absentmindedly played with Agatha's hair, as had crossed her mind a time or two?
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew she should have just asked, but she wasn't ready to just yet, and part of Rio knew that maybe Agatha wasn't ready
     <em>
      for
     </em>
     her to ask those questions, either.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So you bully me onto the pool bench instead?" Agatha posed, craning her neck just enough that she could swipe her lips softly against Rio's in a move that could not have even been called an actual kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," Rio responded plainly before reinstating the contact with a fuller, more intentional kiss. It wasn't immediately heavy or desperate, but it was an honest showing that she had rather missed the physical closeness between them. That, coupled with the way her hands had come to rest on Agatha's shoulders, had to indicate as much, if Agatha was paying close enough attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     They would figure it out, the boundaries of their entanglement, but getting to kiss Agatha like that without feeling like Rio was overstepping felt nice. It felt even better as Agatha's hands found her hips beneath the water, holding them gently in place as she reciprocated the same energy Rio was giving her through that kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was merely lips and sighs and the gentlest little giggles when Agatha would nip at her the flesh she was meant to be kissing.
    </p>
    <p>
     In many ways, Rio felt like a teenager quite often in Agatha's presence. She was drunk on physical affection in the late afternoon while naked in a swimming pool that was housed inside one of the tallest buildings in chicago. Even Teenage Rio might not have been so rash to make such choices, but the longer they sat in the water making out, Adult Rio had no regrets.
    </p>
    <p>
     They carried on for several minutes, just losing themselves in what it felt like to just want to kiss another human being. It was definitely
     <em>
      sexy
     </em>
     by any and all measure, but it was not fueled by the primal desire to fuck or be fucked. No, it was just... blissful to sit in Agatha's lap and kiss her like time itself had stopped for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hand had migrated to the side of Agatha's neck at some point, but just as the kiss started to tip over into something that couldn't be corralled, a nearby sound caused Agatha to pull her head back.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a soft scraping, a scratching almost.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, the most forlorn meow that Rio was sure she had ever heard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas was hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had spent hours in that room, and at least half of that time in the water. While the reserves that had been like a wall between them had started to melt away, so, apparently, had the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Must be dinnertime," Agatha mused.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio's eyes finally fluttered open -- not having been as interested in the sound -- Agatha was staring up at her with a smile that felt too sweet for her and a pink to her cheeks that actually made her appear rather disarming in the late afternoon light.
    </p>
    <p>
     The palm that had been resting on the side of Agatha's neck slid higher so that it could cradle her jaw, enabling Rio to take one last kiss, though she let it linger longer than she probably should have. She could tell as much by the way Agatha's hands started to travel to her ass. As a preventative measure to keep from disrupting their night, Rio broke the kiss off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's soft but displeased whine only propelled Rio forward and to her right, chin hanging over Agatha's shoulder as she whispered the softest promise right into her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Tonight."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Rio braved to press a quick kiss to the side of Agatha's head before she pushed off so that she could climb out of the pool to dry herself off. To prevent any conflicting feelings, she did not dare glance at Agatha's expression as she did so. She wasn't sure how such a move might land and if it was negative, she didn't want to be privy to the immediate after effects.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm going to go shower, if that's okay?" Rio asked over her shoulder, still a little on edge about meeting Agatha's gaze so soon after her haphazard decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     The water was sloshing and then dripping as Agatha lifted herself from it, making her way to Rio's side to pick up her own towel.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course it is. I'll put dinner on and shower when we're done eating. We should be able to make it to the pier by sunset."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know why it mattered to Agatha that they made it before sunset, at least not at first. And then, as she finished drying off, she realized it was because it was simply an experience that Agatha wanted to share with her, one that was renowned for being so beautiful and breathtaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio offered a nod and started to depart, but her feet cemented to the ground the moment she felt Agatha's hand wrap around her bicep, holding her in place. Alarmed, her dark and concerned gaze snapped to Agatha in question, but Agatha offered no verbal answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she did the unthinkable. The unthinkable in the
     <em>
      best
     </em>
     way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and Rio watched as her eyes fluttered shut just before their lips made contact. Open-eyed and a little stupefied, Rio's mind was hurtling at warp speed, trying to understand how Agatha had just made the choice to kiss her outside of a present and immediate physical closeness. It took a couple of seconds, but Rio's lids finally slid shut and her full attention was on that kiss, on what Agatha was
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     saying to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It drew to a close as Rio pulled away, fighting herself on taking another in spite of
     <em>
      knowing
     </em>
     she shouldn't. Instead, her lips curled and her eyes fluttered open, beholding Agatha at close range.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I expect a Michelin star meal when I get out of the shower," Rio teased her softly. As she began to walk away, she was not at all surprised to feel a sharp sting on her left ass cheek, the result of a direct smack of encouragement from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tossing a feigned glare over her shoulder at the other woman as she departed, Rio couldn't stifle the light chuckle that escaped her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her shower was relatively quick and she was dried and dressed in the nicest thing she had brought with her in the event that they did decide to go out; it was not a dress, but instead a pair of dark wash skinny jeans and a black and sheer lace blouse, one that was demanding of the black bra she put on underneath it. The collar was high and slightly ruffled and the sleeves were long, covering her arms but not disguising them.
    </p>
    <p>
     After commandeering Agatha's blow-dryer, it had taken Rio roughly thirty minutes from the time she stepped out of the pool room until she stepped back into the main living space of the condo, a low hum of approval sounding from her in response to the smells that filled her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hadn't been kidding.
    </p>
    <p>
     She
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     know how to cook, if only judging by the aromas wafting throughout the home.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was confirmed when they sat down to eat and Rio put that very first bite in her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <em>
      heaven
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been difficult to not rave throughout the meal each time she took another bite, but she found it in her to refrain somehow, instead indulging Agatha with answers to questions that tickled her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's your worst injury?"
    </p>
    <p>
     That answer was easy: dislocated shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What was the worst you've ever hurt another person?"
    </p>
    <p>
     That one was a little trickier, but she'd been honest: she'd broken a girl's nose at a concert when she was seventeen by punching her in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last one, Rio chose to answer as they finished their meal. It was also the one that had required the most thought to respond in the fullest scope possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you ever think, given the right set of circumstances -- anger, despair, vengeance, whatever it is -- that you could take a life?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't exactly dinner conversation, but they were still within the walls of that steel fortress of Agatha's home and she knew that she was free to ask such things without scrutiny from anyone who did not understand them, or understand
     <em>
      her.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had taken her time, taking a pull of her beer before she leaned back in her chair and glanced to Agatha, the consideration still heavy in her dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't want to say I never could, because never is an impossibly finite word, but I think I can say that I never
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to, and I hope I never
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to. But if the day should come where I do, I..." Rio pressed her lips together, huffing a soft sigh. "I think it would take a lot to get over, for me. But... here's to hoping that we always leave that to you," she quipped playfully, tipping her beer in Agatha's direction before polishing it off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha seemed to think it an adequate enough response, choosing to finish her own drink -- whiskey and lemonade -- instead of posing another question. When she finally took the time to survey what it was Rio had chosen to wear for their date, a calculated smirk found her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I like that, by the way," Agatha told her. That gaze was restrained, but Rio could see the embers of desire beginning to smolder there. She suddenly snapped back into focus, as if she had
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     remembered they still had plans and got to her feet, taking to cleaning up the table as she had earlier in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, Rio did not hesitate to follow, casually making her way toward the end of the island as Agatha finished rinsing their plates.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What? My outfit?" she questioned, leaning forward onto her elbows as she watched Agatha's back for a few seconds, eagerly awaiting her response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, your outfit. It's far bolder than I ever thought you capable of being in public," she answered truthfully, shrugging her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good to know that you're not the only one full of surprises here, then," Rio shot back, tone light and teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shutting off the water, Agatha turned to face her as she dried her hands, though it was rather pointless when she announced her next destination. "I'm going to shower and we can head to the pier. It's about a twenty minute walk from here, if you don't mind, or I can call Francisco. Give it some thought and we'll head out when I'm finished."
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned to weave the towel through the oven handle and surely was intent on doing as she said, but in a brash move of boldness that Rio had in no way telegraphed, she reached up and found light purchase on Agatha's bicep, much the same way Agatha had done to her earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's head whipped to take her in, clearly startled by the sudden move, but she did not stiffen or try to pull away. In fact, when their eyes met, realization washed into her features, and then that deep blue gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't move an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't have to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's lips twitched upward the tiniest amount, but if they pulled any further, Rio didn't see it. Her eyes fluttered shut as Agatha minimized the space between them, closing it off with a firm but somewhat reserved kiss. It was Agatha giving Rio what she was wanting, but at the same time, it was also her giving back the courtesy Rio had provided to
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     earlier in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though they were baby steps, it was still forward progress.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the same vein as Agatha's earlier act of pleasurably painful physical force -- and to prevent either of them from attaching too much thought to the moment -- Rio gave a light swat to Agatha's ass.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go get ready! It'll be dark by the time your hair's dry if you don't!"
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt liberating to Rio to laugh the way she did as Agatha sauntered off down the hallway to shower and ready herself for their night out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their first night out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their first night out
     <em>
      together
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     In the time it took Agatha to shower and do her make-up and hair, Rio had found herself on the couch with Phineas who had curled up at her side, fat and happy after the dinner he'd gotten, too. The silence had started to get to her five minutes in, so by the time Agatha emerged, the television was on some news program that was droning on quietly in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's gaze tore from Phin when she noticed Agatha stride into the room, hair down and blowing wildly behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked
     <em>
      stunning.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The jeans she was wearing were lighter than Rio's, but not by much and had a very large, very excessive gold belt buckle -- Gucci, Rio thought by the design -- that held them up. She had on a black camisole and over it was a smart black blazer, one that had several white buttons for show.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Holy shit,"
     </em>
     Rio managed, doing her best to prevent the gawking that was trying to win out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, this old thing?" Agatha mused, plucking at the lapels of the blazer in show. "Got it years ago. Almost forgot I had it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was on her feet, moving with fervor to minimize the distance between them. She knew, even as she approached, that she should have kept her hands to herself, but it didn't stop her. No, she marched right up to Agatha and slid her hands beneath the blazer and over her waist, beaming at her with a truly delighted grin on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're full of shit, but it's hot as fuck, so I'll let it pass this one time," Rio informed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, when she leaned in to place an assertive kiss to Agatha's lips, she didn't hesitate. Agatha seemed to like that, given the way she gripped at Rio's hips and pulled her just a
     <em>
      little
     </em>
     closer, not wanting her to get away quite so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was another small victory, another inch forward, one that was leading them to figure out what they might be able to become when they stopped standing in their own ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it would still take time, but they were getting closer, little by little.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you ready to go?" Agatha murmured against Rio's lips, breath warm and still smelling of mint from where she had brushed her teeth. It steadied the thumping in her chest as her heart had started to get away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Keep it in check, idiot.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     With an affirming nod, the two of them set out into the evening, sensible footwear carrying them to their intended destination while they kept idle chatter. It was the lightest back and forth mostly revolving around the characters that littered the streets as the night started to unfold.
    </p>
    <p>
     There had been a serene air around them as they walked side-by-side, occasionally lightly bumping into one another as the littlest reminders of presence and accountability. About halfway there, Agatha decided to switch that up. She did not reach for Rio's hand, but instead held her arm out and tipped her head silently in suggestion when Rio went to question what she was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     With an instant understanding, Rio threaded her arm through Agatha's, trying not to let a lip curling that was too tickled touch her features. No one died. Nothing exploded. There were no gunshots. It was just a peaceful transition from distance to less of it, and Rio found herself with that smile because of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been to Navy Pier before. She quite enjoyed spending time there, and herself and Alice had gotten far too drunk on too many occasions at the Beer Garden to keep honest tally of. It was always a good time, but it was always within the comforts of being allowed to be wild per their friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
     This, with Agatha, was new.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was unchartered land that Rio was still trying to feel her way through. Yes, they strolled down that pier arm-in-arm like they had done it a million times before, but what did that actually
     <em>
      mean?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, the only meaning Rio could assign to it was that Agatha wanted her close and honestly? She was more than okay with that.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they began to walk the length of the pier, something caught Rio's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Centennial Wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd had the opportunity to ride it only once before, but it had been midday and way before the drinking had started. There was a different context here, one that she couldn't help but ponder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could just
     <em>
      ask
     </em>
     , but she felt like it might have been toeing the line of what was acceptable between them. It was already ambiguous enough that they were walking arm in arm through a popular city attraction near sunset; she didn't want to tread much further and push Agatha into any kind of fight-or-flight reaction while they were in the public eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently, Rio had been staring at the wheel for just long enough that it had drawn Agatha's attention. She gave the slightest squeeze of Rio's arm, offering an answer to an unasked question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned to look at her, curiosity pulling at her features. She hadn't even asked, and Agatha had shut her down, clearly already having an idea of what was going on within her head. Although Rio could have assumed that it was for the very reasons she had chosen
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     to ask, something about the way Agatha's jaw tensed told her that there was more there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can I ask why?" Rio inquired as they continued walking. It wasn't an interrogation or a demand that Agatha tell her, but just another instance of Rio realizing that there was more to a situation than met the eye. She could have just asked 'why' straight up, but Rio was of the complete understanding that there was a need for her to be delicate, and so she posed the question within another.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not look at her, instead choosing to lift her chin a little as they walked, but she did provide an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't like heights," she offered, but Rio thought it was a lie.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, come on. You live seventy stories above the city," Rio goaded, slinging a little of her weight into Agatha's side, although their arms stayed linked. "There has to be more to it than that."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched Agatha's profile, studying it carefully until she realized something. Whatever it was that was keeping Agatha from getting into one of those little glass boxes to view the city as the sun began to sink, Agatha saw it as a weakness. It showed in how her lips were pursed, how there were lines in her forehead as a result of her frown.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't like the combination of heights and enclosed spaces," she revealed, tone emotionless as she made the admission.
    </p>
    <p>
     There it was: having
     <em>
      any
     </em>
     kind of fear was absolutely viewed as weakness to Agatha and that was clear with such a response. It wasn't something Rio had
     <em>
      meant
     </em>
     to dig into, knowing their surroundings, and she hadn't even actually been the one to do
     <em>
     </em>
     it, but her obvious wants had been a catalyst anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay," Rio stated simply. Facing forward again, she decided to switch gears; while she still felt a little tipsy from her beers at dinner, she was suddenly of the mind that a little more alcohol might be a considerable amount of a help rather than a hinderance. "Why don't we grab something to drink?"
    </p>
    <p>
     They had done just that, garnering their wristbands and respective alcohols -- more beer for Rio and a plastic cup filled with wine for Agatha -- and set off again to scale the pier. They would stop and look into shops or ruminate in the smells outside of one of the restaurants, but every so often, Rio found herself glancing toward that stupid Ferris wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every single time, Agatha clocked it but never said a word.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sun was creeping lower, the oranges and pinks filling the sky over the vast expanse of the lake in the most breathtaking ways. Even more breathtaking was the way the light shined on Agatha's face, creating the most stark contrast of hues and shadows, one that made her seem just
     <em>
      that much more
     </em>
     attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was sexy beyond words, but in that sunset, Rio saw what only Rio was capable of seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were in front of so many people who would only see Amelia when they looked at her, but right then? Rio just saw
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     as she basked in the end of another day, a day she was choosing to end by holding Rio's arm in her own as they enjoyed everything the pier had to offer them.
    </p>
    <p>
     On another pass, Rio's eyes wandered once more to the highest gondola on the wheel, just watching as it swung easily in the breeze while the lower one emptied and refilled. This time, when Agatha noticed it, what she had to say was vastly opposite of how they had begun their evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Fine,"
     </em>
     she murmured lowly, lightly pressing into Rio's side so that they steered more toward the Ferris wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, you don't --" she had started, but Agatha was quick to cut her off as she shoved her empty wine cup into a trash can as she passed by.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do not do that because I will
     <em>
      absolutely
     </em>
     change my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio realized what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been giving Agatha everything she asked for and then some without ever protesting in a way that was not meant to entice or rile her up. As such, Agatha was trying her hardest to find small areas where she could offer a little more give, and show Rio that she was capable of making concessions, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     They purchased their tickets and waited in line, though Rio could feel Agatha's anxiety growing as they stood arm-in-arm, the minutes dragging on. She would lift her chin, looking up at the highest gondola, and Rio could feel as every muscle in her arm would tense, followed by a forceful sigh that told Rio she was the
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     reason Agatha had not bolted in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to say something.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to look Agatha in the eye and tell her it was okay, that they didn't have to do it, but Rio could almost predict what her reaction might be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha would want to do it just because she had the idea in her head that Rio thought she couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Rio just squeezed her arm a little tighter each time they shuffled forward in line. Agatha wasn't shaking, but Rio could
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     her nerves as they jettisoned throughout her body, up and down, back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few more shuffles landed them at the front of the line, stepping forward so that the attendant could scan their tickets.
    </p>
    <p>
     That gondola was only ten steps away, but as Rio turned to Agatha to ask if she was sure, Agatha pressed forward, pulling Rio right along with her. She didn't want to hear Rio offer her an out because, as she had stated earlier, she
     <em>
      would
     </em>
     take it. However, Agatha could see that this meant something to Rio and that obviously was making it mean something to her, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once seated inside, Rio's gaze turned Agatha, but Agatha was already looking out the glass, probably willing the ride to be over already.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha..." Rio voiced softly, glancing at Agatha's hand as it rested on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm fine, R--" Agatha started to insist, but as the mechanics kicked on and the gondola began to move, her hand snapped out and wrapped tightly around Rio's, squeezing her fingers firmly out of nothing more than fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     It happened so quick, but time seemed to stop for Rio as the gravity of it all settled around them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was uncomfortable. Her anxiety was palpable, but she was willing herself to do something because she wanted to do it
     <em>
      for
     </em>
     Rio. In the process, she had been jarred enough to seek out comfort, a comfort that was easily accessible and right there for her to take. The fact that she found that comfort in a physical hold on Rio's fingers? That was
     <em>
      fucking important.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Casually and without saying a word, Rio flipped her hand within Agatha's grasp and threaded their fingers together as they began to move higher and higher. At the same time Agatha's breathing was growing more and more shallow as they seemed to ascend further up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wouldn't it be funny if there were dolphins in the lake?" Rio mused aloud, eyes cast out on the water, though she was still gripping Agatha's hand with ferocity over her own thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha breathed a soft snort, but Rio could tell immediately that she recognized the comment as an attempt at distracting her. Even if it wasn't working, it had seemed to pick at her attention for a few seconds, at the very least, enough to get her to breathe a little slower. The longer they sat there, though, the closer Agatha got to actually panting, unable to catch her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     They went around a couple of times and Rio kept muttering quiet musings in an attempt to get Agatha through those few minutes, but when they stalled at the top of the wheel so that the people below them could get off, Agatha had finally had enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I need out," she stated suddenly, cheeks the deepest red they had been since they'd climbed into the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, hey," Rio tried, but Agatha was starting to panic.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We have to get
     <em>
      out,
     </em>
     Rio!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew that was not an option. Rio also knew that Agatha was
     <em>
      fully aware
     </em>
     that it was not an option and yet, it didn't matter. Whatever it was about enclosed spaces coupled with heights, it was worse than Rio had expected when Agatha had offered her explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha tried to pull her hand away, Rio grappled at it and sandwiched between both of her own, keeping it in her hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, please look at me," Rio requested, once again utilizing the name only she knew to try and reach the part of Agatha that truly needed to hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't matter, Agatha couldn't actually
     <em>
      hear
     </em>
     what Rio was saying, not over the alarms and bells going off in her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to keep her tight hold on Agatha's hand, but she needed one of her own for something else. Slowly, as to not startle Agatha, Rio lifted one of them to reach across, fingertips gracing Agatha's far cheek in a request for her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "
     </em>
     Please
     <em>
      look at me,
     </em>
     Agatha,
     <em>
      "
     </em>
     Rio attempted again, applying a light pressure to convince her to comply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Agatha's head turned and those terrified blue eyes found Rio in their frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "
     </em>
     You're okay. We're okay. I promise,
     <em>
      "
     </em>
     Rio tried to convince, though she wasn't certain it was working with the way Agatha still looked so fucking frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I just want out,"
     </em>
     Agatha managed back weakly, looking every bit the poster child for a panic attack.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't get her out, but maybe she could take her away from it all, instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still maintaining that light touch on Agatha's cheek, Rio closed the space between them with a kiss that was most assuredly far too fucking soft for who they were, but she didn't care.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had needed to do
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     that was going to pull Agatha's anxiety-addled brain from its fugue state, and she had needed to do it fast. Even though the decision came with a certain level of risk, Rio didn't give a shit. All she cared about in that moment was getting Agatha calmed down.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it worked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stopped trying to get away, instead melting into the contact of their lips brushing tenderly. Rio's fingertips lightly caressed her cheek as she deepened the kiss, warming it enough to keep Agatha's focus on her over the fact that they had started to move again.
    </p>
    <p>
     It continued to work!
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha suddenly seemed oblivious to their surroundings, only interested in the fact that Rio was kissing her, that she was squeezing her hand and paying every last bit of attention to her. Rio could feel it, the way the fear was slowly seeping out of her, leaving her form a few seconds at a time. So Rio just kept kissing her, almost as if both of their lives were utterly dependent on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't anywhere near was heated as the make-out session they'd had in the pool, but it had been effective all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't want to fuck Agatha, though, not after that.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio truly wanted was to pull Agatha into her arms and apologize for making her feel as though she had to do something she knew would upset her. What she
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     wanted to do was kiss away every bit of the foreign emotion she realized she
     <em>
      did not like
     </em>
     seeing on Agatha's face and in her eyes. All she wanted was to make it go away and atone for the indiscretion of forcing Agatha's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lips worked tirelessly, just kissing the panic straight out of the startled woman before her and swallowing it whole. When Rio felt the gondola loosely swing to a stop, she pulled away, much to Agatha's chagrin. Her eyes flew open in worried question, one that fell from her immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why did you stop?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned back, indicating the door as the attendant pulled it open.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We're back on solid ground. How about we get out of here and get another drink?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't say it, but Rio could see that she was thankful, not for the reprieve of the ride being over, but because Rio had managed to make what could have been a nightmare into something more akin to a lucid dream.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scooted out, fighting herself the entire time to not reach behind her to offer her hand for Agatha to take. She didn't, despite how badly she wanted to, and instead waited for Agatha to slide out as well. Turning to begin their mini hike to the nearest beer cart, Rio found herself confounded by a catch on her pinky finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course it was Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't holding Rio's hand, not again, but she
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     assured in the way her pinky was locked tightly around Rio's, gripping firmly in her gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let it happen, squeezing right back as they ventured toward the nearest beer cart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Maybe you should get two wines for yourself," Rio teased softly, trying to ease any remaining nerves Agatha might still be having over her perceived moment of vulnerability.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew it was hard for her because she could see it written over every inch of Agatha's body and face. She was tense, she was uneasy, and she likely wanted to forget that it had even happened, but it wasn't something Rio could let go of so easily.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think I'm going to," Agatha murmured back. They stopped near a few high top tables and Agatha turned to face her, though she didn't drop the hold she had on Rio's finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm gonna go grab the drinks and we can head back home, but I'm gonna go alone. Just... for a minute, hm?" she told Rio, even if she tried to pose it as a question. Hidden in there was an unvoiced request for space and a second to catch her breath. Agatha was being too hard on herself, upset with the way she had buckled so easily, both to Rio's request and then to her own fears, but she wasn't understanding that it simply wasn't necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
     There wasn't any reality where Rio would ever judge her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded her understanding, even if she felt a ball of hot lead sink in her stomach when Agatha walked far enough away that the contact between them ceased. That unbearable heat might have gone even further if not for the way Agatha looked back over her shoulder, relieved blue pools landing on Rio for just a moment before a tiny smile caused her lips to twitch.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio leaned against one of the tables, propped on her elbow, she knew she had a lot to consider. She wanted to watch Agatha as she stood in line, but she didn't want to provide any unnecessary level of perception that might cause her to draw inward just as Rio was getting her to open up, even the most minute amount.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew that she had not been meant to see that. She knew that if Agatha could reach inside of her head and pluck that memory right out, she would never hesitate to do so. To Agatha, it was a moment of weakness. It was breaking down and showing that something could effect her in the future if Rio chose to hurt her with it. Now, she had given Rio this piece of her that she probably felt paramount to all else.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio wasn't going to turn it into a weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, those several minutes in that glass gondola had reminded Rio of one very important thing that she seemed to find herself forgetting with frequency: Agatha was still human.
    </p>
    <p>
     She might have been a stone cold serial killer, but she was still very much a person and one that had reasonable and logical emotions, no matter how good she had gotten at masking over them.
    </p>
    <p>
     And that humanity, Rio guessed, seldom made an appearance in front of another human being. Agatha's shame didn't need to consume her; Rio didn't
     <em>
      care.
     </em>
     All Rio cared about was making Agatha feel better, making her understand that if she had legitimate and valid reasons for saying no to something, Rio would never knowingly push. She needed to understand that Rio actually cared about how she felt in any given situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the midst of devising a plan to convince Agatha of such upon her return, Rio's eyes shifted to check on her, but were her vision was obstructed by a man who appeared directly in front of her, blocking her view.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had always been of the opinion that most white men looked like Machine Gun Kelly, and this guy looked to be no different. His hair was longer, but he had a hideous pencil thin mustache and the most mud-colored brown eyes Rio was sure he had ever seen. He had various tattoos and while Rio tried not to judge, the ones on his neck were so awful she couldn't even tell what they were meant to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     He'd seen her, alone, covered in tattoos, dressed the way she was, and assumed she might like a conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the last fucking thing in the world she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Heyy," he greeted, rubbing his palms together in front of him. Rio had watched too many TikTok videos of women mocking the behavior relentlessly, but she had never witnessed it in real time before and she saw the cause for disgust. That alone told her he was but a boy trying to step into a man's shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
     A man that never would have had a shot with Rio anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if her serial killer not-girlfriend was not standing thirty feet away, paying for wine and beer so that they could be moderately buzzed on their walk home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not interested," Rio informed him immediately, tone flat and expression deadpan.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But you're here all by yourself? Don't you want to have a little fun for the night?" he asked, reaching up to smooth back his untidily long hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not with you I don't," Rio assured him. "I have a girlfriend."
    </p>
    <p>
     She was so fixed on him, waiting for the next stupid thing to spill out of his mouth that she had lost sight of the background and lost sight of how Agatha was returning, all three cups pinched in the fingers of her left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio delivered another warning, still oblivious to Agatha's beeline straight for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So please, fuck
     <em>
      off."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, as he started to spew some comment where Rio was sure he was going to ask if he could watch, Rio jumped back, startled as he was jostled forward by Agatha who had deliberately bumped into him from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     missed it, the way Agatha's empty hand slid into the pocket of her blazer, stowing something away, but she caught it at the last second. Even so, it didn't quite register and she was instead focused again on the man who had been bothering her as Agatha came around and he snapped to her in order to voice his dissatisfaction at the physical contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What the f--" he started to bellow, but Agatha's free hand snapped up in front of his face, one finger held up to silence him.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I believe I heard the lady tell you to fuck off," she stated plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The man blinked, but was quickly fumbling over his words in response. "I was just..."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's fury was visible even from Rio's view as she stood behind her; she couldn't even begin to imagine what the look in Agatha's eyes was conveying to this asshole.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Y-y-y-you were just what?!" Agatha mocked, holding the cups out to her side as she took a step toward him, giving no shits that she was about two inches shorter than he was. "You were just annoying the fuck out of her is what you were doing. Now do as she said and
     <em>
      fuck. Off.
     </em>
     Or I promise you I will
     <em>
      make you fuck off
     </em>
     and no one you love will ever hear from you again."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a good thing he looked as scared as she did because just behind Agatha, Rio knew she meant every single word she was saying to him. She also seemed to be situationally blind for just a moment because she did not lower her voice or make it a quiet threat. Agatha wasn't shouting, but anyone who was
     <em>
      trying
     </em>
     to listen certainly would have heard her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The man didn't move. He just stared down at Agatha, as if she were going to tell him it was all a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she flinched at him menacingly instead, he stumbled backward and took off, briskly heading toward the end of the pier. She watched after him until he disappeared into the throngs of people that were only illuminated by the lamps posted on the railings, hanging overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, when she turned around, Rio saw something else new on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Worry.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you alright?" she asked as she paced the few feet between them, not shifting any of the cups to her right hand so that she could place it against Rio's side, looking her over.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm fine Ag--" Rio immediately bit her tongue, stopping herself from saying something she had no business saying given where they were. "I'm okay," she corrected softly, gaze dropping to the half-empty cups in Agatha's hand, having lost some of their contents in her collision with the nuisance of a man that had tried to ruin Rio's night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Taking the beer, she tossed back the few swallows left and crumpled up the cup before she found herself brave enough to look at Agatha again. "Can we go back to the condo?" Rio asked, her voice suddenly small and uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think we should," Agatha agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, when they departed, it was Rio's entire hand Agatha picked up after she threw away her own refuse so they could begin the journey back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though it had startled Rio those first two times, when Agatha clutched at her fingers through their trip back to the mouth of the pier, and then the lively city streets, Rio wasn't as shocked. In fact, she was more shocked at realizing how much she liked it, and how she never wanted Agatha to let go, no matter how unrealistic that was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Only a few blocks from the tower, Agatha slowed her pace at the sight of a small ice cream stand to the left on the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you want some ice cream?" Agatha asked her softly, though it gave Rio pause.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't strike me as the type to eat street food," she returned, glancing to Agatha with a wrinkled nose that displayed her confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's why I asked if
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     wanted some," Agatha answered, finally meeting her gaze with a playful curl of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio considered for just a moment; she didn't actually
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     it, but something in her felt as though Agatha was probably asking for a reason, and so after another second's thought, Rio gave a gentle nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she ordered a single scoop of brown butter almond brittle, Agatha had informed her she was paying. What she had not included was
     <em>
      how
     </em>
     she was paying.
    </p>
    <p>
     Smoothly and with an air of absolute arrogance, Agatha reached into the blazer pocket and produced a wallet. It was a wallet Rio had never seen before. It was... a
     <em>
      man's
     </em>
     wallet. Agatha coolly slid a $20 out and forked it over to the man who had served Rio her ice cream, a sweet smile on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Keep the change," she assured him, snapping the wallet shut once more before she tucked it back safely in her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the two of them began to walk again, Rio immediately pinned her with a narrowed gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha?" she cooed accusatorily, feeling safe to do so with no one close enough to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, princess?" Agatha shot back, not daring to meet Rio eye-to-eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you steal that man's wallet when you bumped into him?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was grinning, ear to ear, as she chose her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I refuse to answer that on the grounds that I believe you should get to maintain plausible deniability."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, lowering her ice cream.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You fucking criminal."
    </p>
    <p>
     That time, they both laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
     By the time Rio and Agatha made it back to the tower, Rio had happily finished her ice cream and even as they entered the elevator, Agatha was still holding her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the most immature sense of joy that had filled her, one that made Rio feel as though she were a teenager all over again with a crush that finally started paying her attention. Agatha was not a crush, though, not by any measure. Agatha was this perplexing and stupefying human being that had managed to wrap Rio around her finger with little effort and was holding her there with no reserves.
    </p>
    <p>
     On a deeper level than that, whatever was beginning to brew between them was more than just some physical dalliance that they would both move on from after a couple more rounds. It was stronger than the parameters of a fling, and for as much as pointing that out might flag Agatha's fight or flight response, it had weight to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was something that Rio found herself spinning on when they'd made it back up to the condo and she had departed for another shower with the explanation that she just wanted to wash off quickly. Agatha hadn't let her leave without something to say first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Take your time," she assured, leaning in for a kiss that filled Rio's stomach with a too-tender heat that she tried to ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And if I don't want to?" she asked back coyly, their lips only an inch apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will always be a champion of you doing whatever you want," Agatha returned, the slyest smile finding her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You say that because you have enough awareness of the fact that the thing I want to do most as of late is
     <em>
      you."
     </em>
     The smirk that found her was close to Agatha's, but she hid it by taking a kiss of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can't fault me for being practical," Agatha offered with a shrug. Her arm raised, and while Rio was almost certain Agatha was about to commit to the cupping of her cheek, she was not disappointed when Agatha held her neck instead, thumb working immediately to caress her jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You are a realist, I'll give you that." A braver but quicker peck left Rio with a smile as she pulled away. "I'll be right back. Don't have too much fun without me."
    </p>
    <p>
     While she had no intentions of taking longer than necessary, she knew that having some time to think wasn't going to be the worst thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, washing her body, Rio simply thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     She thought about where she was, in that condo, and how she had come to be there. She thought about how Agatha hadn't asked, had just told her to be ready for a weekend away and then once she was too far in to turn around, Agatha had told her the truth. She thought about how Phineas was there, too, because of a calculated decision on Agatha's part, one that more than took Rio's feelings into consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thought about how Agatha had asked her to stay in the first place because the true intention had been to offer her somewhere to go if she wanted out of her day-to-day for a couple of weeks. It had been a generous offer, but Rio didn't buy her whole 'you can if you want but a house sitter might be nice' act, not for a second. Agatha
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     it to have a surface level cover and she had aptly found one to provide, even if Rio saw through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, she thought about the pier. Agatha asking her to go in the first place had been
     <em>
      huge,
     </em>
     but the several steps she had taken in their time out? It had been an arm hold at first, but the ride on the Centennial Wheel had changed all of that.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio found herself thinking about that gondola ride, something in her chest squeezed. Agatha had been so insistent when they arrived about not doing it, but
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     had changed her mind. Rio knew it was likely her own wandering gaze and how it kept appraising the wheel and the sights she knew it offered, but Agatha hadn't needed to make such a concession.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had Rio known that the outcome would be, she wouldn't have let her do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Therein lay the beauty of it all; Rio hadn't known, but Agatha had, and she still made that choice. When Rio asked herself why, she wanted to find every insignificant reason that would not add to the fixation she already had with all that Agatha was. Maybe 'fixation' wasn't the right word, but Rio was in no way ready to admit that she might be feeling a little more than she should when it came to their dynamic.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't
     <em>
      allowed
     </em>
     to have feelings here, she knew that much. Whatever Agatha was, she was never going to be a romantic partner, or a 'girlfriend' as Rio had floated to try and get that man to leave her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     The man.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was a whole new cycle of thoughts; it was such a small interaction and while not much had happened within it, the entire situation shouted things at Rio that she was not ready to hear just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had spotted it happening, made her way straight over, and handled it the way only she could have. She had shown her strength when she ran into him, she had shown her prowess when she placed herself chest-to-chest with him, and she had shown her ferocity through not-so-empty threats. It had worked, and he had found himself spooked enough to stumble away, but that wasn't all there was to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had defended her,
     <em>
      protected
     </em>
     her even, and it made Rio feel things she did not know how to process.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to blame some possessive nature that she was not even sure Agatha actually had, but it would have made more sense than the alternative. Letting herself accept that in the few short months they had known one another, Agatha had come to appreciate and even care about her? That felt like a farce, like something that was as strong as wet paper when it came to holding any weight.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she stepped out of the shower and dried herself off, Rio had no answers as to why Agatha was choosing to do the things she was doing. Rio couldn't let it be personal, couldn't let herself have any idea that Agatha might want to keep her around for longer than just to house sit or get her sexual fill because those thoughts were dangerous. They were far too dangerous to find comfort in, of that Rio was certain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slipping into a too-large t-shirt and a pair of panties, Rio wandered out into the condo, perplexed by the fact that it was still mostly dark inside. Her gaze lifted to find Phineas asleep on the arm of the sectional and behind him, Agatha stood resolutely at the window, just staring out upon the small expanse of city and the large expanse of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without a word, and with quiet footsteps, Rio glided her way over, silent in her contemplation of what the right thing to do was. When she noticed that Agatha was holding something in her hands -- likely the wallet -- Rio made the choice to simply go with her gut. She stepped up behind Agatha, letting her hands fall to Agatha's hips as Rio's front pressed to her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha jumped slightly within Rio's hold, but seemed to settle immediately, almost melting into the contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmmm, did you enjoy your shower?"Agatha hummed softly, tipping her head back as Rio's chin shifted to hang slightly over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I did," Rio returned, losing all inhibitions as she turned her face into Agatha's neck. Drawing in a deep breath through her nose, Rio found herself getting lost in Agatha's scent, so light and fragrant like lavender or vanilla... maybe both. "Is this your
     <em>
      thinking spot?"
     </em>
     she added in question as she offered a light squeeze to Agatha's hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ah, am I being obvious?" came Agatha's soft answer. Truthfully, she was, but Rio wouldn't answer that question.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she would ask another.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what is it you might be thinking about?" Rio asked. Her chin dropped and settled, resting on Agatha's shoulder so that their heads were side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not stiffen in her hold, but she did offer a dismissal. "Oh, nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew that was a lie. If Agatha wasn't thinking about anything, she wouldn't have been staring out that window so fucking contemplatively and she would not have been holding that man's wallet after she took her blazer off. So, Rio decided to call her bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So you're definitely not thinking..." Rio muttered just before she placed a kiss to the side of Agatha's neck, "that you want to go to the address on that license..." Another pause, another kiss, though that one was a little higher. "And grab him up and take him to your barn?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was still lax in her hold, and for a moment, Rio thought she might have even breathed a laugh, but she did find a response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Maybe..." she trailed, head turning slightly into Rio's, something Rio thought she might have solely been doing for the contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     While this was a flattering idea in its own right, and perhaps the thought had crossed Rio's mind that it would be the ultimately declaration of 'I will protect you at all costs!' Rio was fully aware that Agatha kept to a set of rules, several guidelines that kept her on the path that she felt to be morally righteous.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she wanted to spend days looking into the guy to see if there was an actual reason to put him on her table, that would have been different, but she only had two days until she left to do so. It wasn't enough time, and Rio was not about to let her break protocol for personal feelings. When things got personal, they got
     <em>
      sloppy
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it would do them both some good to remember that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kissed a little higher, her lips brushing faintly over Agatha's ear so that she could whisper into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The chivalry here is undeniably so fucking sexy, and is definitely a turn on," Rio informed her. Her hands on Agatha's hips began to move, to slide higher first and then back down, fingers catching the camisole on the way back up to push it toward her chest.
     <em>
      "But you're not breaking your code for personal reasons."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed, clearly delighted by
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     , but Rio couldn't have guessed what.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sexy, hm?" she cooed back, raising an arm to reach back to cradle Rio's head. It was an encouragement for her to continue on both verbally and physically.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kissing her ear again first, Rio decided to oblige her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean, I thought about it... About you looking me in the eyes as you gave that simple little pull..."she husked.
    </p>
    <p>
     In time with her words, Rio's hands slipped beneath the camisole, palms rubbing firmly in tandem up Agatha's abdomen and chest despite the fact that her bra was prohibiting Rio from touching what she wanted most. Low sounds to content slipped from Agatha, the softest vibrations as they left her throat in spite of Rio's gentle chastising.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But we don't know for certain he's earned it. So... Maybe let this one go."
    </p>
    <p>
     To amplify her request, she lightly nipped at the lobe of Agatha's ear before placing a couple more kisses along the length of her neck. Still pliable in her hold, Agatha seemed to consider for a moment before she revealed her truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I can't stop thinking about it," she told Rio honestly, her weight sagging into the feeling of Rio's touch as it wandered her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well then, it seemed as though there was little else to do than find something else to occupy her mind. With that thought in her head, Rio's hands slid down Agatha's stomach, finding the fasten of her jeans and popping the button with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So let me give you something else to think about," Rio beguiled, gently plucking the waist of Agatha's panties to rub it between her thumb and forefinger. When Agatha released a soft whine, Rio gave a firm pull to the material, causing a pressure on Agatha's cunt that caused her to sway slightly in Rio's grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Fuck, Rio,
     </em>
     " she hissed sharply, fingers flexing into the back of Rio's scalp in encouragement. After another low hum, Agatha spoke again, not daring to let an opportunity pass by to razz Rio a little more. "Are you going to ask me to explain the golden ratio to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Rio responded, running the tip of her tongue along the edge of Agatha's ear at the same time she released Agatha's panties with another plan instead. Her touch sank between Agatha's folds, delving into excessive slickness. It drew a low groan from her, but Rio wasn't quite finished speaking. "I'm going to make you forget you know what the golden ratio even is."
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I've got an amazing me-memory
     <em>
      . Ohhhh, fuck,"
     </em>
     she attempted to banter back, but it was clear that Rio's touch was having its intended effect. She was trying to put up a fight, but it was pointless. Agatha's hips shifted down first and then back into Rio's own, clearly aching for more.
    </p>
    <p>
     If more was what she wanted, Rio could give her more.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not without a little fun first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's touch slowed and then ceased altogether; Agatha's disappointment both in her audible whine and the way she physically tried to throw her hips back, but Rio's feet stayed firmly planted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We can go to bed and wait until tomorrow?"Rio murmured in suggestion, though as she did so, her lips brushed lightly over the shell of Agatha's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a soft 'thud' the wallet hit the ground, freeing Agatha's hands so that they were able to reach for the hem of the camisole, pulling it immediately over her head with a speed that Rio was certain she hadn't seen out of Agatha before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio barely had time to pull her hand back before Agatha was moving again, shoving the waist of her jeans and underwear over her hips until they pooled around her ankles. With little effort, they were kicked off to the side as if they had never mattered at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, Rio sealed the space between them again, a hand raising between them so that she could work free the clasp above Agatha's spine, allowing her to drop her arms thoughtlessly so that it, too, could fall to the ground without a sound to be made.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was what Rio wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was what she wanted even before she knew she could have it, just Agatha and bare skin and beauty and sex. It was all she needed to propel her forward, to believe that the world was a fucked up place but that comfort could still be found within it. She had never once expected to find it in Agatha, but she wasn't going to question it lest she lose herself too deep in the what-ifs of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     With Agatha completely naked, Rio's arms wrapped around her, palms warming smooth skin as they traveled and explored, feeling out the divots and ridges and curves of Agatha's supple form.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I felt you,"
     </em>
     Rio murmured as her face dropped to Agatha's neck, lips resuming their hungry work of devouring her flesh on soft suckling at a time. "Have you been that wet all night or just since you got a chance to puff your chest?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't touching her again, not like that, not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the way Agatha's body was twisting in her hold said that she wanted her to.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Been wet since you got out of the shower the first time in that lace as fuck blouse," Agatha whined in response, hips attempting to shift back but Rio's hold on her ribcage prevented her from moving too much.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You like that, did you?" Rio shot back, nipping at the lobe of Agatha's ear, palms surfing upward to cup both of Agatha's breasts, further weakening the tension in her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was slacking a little too much for Rio to continue keeping her up, so she did the next best thing; she stepped forward, using the weight of her body to encourage Agatha to do the same. It took two steps before suddenly, Agatha's front was pressed to the glass and every curve of her backside was flush with Rio's body. She was pinned and the moment it caught up to her where she was, a louder and more raucous moan spilled out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Touch me,"
     </em>
     Agatha demanded gruffly, hips attempting to buck backward but finding no room for movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to comply, but with the way she had been holding Agatha when she pressed them forward, her arms were pinned. As such, she released the smallest amount of pressure so that he hands could travel, doing as Agatha asked, but only over her stomach and chest and sternum and breasts. It was exploratory, but it was also a large tease.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wait!" came Agatha's sudden croaking, as if she had remembered something long forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, she was just insistent about something else entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're not naked!" she nearly shrieked, as if Rio had committed the ultimate crime. It was something she actually found a deep amusement in, one that left her in a snide chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am not," she agreed huskily, kissing at Agatha's neck again. "Does that make you mad?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was squirming again, though not quite stuck to the glass with the addition of Rio's hands roaming her torso.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It sure as
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     doesn't make me
     <em>
      happy,"
     </em>
     she growled back, reaching behind her to claw at the oversized t-shirt Rio had thrown on after her contemplative scrub down.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a haughty chuckle of her own, Rio released Agatha from her hold but only to do as was expected of her, shedding the shirt, as well as the panties she had thrown on as if they were meant to stay on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yeah right.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe the shower had helped her wash some of the day off, but that consistent and soft drumming between her legs hadn't ceased since she'd watched the back of Agatha's body as she scared the shit out of a grown man. As a result, she knew she had no business giving Agatha shit for how fucking wet she was when she herself was absolutely not any better, but Agatha didn't need to know that.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as she was stripped completely, Rio's hands were back on Agatha's body, scouring waves of skin for any treasure of sound, any moan or whimper she could pull from a grasp or a pinched nipple that paired so nicely with the feeling of Rio's teeth sinking into her neck or shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio thought Agatha felt supreme, just like that. Their bodies were flush and while there was still inches between Agatha's nipples and the glass of the window, it was only to permit Rio to have free reign, to touch and grab and feel as she so pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Better my queen?"
     </em>
     Rio rasped in Agatha's ear. After only a second's hesitation, the tip of her tongue traced just barely along the edge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Much,"
     </em>
     Agatha choked back, though it was broken by a catch of her breath as one of Rio's hands began its journey down her stomach, fingertips purposely brushing over coarse hairs to be nothing more than enticing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think you just wanted to be one step closer to finding out how wet you've made
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     ," Rio dared to guess, and judging by the dark and fucking wicked laugh it pulled out of Agatha, she was right.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, I'm already thinking about returning the favor," she offered back, tone still husky and ragged as Rio's lips left her shoulder to their mercy, not hesitating to suck and bite in ways that would linger for days. She'd been thinking about it, all of it, since they'd gotten home and all she wanted was to simply show Agatha what it meant to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     All she wanted was to find some way to make her understand without using words that would betray her feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio clucked a soft admonishment in her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Wait your turn,"
     </em>
     she managed, finally pressing Agatha's body forward again to close off any space between her and the window, also effectively pinning her own arm in place just barely; it was fine only because her hand was exactly where she wanted it. Any movement she needed she would garner at any cost, but for the time being, her fingers dropped low enough to grace tauntingly over Agatha's entrance before skating through thick and hot slick to brush against her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     It happened so quick that Agatha's body tensed like she'd been hit with lightning, hips trying so desperately to meet the contact, to get more of it even if she had nowhere to actually go, stuck by the way Rio's weight was fully slung into her, holding her in place.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "God, Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio breathed in her ear, pressing her hips forward with moderate force at the same time she began a steady circling around Agatha's clit. Teeth were grazing the lobe of her ear before Rio found her voice again amidst Agatha's broken whimpering the quicker Rio's pace began. "Seeing you so angry made me want to fuck you on the spot. Fucking hell."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could tell Agatha wanted to speak, wanted to say something, but the way she slid Agatha's clit between her first two fingers and clamped them together to catch it between them, it pulled out a raw and low moan, one that sounded like it came from the deepest caverns of Agatha's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Almost told you we could fuck in the bathroom."
    </p>
    <p>
     Another tug, another wily moan that jumped from Agatha's lungs, her hips trying to fight against the pressure Rio had on them to no avail.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio released the pressure and used both fingers to resume the circling she had abandoned previously, more intentional pressure to bring Agatha to climax like her body was so desperately craving.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You were a
     <em>
      good girl
     </em>
     and waited, but you don't have to anymore," Rio whispered against her skin, just loud enough to be heard. The pressure was more present and her movements were deliberate and quickening to a point where she could
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     in Agatha's entire body that she was losing the battle of wills to keep holding out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could also feel the physical response to her words, the way Agatha's body shivered and began to tense more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was
     <em>
      so close
     </em>
     and all Rio wanted was to get her there, to feel her come undone beneath every inch of her body, to feel her shatter in ways those windows never would.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to hear Agatha's pleasure, every last bit of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was kissing her way back up Agatha's neck, lips finding her ear to breathe a request into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cum for me, beautiful,"she beseeched, thrusting her hips forward in a way that completely pinned them both, leaving absolutely no room for movement. "Give me what you've been wanting all night, Agatha."
    </p>
    <p>
     If her words hadn't been enough to trigger it, the reasonably loud moan she dumped right into Agatha's ear definitely stamped every single button it needed her, causing Agatha's body to still just before she dissolved into trembling, crying out in a way that scared the ever-loving fuck out of the cat who bolted off, claws ripping up the carpet in his terrified frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't focused on Phin, not when she had Agatha crying out so beautiful like that as her knees buckled under the weight of her orgasm. She was fine, held up by the sheer power of Rio's own strength, keeping her pinned against the glass as she rode out wave after wave, simply shaking against every strained muscle Rio possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Mmmm, good girl,"
     </em>
     Rio praised once more, voice still low and rich with her pleasure. Again, Agatha had a visceral reaction, trembling and whining in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     She
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     seemed to like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Noted.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, the reasoning for that likely had awful depth and content, but it wasn't something that needed exploring right then. All that mattered in those moments was the way Rio's fingertips were still teasingly running laps around Agatha's clit, causing her muscles to twitch and her body to jerk within the confines of Rio's hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stayed like that for a few moments longer, Rio's other hand sliding from between them to pull Agatha's hair over one shoulder so that she was able to place a few soft kisses down the center of her neck, stopping when she reached the spot between her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You okay for me to move?"Rio murmured in soft request against Agatha's skin, her touch finally desisting in its movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't answer, but she did give a gentle nod of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio stepped away, Agatha stayed as she was for only a few moments longer, simply heaving with her chest against the glass, Rio's hands still holding onto her, though with far less strength. She trusted Agatha when she said she was fine, but it was clear that the heat of it all had left her rather winded.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a valiant effort, Agatha spun in place and slouched against the glass, cheeks pink in the traces of light from the kitchen that reached her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could have cracked a remark or been sarcastic, but what Agatha chose to do surprised Rio and delighted her all the same. Agatha chose to take her by the wrist, pulling her back in so breasts were brushing breasts and their stomachs were flush until their hips met. At the same time, her other hand lifted and cradled Rio's jaw, demanding in its pull to draw her in, to bring her close enough to kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a hot kiss, one that said so many things Rio did not know how to hear, so she simply chose to take it at face value. She let Agatha kiss her like that because it made her feel wanted, made her feel like she was right where she should have been, skin pressed to Agatha's in heat and sweat and desire pooling between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wore on, a gentle warring of tongues and moans and whines as Rio grew more and more desperate for relief, to be touched by Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silent demand sat within her, but Agatha heard it anyway. Her hand slid around Rio's neck, carefully fastening to her throat in a way that excited her the same every single time, nearly causing her legs to give out beneath her. With that grip, Agatha pulled her back and severed the kiss, taking a step forward at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio could keep up, Agatha was using force to guide her, to spin her around so that it was her back pressed to the window instead of Agatha's. The glass was
     <em>
      cold,
     </em>
     but it felt like relief against the radiating waves of heat that rippled up and down her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     A helpless moan slipped out from between parted lips as on of Agatha's hands grabbed at a breast, lifting it so that her ducked head could reach it, pulling it into her mouth as she licked and sucked at the pebbled nipple to be found there. Rio's hand fired up, landing on the back of Agatha's head, gripping her hair in a silent plea for more.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was only half met.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's other hand raised to knead at the unattended breast, desperate and wanting, but before Rio could lose herself in the feeling, both were gone and she was left pouting at the lack of stimuli.
    </p>
    <p>
     When her eyes fluttered open, the wicked grin she found before her made her stomach fill with sparks that would surely turn to flames if left unchecked. Agatha was
     <em>
      so fucking beautiful
     </em>
     in
     <em>
      the most
     </em>
     predatory way, most of all when it was Rio who happened to be her prey.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands found a firm hold on Rio's hips, but not for long, as she used her grip to pull Rio toward her first, then to turn her around.
    </p>
    <p>
     The force with which she used to press Rio's front to the window was moderately more than what Rio had used, but that was
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     how Rio wanted it. She wanted Agatha to know that she could use her power, that she could leave bruises and bumps and it was only going to thrill Rio further when she got to poke and press them in reminder of that time Agatha fucked her against the window of her 72nd floor condo.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was when Agatha's hands found her arms, pushing them up so that they were pressed flat to the glass that Rio realized she may have been underestimating just how bad Agatha wanted this, maybe even needed it. The way Agatha was touching her was hard, it was heavy, it was
     <em>
      present.
     </em>
     She was clearly finding herself consumed with desire and if this was how Rio was going to benefit?
    </p>
    <p>
     She would
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     complain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those skilled and deadly hands trailed down forearms, crooked around the curves of elbows and found Rio's sides, fingers grazing what sections of side-boob she could given how they were smashed to the glass, just as Rio's cheek was, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     A soft kiss was placed to her ear before Agatha's lips traveled down her neck, over her shoulder. Those kisses traveled even lower, though as Agatha's hands moved lower, they stopped on Rio's hips with a purpose: keeping her firmly against the window as Agatha stepped back enough to leave a trail of kisses down her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was taking her time, much to Rio's chagrin, but it was doing everything she hoped it would and more. Rio was desperate, aching, in absolute need of what it would feel like to have Agatha touch her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been so distracted by the feeling of Agatha's lips on her back that she did not even notice as Agatha released a hip to withdraw her hand only to press the back of it to Rio's thigh in request, wanting her to widen her stance. Catching up, Rio complied and shifted her foot out just enough that when she settled again, she felt two of Agatha's fingers slide right into the sheer soaking want that had been building between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh fuck,"
     </em>
     Agatha hissed, seemingly caught off guard by how truly aroused Rio had become throughout the course of their exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, it was difficult for Rio to
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     be that wet at almost any given time when she was in Agatha's presence, but she'd been working on it.
    </p>
    <p>
     This wasn't going to help at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was going to be another memory for her to reflect on when she was alone and needed relief when Agatha was not around. Maybe it would be in a few days when Agatha was gone and Rio took up residence in that bed and throughout that condo.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, she was simply lost in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was weak at the mere touch, Agatha's fingers deliberately seeking out the most pleasurable points she could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took seconds before Rio was stumbling through breaths, trying to keep them from catching each time Agatha would skim her clit or press tauntingly at her entrance, but it felt futile. Agatha had learned her so quickly, seemed to know every single right move to make in a way that would drive Rio out of her mind with anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Agatha,"
     </em>
     she managed, cheek still flat against the glass as she attempted to lift her hips in spite of Agatha's hold on her left one. It only half worked, but it provoked Agatha to change tactics, both hands landing on its respective cheek of Rio's ass, squeezing firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio realized that somewhere in the exchange, she'd completely missed how Agatha had wound up on her knees, once more ready to take what it was she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh mother fuck.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     This woman was going to be death of her, an intentional mark on her tally. As opposed to having her spinal cord severed, Agatha was just going to rip Rio's soul right out of her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Stand still," Agatha growled when Rio attempted to push her hips back, stopped by the pure strength in Agatha's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to offer a rebuttal, but Agatha gave her no opportunity to do so as her thumbs sunk inward, pulling Rio's lips apart enough to expose her for the incoming assault on the part of her she would always believe Agatha most coveted. Agatha only proved that the moment Rio felt her tongue on her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had already learned that Agatha was in possession of a tongue that she knew how to use like a weapon, one that could completely flay Rio alive in the most exultant way imaginable, but the moment she set to work, kneading and pulling Rio's asscheeks apart, Rio felt like she was far too close to coming for her liking.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      GET IT TOGETHER. DO NOT FUCKING DO THAT SHIT AGAIN.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The voice was shouting, screaming in her head as she tried to refocus her attention somewhere else, somewhere that wouldn't lead her to having her first orgasm within forty-five seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she thought about dead bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was really hard to think about dead bodies when Agatha's tongue kept making swipes like
     <em>
      that.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It just made Rio think about
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     dead bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh,
     <em>
      no!
     </em>
     That was only going to make her cum faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      FUCK.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice! Think about Alice! Super platonic Alice!
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh shit,
     <em>
      why was she thinking about her best friend while getting head?!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Because she was too fucking weak for Agatha and the things she knew how to do to Rio's body and she did not want to be a weeping puddle of cum before Agatha even got a sliver of satisfaction from her work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being easy on the strap was one thing, but as they melded there together, the last thing Rio wanted was for it to be over before it began.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so she fought, though she tried to find more reasonable things to think about, like the art in Agatha's bedroom or Phineas. It was hard to focus on any of those things when Agatha felt
     <em>
      so goddamn good
     </em>
     there between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     In no way was Rio shy about letting it be known. It was mostly a slew of moans, some half-choked by the way Agatha would pass a particularly pleasurable spot, but there were a few low groans thrown in for variety.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite how impossibly good it felt, Agatha seemed to find herself dissatisfied. When she stopped, Rio was dissatisfied times about a million, letting out a cry in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Agatha no!"
     </em>
     she hissed, but Agatha was already letting go of her in her urge to reposition. Both of her hands found Rio's hips, pulling them out further than she'd been maintaining. Satisfied, her hands then moved to Rio's thighs as she urged them further apart. Compliant and desperate to feel Agatha's attention back on her core, Rio was willing to do anything it took.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just when Rio thought they were getting somewhere, Agatha rose to her feet behind her, giving a firm smack between her legs, straight against her aching cunt, before she just fucking
     <em>
      walked away.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whipped her torso back, skin peeling from the glass in a way that almost hurt, as her eyes whipped open to locate Agatha who was already sauntering her way back, this time with a pillow in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     A big, cushy pillow that she placed on the floor through the space of Rio's stance before she, herself,
     <em>
      climbed right through
     </em>
     the same space.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking like she was staring up at a million bucks, Agatha sat right on that pillow with her back against the glass, hungry blue gaze drinking in every last visible inch of the body above her, made a little easier by the way Rio was bracing herself on her forearms after Agatha's too unnecessary departure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her head dropped, that pupil-consumed gaze finding the woman beneath her, grinning like she possessed every last drop of luck there was to be had in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     "View's nicer," Agatha murmured at her, reaching up to weave her arms through Rio's legs so that she could hook them over her hips, gripping tightly in request that they be dropped just enough for her to have the access she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she complied and lowered her hips to meet Agatha's awaiting mouth, Agatha gave another harsh pull on her hips, jerking her forward so that her chest fell flush against the window but her feet stayed planted.
    </p>
    <p>
     A thunderous moan hit the air around them and at first, Rio thought it had come from her. It had, but it had also harmonized perfectly with the one Agatha let out against her body, shaking her straight to her bones. That time, the way her hips dropped and rolled was not in answer to an unasked question, but nothing more than primal instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of her hands had dropped from the window, finding Agatha's hair with ease as she let herself mentally lower those walls she had been trying to keep up to get herself to last just a little longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was it, it was too much as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     So when Agatha's hand released her hip and dropped so that she could press two fingers directly into Rio's tight core?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was damn near done for.
    </p>
    <p>
     So cooked there was no salvaging what was left.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried, she
     <em>
      really, really
     </em>
     tried, but by Agatha's fourth thrust, Rio was nearly leaving scratch marks both in the glass and Agatha's scalp as the rush of her orgasm struck her. It was powerful and crippling, but in the most beautiful possible way, leaving her gasping for air like she had never known what it was to breathe before.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Fuck, Ag-Agatha,"
     </em>
     she moaned, hips thrusting down despite herself. It took her about three seconds before she realized that the only reason she was still remotely upright was because Agatha was supporting her, hands on the backs of her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, and with a measured sense of care that Rio had never really considered Agatha to be capable of, Agatha lowered her into her lap as she sat against the window, allowing Rio to fold into her chest, skin damp with sweat and chest still heaving.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were no words, no soft jabs or playful quips for those first few moments. Instead, Agatha's hands lifted and fingertips found places to land and caress on both Rio's side as well as her back. Agatha wasn't holding her, but she was touching her as a very blatant reminder that she was there, and that she wasn't going anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Rio might find that Agatha's show of affection could be more comforting than an embrace yet.
    </p>
    <p>

   <div>
    <p>
     After a little more recovery, despite her legs still feeling like jelly, Rio let Agatha climb to her feet and carry her to bed with a gentleness that almost felt foreign. It wasn't so much that Rio thought Agatha to be incapable of such emotion, just that she
     <em>
      chose
     </em>
     not to show it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she was choosing to, now.
    </p>
    <p>
     While Rio's primary goal had been coaxing Agatha to lower her defenses just enough to let her in, she had never actually thought she would reap any success from it. Of course it was a hope, it was something Rio
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to happen, but it was a two party system in the fact that Agatha had to want it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she did. Maybe this was Agatha trying to say things she didn't have words for. Maybe this was her way of trying to make Rio see that she wasn't the only one trying, she wasn't the only one showing up for this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course there were larger showings of it, like the fact that Rio had already decided to fully accept Agatha's invitation to stay in the condo in her absence. Maybe she shouldn't, but it was... a dream. Sure, it would have been better if Agatha didn't have to leave, but who
     <em>
      wouldn't
     </em>
     want to poise themselves up above the city with a view like
     <em>
      that?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She could have said it was selfish, that she wanted the luxury of the massive televisions, the view, the pool, but it wasn't completely true. The lavish and rich aspect was a perk, but that was all it was. Rio would have stayed in any dwelling Agatha offered her if it meant that Agatha was the one doing the offering. She had asked because it meant something to her, because she had put a considerable amount of thought into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wanted Rio around, and Rio wanted to
     <em>
      be
     </em>
     around.
    </p>
    <p>
     If her taking up space in Agatha's abode for a couple of weeks might offer some form of comfort to them both, it was something Rio could do with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they had crawled in bed, Rio had not been under any illusions that she was entitled to any physical reassurance. She had not wordlessly sought it out, nor did she ask Agatha for it. She had already made the concession before and Rio did not think it the best idea to potentially force her hand on it again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had already made one choice that night that had put her in an uncomfortable headspace. Rio didn't want her there again.
    </p>
    <p>
     So when Agatha finished drinking her water and relaxed back into the bed, Rio had not been expecting for her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come here," Agatha requested softly. She wiggled a bit under the covers and raised her arm to tuck her hand behind her head, exposing the right side of her body for Rio to curl up against.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to ask if she was sure, if it was what she really wanted, but she didn't want to risk it. More than that, Agatha seemed to not like it very much when she challenged her seemingly out-of-character decisions. For anyone else, hand holding and cuddles were almost obligatory after a third fuck and first date, but not for Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Agatha, making sacrifices where she could was how she said the things to Rio she couldn't say in words.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio snuggled into her side and let the tiredness weigh heavy on her form, she found a request that she couldn't let get away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tracing the lightest shapes over the center of Agatha's chest, Rio whispered hushedly into the night, not really expecting an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you think I might be able to get to know more about you tomorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was quiet, but it was an obvious plea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's muscles did not tense, but she
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     stop breathing. It was at the peak of an inhale, one that she kept in and did not exhale. Rio kept waiting, anticipating that release of breath, but the seconds ticked on as Agatha seemed to think and think. And then, she seemed to think more.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Rio was going to lift her head to gauge if Agatha had actually passed out as a result of the question, the softest sigh fell from Agatha's lips, her chest sinking beneath Rio's head. She kept tracing those shapes, not having stopped throughout Agatha's stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't answer, still, and Rio considered pressing, but something else happened first: Agatha dropped her arm, her hand landing on Rio's hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you ask something I don't want to answer, a 'no' is good enough. It's my only rule."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's voice was akin to a whisper, but lacked even the volume to qualify as such, but Rio could tell that she meant it. Once more, Agatha was making a choice to try to give Rio what it was she wanted. She did not
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to do these things, but the fact that she kept
     <em>
      choosing
     </em>
     to spoke to her true intent.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can abide by that," Rio murmured back, eyes falling shut as her fingertips slowed in their light caress, but did not stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     At least, they did not stop until she finally dozed off to the feeling of Agatha's thumb brushing back and forth over her hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next morning, Rio did not wake when Agatha did, nor did she wake when Agatha slid out from under her to make her way to the washroom to undergo her morning skincare routine. She did not even rouse as Agatha dressed herself and made her way to the elevator, descending to greet the city streets on a not-so-typical Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, even as Agatha returned an hour later with coffee and bagels, Rio was still fast asleep. The only difference was that she had wound up face down, the bare cheeks of her little ass uncovered despite the blanket covering most of her back. Well, not the only difference, as Phineas had taken up residence against her elbow in the spot Agatha had been occupying before her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was in those quiet, sleep-filled moments that she missed something.
    </p>
    <p>
     She missed the way Agatha had watched them, watched her, as she contemplated how she had been living her life for nearly forty years. She missed the way Agatha traced her form with that chilling blue gaze, but in those moments when no one else -- not even Rio -- could see, that gaze was much softer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio even slept through the ten minutes it took Agatha to set up the small spread for breakfast and make her way back to the bedroom, back to finally stir Rio from her slumber. She kneeled on the bed enough to reach Rio's form, giving her a light shake by way of the hip she could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     "M'up, m'up," Rio grumbled, heavily wiping at her own face as an irrational first act of consciousness. It had no logic to it, but perhaps she could brush away some of the exhaustion in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There's bagels and coffee in the kitchen," Agatha informed her, but instead of removing the hold on Rio's hip, her palm flattened and smoothed over Rio's asscheek. It wasn't suggestive or inappropriate, just a light caress that might get her synapses firing a little faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     It did.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that little nudge, Rio's form wound to life, pulling herself up enough to scoot toward the edge of the bed. Before she could get there, Agatha had already departed toward the door and was passing right through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was silly, but Rio wished she would have stayed, if only for a moment. She would have liked to sit at the edge of the bed and start her day with a kiss, starting the day bare and on full display in front of a woman who's attention felt awfully fucking nice. It would have been nice to just feel normal for once, but she had to be real with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing about her dalliance with Agatha was ever going to be normal.
    </p>
    <p>
     She dressed herself, that morning in leggings and a sports bra, not bothering with an actual shirt. There was really no point; they weren't immediately headed out and it was clear Agatha had brought breakfast to them. Rio wondered if that had been by design; just before she had fallen asleep, Agatha had agreed to be a little more forthcoming. Surely, she did not want to do so in any kind of public setting.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A lazy Sunday in for us then?" Rio crooned as she paced into the kitchen, surveying the spread of thirteen bagels and three tubs of schmear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I thought it could serve us well after our little adventure yesterday," Agatha returned calmly, as if those words didn't say several other things at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had dared to breach her bubble of comfort and it had taken its toll on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     If someone would have told Rio three months ago that serial killers could have emotional hangovers, she would have laughed. Even more, she would have undeniably
     <em>
      cackled
     </em>
     , but she could clearly see that despite all of her ego and arrogance and steely demeanor when it came to executing the unworthy, Agatha was still capable of feeling
     <em>
      something.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't guess what that something might be, or if there was even actually a word for it, but she was quite certain that whatever it was, it had a firm hold on Agatha whenever they shared space.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was even more obvious as they ate breakfast and sipped at their coffees at the dining room table, Phineas chirping softly from his spot at the window. When Rio lifted her head to peer over at him, a grin found her at the smears of sweat visible on the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can clean that later," she mused with a light giggle, dark but amused gaze sweeping over to Agatha as her grin only seemed to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't have to," Agatha dismissed, "the maid will be here tomorrow while you're at work. I'll be here, but I don't mind looking her in the eye." The smirk that tugged on Agatha's lips was most certainly daring, but there was a light of humor that sparkled in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     This raised a flag of abnormality at the forefront of Rio's mind, causing her to perk up slightly. "You don't have to go in tomorrow?" she asked, trying not to look too eager, or like it was giving her the idea of calling in sick to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't, but because my flight leaves tomorrow evening at nine. So, I will be here if you want to take the time after work to go back to your place and get more of your things," she explained, as if it were still
     <em>
      so fucking casual
     </em>
     that Rio was going to be staying in that multi-million dollar condo for the next week and a half to two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Or..." Rio offered, popping a piece of bagel into her mouth as she chewed in thought, watching Agatha carefully. "I could just call in and we could spend one more day together before you have to go."
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she said it, Rio regretted it. She wished she would have found another way to word it, like maybe 'I can call off tomorrow so we can spend all day fucking like wild beasts,' or maybe 'I can pretend to be sick so that we can go for a daytime round against the window.' She wished that she would have said anything other than what she said, because what she said caused Agatha's face to shift just enough to be noticeable.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a big enough shift that it made Rio wonder why she had to get so fucking far ahead of herself, seemingly forgetting the reality in which she consistently existed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know that thing you said about not breaking code?" Agatha posed back, lifting her coffee to take a long sip as she eyed Rio over the rim.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Of course
     </em>
     Rio knew, she was the one who said it. But that meant she also understood what it was Agatha was trying to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Me calling out of work pales in comparison to --"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Situationally, yes, but in terms of moral culpability, not really," Agatha retorted, setting her coffee cup down with a raised brow as she stared Rio down, daring her to raise protest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Would you care to elaborate on such an interesting theory?" Rio asked back, tilting her head slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your work means quite a bit to you," Agatha explained with a shrug, reaching down to thumb at the paper that had been laying untouched on the table in front of her. "Deciding to call out for no other reason than to spend more time with me is a misuse of a sick day that you might actually need. Plus, you don't actually
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to miss work. I know you better than that."
    </p>
    <p>
     She was right. She
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     know Rio better than that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't sure if that should excite her or put her on the edge of not knowing what it was they were actually
     <em>
      doing.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     For the time being, she chose complacency and did nothing but shrug her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's just work, but I understand the point you're trying to make, even if I believe them to be vastly incomparable situations." It was a white flag, an offer that the conversation had run its course and she understood that Agatha did not
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     her to make that choice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she just needed a little time to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was something Rio could understand, something she could even relate to at certain times, but it wasn't something she'd ever really felt when it came to Agatha. Actually, every time that Agatha had left her alone in her apartment, she'd wanted nothing more than for her to come back, to staunch the loneliness that she felt so deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn't much felt the need to say it so plainly, but she knew what it felt like to fuck but not love, to be physical but not actually feel. She knew what it was like to seek out comfort in a sexual connection and find little relief.
    </p>
    <p>
     So maybe that was what this was. Maybe it was relief, a relief that neither of them had really known.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was empty of love, but not connection. That connection had bloomed out of the physical, but something else was branching off, growing slowly but strongly. Rio didn't know how to identify it, how to put some kind of brand or label on it, but she was watching as it seemed to progress hour by hour.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then you'll go to work like a good girl and I will have dinner for us when you make it back. I can't stand the thought of plane food, first class or not," Agatha detailed, making a face that showed her disgust at the idea of a tray meal that might be dropped in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can't just pepper in a 'good girl' when you're trying to convince me to do something I don't want to do and think it'll work every time," Rio told her, picking up her coffee to take a long sip, eyes dark and challenging as she watched the woman beside her, not oblivious to the way Agatha's foot had begun to caress her calf again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But it'll work this time," Agatha offered back, her grin bright but glinting in the morning light like a freshly polished blade.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We'll see," Rio pushed back, but for no other reason than to appear as though she were putting up a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
     They both knew she would listen, even if it meant less time spent together.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We shall."
    </p>
    <p>
     That seemed to end the conversation only moments before the finished their meal and decided on a plan for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Movies and snacks (grapes, pineapple, and strawberries, though only later) while propped in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Between the blackout curtains and the massive projector screen, they might as well have been in a theater. When they had initially settled in, Rio was... unsure. What was too much? What was not enough? So, instead of over thinking it, she placed herself directly next to Agatha, their hips barely touching.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was the one to scoot over, the one to close off
     <em>
      any
     </em>
     amount of space that might have existed between them. She was the one to make sure they were pressed together as they scrolled through an endless list of films.
    </p>
    <p>
     The one they settled on?
    </p>
    <p>
     Ironically, it was Agatha's choice.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Accountant.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed. "Is there a kinship there or something?" she teased, leaning into Agatha in a humorous show of heckling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Agatha responded. "It's just a good movie."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let her put it on, let her sink back into the pillows and did the same, finding herself comfortably leaned against Agatha in a way that did not seem to draw any kind of protest. It felt nice to simply relax and watch a movie she had already seen next to someone whose company she was finding she quite liked to keep.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, that did not mean that Rio was clueless to Agatha's motivations.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was clearly stalling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let her, if only a little while longer. By the time The Accountant was over and Agatha was turning on a Halle Berry horror film from the early 00's, Rio had fetched a bowl of fruit for them to share and they settled in once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio was never going to let the chance to know more get away from her, even if Agatha was clearly trying to stave it off and avoid it for a little while longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     In front of them, almost in front of the very point where their knees met, the remote was laying on the bed. Without picking it up, Rio pressed three times on the little negative symbol, the one that lowered the volume around them -- still slightly annoyed that there was fucking surround sound in the goddamn bedroom, too -- and sat back as if she had done nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, Agatha's head turned; Rio could see it in her periphery but she did not meet it. Instead, she popped a grape into her mouth and waited for Agatha to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she did, her voice was low and
     <em>
      tried
     </em>
     to be sharp, but did not quite make it there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes?" she questioned, clearly sensing that Rio had lowered the volume for a reason.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So I've been wondering," Rio began, stealing one more grape to chomp on before she continued, "if heights and enclosed spaces are a big 'no,' how are you able to fly? Or ride the elevator up here?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Rio turned her head so that she could find those curious blue eyes, though as the question settled in her mind, the softened the tiniest bit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was quiet for a moment, considering the best way to answer such a query. Rio sensed that there was likely an obvious answer, but she wanted to hear it off of Agatha's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When I can't see what's around me, I'm okay," Agatha answered lowly, reaching over to pluck a strawberry from the bowl before taking a bite to stall the continuation of her explanation. Her eyes had wandered, no longer finding comfort in Rio's dark gaze; she was taking a painfully long time to finish, but Rio knew why. To Agatha, she was admitting flaws, weaknesses, and it was making her uncomfortable. "It's irrational. Truly. And I think that's why I hate it so much. But if this fucker only had a glass elevator? I'd find somewhere else to live."
    </p>
    <p>
     She finished her answer by also finishing off her strawberry, but she did not otherwise move. It was a fair enough answer, but Rio felt like there was more to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But," Agatha decided to amend, "planes are... mostly doable with a bar of Xanax. It's not often I like to be robbed entirely of my wherewithal, but if I can sleep for eight to twelve hours as a result, I'm alright with it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, so Agatha's anxiety was a little deeper than she'd dared to let on before. Rio had an inkling, but she hadn't wanted to spook Agatha by pointing it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alright. One question down.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So... Does that mean if you travel a lot for work that you have a Xanax addiction?" Rio teased, looking back over at the woman beside her despite the fact that Agatha's gaze was fixed on the screen across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha parted her lips to form a retort, but before she could, a flash of grey appeared over the edge of the bed as Phineas made the leap, clearly upset by the fact that no one had paid him attention in a few hours. He padded his way over to Rio, begging for love that she met with several rough strokes along his spine. The pressure mixed with the relief caused him to lower to the bed, laying contentedly in front of Rio's crossed legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, it's the only time I use them. I don't really like being too out of touch with my faculties and awareness. It's why I don't drink enough to get drunk, or use illicit substances," Agatha informed her, picking up a piece of pineapple to munch on. It was a fair enough answer, one that Rio felt aligned perfectly with who Agatha presented herself to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cooking up her next question, Rio couldn't help but lean into Agatha a little more, letting her head drop to rest on her shoulder in a daring show of boldness. It was likely Agatha would scoot over, try to separate them again.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't lay her head on Rio's, but she let her stay there, even as she posed her next inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What was your longest relationship?" she asked, though this question sounded at a much lower volume and with less of an interrogatory tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was quiet for a moment before she gave her answer, one Rio really hadn't been expecting.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not lift her head, did not swing an accusatory gaze and tell Agatha she wasn't being fair. All Rio did was provide a response of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, hm," she murmured, her lips twisting as she considered the next query to pose. "What about the last time you were happy? Like... truly happy. Where you might have found yourself sitting in it to bask in what it felt like."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could already tell Agatha wanted to offer that one word again by the way her body tensed ever-so-slightly, but it relaxed again at the same time she heard a soft sigh pass through Agatha's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Maybe a year ago," Agatha finally supplied, though she picked up another piece of fruit. It was quickly becoming an obvious stalling tactic, but Rio wasn't going to call it out. There was really no point; Agatha was still being cooperative, even if she was taking her time to do so. "It was a work thing, so kind of pathetic. But there had been a cooling issue on the ISS that --" she paused, sensing that her lingo might need slight elaboration, "International Space Station -- we only had two weeks to fix. I spent about eight of those days in an office with six white boards and another woman and two men."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused, offering a chuckle that almost sounded snide. "I drank at least five gallons of coffee in that time, but before the two weeks was up, I had mostly figured out what it was that we needed to build to send up so that they could repair it on board. With some help from Gina -- the other woman -- we had it manufactured and a mission slated to have it brought to them. By the end of that two weeks, it was rectified and I celebrated with the most expensive Filet Mignon I could find in the city."
    </p>
    <p>
     Listening to Agatha, as her tone and her inflection matched with the content of what she was actually saying, Rio could tell she meant it. She was
     <em>
      proud
     </em>
     of what she had accomplished in those two weeks, rightfully so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was still a mystery, but she was a mystery with reasons and motivations for the things she did. She was still an individual that sought fulfillment in life, just one that found it in unlikely and depraved places that others would never dare to look. For Agatha, she found it in a career she had conned her way into because she could not find it in connections with other people. She found it in her moral crusade that she took on under the cover of night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, it seemed as though she was seeking it in the form of company.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not just any company, but Rio's company.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of pressing on that thought, Rio switched things up. "Have you ever had a pet? You seem to really like cats..." Rio trailed, her eyes casting down to the sleeping feline beneath the gentle strokes of her fingertips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I haven't had one myself, but my roommate when I was nineteen did," Agatha answered honestly, reaching out on her own accord to join Rio in her light petting of Phineas. He did not stir or mew or chirp. He simply enjoyed it in his slumber. "Her name was Tofu and she was a calico. Absolute little shit."
    </p>
    <p>
     At that, Rio could not contain the light giggle that left her. "I take it she was a vegetarian?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's head shook. "No. There was no reason for it. She brought it home, looked it in the eye and said 'Your name is Tofu.' No elaboration, no explanation. So... she was just Tofu."
    </p>
    <p>
     They were both laughing by the time Agatha finished speaking and in a moment where Rio's inhibitions slipped, she scooted a little closer -- or, at least tried to -- and snuggled in
     <em>
      just that much
     </em>
     more.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha's hand rested on her knee, Rio considered just... picking it up. Just holding it in her lap as a show of a little more. It could have been reassurance, could have been comfort, wouldn't have really mattered. Rio simply wanted to be closer to her. But she didn't. She kept her hands to herself and pondered what it was she wanted to ask next.
    </p>
    <p>
     The one she found felt... a little dangerous and yet, the impulse of asking won out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When was the first time you saw a dead body?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha surprisingly did not stiffen at such a question, although Rio wasn't sure why she thought she might. She was even more surprised when Agatha's return came calmly and was almost metallic in tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I was eight." It was a fact. It was a statement of a fact, one that had likely changed Agatha forever. "It was a kid down the street."
    </p>
    <p>
     Holy shit. No way had Agatha started
     <em>
      that young.
     </em>
     Even if it was an accident, Rio couldn't imagine a world where Agatha had taken a life before she reached double digits.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not wanting to come off like an insensitive asshole, Rio chose to remain quiet. She didn't know the proper arrangement of words to use that might coax Agatha into giving her more. Thankfully, her silence did it all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It was a little boy named Caleb. We liked to climb the tree in the back yard and see who could run from fence to fence the fastest." Agatha was revealing more than she probably ever had before and yet, the way she was telling it was as if she were reciting Pi to its infinite decimal points. "My mother never let him inside. And the first day she did was his last day alive. I don't really know what happened other than I went upstairs for a toy shovel, and when I came back, she told me he was 'taking a nap.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to lift her head so fucking badly that it nearly caused a crick in her neck. She wanted to look at Agatha as she was saying such weighted things, but Rio also realized very quickly that doing so might put unnecessary pressure on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was telling her these huge facts
     <em>
      because
     </em>
     she did not have to look her in the eye as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
     "She sent me to my room for the rest of the night, but I watched from the window as she carried a lump of sheets out the back gate and down to the creek that ran behind our house. She was gone for a while, but she came back with nothing. The next day, it took me five minutes to find where she buried him like a fucking idiot."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated, drawing in a slow breath that quaked the smallest bit near the tail end. "So... I went every day when I knew she wouldn't notice. I checked on him, watched every day when I swept away the dirt as more and more of him just... disappeared. Sometimes it was from wildlife, but a lot of it I now know was nothing more than natural decay."
    </p>
    <p>
     It probably should have been alarming the way Rio felt so calm as she sat and listened to Agatha recount a very awful core memory from her past, but
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     was only being so calm because
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     was being so calm.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was Agatha's life, near its beginning, and it had a very heavy impact on who she had grown into as a person.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had half been expecting her to continue and half expecting her to get up and walk away. It wasn't that she seemed upset, but Rio could tell that she was unearthing more than Agatha had probably thought she might.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, Rio reminded herself, it was within Agatha's control to decline to answer any question she asked. It was a rule that Agatha had instilled herself, likely telegraphing the nature of this conversation before it had started. So, it stood to reason that she was answering most of Rio's questions because she
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to.
    </p>
    <p>
     While still not brave enough to initiate a hold, Rio's right arm crossed over her body so that her fingers could brush gingerly along the length of Agatha's forearm in search of the next question she wanted to pose.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can I..." Rio cut herself off, tucking her bottom lip between her teeth in a harsh bite.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go on," Agatha urged her quietly, not moving away from Rio's touch, or her instinct to ask questions that Agatha had never thought she would have to answer in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why did you start?"
    </p>
    <p>
     That question dropped in Agatha's lap like a ten ton anvil, heavy and demanding of her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could feel, that time, as her muscles tightened and her breath hitched somewhere low in her chest. She did not jerk away, but she was suddenly tense and Rio could tell that Agatha hadn't been anticipating on her being so forward about it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hadn't she learned anything? If Rio wanted to know something, she found a way to know it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was quiet for long enough that it left Rio wondering why she just didn't say no and move it along. Why was she choosing to let the conversation between them just die instead of letting Rio redirect?
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha drew in an impossibly slow breath through her nose, Rio realized it was because she had been searching for the right answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tofu's human was named Amanda. Amanda and I, despite being roommates, were pretty good friends. She was... a lot like you, actually. Not a mean bone in her body, but a morbid curiosity that she could never seem to satisfy," Agatha began to explain, though she was staring down at the space in front of her, a space that was filled a moment later as Phin slinked over, stretching out before their knees as they remained pressed together.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Her boyfriend was... a real fucking piece of work. The first time she came home with a black eye, I told her I'd kill him for it. She always talked me down, said it would be fine. She was wrong. It was never fine because he killed her when I was supposed to be at work. I came home early that night because I got into it with a coworker." Agatha cleared her throat, but her voice stayed steely and did not waver.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When I unlocked the door, he was choking her to death on the couch. Well, he
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     choked her to death on the couch. And I made good on my word. I went right up behind her just as he was letting her go and used every last muscle I had in my body to snap his neck. And then... I grabbed my shit, headed back to the house I said I'd never return to, and I... I..."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was fumbling, but Rio could immediately identify that she was not upset. No, Agatha was second guessing sharing more because it might cross a line that Rio could not be okay with. At least, that was most likely what Agatha thought. The truth of it was, Agatha could have told her anything and Rio was pretty sure it wouldn't have mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I had money and valuables stashed there. And when I showed up for them, my mother was less than thrilled that I decided to show my face. So, when she tried to physically stop me, I... Well, I suppose I dispatched her, too."
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, the pieces were presenting themselves and quickly, Rio was finding the ways they fit together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had started running when she was barely 20 because of an impulsive series of decisions that had given her a thirst for justice. She'd gotten that vengeance, on both fronts, and so she sought to ensure that as few women as possible had to suffer at the hands of men like the one who took away her friend when she was younger.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, as it turned out, Agatha could relate to Alice a little more than Rio had initially guessed. Perhaps that was why Rio's apology had been heard, as Agatha had promised her it had.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You weren't wrong for the things you did," Rio voiced softly, though she was being genuine. "In the legal system, maybe, but... You removed two threats that had already dealt irreparable damage. I don't think you a bad person for that."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha released a soft sound, one that could have been a chuckle, but wasn't quite a hum. Her gaze cast to the spot on her arm that Rio was still touching, grazing lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was clear that this conversation had reached its peak and they could slide safely down on the other side, but there was still one more thing Rio wanted to know.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha?" she breathed, fingers tracing further toward Agatha's wrist than they had before.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hm?" Agatha returned, lifting her head to peer over at Rio, those blue eyes looking a clearer window to Agatha's inner monologue than they ever had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you want? Out of life? Out of... this? Us?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's jaw tensed and bulged on both sides, her lips pressing into a tight and flat line. It seemed as though she had known it was coming and yet, Rio actually asking her while looking directly at her had still caused her to snap shut like an agitated clam.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of answering, Agatha turned it around on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What is it that
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     want, Rio?" she asked, those eyes not daring to break the stare they were locked into.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was easy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What I want is for you to know that you can trust me to take care of you," Rio returned easily, her expression soft as she delivered such a blatant truth for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Whatever you will let that mean, one day I want you to believe that I can and will always handle you with care. It could be bringing you soup when you're sick, being close by when you're nervous about something. Or maybe someday, even as far as letting me be the one to strap
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     down," she added, and while she offered a disarming chuckle, she wasn't actually kidding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was still silent, just listening to what it was Rio was saying. Slowly, her arm turned and her palm faced upward in the quietest give of permission. Recognizing it for what it was, Rio's touch continued on past Agatha's wrist, pressing their palms together before her fingers filled the spaces between Agatha's.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What about today?" Agatha asked back, though she had diverted her attention to their hands together and began to chew on her lip the moment the question left her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean...?" Rio asked back, brow pinching in her confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not right now... Because I do want to keep watching the movie... But maybe tonight?" Agatha's voice was
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     soft, almost like it was filled with shame, but there was no need for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was
     <em>
      growing.
     </em>
     She was making choices because she knew that by doing so, Rio's image of her was not going to chance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned her weight against Agatha's side again, letting her head drop to rest on her shoulder as it had done earlier in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Maybe tonight," Rio concurred, giving Agatha's hand the lightest squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was another wordless moment between them before Agatha spoke again, clearly having redirected her attention back to the screen across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know what my favorite thing about this movie is?" Agatha asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without lifting her head, Rio provided her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed a light laugh, reaching for a grape. "The ghost girl still finds a way to kill the bastard man that took her life."
    </p>
    <p>
     Of
     <em>
      course
     </em>
     that was Agatha's favorite thing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course it was.
    </p>

     What a lazy Sunday, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
     After their second film selection, Rio had suggested something she wasn't actually interested in. It was something to simply have on in the background as she took the ninety minutes it offered to curl into Agatha's side as much as she was allowed to take a light nap.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let her have it, even to the point of still being there when Rio stirred to the feeling of Phineas licking her finger to garner her attention. It seemed like a dick move as Agatha was petting him where he sat on the top of her thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she came more to her senses, Rio realized that how they were positioned, Agatha's hand had landed on her side. More than that, Rio was suddenly aware of the light brushing that her thumb was doing, a gentle back and forth as a little whisper that their conversation before Rio's nap had actually happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes flickered to the screen, the credits rolling from the film she had selected earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lifting her head, there was a grin sprouting on Rio's lips before she even asked her question. "Did you sit here and watch that whole movie?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's gaze dropped to her and a sly smile gave her away prior to the little shrug she offered. "I had never watched it before. I like that it was very Bond style spy meets slapstick comedy. Also... If anyone would want to get hammered within the span of two hours, just have them watch this and take a shot any time Eggsy says 'fuck.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     The brightest bout of laughter found Rio, her form vibrating as a result there against Agatha's side. Rio lowered her chin, resting it on Agatha's chest as she just watched her for a moment. Agatha was watching her back, though Rio surmised it was for different reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was watching Agatha because she was trying to determine just how many layers there were to her and how long it might take her to reach each one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was watching Rio because she realized that Rio was doing the smallest things to give back, letting Agatha see pieces of her that she might not share with anyone else, like in the movies she chose or her physical positioning.
    </p>
    <p>
     For those few moments, all they could do was watch one another, silently asking the same exact question:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What are we doing?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     For as long as it had lasted -- maybe a little too long, honestly -- it was over in a snap as Agatha lifted her head and checked her phone for the time. As if on cue, Phineas also began to meow. He'd probably been waiting for them to show a little more movement before he cried about wanting to be fed.
    </p>
    <p>
     After only a minute or two longer of being sunk in that plush bed, the rousing truly happened and they managed to tend to their evening, wherein Agatha cooked them pasta and let Rio be the one to construct and toss the salad (and while Rio didn't voice it because she understood the need to be delicate, she found an ironic humor in Agatha allowing her to... toss the salad, of all things, given their earlier conversation).
    </p>
    <p>
     They had eaten at the island for that meal, per Agatha's request, one Rio met happily. It was a way for them to sit a little closer, for Agatha to show what it was she was wanting without actually having to ask for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the layers she was beginning to shed, there was still so much mystery to Agatha. Mystery, for Rio, meant something to figure out, something to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had learned a lot that day, things that she knew she never would have been told without asking the questions she had. She also knew that there was a very loud and very clear sentiment that came with those answers, even if it had never been put into words itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave them because she made the choice to do so. She had been very clear about ground rules -- or a ground rule -- the night before and Rio had walked the line with ease. Agatha had offered her directive and Rio had obliged respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     While there were still so many things Rio wanted to know and learn about the woman that seemed to gravitate to her when they shared any space, what she had learned to that point had given her more of an understanding of
     <em>
      who
     </em>
     Agatha was and
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     she was the way she was. She wasn't some murderous villain who wanted to kill because taking human life was a good time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chose to kill because she thought she was doing the world a favor by taking out the trash in the form of men who frequently abused women. From Rio's perspective? That was exactly what she was doing, a favor.
    </p>
    <p>
     The law would never see it that way, but Rio did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio saw too many women come across her table, dead at the hands of their husbands or boyfriends. The idea that maybe there were a few that
     <em>
      didn't
     </em>
     make it to her table because of Agatha? Well, it had already crossed her mind... quite a few times.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, as they returned to the bedroom to take turns showering before climbing back into bed, Rio could never even fathom the idea that Agatha could ever hurt her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, not intentionally.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha finally made the decision that she was bored of whatever this was they were doing?
    </p>
    <p>
     That was probably going to hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was best to not think about that, at least for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took the second shower, but only after stealing a quick peck to Agatha's cheek as they passed one another outside the doorway. It might have been too much, but if Agatha was going to throw her out for a kiss on the cheek? Well, that would be that, she supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
     She spent a little longer running through her routine merely to let Agatha have a few more moments to herself, just a brief breather after having her domain encroached upon for so long. Maybe she didn't need it, but Rio was well aware of the fact that this was most likely the longest amount of time Agatha had spent with someone when it was not work related.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were certain things she did, just the tiniest tells that told Rio sharing space was not something she was used to, so she was trying to figure it out as they went.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio emerged, fresh and clean from the shower, she was greeted by the sight of Agatha on the bed, wearing only a tank top and a pair of panties. It was surely something she had thrown on to wait while Rio showered, but then again, it could have been that she had changed her mind and simply wanted to relax a little more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sat there, her legs were separated, a couple feet of space between her ankles. Right between her knees lay Phineas, rolling around as she vigorously rubbed at his back and side and belly in accordance with his movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     First came the warmth of what the actual sight itself made Rio feel. Then came the heat of anger toward herself for softening so quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who was she kidding?
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd already shown Agatha her belly in a far more sever manner than Phineas was doing right then.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was the point in being upset with herself for feelings and thoughts that were never going to leave the house?
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe there wasn't a point, but it was still valid; this wouldn't last forever. Even with the promise of taking up residence in the condo for a couple of weeks, Rio knew that in the long run, Agatha would take off and Rio would be but a memory to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way her thoughts were jumping around started to give her whiplash before she even made it to the bed, climbing atop with the intention of placing herself at Agatha's side, as she had done all weekend. As she readied to do just that, Phin shot off like grey lightning and leapt off the bed, bolting through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know it, but it was exactly what Agatha had been hoping for.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How about here instead?" she voiced, causing Rio's head to snap to the side in time to see her patting the space between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew that there was
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     insinuation there, a call to a deeper meaning, but with them both in loose tops and their underwear and Agatha
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     snapping her legs shut and demanding Rio sit on her lap, the request seemed to fall on a more innocent end of the spectrum.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gave Agatha what it was she wanted and placed herself between her legs, back to Agatha's front. It wasn't exactly a surprise that Agatha did not wrap an arm around her middle or try to hold her, but it
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     a surprise that while one of Agatha's hands lifted the remote, the other wrapped around just enough to land on the top of Rio's bare thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I saw there was a sequel. And a prequel?" Agatha offered in reference to their last watch.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last thing Rio would have thought Agatha to be was a cinephile. But... as she had already learned, Agatha was full of surprises.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sequel is great. Elton John's in it! But prequel is trash, definitely not worth the waste of two hours."
    </p>
    <p>
     A soft chuckle sounded behind her as Agatha turned on their next film and tossed the remote a little ways off to the side in that ocean of a bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     That should have been a clue.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha's hand -- now freed -- landed on Rio's empty thigh also should have been a clue.
    </p>
    <p>
     But all it made Rio did was lean back into Agatha little more, reveling in that small bit of closeness Agatha was allowing her to have.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a car chase playing on the screen in front of them, campy in that old-school spy kind of way, but Agatha had never really had any interest in watching it, at least not that night. No, she was far more interested in how smooth the skin of Rio's thighs felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had just been the stationary touch at first, but then those palms began to pace and Rio knew that while Agatha had been striding around seeming tame and calm, there had been a storm brewing behind those blue irises. She was thinking herself into a hole, and it seemed the only way out of it was to touch Rio's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't going to draw any complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
     It got even better by the end of the first scene as Agatha's lips found Rio's shoulder on the outside of her tank top. They skipped over it, kissing more toward the crook of her neck, upward even further.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Mmmm,"
     </em>
     Rio released in an exhale, one of her hands landing on top of Agatha's as it lightly gripped and squeezed at the flesh beneath it. "Agatha, I thought you wanted to watch this movie," she attempted, but the way Agatha began to suck on her neck only caused her weight to sink further back into Agatha's presence behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I do," Agatha mumbled back against Rio's neck right before she nipped at the lobe of her ear. "But I also think you smell really nice and your skin feels really soft. So touching you felt like more fun."
    </p>
    <p>
     Further into Agatha she sank, head dropping back to expose more surface area for Agatha to feast upon. It was over for her before it even began, as seemed to be commonplace between them at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
     All Agatha had to do was fucking touch her and she was ready to be lost in Agatha's skin and sweat and slick for an eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hungrier Agatha's kisses became, the more Rio wanted to lose herself in the feeling, but something else was annoyingly tugging on the outer reaches of her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha," Rio tried, but it came out far breathier than she'd intended. Agatha kept kissing, but her hands had started to wander, one of them trekking upward toward that tiny sliver of skin between the hem of Rio's tank top and the waist of her underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
     She made another attempt, but it didn't seem to matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Agatha."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently what Rio wanted to be a request for Agatha's acknowledgement came out as an encouragement for her to proceed with what she had been doing. Instead of offering Rio a verbal response, she breathed a heavy sigh directly into her ear as her hand slipped into the front of her underwear, fingertips feeling out Rio's body in a way she had surely been aching to do since the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, at least Rio hoped that was how she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Wait,"
     </em>
     Rio beseeched for a third time. At that request, Agatha's fingers stilled with solely her fingertips having pressed between Rio's folds. Without dislodging Agatha's touch, Rio leaned over enough to swipe up the remote and turn the projector off. There was absolutely no interest for it between the two of them and the sounds alone would prove to be distracting if they allowed it to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
     With haste, Rio discarded the remote, tossing it with enough force that it bounced and sailed right over the edge of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted her attention on Agatha and Agatha only.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seemed like Agatha wanted
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     attention on Rio and Rio only.
    </p>
    <p>
     Funny how that seemed to work out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's right hand landed on the back of Agatha's as it remained on her thigh. The way she threaded their fingers together felt natural and drew no irrational response from Agatha, so Rio squeezed a little tighter the moment Agatha's touch sank lower, delving into the warm and inviting wetness that had been building over the course of Agatha's touching and kissing and taunting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha breathed a light chuckle directly into Rio's ear at the sensation; she was also wearing a dangerous grin that Rio could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It never ceases to amaze me how wet you get so fast," Agatha purred, moving away from Rio's ear to place a kiss at the corner of her jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It amazes me every time," Rio groaned back, gripping Agatha's hand a little tighter as she tried to refrain from bucking her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmm, and why's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha began to circle her clit, Rio shifted enough to try and earn herself more of the contact, but it was useless as Agatha ceased it entirely and began to draw her fingers back and forth through Rio's cum, teasing her with intentional pressure against both her entrance and her clit as she made her passes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to answer, but that shit was
     <em>
      really fucking distracting.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "You okay there?" Agatha goaded, spending a couple seconds more when she reached Rio's throbbing entrance. The pressure was way more deliberate that time and it showed in the moan that escaped through Rio's parted lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm -- ohhh, fuck. I'm fine, Agatha," Rio growled back in spite of the way her hips were lifting in a manner that might coax Agatha to slip inside. "But I...
     <em>
      fuck.
     </em>
     It's not --
     <em>
      mmm
     </em>
     -- usually like that. I mean... I get wet, but I don't get
     <em>
      wet.
     </em>
     "
    </p>
    <p>
     This, of course, was an absolute delight to Agatha's ears, enough of one that she met Rio's silent request and pressed only a lone finger into Rio's dripping sex. It drew another moan, but it wasn't enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't be a tease," Rio warned lowly, hips shifting once more in desire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Craning her head enough to kiss at Rio's jaw a little more, Agatha's laugh was downright predatory.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, princess, you put yourself in the trap knowing what would happen. You think I'm gonna let you out that easily?" she crooned against Rio's skin, working that single digit in and out of Rio's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first time Agatha had used that pet name on her, it had certainly had an impact. The more she used it, the more Rio liked it. Right then, it was
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     enough to make her cum on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Agatha
     </em>
     , more.
     <em>
      Please.
     </em>
     " Rio was nearly bleating at that point, choked and broken wails of desperation as she craved more of Agatha's touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a sinister breath of a laugh against the side of Rio's neck, Agatha dropped a second digit and pressed it inside, curling tauntingly just before she began a steady rhythm, one that made Rio attempt to spread her legs further apart despite being caged in by Agatha's.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hand that was not finger fucking her to a too-soon climax slid from beneath Rio's touch and lifted so that Agatha's palm laid flush over Rio's forehead, holding her head back as she continued to lick and suck hungrily at her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could feel every single thing Agatha was doing, all at once. It was debilitating in that all she felt capable of doing was making the most pathetic whimpers as she attempted to convince Agatha to give her more without a word spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
     It apparently worked, because before Rio could think to form a verbal request, she felt as Agatha pressed a third finger into her needy and weeping sex. Rio knew the very second she felt it that she was fucking done for, but she had
     <em>
      tried
     </em>
     to hold out just a little longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     It lasted maybe thirty seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Pathetic.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ohh, fuck! Agatha!" Rio whined, although the last vowel devolved into another primal moan as Rio trembled and tensed against Agatha's form, her orgasm pulsing in far too many places in her body to keep tally of.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Good girl,"
     </em>
     Agatha murmured, kissing Rio's ear again as she withdrew her fingers to gently drag them over Rio's folds in a firm caress.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      God, she felt so fucking good.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hand slid from her forehead and gently stroked over her hair, and for a moment, Rio thought she might kiss at the side of her head. Instead, her touch lessened until her hands were both free, landing on Rio's legs with a soft squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she spoke again, it wasn't what Rio
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to hear, but she took it for all it was still worth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go pick me out something to wear, hm?" Agatha posed coyly. When she followed it up with a kiss to the back left quadrant of Rio's skull, it melted any opposition Rio might have had.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, it was an order that was in direct contrast to what they had discussed earlier in the day. But... Rio knew there had to be a reason. Agatha did not seem like the type of woman to go back on her word without one, but at the same time, Rio knew she would not voice them even if she had them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio heeded, deciding to listen, but she fought herself on looking back at Agatha in question. She wanted to dig a little, to ask if everything was alright, but clearly Agatha still wanted to fuck her, so it wasn't too far off the tracks just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of looking to her in question, Rio turned just enough before her departure so that she could take a light hold on Agatha's face, planting a firm kiss to her lips. Without another word spoken, Rio scooted off the bed and scampered off toward the closet to do as she had been told.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her first selection was almost too easy; she'd been bold before, but making the choice of the next step up seemed like common sense. It was both for her personal pleasure -- even if she secretly feared a repeat of Friday night -- and maybe a little for Agatha's ego, as well. Clearly something had given her pause in following through on her request, so if Rio could help ease whatever that was, she would try.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, Rio sunk a little more effort into picking the right harness. Maybe she'd been a little heavy on the aesthetic of her previous selection, but this one required a bit more thought. She inspected them and their weavings, the way they were each made do sit differently on the hips. They clearly all had their functions and things Agatha liked about them, but Rio was more interested in functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
     The one she settled on looked like an Aslan and was meant to sit lower on the hips in a way that offered maximum pleasure to the wearer. It was probably why Agatha had it in the first place, and so, that was the one that would suit them both well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had meant what she told Agatha earlier in the day; she wanted to handle Agatha with care, to show her that someone could value her for more than money and a pretty face. Rio
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     who Agatha was beyond the surface and still wanted her time and attention. More than that, she wanted to shower Agatha in the time and attention she had just as much.
    </p>
    <p>
     If by doing little things like making the right harness choice, she could show Agatha that she was being considered, too, it might remind her of that sentiment Rio had delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cared. She was going to keep caring. Agatha just had to let her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she emerged from the closet, Rio lifted her head to see Agatha already naked and perched at the end of the bed, awaiting her return with a bottle of lube laying next to her. When she saw what Rio was carrying, it took her half of a second to grin wide and bright.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a familiar hunger in those beautiful blue eyes, but there was something else there. It was recognition. It was Agatha seeing that Rio had actually given her choices some consideration. It didn't last long, but it was there for
     <em>
      just long enough
     </em>
     that Rio noticed it, and it caused a twisting of uncertainty low in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     It shouldn't have mattered to her
     <em>
      that much
     </em>
     that Agatha was pleased. But it did. It mattered more to Rio than she would admit to anyone, even Alice. Maybe even herself on occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Caring that much about Agatha's happiness was going to land her nowhere good.
    </p>
    <p>
     But alas, feelings weren't rational and that was what made them such a bitch to deal with.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was almost
     <em>
      too
     </em>
     intimate, the way Agatha got to her feet and instead of just handing the readied harness over, Rio helped Agatha step into it. She left the tightening and adjusting to Agatha, but she watched with a soft interest every step of the way, just to the side as she shed her own clothing concurrently.
    </p>
    <p>
     The view was a beautiful one, really, but more because Rio could literally see as Agatha's form filled with a confidence that had been chased out by her apparent overthinking and ruminating over what they had talked about earlier in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was not expecting Agatha to start blabbering on about any and all emotions she had, but she was also starting to realize that maybe she didn't have to. Agatha said a lot of things without using any words, and Rio was starting to hear them more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, the way Agatha grabbed her by the wrist and pulled her in for a warm but not overbearing kiss said quite a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a means to rile Rio up even more, as if she had not just been fingered while attempting to watch a damn movie.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, predictably, it worked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's touch landed on Agatha's neck, fingertips sinking in hungrily as Rio fed right back into that kiss, using it to remain alive instead of actual oxygen. She didn't need it, nor want it, if the alternative meant that Agatha would keep kissing her that way. It felt fucking phenomenal, but nowhere near as good as it was going to be to feel Agatha inside her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a few moments of that heated and slowly escalating lip lock, Agatha knew what she wanted. So, she took it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the kiss broke, Agatha leaned forward and Rio knew what was coming; she braced herself with her hands on Agatha's shoulders, squealing in delight as Agatha lifted and then gently tossed her onto the bed, tipping her head back with an instruction in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Compliantly, Rio scrambled toward the head of the bed, but she did not prop herself up, instead choosing to lay flat on her back with her head supported by the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was propped just enough to have a full and breathtaking view as Agatha, majestic and ravenous, swaggered forward on all fours. That white hot fire was licking at her irises, ready to simply devour Rio as she laid out on full display. By the time she was directly above, Rio was almost thankful to see that insatiable demeanor completely take Agatha over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their lips were crushed together again before Rio even had the chance to catch up, one of Agatha arms supporting her while the other hand found Rio's breast. There was only a moment of play there before that touch began to move, to feel out every part of Rio's body it could get to, from chest to abs to hips and thighs. In the assault on Rio's senses, Agatha had not once lightened up in their kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <em>
      hard,
     </em>
     and it was
     <em>
      hot
     </em>
     , the way Agatha was taking all she wanted. Her tongue was tasting what she wanted it to taste. Her hands were feeling what they wanted to feel. And the tip of that fucking strap kept grazing just below Rio's belly button, like she was sure Agatha meant it to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deciding that she did, in fact, need to breath, Rio pried their lips apart for a sharp inhale, one that almost made her feel human again. Before she could do much with the reinstated awareness, Agatha was sitting back on her knees and both of her hands had found grips on Rio's thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a plan already devised in her head, Agatha positioned her hands on the underside of them, pushing them up enough that Rio's knees bent and tucked a little more toward her chest, leaving her completely exposed to Agatha's gaze. It was a sight that caused a devious smirk to curl up her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having caught the hint, Rio's legs stayed where they were, even as Agatha raised one of her hands to wet her fingers with a long swipe of her tongue -- one she took while looking directly into Rio's eyes -- and reached down to run through that sopping mess of want that was ready and waiting for more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still wearing that diabolical smirk, Agatha gave a firm smack to Rio's puffy and pink pussy, just hard enough that the shock from the contact to her clit caused her to cry out, jerking slightly from her spot beneath Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hum that fell from her was satisfied, but only minutely. Hearing Rio make that kind of a sound clearly did something to her; if Rio could see her pupils in the dark, she was certain they were already blown.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You think you can go longer than ten seconds this time?" Agatha questioned lowly, that deviousness still wound throughout her form.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was fixed on her, watching her, and while she wanted to offer some smartass retort, it wasn't what found its way out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Only one way to find out, hm?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more, that daring light was flashing in Agatha's eyes, seeing Rio's challenge for what it was. She arranged herself so that her knees were spread, positioned on either side of Rio's hips with her legs still bent toward her chest. Rio could tell that she didn't
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to, but Agatha tore her eyes away to provide a little more focus to what she was doing; using one hand to steady herself, she guided the slightly larger strap forward, sinking it slowly into Rio's core.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, Rio felt like Agatha might have been right to call her out on it. It was fair, given the way she could feel her body begging to betray her again, but she would
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     fucking let that happen. Not again. Her fingers found themselves clutching sheets to try and spread her focus, but it was only half working.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha shifted so that could could lean forward to plant her fists on either side of Rio's torso, that look she had on her face said it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had somehow managed to stave off her body's natural impulse when Agatha was fucking her, but she was not sure for how long with the way Agatha looked nothing short of vicious in her desire. It was fucking difficult, especially with the way that new attachment
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     , but she was doing her best.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, Agatha began to build a rhythm, but she had a question that needed an answer before she really got going.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey,
     <em>
      look at me
     </em>
     ," Agatha requested lowly, her hips still rolling at a steady but measured pace. Rio
     <em>
      somehow
     </em>
     found away to roll her eyes forward from where they had been stuck somewhere near the back of her head, but the question that Agatha offered her nearly made them snap right back. "If you cum quickly, do you want me to keep going?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Holy fucking shit, what kind of question was that?
    </p>
    <p>
     Not only was it one Rio had never been asked before, but it was also one that would get the same answer every single time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes. Yes, don't stop," Rio jabbered back, nodding her head fervently. While she was still gripping the sheet on one side, her other hand had found a home on Agatha's forearm, simply somewhere to be that would offer additional contact -- additional connection.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that permission, Agatha hit the gas.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was still poised on her fists, giving herself more than enough room to work with as her hips began to roll with more fervor, more intent. Her pace gained speed and grew a little more frantic as her focus shifted between watching that dildo slide with ease in and out of Rio's body and trying to main eye contact when Rio could keep hers open through her moaning and gasping.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a feat of pride, Rio lasted roughly three minutes before she succumbed to her second orgasm of the night, a bellowing wail of pleasure echoing off of the walls and likely scaring Phineas, no matter where he was in the condo.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, because Agatha had already questioned her, she did not stop. She did not even slow down as Rio's body writhed and spasmed, gripping that strap with every bit of strength her throbbing pussy was capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
     If anything, Agatha fucked her even harder, starting to huff a little bit in her effort. It was so fucking hot, from the way she was clearly deriving her own pleasure from the way the harness rubbed against her clit to the way that thick and longer strap looked working in and out of Rio's tight cunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was enjoying herself, and it showed.
    </p>
    <p>
     It somehow managed to turn Rio on even more, nails digging harshly into the skin of Agatha's arm as she gripped at it in the throes of her pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "H-Harder,"
     </em>
     she managed to choke out. The demand was met, but it came with a direct burning gaze from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew what Rio was asking, and she knew why she was asking.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You gonna come on me again?" she rasped, the tips of her hair tickling Rio's ribs as she lowered enough to get a better angle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to form a 'yes' but instead just whined in accordance with a weak nod of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Keep your eyes open," Agatha demanded in return, her voice sharp but only because it was steeped in a panic where that might not happen. Her hips were swinging with force and Rio knew she was going to be feeling it for days, but she didn't care. All she cared about was that look on Agatha's face, that needy and
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     pathetic look that screamed all the ways she
     <em>
      craved
     </em>
     Rio's pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha's hips canted irregularly, Rio realized something.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was close to cumming, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     If keeping her eyes open might spur on an orgasm for Agatha too? It was something Rio would fight to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     Locked in on that blue gaze, Rio's hand slid up to Agatha's bicep, gripping tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cum with me," Rio gasped, her own hips shifting slightly in any attempt to initiate such a request.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, F-FUCK," Agatha moaned, her weight sagging onto her fists as her hips slammed into Rio's in the most pleasurable collision, one that booted Rio right over the edge she had been trying not to slip off of.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time, the moan that left Agatha was thunderous and like the most appealing song of satisfaction Rio was sure she had ever heard in her life. The only thing she could do to make it any better was join her, sounding a deep groan as her body joined Agatha's in its trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
     It could have been beautiful, if Rio had been able to see it from any perspective other than her own; there they were, Agatha buried in Rio, and both of them warmed by the tides of climax.
    </p>
    <p>
     From her spot below Agatha with her pussy still throbbing and still stuffed, it just felt fucking
     <em>
      hot.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     There had been a temptation there, one for Rio to goad Agatha on and convince her to keep going, but something else happened first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha dropped her head and delivered a kiss that felt... different. It wasn't bad, or negative in any way, but something about it did not resemble any other kiss that they had shared before. It was somehow still hungry, but there was a newfound tenderness that Rio was truly surprised to feel coming from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha lifted her gaze and looked Rio in the eye, her words nearly caused her heart to stop beating.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why don't you go pick out something pretty to wear?"
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Holy shit.
     </em>

   <div>
    <p>
     As Rio returned to the closet for the second time that night and found herself throwing open the lid to that antique chest, there was a new feeling entirely that had taken over her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was excited, that was a given.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, much in the same way she had taken great care in choosing what it was she wanted Agatha wear, she was also investing a lot of herself, her thoughts and considerations, into what it was  she was going to choose when it came to how she was going to fuck Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     It shouldn't have been such a big deal, but it was. Rio saw that it was, and as such, there was a certain responsibility there to ensure that Agatha did not feel like she was making a wrong choice or a bad choice. Rio had said some things earlier in the day and she had wondered if Agatha had actually heard her, but she supposed she had stumbled on the finite answer to that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had heard her, and now, she was choosing to bare a little more of herself in both the emotional and physical senses.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had mostly started as a joke with herself, really, but Rio had never anticipated that Agatha might cave so quickly. Rio wouldn't have held it against her if she stayed buttoned up and locked away from a reality where Rio wanted to physically find a way to show Agatha what it was Agatha made her
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Trusting her gut, the selection Rio made was a step below her Friday night favorite. Maybe Agatha was a size queen and that last choice on the right was for more than the bluff Rio thought it to be, but something told Rio that this required finesse and attention to detail. The details Rio saw were that Agatha was nervous, she wasn't really ready to talk about those nerves, and she was still offering Rio a chance to be closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      could not
     </em>
     fuck this up.
    </p>
    <p>
     With one decision made, she turned to the dresser and wasted no time picking a harness. It was easy, as she'd already gone through them twice. Threading it through the o-ring, she made her return to the bedroom, the harness still in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the second time that night the sight of Agatha on that massive fucking bed completely disrupted every natural function in Rio's body from the way her breath caught to the way she was certain her heart stopped beating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Directly in the center of the bed, Agatha was fully laid out with her legs bent at the knees. One of her hands was tucked casually beneath her head and the other was being an absolute menace.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was clearly massaging herself, but the moment she sensed Rio had stepped back into the room, her tactics changed. She wasn't fucking herself, but she was deliberately pushing her folds apart, spreading them so that Rio could
     <em>
      see
     </em>
     her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was instantly salivating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Knowing the need to play it cool was paramount, she chose to lick her lips instead of jumping straight into the harness and flinging herself on top of Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     But
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     , that look in her eyes, that smirk on her lips, the way she was glistening in the dim light of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio did not fuck Agatha in the next five minutes, the likelihood she was simply going to die was impossibly high.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I see I'm not the only impatient one," Rio mused, fighting for her life to keep her voice from cracking as a result of how ridiculously turned on she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Almost thought you -- mmm -- ran to the market instead of the closet," Agatha replied, clearly a little taken over by the way it felt to touch her own body. She was still going, still just feeling herself out in a way that was making Rio weak in the knees, and it was driving her
     <em>
      insane
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Without committing to being hurried or rushed, Rio took her time stepping into the harness and securing it around her hips. She was aware, the entire time she worked, that she was being watched. As a result, she made a show of it, giving Agatha a visual appetizer before the true meal began.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't excessive in that she did not immediately start running her hands over her own body for shock factor, but a slow hand
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     slide down her stomach, long and nimble fingers wrapping firmly around the shaft that was now poised on her hips. Her gaze tore from the majestic as hell view that was Agatha rubbing her desperate pussy to instead locate the lube that had been left at the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she picked it up, Agatha made a sound, almost like she was going to say something that didn't quite fully form.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't read her mind, but if she had to hazard a guess, Agatha was going to razz her about not being confident in how wet she could get Agatha, but then quickly thought better of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was a new dynamic they were exploring and while their banter was usually more of a turn-on than it wasn't, Agatha seemed to understand that for as nervous as she was, Rio might have been a little unsure, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha finally formed something to say, the physical reaction it had on Rio's body actually felt insane.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck, Rio, you look so good like that," Agatha husked, her fingers running through that awaiting slick, luring Rio in with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll look even better when I'm inside you," Rio offered back haughtily, squeezing a dollop of the lube into her palm so that she could apply it to the dildo sitting on her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You think so?" Agatha returned, her expression reading solely as a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know so," Rio answered pointedly, her own hungry gaze sweeping over Agatha's body before landing up on her face once more. She tossed aside the bottle and clamored onto the bed, tired of wasting time.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd been trying to stall, perhaps as a way to give Agatha an out if she was looking for one, but there she lay running her mouth knowing it would only egg Rio on and push her to do as she had said she would. The truth was, the fact that Agatha wasn't backing down only turned Rio on even more; the fact that she was so wholly committing to it really did something to the far reaches of Rio's brain, causing her to feel like she was standing in a body of water that had a live wire jammed right into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she crawled further up, Rio wasted no time in closing the distance between them, first with a kiss to Agatha's thigh, her hip, her navel -- which got a quick swipe of Rio's tongue -- and then traveled higher through the center valley of her abdomen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't sure what she thought might happen, but the way Agatha's hands were on her body just sliding and gripping and pinching was not something she had been able to imagine beforehand. It felt fucking divine, but it was also distracting her from what it was she wanted to be doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, above Agatha who had her legs spread and waiting for Rio's imminent descent into her dripping want, Rio felt like she was on top of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     The higher she kissed, the heavier Agatha's breathing became, one of her hands landing in the still-damp hair on the back of Rio's head in a tight grip. It was used as a guide, pushing and pulling Rio where she wanted her, and Rio just let her.
    </p>
    <p>
     First it was to her left breast which Rio bit and licked at happily, even taking the time to suck a sizeable hickey just above her nipple despite Agatha's tugs on her hair to convince her to stop. They were
     <em>
      weak
     </em>
     and not convincing at all, so Rio did not respond in kind. She chose to suck Agatha's nipple into her mouth just before she gave it a moderately rough bite and tugged on it enticingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's back arched in turn, her grip on Rio's hair tightening while her nails began to press into the skin over Rio's shoulder blade.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Good,
     </em>
     Rio thought,
     <em>
      it was working.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Satisfied with the way Agatha's body had gone limp and pliable beneath her, Rio kissed higher, over Agatha's sternum and clavicles. They were deliberately placed kisses, ones Rio knew would rile Agatha up even more.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time their lips met flush in a hot and demanding kiss, Rio reached between them to do what she'd been wanting to do the majority of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, she got to actually
     <em>
      touch
     </em>
     Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     And boy, was she
     <em>
      fucking wet.
     </em>
     Maybe Rio hadn't actually needed the lube after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Better safe than sorry, she supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's moan happened instantaneously, Rio's fingers still running light paces over her, up and down, back and forth. Rio could see very clearly, when she pulled away, that the effect it was having on Agatha was nothing short of supreme. Her eyes were closed and her head was tipped back, but her hands had not stopped moving.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was grabbing at Rio's arms, clawing at her back in a way that didn't seem so desperate quite yet. It was fervent and stimulating, but it was also growing into a distraction pretty quickly. How the fuck was she supposed to give Agatha what she needed if she couldn't fucking focus?
    </p>
    <p>
     Trying to push through it and direct her attention appropriately, Rio's lips brushed against Agatha's once more before she rasped her devious observation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Feels like you've
     <em>
      been
     </em>
     ready for me."
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the last word fell from her lips, rolling through Agatha's to land on her tongue, Rio's thumb and pointer finger closed snugly on either side of Agatha's clit, giving it a measured tug that drew a sound so delicious from somewhere low in Agatha's body, one that tasted like satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh
     <em>
      god,
     </em>
     " Agatha breathed, lifting her hips off the bed in silent demand. She'd done so using the leverage of her hold on Rio's back, nails sinking in deeper as if to plead that the distance between them be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Oh, my queen,"
     </em>
     Rio drawled, shifting to place a trail of kisses along the edge of Agatha's jaw until she reached her ear. "You can just call me by my name."
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio had been
     <em>
      hoping
     </em>
     for was that Agatha would engage verbally and moan her name for the first fucking time, but it did not happen. Instead, as she gave another firm tug on Agatha's clit, Agatha howled out, hips thrashing upward in a demand for more of that irrational pleasure. Instead of giving it to her, Rio let go.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand moved, wrapping around the shaft of the strap so that she could guide herself a little better. At the same time, her head lifted and those nearly-black eyes zeroed in on Agatha below her, taking a quick survey of her expression. It was pinched, but not in a negative fashion. Instead, she looked like she could hardly sort the sensations she was experiencing in the most pleasurable way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha," Rio coaxed; all she wanted was for Agatha to open her eyes, to be able to look directly at her so that she could maybe get a gauge for what was going on inside that head of hers.
     <em>
      "Agatha,
     </em>
     " she tried again, but to no avail. "Agatha, look at me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could feel the eight spots on her back where Agatha's fingers dug in deeper and those wild blue eyes flew open before her. The ecstasy was written over her entirely, but that look in her eyes said something more, something louder that Rio could actually hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I'm trusting you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't a statement that she already did, but Rio could see that Agatha was
     <em>
      trying
     </em>
     and that was what was most important.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those fucking fingernails cutting into her back said something else, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I fucking need you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That was a call Rio could answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her weight dropped just enough that she was able to press the tip against Agatha's entrance, only stealing a glance before she looked back to Agatha's face, watching as her hips eased forward, pressing herself into Agatha's tight sex.
    </p>
    <p>
     That expression? That look that Agatha was wearing? It was almost enough to make Rio cum on the spot, but she fought it to hold her focus on Agatha and
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was
     <em>
      for
     </em>
     Agatha, no matter how much it had been framed as something Rio wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh
     <em>
      godddd,"
     </em>
     Agatha groaned as Rio pressed her hips further forward, taking her time to let Agatha squirm and adjust to a feeling Rio was almost certain she did not experience unless it was at her own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmmm, good girl, Agatha," Rio purred at her, looking her directly in the eyes as she did so. It was too much for Agatha who squeezed her eyes shut, another choked moan sounding from her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, how beautiful
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     two way street was.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Rio's forearms was solely being used to brace herself on the bed, but with the way Agatha kept absolutely clawing at her, even before she truly built up a rhythm, Rio's focus kept veering. It wasn't a
     <em>
      bad
     </em>
     thing, but she wanted to be able to give her full attention to the act of making Agatha feel so fucking good she could hardly stand it. She could not do that if she was too distracted by the way Agatha was tearing into her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hips stilled for just a moment as Rio used her core to lift herself enough so that she could bring her hands around, landing them on the underside of Agatha's biceps. Gently, as she started to roll her hips again, Rio gave the lightest push to Agatha's arms, causing her claws to unlatch from Rio's back as she limply let Rio move her as she so pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     to feel Agatha so slack in her grasp, and it felt even better as she began to develop a little more force to her thrusts, pulling out a series of beautiful whines and whimpers as Agatha's feet hooked over the backs of Rio's calves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had known that this was going to feel amazing, but right then she was wondering how on earth she had underestimated so severely what it would be like to have Agatha beneath her, face contorting like that while she made those noises. It made her feel powerful, but it also made her feel important, like this was a duty solely entrusted to her, one she was going to carry out with intent and finesse.
    </p>
    <p>
     She continued -- for a moment longer -- to split her focus only so that she could get Agatha's hands above her head and situated so that they were less of a hinderance to Rio's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way she chose to do that was adjusting enough so she could press the backs of Agatha's hands to the pillow above her, threading their fingers together before applying enough pressure that she could support herself. Her hips began to work again, but she had not visually checked in on Agatha in the process. When Rio lifted her head to do just that, the first thing that she noticed was Agatha's cinched expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was causing it, visibly, was not pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha wasn't saying anything. Her eyes were squeezed shut and her hands were still completely limp in Rio's hold, but she wasn't
     <em>
      saying
     </em>
     anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio rasped in blatant request, but Agatha did nothing. Her face did not smooth over, her fingers did not curl into the backs of Rio's hands. Even more worrisome, the toes that had been digging into her calf were suddenly gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     She started to try again, to voice Agatha's name in soft plea, but Agatha's blue eyes flew open and all Rio could see there was panic.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Rio, stop. Stop, please stop."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't a cry, but it was desperate and the demand was made clear. Not even a full second passed from the first time Rio heard the 's' word before she was obliging. In the blink of an eye, Rio released Agatha's hands and while her immediate reaction was to scramble away, she simply eased back to sit on her heels, careful as she pulled out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands flew to her face, most likely to hide her embarrassment, as she did not immediately start to cry. Rio didn't think she would, but it was clear that something about what had just unfolded had unsettled her enough to beg Rio to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha..." Rio voiced, though she was fighting her own panic. This was the second time that Agatha had agreed to something that she apparently had no interest in doing and while she was trying to not let it get to her, Rio was starting the feel as the guilt began to seep into her bones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept pushing herself because she thought it was what Rio wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hadn't she been listening? All Rio wanted was to make her happy. If being on the bottom meant that she was going to be miserable, it didn't
     <em>
      need
     </em>
     to happen, no matter how many jokes Rio cracked about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm okay," Agatha managed, but it was muffled by the way her palms were still pressed to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know what to do, and it was making her panic, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Did she reach out? Should she try to touch Agatha? Pull her hands away and tell her that it was okay?
    </p>
    <p>
     She was running over her options, trying to improvise a plan that would rectify a situation she did not foresee, but Agatha finally lowered her hands despite still looking up at the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm okay," she repeated, clearer this time with the lack of obstruction.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha... What... What should I do?" Rio asked her softly, lips twisting as her uncertainty began to devour her whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     This panicky, sick feeling at seeing Agatha in distress was nauseating in the worst way and more than Rio wanted it to be over, she wanted to see that anxiety evaporate out of Agatha's form.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's arm raised from the bed, a limp hand flicking to the side, a silent instruction before she could find it in a verbal one.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Will... Will you just sit here?" Agatha asked, her head finally lifting enough that their eyes met again. The panic and flecks of terror were gone, but Agatha still looked
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her mind still racing, Rio simply stared at Agatha, completely perplexed as to what the right choice was to be made. Agatha was making a request and there was no reason for Rio not to heed it, but something in her felt like she should call it off. Whatever she had done, it had caused
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     kind of reaction from Agatha, and she did not want to make the mistake of doing it again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you... sure?" Rio questioned gently instead of jumping to attention as she had every single time before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was still looking at her, but her expression was turning more toward annoyed than it was embarrassed or worried.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio,
     <em>
      please,
     </em>
     " she reiterated, casting her gaze toward the same space she had just loosely indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     the way she had been hoping to hear Agatha say her name. In all honesty, she wasn't sure what she was supposed to be feeling, but the sinking pit in her middle was absolutely not it. It was clear that Agatha was working something out in her head, that she was trying to find a work-around, but Rio didn't want her to feel like she
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     to.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was okay if it wasn't going to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't the end of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     She should have tried telling that to Agatha's relentless determination.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gathering enough sense to know that Agatha was not going to ask a third time, Rio did as she was told and moved toward the head of the bed. On her way there, Agatha reached for one of the pillows and tossed it away, discarded and useless. Rio didn't understand it at first, but then Agatha began to move.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio sat with her back to the headboard, Agatha turned as well, a little frantic as she shuffled the pillows around. Once she seemed to uncover what it was she was looking for, the tension ebbed out of her form in seconds. She sat back on her heels, leaving her eye-to-eye with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was trying to
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     looked as confused and guilty as she felt, but she knew she was probably doing a piss-poor job of it. This belief was only further solidified when Agatha chose to do something that otherwise might have seemed out of character.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised her hand to cup Rio's cheek so that she could close the half-foot of space between them with a light kiss. Rio wouldn't have called it
     <em>
      soft
     </em>
     , but it was not the forceful jamming of mouths where they could not seem to get enough of one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm okay," Agatha murmured for a third time and while it was the quietest of the bunch, it was actually the most convincing. She leaned away again, but when she kept speaking, Rio finally started to buy it. "I don't want to stop. I just... need something different."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could have made the choice to stay stuck in her guilt and worry, but it wouldn't fix things, and it probably would not make Agatha feel any better. If Rio got cold feet, it was going to show Agatha that they couldn't try again and that was the very last message Rio wanted to send.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, she chose to buck up and be a bit brave.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What is it that you need?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes had been trained on her, but the moment they dropped to the where the headboard met the mattress, Rio already knew what she was looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It won't be every time..." Agatha told her, reaching forward to pull a section of the ribbon between her fingers. "But... I don't want to stop and I just... I don't want you to touch me this time."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not take personal offense to the comment; Rio was actually
     <em>
      Really Fucking Proud
     </em>
     of Agatha for laying down the boundary and feeling as though she could voice it without any resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can, if that's what you need," Rio agreed softly. Although there was a tenderness to her as she contemplated every implication of what Agatha was asking, there was still something about the idea of her hands being tied that she did find to be pretty fucking hot.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took only a moment and a little direction from Agatha, but Rio had rearranged herself so that as she raised her arms above her head, Agatha was able to make easy work of securing her there via the ribbon. She had been straddling Rio's knees, but she was up on her own as she working, leaving Rio to duck her head forward to steal what kisses she could on Agatha's chest and stomach -- whatever she could reach, really.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it was soft, maybe it was too much. Rio didn't care. Rio could not have given a shit less about what was too much or too soft or too this or too that. No, Rio just wanted to see Agatha in contortions of pleasure, not of anxiety or panic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once finished, Agatha gave a gentle tug on Rio's arms to test the durability of the knots she had tied, a reassuring and wickedly tickled smirk curling her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not too tight?" she asked, her gaze dropping into Rio's black and blown from the sudden reinstatement of the arousal that had only momentarily flickered out as the result of her concern for Agatha's mental state.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head, pulling on her own accord to prove a point.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha scooted forward on her knees, Rio wasn't quite sure how well she was going to fare with her ability to touch Agatha's body suddenly restricted, but the moment Agatha touched
     <em>
      her?
     </em>
     Oh god, it was fucking over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those warm palms hit her breasts first, and then slid up her chest to lock around both sides of her neck, holding her perfectly still so that she could kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched until the very last minute as Agatha did, too. They were locked in a gaze that neither of them seemed to be able to break until their mouths were occupied with one another again and the taste of Agatha was all Rio seemed to give a fuck about.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was sat there with her hands fastened above her head and while it was all she wanted to just hold Agatha's face and feel out her body, Rio was more than okay with letting Agatha take anything and everything that she
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     more than what she
     <em>
      wanted,
     </em>
     so long as she felt safe in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she felt Agatha begin to withdraw from the kiss only to sink her teeth into Rio's bottom lip, any trace of doubt that had been sticking around seemed to melt right out of Rio's consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled away, hands falling to Rio's shoulders so that she could shuffle the rest of the way forward, holding herself up above Rio's hips and that awaiting strap. In a move that probably offered Agatha some peace of mind, her head dropped to hang over Rio's shoulder, hair spilling over Rio's skin. She was hiding her face, and Rio would never find it in her to be upset about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Need you," Agatha whispered, so close to Rio's ear that it made her skin flare with goosebumps. Rio wanted so fucking badly to meet the sentiment with her hands on Agatha's hips, but she didn't even try to fight to make it happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Take it."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's head turned, her lips catching what they could of Agatha's face, though it was little more than a swipe across her temple. At the very same time, Agatha's hips lowered and dropped entirely as the strap pressed into her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, totally in control, the moan that Agatha could not keep contained was pitched higher and sounded so much sweeter than any before it. Her palms were pressing on Rio's chest, but those fingertips were sunk into the divots on top of her collarbones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her words came automatically despite not being able to offer physical punctuation.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Good girl,"
     </em>
     Rio praised, placing another kiss, this time to the apple of Agatha's cheek as she slowly worked to start a thready rhythm as she gained the wherewithal to right herself. Once she was able, Rio was truly able to see the full display of her beauty. Her arms twitched involuntarily, wanting to feel and touch the woman in her lap, but she did not vocalize her displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Rio just watched.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched as Agatha got comfortable, as she pulled her hands back, and as she began to touch her own body in the ways Rio imagined she wished she felt comfortable letting Rio do herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rolling of her hips became paced and consistent, as did the moans and whimpers she was making at the feeling it was giving her. The pleasure was beginning to fill her form, to fill her voice, and it was a glorious thing to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck, Agatha," Rio groaned, only able to touch with her gaze and not with her hands. "You're so fucking hot."
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Mmmmmm,"
     </em>
     came Agatha's hummed agreement, her head tipping back as her hips rocked with more vigor. The break in eye contact afforded Rio an opportunity to behold something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze dropped, immediately locked into the sight of Agatha's cunt as it worked up and down on Rio, slick coating her more and more with each pass. It was so fucking hot the way she was
     <em>
      so goddamn wet
     </em>
     and yet, it seemed to getting more and more severe the longer she worked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So wet for me after all, aren't you my queen?" Rio managed in a lilt, shifting to lift her hips just noticeably enough that it cause Agatha's hips to stutter a moment before finding their rhythm again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," Agatha answered simply in a  gravelly whine, one that almost slipped into a groan as she squeezed at a breast.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fucking hell, Agatha," Rio sputtered, torn between watching the show Agatha was putting on and staying locked into what it looked like as Agatha used her for all she was worth. Her chin remained dropped, but only for another minute before something pulled at her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a touch, a soft touch, one that landed just beneath her chin. While Rio busied her focus with meeting Agatha's request, she missed the way Agatha's hips began to roll quicker and with a little more force.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment their eyes locked again, Rio sensed something was different. Agatha was getting
     <em>
      close
     </em>
     , and as such, she had something she needed Rio to hear in every way imaginable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's bottom lip quivered as it separated from the top one, but she did not praise Rio. She did not call her a good girl, did not tell her she was behaving. No, Agatha's brow pinched above her nose as the pleasure clearly began to well in her middle, her hips canting irregularly to get her that much closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, oh
     <em>
      god,"
     </em>
     Agatha gasped, keeping that steady pace as she stared right into Rio's very fucking soul.
     <em>
      "God, Rio, I'm gonna.. I'm gonna cum for you."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Between hearing Agatha moan her fucking name like that and the immediate follow up? Rio didn't need to be touched; she was already cumming, her cunt pulsing without permission as a choked groan left her. At the same time, irrationality found her and her hips bucked up, slamming into Agatha's in a move that Agatha had definitely not been expecting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps because of it, it shoved her right into the tide of her own orgasm. Rio watched as she locked up for the briefest moment, head tipping back before she cried out, her moan boring into the deepest caverns of Rio's consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a second, Rio wasn't sure which direction Agatha was going to choose to fall in, but was thankful when she crumpled forward, folding against Rio's chest as her hips finally stilled and her face tucked into Rio's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was panting, but she wasn't making any other noises to indicate to Rio what it was she might be feeling outside of her pleasure, but the moment her body began to tremble
     <em>
      more
     </em>
     and not
     <em>
      less,
     </em>
     Rio's second nature took over and she
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     to touch Agatha. She
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     to hold her, to praise her, to calm her, to tell her that she was fucking perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was only one way that was going to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha," Rio urged in a whisper, struggling a little against her bindings. "Agatha, untie me.
     <em>
      Please
     </em>
     untie me."
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a thick sense of desperation in her tone, one that only doubled by the time she finished because of the way Agatha was shaking against her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Far too fucking slowly, Agatha -- unmoving otherwise, face still pressed into Rio's neck -- reached up and worked the knots free with only one hand. The very moment the ribbon gave enough, Rio slipped her hands out and, with full use of her arms, wrapped them firmly around Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Agatha might push her away, tell her to stop, but she didn't care.
    </p>
    <p>
     One arm locked firmly around her, holding onto her tightly as the other lifted to smooth over her hair. Rio's head turned, nuzzling into the hair there, too, as she found her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     proud of you, Agatha," she told her first, placing a kiss to where her face had landed, somewhere behind Agatha's temple. "You did so good. You did. And you looked so beautiful cumming for me. My beautiful queen."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the gentlest praise and while not entirely too sentimental, Rio felt the need to assert that what Agatha had done was
     <em>
      worth
     </em>
     that praise. She'd ventured out of her own comfortability and as a result, something magical had happened between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     At least, that was what Rio had thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha pulled away, she
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     look at Rio for only a moment, and she
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     give her a very gentle kiss, but she also removed herself from Rio's lap and did not immediately place herself at Rio's side. Instead, she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll be right back," she voiced a little louder than a whisper. Before Rio could ask if she was alright, she plied her with an explanation. "I have to pee."
    </p>
    <p>
     Important, yes, but Rio felt like there was something more there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Especially when Agatha shut the door to the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even more when she was in there for longer than five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shed the harness and laid it atop the nightstand on 'her' side of the bed so that she could slide to her feet, padding quietly across the carpet to the bathroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
     The light seeped through the crack at the bottom, but as she listened, she heard nothing. There was no water running, no toilet flushing, no sobs, no sniffles, no anything. It was deadly silent and that door was between Rio and uncovering the truth of what was actually going on inside that bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could have knocked. Maybe she should have, but she didn't. Agatha needed the moment and Rio would give it to her, but she would also remind her that she was still there, and not in the way that was afraid of being shut out. No, Rio was still there in the way that she would do whatever it was Agatha needed her to do, even if it meant leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio chose to do in that moment was a physical representation of everything she had been trying to communicate to Agatha over the entire weekend.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat down, still entirely naked, and pressed her back to the bathroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
     The following few minutes remained silent, but only because Rio was taking the appropriate amount of time to think about what it was she wanted to say. When she found it, her voice sounded, impossibly soft but still loud enough to be heard through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know what you're thinking or feeling right now, and I know that's by design," she called, her head tipping back slightly as her eyes slid shut. "But I want you to know how important it is to me that you keep making decisions to do things that unsettle you. You owe me nothing, Agatha, but you keep giving me everything. And... And I can see that it's obviously effecting you, but... But it still means more to me than I know how to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio breathed a sigh through her nose, pulling her knees to her chest. "My... I... Fuck. When I... When I came here with you Friday night, I didn't know what was going to happen. I didn't know what we would do, or that you would decide to make these big choices that you never would have made otherwise. And... I know it's a lot. And I... I feel like you're probably as confused as I am about it all, but... I'm still here for you. At least, until you don't want me to be anymore."
    </p>
    <p>
     There Rio sat, back to the cold wood of the bathroom door, spilling what little feelings she might have been allowed to have, having little to no idea if it would actually matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     After another minute or so of no response, Rio decided to leave it be where it was and got to her feet so that she could crawl back in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was less than sixty seconds, the bathroom door opened and Agatha emerged, not lifting her gaze to where Rio was laid on her back in the bed, the comforter pulled up over her hips but no further. Instead, she walked around the bed to her side and climbed in. Without a word, she laid on her side.
    </p>
    <p>
     The part that stung was that she was facing away from Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, at least it stung for the time it took her to scoot back, the soft and supple flesh of her ass pressing firmly to Rio's hip.
    </p>
    <p>
     Against her own will, Rio's heart fumbled in her chest, skipping more than one beat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without saying a word, Rio rolled to her side and wrapped her arm around Agatha's middleand buried her face in Agatha's hair. It was stupid, probably, but when Agatha didn't immediately try to fight her off, Rio felt like it might not have been the wrong call. She still felt that way even when Agatha spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio..." she whispered. That lone sound made Rio understand why Agatha had not responded from within the confines of the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shhh," Rio soothed, squeezing her tighter. "It's okay to just let yourself have it for a little bit. I'm right here and I don't want to let go."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't verbalize a response. In fact, for a little too long, she didn't respond at all. And then, Rio felt all at once as Agatha's thin fingers wrapped around her arm, clutching at her in a silent request that she follow through on such a statement.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I promise."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha squeezed her a little tighter but said nothing. So Rio simply held her, thankful that she did not
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to let go. Rio held her for five minutes, then ten. Fifteen minutes in, Rio realized something quite beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had fallen asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't help but wonder, breathing in the scent of Agatha's sweat and shampoo, if it was the first time Agatha had ever fallen asleep in the arms of another person.
    </p>
    <p>
     If it was, Rio truly hoped it wouldn't be the last.
    </p>

   <div>
    <p>
     It had been an unbearably long time since Rio had slept hard -- that kind of hard where a bomb could have dropped an she likely would have kept sleeping -- but somehow, her alarm sliced cleanly through her unconsciousness. It wasn't overbearingly loud, but loud enough that she knew it was a beckoning for her to begin her day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rousing to consciousness, Rio was immediately aware of one thing and one thing only: she was still on her side and she still had Agatha beneath her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn't stirring and so it left Rio torn; she wanted to turn off the alarm as to not wake Agatha, but she did not want to move and risk Agatha not letting her back in for just a few more minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The logical part of her won out and as quick as she could, Rio rolled to her back to reach for her phone so that she could silence the alarm. When she rolled back to her prior position, Agatha was beginning to wake. She was squirming, but she was not scooting away.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio's arm settled over Agatha's side, a gruff and tired grunt left Agatha, her body surprisingly shifting backward to fit into the curve of Rio's as Rio fought her urge to cuddle closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good morning," she breathed into the back of Agatha's neck, covered by her hair. "I know you probably wanted to sleep in today, so I'm sorry for waking you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of telling her it was okay, or not to apologize, Agatha's hand found hers, wrapping around it snugly. When she spoke, her words said the opposite of her grip.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You should get ready for work," Agatha whispered back, trying her luck at being authoritative in spite of the fact that she was barely awake.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will," Rio assured her. She could have tried to fight sentimentality, but she was still just tired enough that her inhibitions slipped. Her lips pressed to hair as she kissed at the back of Agatha's neck in a move that was almost scarily automatic. "But in five minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio meant it, she really did. She just wanted five more minutes where apparently, Agatha was going to allow her to hold on a little longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a peaceful five minutes, but it was also five minutes where Rio very heavily considered the idea of calling out of work so that she could stay where she was until Agatha had enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ultimately, she was reminded of the conversation they'd had the night before wherein Agatha had all but forbade such a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew that ultimately, Agatha would let her make her own choices, but it was also apparent that she wanted to interrupt Rio's day-to-day as little as possible. She hadn't seemed to catch on to the fact that she could have upended Rio's entire existence and Rio would have
     <em>
      liked
     </em>
     it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wasn't that essentially what she had done already?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had walked into that bar, not knowing that Rio had been hunting her, and she had changed both of their lives forever by doing nothing out of
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio basked in those last couple of minutes of physical closeness, she
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     that what they were doing, it did not have a long shelf life. It wasn't a reality Rio liked, but it was her reality all the same. Agatha would forever be wild and unruly; it was in the threads of her very being. As such, commitment was never going to be something she was capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, at least, that was what Rio had to keep telling herself to remain in check.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she let herself believe for even a second that Agatha could be capable of actually
     <em>
      feeling
     </em>
     something toward her, the house of cards she had carefully constructed where she did not fall helplessly into Agatha was going to collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
     To maintain her sanity, Rio had to convince herself that Agatha could never love her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wait.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back?
    </p>
    <p>
     What the fuck kind of thought was --
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think it's been longer than five minutes," Agatha murmured. In complete contradiction to such an observation, her grip on Rio's fingers tightened, making her heart falter in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's okay," Rio dismissed half-heartedly, not really meaning it. "I can just skip a shower. I mean, its not like dead people have an acute sense of smell and Alice has a deviated septum. I should be fine."
    </p>
    <p>
     Beneath her hold, Agatha's body shook softly with her quiet chortling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio," she murmured back admonishingly, "go shower. Work your nine to five, go grab your things and come back to see me off proper." It was a gentle instruction, and while Rio could sense that Agatha wasn't actually being suggestive, she could not pass up the opportunity to voice a reminder of who they were.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Does that mean you want to squeeze in a quickie before you have to go?" she questioned with a light giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's response was softer than Rio was sure she'd ever heard Agatha be before and as a result, she was measurably caught off guard.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, something like that."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to probe, wanted to gently nudge Agatha into explaining what that meant, but if she did, she knew she was going to be late for work.
    </p>
    <p>
     With one last squeeze, Rio begrudgingly untangled herself from Agatha, resisting the urge to place one last kiss to any available part of her body as she did so. Without a word between them, she did as Agatha had instructed and set to preparing for her day.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, in the shower, Rio could only think of one thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Something like that.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had explicitly made a suggestive comment and Agatha's first response had not been to encourage her or rise to the challenge. She had chosen instead to voice that there would be an alternative to a quick fuck before she got on a plane and was gone for ten days, at the very least.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe those two things would not be mutually exclusive, but even the idea that Agatha might want more was... Well, it was confusing.
    </p>
    <p>
     What even was
     <em>
      more?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Things were changing between them, but if left Rio wondering to what extent.
    </p>
    <p>
     The night before had truly dismantled the prevalent dynamic between them and in the process, Rio had seen more of Agatha than Agatha had probably meant to show.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't change a thing. If anything, it made Rio realize that while she had been aware of Agatha's numerous layers, she had not realized just how many there were. Now, the trick for her was going to be understanding which ones needed a little more attention when she attempted to pull them back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her shower hadn't been long, but it had been just long enough for Rio to think herself into a hole. The trick was going to be figuring how to climb back out.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it turned out, that was a little easier to do when Agatha was not in the bedroom as she returned to get dressed. Rio was a little disappointed, but solely because she felt as though she had disrupted Agatha's routine more than she'd meant to. Yet, when she emerged from the bedroom, the sight before her almost stopped her in her tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
     There at the counter was Agatha, a pot of coffee in her hand as she poured it into a travel mug that was absolutely not for herself. Next to it, there was a small little prepackaged container. From where she was, Rio could see the boiled egg inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, that's your weekday breakfast, hm?" Rio teased lightly, planting herself next to Agatha at the counter's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Agatha answered simply, "it's yours."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to melt at the seemingly normal gesture, but it felt impossible to try to resist. Agatha wasn't being overtly affectionate, but was choosing to take a much more low key path to the same destination.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a premade protein pack and yet to Rio, it was so much more.
    </p>
    <p>
     To Rio, Agatha was telling her that she was going to be taken care of, too. To Rio, Agatha was saying, very loudly without a word, that Rio's wellbeing mattered to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a gesture that had no noise associated, but it was ringing clear as day in Rio's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't want to talk about the night before, and that was fine, but it was becoming more obvious to Rio as the seconds ticked on that something had most definitely changed between them. It wasn't bad, and she felt no need to panic, but Agatha seemed to be finally
     <em>
      getting it.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     They were reaching the point of true understanding, at long last.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You made me breakfast? How sweet," came Rio's light cajoling. She wanted to put a period at the end of it with a kiss to Agatha's cheek, but she was concerned it might come off as facetious given her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You need something on your stomach before you work eight hours. Plus, the science of breakfast cannot be contested; your body functions better when you fuel it with more than a glass of V8." Agatha was speaking clinically, but Rio could hear the genuine investment there, like it actually mattered to her whether or not Rio took care of her body -- which she did, but the point still stood.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Spicy V8, actually," Rio chided back, bumping Agatha's hip with hers. It was a mild interruption to the task of screwing the lid on the coffee, though she stopped halfway through.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I didn't add any sugar or cream," Agatha stated, realizing her mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't have to, Agatha. I'm a big girl and can make my own coffee."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was
     <em>
      trying
     </em>
     to be sweet and Rio truly did appreciate it, but she didn't need to make the hurdle straight into domesticity when they weren't even actually a couple. They were simply two people who had mind-blowing sex that kinda gave a shit about one another's feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, whatever feelings they were capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
     More specifically, what feelings
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     was capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was all just... a little jarring, if Rio was completely honest with herself. She knew it wasn't like Agatha was throwing herself around professing her love or any emotional connection at all -- even if it was clearly there -- but the fact that Agatha had gotten herself out of bed when she didn't have to and put together a small parting gift for Rio to take to work?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was blatant, even in such a small way. Agatha gave a shit. Maybe more than 'kinda.' And Rio realized immediately how dangerous that was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was never going to physically harm Rio, of that she was certain, but the moment she decided to
     <em>
      stop
     </em>
     giving a shit? That was going to be a wound Rio wouldn't know how to nurse. While Rio had never met anyone like Agatha before, she could see their future (or, rather, lack of one) as it laid ten miles out.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was just a good time, no matter how many personal strides Agatha took when it came to growing as a human. It was fun, it was hot, and it was heavy and hard. That was all it would ever be.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was all it
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     ever be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Talking herself out of it would have to work, but Rio already knew it was a fruitless endeavor already.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more time she spent with Agatha, the more invested she became. Now, even in Agatha's absence, Rio was going to have to use that time to deconstruct the complicated emotional tangle she had gotten herself into.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're right," Agatha responded, gently sliding the mug over so Rio could finish the job. Before Rio could say anything, Agatha snatched up the mug of coffee she had prepared for herself and paced to place herself at the kitchen island.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was quick about her task of finishing the coffee, realizing something mid-way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha," she rushed, feeling the panic as it slowly rose throughout her body. When she turned around, Agatha was staring at her expectantly, as if waiting for her to continue. "I don't have my car. How the fuck am I supposed to get to work?!"
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been a glaring oversight on Rio's part to not have taken that into consideration, but she should have known Agatha better, even at that point.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Francisco is in the parking garage below waiting for you. He will be at the morgue at five to pick you up and drop you off at home, where you can collect your tiny little go-kart with with rest of your things," Agatha informed her, her air of nonchalance almost maddening as she took a sip from her mug.
    </p>
    <p>
     In spite of her indignance, Rio deflated a little at the relief she felt to know she was not going to have to take a cab to work in rush hour traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's almost infuriating how you always have answers," Rio informed her, raising the steel mug to take a draw of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think a lot," Agatha mused back with a light shrug. The smile on her lips gave her away; what she said might have been true, but Rio heard what she was
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     saying.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      'I think about you a lot.'
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     But that wasn't what Agatha actually said, so Rio could not respond like it was. Instead, she set her coffee down and opted to pull her hair up if for no other reason than just not wanting to deal with it. When she finished and started to gather her things to leave, Agatha raised a hand and dropped a finger to point at the spot next to her in a silent command.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without a word, but
     <em>
      with
     </em>
     a curiously raised eyebrow, Rio paced to the indicated spot as Agatha turned her head to look up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I hope you have a good day," Agatha voiced the moment their eyes met. "And if you think of anything that you'd like to have for dinner before I leave, please do text me and let me know."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to grin, but only because she could
     <em>
      see
     </em>
     Agatha fighting through the physical discomfort of being both sentimental and weirdly normal about a morning departure. Perhaps it was an attempt at being
     <em>
      too
     </em>
     normal that made Rio want to laugh. But laughing would surely sour the mood and erase any intention Agatha might have had at trying again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Rio made a soft observation. "You're being very sweet this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, turning back to her coffee in feigned discouragement. "My apologies, I will make sure it doesn't happen again," she offered back, but it was light. It was playful. It was maybe even gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, Rio raised a hand so that her first two fingers could land on Agatha's far cheek, pulling in light request for Agatha to meet her gaze again. When she did, Rio was smiling. It was warm, it was soft.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you going to be sweet enough to at least let me give you a kiss on the cheek before I leave?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was such an innocent request and for no more than five seconds, Rio could see Agatha's eyes soften
     <em>
      just enough
     </em>
     that told Rio exactly what she needed to know. It wasn't the answer to her question, but rather a voicing of something more. Something Agatha
     <em>
      tried
     </em>
     to contradict when she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What? Do you not trust me enough for full lips? Think I'll toss you up here and give myself a proper breakfast so that you're late for work?" Agatha offered it like it was supposed to be discouraging, but Rio was already warring with herself to keep from getting undressed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Rio tried to defend, but she knew it was pointless. Agatha was just giving her shit. "In fact, after our little talk, I'm surprised you're stalling instead of letting me get to my day."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had been in the process of setting her coffee down as Rio spoke, clearly trying to gain the upper hand, but it never would have worked. Quick as lightning, Agatha's suddenly free hand whipped out and reached up for the ponytail Rio had given herself. It was a handle, a hold that Agatha used to pull Rio in close enough to kiss her and hard.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't just a kiss of parting, but Rio also knew she could not read into it too much right before she had to spend eight hours cutting into cadavers. She could read into it too much
     <em>
      while
     </em>
     she was cutting into cadavers. She just had to get to work first.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how the fuck was she supposed to want to when Agatha was kissing her like
     <em>
      that?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha pulled her back by the hold on her ponytail, Rio's whine of disappointment was loud and very clearly soaked in dissatisfaction. She didn't
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     Agatha to stop. She wanted her to follow through on that empty threat and throw her on that counter and go to fucking town in every single way that would make Rio forget about her responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
     That wasn't in the cards for her, not today.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go to work," Agatha told her, but she still hadn't let go of Rio's ponytail, looking her straight in the eyes. "I'll see you when you get back." That time, she did let go, and Rio's hopes sank. She knew the rules and yet, there had been the flicker of a thought that Agatha might let her break them just this one time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she conceded, however, Rio stooped in as quickly as she could and placed the daintiest kiss to Agatha's cheek, grinning like a kid who'd gotten away with stealing candy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have a good day, Agatha," Rio offered, finally turning so that she could head for the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You too, Rio."
    </p>
    <p>
     She had just pushed the button when Agatha called to her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah?" she returned, glancing over her shoulder to see Agatha pointing at something.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You forgot your breakfast."
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     Work was... work.
    </p>
    <p>
     That day was the first in Rio's career where she simply did not want to be there. Alice had brightened her morning of course, but even her chipper demeanor had not been enough to ease the yearning of being back in the condo, curled up in bed and spending her day lazing around with Agatha and Phineas.
    </p>
    <p>
     After lunch, though, Alice definitely called her out. She'd been leaning over to gather a box of personal items and because she was not wearing her coat, the shirt she had put on that morning rode up just high enough to sell her out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio! Oh my GOD!" she squealed, shoving her last French fry into her mouth as she leapt to her feet and surged forward. "Did you have a dream about a really scarred guy with insane claws?! Because fuck!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Welp, the stinging Rio had felt the night before apparently had a visual representative to go along with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Phin got me," she attempted, but by her tone of voice alone, Alice knew she was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You saw her again?!" she pressed, her eyes as bright and wide as her smile as Rio turned around.
    </p>
    <p>
     Admittedly, Rio was also grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, I did," she conceded with a shrug, her lips not dropping from their brandishing of teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And she did
     <em>
      that?
     </em>
     Are you actually okay? First the hickeys and now
     <em>
      that?"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew what Alice was asking, but it was not a conversation that she was ready to have yet. The truth was, Rio still didn't have an answer that would appropriately nail every point Alice would want her to hit. Whoever Agatha was, she had completely disrupted Rio's sense of self in the most insane way possible and yet, Rio wasn't bothered. Not in the slightest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What can I say? We have fun!" Rio dismissed, relocating the box she had lifted with a shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah. Fun. While it looks like she's trying to kill you," Alice mused back, swiping up her soda from the desk so she could depart for her afternoon runs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If it helps ease your worries, I could always have her text you before she does so at least you're aware?" Rio shot back, removing her coat from the back of her chair so she, too, could get back to work. When she looked up to gauge Alice's reaction, she wasn't sure what she had been expecting, but what she saw was not it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, Rio dissolved into laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice must have lost her sense for a moment because the terrified expression she was wearing showed Rio that she had no idea that she had been joking.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not her type, Alice," Rio revealed with a toothy grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh. Right. Sorry," Alice murmured in return, reaching up to rub the back of her neck which was likely just as pink as her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Anyway! Be safe in the streets! Don't bag up anyone still breathing!" Rio chirped at her, heading for the autopsy room.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey!" Alice called on her way out. "That's my line!"
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     As promised, when Rio walked out of the morgue a few minutes after Alice, Francisco had been sitting curbside in a large black Denali. Surprisingly, when Rio opened the back door to climb in, she realized he was listening to Reggae.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, he snapped forward to turn it down, seemingly embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm sorry, ma'am," he offered with a brief glance over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't be, turn it back up."
    </p>
    <p>
     He didn't turn around to acknowledge her, but she could see his cheeks shift with his smile before he leaned to do just that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was quiet the rest of the way to her apartment, just watching the city as they passed through it. It was a city she loved, a city she had spent so much of her life in, and a city that she now knew what it was like to look down upon. When he pulled into the familiar space he had occupied three nights before while waiting for her, Rio offered a light wave in the rear view mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Goodnight, Francisco. Thank you for the lift."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And to you as well, Ms. Vidal. Take care," he offered. It was a professional courtesy, but it was warm considering that he was a stranger and it was only the third time they had shared in the space of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took her little time to gather her things and cram them into a duffel bag -- she figured it was more informal than a suitcase; she didn't need to look
     <em>
      completely
     </em>
     insane -- so that she could load everything up into her car and make her way straight back to Water Tower Place and an awaiting Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she arrived, Agatha had already called her in a parking pass which made things considerably easier for the following couple of weeks. Once parked, Rio headed straight up.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the doors pulled open, there was an instantaneous aroma that filled her nostrils, lightly stinging in all the right ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew that smell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Forgetting her manners and immediately salivating, Rio surged into the condo, gaze cutting to the kitchen where Agatha was plating up their meals.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You got Nandos?!" she all but squealed, finding her place again at Agatha's side to survey the display of grilled chicken, fries and garlic bread.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Somehow, I knew you'd be thrilled," Agatha offered back with a haughty show of teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's because I like chicken, isn't it?" Rio joked. There, in that spot she always occupied when Agatha was busying herself with kitchen-esque things, Rio wanted more. She wanted to cling to Agatha, to hold onto her for as long as she could before she knew it stopped being an option. She wanted to shuffle to the side, to plant herself firmly behind Agatha and wrap her arms around her middle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did no such thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she reached across Agatha, gently brushing her hand with intent, so that she could take hold of the purple labeled bottle that was already half empty.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This is yours, I take it?" Rio mused, holding up the bottle of garlic hot sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's good to have around. Spices things up every now and again." Agatha was making a joke, but the way she said it was so... strange that it just made it even funnier, spurring Rio into a bout of laughter that had her arm holding her stomach for support.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, not for one second do I ever think that your life lacks spice," came Rio's retort. When Agatha pushed the plate over with a fork and knife, Rio picked up all three with one hand and decided to do something stupid, even if it was a continuation from the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her free hand landed in the middle of Agatha's back and she leaned in, her lips pressing firmly to Agatha's cheek before they eased enough for her to murmur softly against it. "Thank you for dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
     There had been an intent to pull away, there really had, but when Agatha's left arm crossed her body and her nimble fingers hooked into the back of Rio's neck, she no longer wanted to go
     <em>
      anywhere.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The desire to stay completely still only got worse when Agatha planted a kiss on her lips that nearly took her breath away. It was assertive, and it was undeniably firm, but the pure emotion Rio felt as a result made her wonder if it was actually coming
     <em>
      from
     </em>
     Agatha instead of simply being brought on by her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they parted, Rio's eyes flew open instantly in some sort of attempt to measure what might be on Agatha's face, but she wasn't fast enough. Agatha turned back to the food and picked up her plate, departing without another word to the dining room table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had a thought as she followed, catching sight of Phineas hunched over his bowl while devouring his own dinner; Agatha had told her that she sat at the table for her evening meal most nights. Rio finally understood it when she became of the mind that she'd probably do the same, if only to envision that Agatha was there with her instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     While they ate, Rio lobbed lazy questions about if Agatha had any plans for Taipei and what she was actually going for. Agatha had been rather tight-lipped about the majority of things related to work, but she admitted that she had no real plans to venture away from the hotel aside from meetings and workshops she would be attending.
    </p>
    <p>
     Funny, Rio thought, that even rocket scientists attended workshops.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time they had finished, Rio was the one to tend to the dinner dishes, insisting Agatha relax in the living area before she had to leave. Agatha didn't argue with her, following her into the kitchen only to pour herself half a glass of wine, paying full mind to the two milligrams of Xanax she was going to be popping into her mouth like a tic-tac within the following few hours. It took only a couple of minutes for her to tend to rinsing their plates and stowing them in the dishwasher, leaving her to wander into the living room after Agatha, making a direct path for the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she started to place herself next to Agatha, a light hold caught her wrist and gave a tug. Lifting her gaze and sweeping it over, Agatha was looking up at her in earnest request. Before she could ask what exactly it was she wanted, those striking blue eyes dropped to her lap and lifted right back up again.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a knowing curl of her lips, Rio gave a gentle nod and turned in place, reaching down to pluck Agatha's wine glass from her hold so it could be relegated to the coffee table, no longer needed. Once it was far away enough from the edge, Rio's focus was back on Agatha and the very act of placing herself in Agatha's lap, knees cradling hips and hands on chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How was work?" Agatha asked, and while it might have seemed mundane to anyone else, Rio had learned that the questions Agatha asked weren't actually the questions she was asking.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No new hubbub. A lot of the usual, DV, car accidents, ODs. Nothing... exciting," Rio detailed, her palms gently rubbing over the expanse of Agatha's chest, back and forth, as she did so. The wideness of the smile she had tried to keep at bay grew the longer she went on, watching that sparkle in Agatha's eyes get brighter and brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So what I'm hearing is you miss me?" Agatha suggested, brows arching to offer a challenge that Rio even
     <em>
      try
     </em>
     to defy her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She did it anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How can I miss you when I'm sitting in your lap?" she replied coyly, lifting a brow of her own. There was still a decent amount of space between them, but the way Agatha's hands had taken to caressing her thighs told Rio it might not last very long.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You miss being stimulated," Agatha responded, cocking her head as if she were trying to make a point.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I mean, yeah, but I've got that to look forward for two weeks, don't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands stopped moving, but her strong grip found her sinking rough fingertips into the muscle of Rio's thighs. Her eyes were no longer shimmering, but there was still a light in them, even if it had dimmed slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean that intellectually and sexually, don't you?" she asked back. She didn't smirk or grin or coat her words with allure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked at her for a moment, trying to realign the conversation being had with the way it was supposed to go in her head. And then, the weight of it -- coupled with Agatha's downshift in demeanor -- hit her.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of Rio's hands sailed up the side of Agatha's neck so that she could cup her jaw, looking her dead-on.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean that in every way imaginable, Agatha. I'm going to miss being excited about work because I know for a fact that the most puzzling series of murders I have ever seen are going to be on pause. I'm going to miss waiting for that stupid burner to go off because you've texted me. And I'm going to also miss the way you fuck me to the point of lacking braincells, and -- "
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly realizing where she was about to go, Rio's jaw snapped shut and her lips pressed into a thin line, a true indication that she had almost really fucked up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha saw it. And, like Agatha did, she pressed as hard as she could on the purpling bruise of Rio's dumbassery.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's mouth was suddenly dry and her throat felt as though it was filled with razorblades.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     The door was open, now. Agatha was not going to let her do anything other than run right through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her thumb brushing just barely over Agatha's cheek, Rio glanced to that very touch before finding the courage to look Agatha in the eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And I'm going to miss watching movies with you, and going for swims, and playing with the cat with that ridiculous laser pointer you have. I'm just..." Rio's eyes were darting back and forth, searching Agatha's face for the very moment it was going to turn green and she was going to grow too nauseated by Rio's stupid sentimentality. "I'm just going to miss
     <em>
      you."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not gag. She did not make a face. She didn't laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha just looked at her, studying her. She was looking for any tell Rio might have had that said she was lying when she said that kind of thing. She could look all fucking night; she wasn't going to find out.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of her hands lifted from Rio's thigh so that her knuckles could skim Rio's cheek, just beneath her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can I tell you something with the caveat that what I tell you is what you get?" she asked quietly and Rio immediately accepted the moment for what it was. Before she could actually use her words to agree, Agatha kept going. "It's just... We'll talk about it more eventually, but we just don't have the time tonight, but I still think you should know."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was stalk still, hardly breathing as she watched Agatha's eyes with an unhindered intensity. She knew what was happening, or what was about to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was softness, in the most Agatha Harkness way possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can tell me anything, Agatha," Rio murmured back sincerely, her thumb moving to brush along Agatha's cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Before you said it last night... No one's ever told me that they were proud of me. And... And that's why I went to the bathroom and didn't want to come out. Not in school, not at work and God fucking knows my mother would have sooner licked a leaking battery before daring to say it. And I..." Agatha's lips mashed together, so hard that it looked like she was biting the insides of them. Meanwhile, Rio felt like she was about to shake right out of her skin while fighting to stave off the urge to let it permeate her physical form.
    </p>
    <p>
     Continuing on, the war going on within Agatha started to make itself known in the tiniest contorsions of muscles in her face. "I still don't know how it made me feel. And I figured I'd have a lot of time to think about it, but then..."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha seemed to gather some self-awareness that was immediately followed by self-consciousness. Her hand snapped down again to land on Rio's thigh, but Rio did not lessen her touch on Agatha's face. At the same time, she did not waver in the slightest as she watched Agatha's expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was locked in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was so fucking close to opening up.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      So fucking close.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of immediately trying to pull more out of her, Rio chose to do something else instead. Her head dropped and their lips pressed together in a undemanding and unhurried kiss that Rio hoped would do nothing but soothe whatever qualms seemed to be keeping Agatha from just taking the leap.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio put space between their mouths again, she chose to supplement the lack of contact with a pressure of her forehead to Agatha's, her eyes still closed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can tell me, Agatha," she whispered, choosing explicitly to not look at her if she could find the courage to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And then you just said you're going to miss me. And... Guess what?" Agatha's words were so fucking quiet, but Rio chose to bite anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No one's ever said that to me, either."
    </p>
    <p>
     For the second time, Rio felt as pieces of her heart simply crumbled off and dropped into a sea of nothing -- or maybe it was stomach acid where they actually landed. Agatha almost sounded
     <em>
      ashamed
     </em>
     as she put those words into Rio's ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     What the fuck did she have to be ashamed of? Agatha was a complete fucking mystery (even still) and it was clear that she'd dealt with a lot in her life, but the fact that no one had said these basic and humane things to her was not down to
     <em>
      who she was
     </em>
     . Sure, the things she'd done and the choices she made might have been contributing factors, but it wasn't some personal flaw because of the human being she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it was simply the fact that she'd just never let anyone in enough to appreciate what they had before it was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did, though. Rio appreciated everything that she had learned Agatha to be. She was beautiful, she was a goddamn genius, she was cunning and so fucking calculated. Agatha moved about the world in a path she carved only for herself, razing anything and anyone that stood in her way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha..." came Rio's quiet introduction as she pulled her head back to behold the woman beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was shaking her head instantly, stopping Rio from continuing on. "And that's why. Because in nearly sixteen years, you are the only person who knows me by that name. And... You don't have to tell me how you figured it out, but... That alone was such a fucking turn on. Fifteen years I've kept who I am buried beneath who I wanted to be. But you wanted to know. You always want to fucking know."
    </p>
    <p>
     She was beginning to ramble, tumbling further into an abyss of unknown to her, but she still barrelled onward.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When I look at you, I see... It's... You know when it's rained really hard but then the sun comes out even though it's still so fucking windy?" She blinked at Rio, expectant of an answer and so, Rio offered it in a nod. "When I look at you, I see that wind-rippled reflection. And the more I've gotten to know you, I see that reflection as it melts perfectly with traits of someone that meant a lot to me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused again, licking her lips in an attempt to reinstate some wetness in her sandpaper-dry mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You have always been familiar in the most obscenely unknown way."
    </p>
    <p>
     God, Rio couldn't have said it better herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was an anomaly, something that didn't made sense, but she'd always felt it. It was the strangest pull, a calling of reminiscence when truthfully, there was no reason for it. Rio had not known Agatha, or Amelia, or any iteration of her before she had walked into the bar that night. And yet, when their eyes met for the very first time as Rio looked beyond the muzzle of that pistol, Rio had seen
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     that had solidified her need to know
     <em>
      more.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She could have answered Agatha, could have said that it went both ways, but there was no point. Agatha already knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chose to kiss her again instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was tender, but it was also sensuous. It was slow, but it was attentive and mindful. It wasn't a desperate macking where Rio wanted Agatha to fuck her into a coma, but rather a quiet goodbye with a whispered 'I'll see you soon' thrown in for good measure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let her. For minutes upon minutes, Agatha let Rio kiss her. She probably would have let her keep going, had her phone not begun to ring.
    </p>
    <p>
     With suddenly cold lips, Rio sat back on Agatha's thighs as she swiped up and answered her phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Francisco, shit. Sorry. Yes, I'll be right down. No, no, that's alright. They're by the elevator. I'll just bring them down with me. Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a short conversation, but Rio could hear the other end without having heard the other end.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio didn't want her to. Especially not after
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     She considered, for the few seconds before Agatha softly patted her thighs to request that she gets up, just asking Agatha to go with her, to see her off and have Francisco bring her back. With a total awareness of just how heavy the things were that Agatha had just admitted, Rio somehow found a way to swallow it down before it touched her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     That much bravery wouldn't find her, but just enough did that she took another chaste kiss before complying and getting to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     do, and what she
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     do, was walk Agatha to the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let Agatha reach forward to press the call button, but when she stepped back to wait, an impulsive thought that flared in the back of Rio's brain pushed her to act. Suddenly, she stepped forward and took hold of Agatha's wrist, turning her so that they were facing one another. Immediately, she was stepping forward -- right into Agatha -- as she wrapped her arms around the other woman, holding her tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't do physical affection like cuddles and hugs, but Rio
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     one more reminder that Agatha was there, that she was real, that this life she was suddenly living was fucking
     <em>
      real.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     They stood like that for so long that the elevator bell dinged and the doors open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't notice.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Agatha did, she didn't say anything and let them close again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't see it, but even though Agatha wasn't holding her back, her eyes were closed as she basked in the feeling of what it was like to be willingly held by someone she
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to be held by.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another moment passed and Agatha finally chose to separate them so she could push the call button again. This time, the door opened immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stepped forward and grabbed her suitcase up by the handle and found herself by the threshold of the elevator, lifting her head to look back at Rio one last time. Her gaze tore away and landed in the elevator before snapping out again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Kiss me one more time, but make it quick," she demanded with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like an obedient puppy, Rio rushed forward, nearly bumping into Agatha as her hands raised and they indulged in one last kiss before they both had to go over a week without another.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have a safe flight, Agatha. Text me when you land."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will, Rio. It'll be over in no time." Agatha had stepped backward into the elevator, but the smile she was still wearing was bright in spite of the weight that came once those doors closed.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they finally did, Rio really fucking hoped she was right.
    </p>

    <p>
     It took about ten minutes after those elevator doors closed for Rio to actually feel the weight of her solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     In that ten minutes, she'd grabbed herself a beer, paced to the couch and plopped down unceremoniously with a strange knot of emotion sitting somewhere near the base of her throat. Rio had known this was coming. For three days, she had known it was coming and yet, the idea that she was going to be taking up most of the space in that condo on her own for the next week and a half -- at least -- felt almost like a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had made the invitation and Rio had accepted with ease, but in Agatha's absence it just felt... weird. Maybe even
     <em>
      wrong
     </em>
     despite the fact that Rio couldn't actually put into words
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     it felt that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being alone gave Rio too much time to think. In the following ten minutes, she'd been overwhelmed with so many thoughts that fifteen people could have been having them at once. However, there was one that was a little more prevalent; it was a question that she realized might not have a simple answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     What the fuck was she
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     doing?
    </p>
    <p>
     She was sitting on a massive couch in a multi-million dollar condo unit that belonged to the manufactured alias of a serial killer while said serial killer tended to the responsibilities of her day job of being a fucking rocket scientist. While that alone felt improbable enough to accept as reality, the additional fact that Rio felt a pang of longing for Agatha to return even so soon was not only stunning, but also impossibly maddening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio needed to get real with herself and fucking fast, or she was going to find herself in a bigger mess than this already was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could spiral too deep into the bottomless hole of possibility and misfortune, Rio realized that she had at least another week to devolve into an existential crisis. For that night, she just needed to... exist in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, that was what she tried her hardest to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas had come to join her a short while later, curling up on her chest and shoulder as she lounged on the sectional and tried to occupy herself with some low-budget indie film about converging alternate realities. At least the guy from Buffy was in it?
    </p>
    <p>
     It had an interesting enough plot, but Rio was struggling to focus. Who could blame her? In a matter of months, her life had warped into something she barely recognized. She felt a camaraderie with Agatha, and she truly understood it when Agatha had said that looking at her felt like looking at a distorted reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio only understood because she felt the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio saw the darkness, the righteousness, the intellect that she didn't like to claim but knew she had when she looked at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the other hand, when she looked at Agatha, the
     <em>
      real
     </em>
     Agatha, she saw someone who had been mistreated by life. She saw someone who wasn't permitted to have friends as a child without severe consequences. She saw someone who was able to finally find friendship in early adulthood only to have it taken away... in the
     <em>
      exact
     </em>
     same manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's mother had killed a
     <em>
      child
     </em>
     -- even if Agatha had not explained why -- and Agatha had watched his body decay away for weeks. While Rio had indulged in her fair share of the macabre side of life, it had been after her brain had developed enough to know what it was she was getting into. For Agatha, it had been at the age of eight. Eight fucking years old.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was no wonder she had become the woman she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     The similarities that Rio saw, they came from the understanding that life was fickle and the world would always be cruel. There would be murder and torture and injustice until the end of time, and that was something both Rio and Agatha grasped firmly. The other hold came on the fact that Agatha had found a way, even the smallest one, to do what she could to taper off some of the pain and violence and disruption.
    </p>
    <p>
     For every man that Agatha killed, there was an undetermined number of people's lives who were going to be better off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it wasn't Rio's place to be making such observant judgements, but the truth of the matter was that Agatha didn't just kill all willy-nilly without any forethought. Agatha invested time and research to the targets she selected and chose them with the hope that what she was doing would be a contribution toward bettering the world and the society kept within it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It might have been a drop in the bucket, but every single one mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had to wonder, though, when Agatha's bucket might overflow.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't have a solid number, did not know just how many people had died by Agatha's hand, but perhaps Rio was so morally far gone that it just didn't matter anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing who Agatha
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     had been jarring in its own right, but it didn't actually change Rio's mind about anything. In fact, all it did was make her want to stick around longer in spite of whatever plans Agatha may have had when it came to severing their little... whatever the fuck it could be called.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just before Rio could slip further into contemplation, there was a soft ding from the coffee table. Her eyes snapped to the glass surface, landing on her own phone first. Realizing it was not the source, she picked up the burner to see a message waiting for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     A message from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Boarding now. Be safe while I'm gone. Don't go chasing serial killers through the city."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was stupid, but it made Rio smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had absolutely no desire to chase after anyone else, in any capacity. All Rio wanted was to enjoy the quiet existence above the city that she had been offered and wait for the return of someone she knew she could never learn enough about.
    </p>
    <p>
     For all Agatha had told her, Rio still knew that there was more beneath the surface. So, as she had done to that point, she would just keep gently peeling back the layers until Agatha made her stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still wearing that smile, Rio typed her response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I thought about it, but I might not make it out alive a second time. Have a safe flight, A."
    </p>
    <p>
     While Rio was aware she could never put Agatha's real name in text, she also already hated the idea of calling her Amelia. It was a fine name, but it wasn't who Agatha actually was. It didn't fit, didn't feel right when Rio knew the truth before she knew the lie. She knew she would, should they enter a public space again, but it just felt to her like calling an apple an orange when it was still an apple.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the phone was returned to the coffee table, Rio knew that she was truly alone -- aside from the slumbering animal that had landed in her lap -- and that it was a state of being she would have to live in for a short while.
    </p>
    <p>
     Watching television had been enough to keep her relatively distracted, even if she kept glancing toward both phones on the table, as if she wasn't already fully aware that Agatha was not going to be messaging for... a while. Fifteen hours, at the very least.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, Rio watched some mindless reality show until she fell asleep on the couch, only waking to the sound of her alarm and a half-dead phone the following morning. Bolting upright from her sprawled-out position, she nearly launched Phineas toward the end of the couch, but he was quick to sink his claws into her hip to prevent that from happening.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck! God damnit!" Rio howled, causing Phin to unhook and bolt off on his own accord. "Shit, sorry Phin. I didn't realize you were there, buddy."
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't matter, he was already gone and likely hiding beneath the massive bed in Agatha's room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before setting about the task of preparing for the day, Rio stupidly checked the burner, not entirely surprised to see that there was no message. Really, she wouldn't have been surprised if she didn't get one at all until Agatha had settled in and gotten a little bit of rest to compensate for the jetlag. But, she checked anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she made it to work -- with a cup of the insanely caffeinated coffee that Agatha had a surplus of -- Rio was investing every bit of energy she had in focusing on actual work. She
     <em>
      tried
     </em>
     not to think about how the guy who choked to death on a marble was boring. She gave a
     <em>
      valiant effort
     </em>
     in not thinking about Agatha when Alice brought in a man that had fallen off a ladder and broken his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     For all of her accommodations in trying to keep Agatha and how she was half a world away out of her mind, Rio knew it was impossible. She had become obsessed and letting herself realize as much should have been alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, when she clocked out that day and climbed into her car, the first thing she did was check the burner she'd accidentally forgotten to take in with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a message.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was from two hours prior, but it was still a message.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt something akin to a palpitation in her chest, but her automatic reflex was to gag and then cough, as if she were absolutely sick of herself. It was bizarre, but... maybe it had roots somewhere. Maybe she
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     sick of herself and the way she had run headlong into this insane scenario with little regard for any consequences that might befall her.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, when she opened the message, the smile that found her was immediate and wide.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In Taipei. Flight was atrocious from what I can remember. Just got to the hotel. Think I'm going to try and get a little nap in before people start requesting my attention. Hope your day at work didn't bore you to death."
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't detailed and there was little emotion in it, but that last line let Rio know exactly how Agatha felt. It showed that Agatha truly understood her and her quest for titillating intellectual stimulation and that Rio's day-to-day was a lot more mundane when Agatha wasn't in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You will be thrilled to know that while it bored me to the very edge of death, I got to clock out before I succumbed. Glad you made it safe. Rest up so you can do smart people stuff. Though I had considered you're actually at a black market auction and just pretending it's for rocket science."
    </p>
    <p>
     A soft huff passed through her nose, amused at her own wit above all else as she pressed send on the message.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took less than a minute for a response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you die while I'm gone, I'm reviving you so I can kill you again. Also, black market is below me. Can be a bit seedy for my tastes. Enjoy your evening. I'm really going to sleep this time."
    </p>
    <p>
     Reading those messages, Rio could
     <em>
      hear
     </em>
     them in her head. It was Agatha's voice, haughty and snide and full of confidence. It helped that her dark humor was oozing out of every word she typed.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was stupid that all Rio wanted was for her to simply not have so much distance between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, okay, she had formed an attachment, yes. But, at the same time, Rio was convincing herself that it was only such because she had not gotten what it was she was looking for our of their entanglement quite yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she wanted to do, in this time she gad with Agatha, was learn what she could. She wanted to spiral into the madness of just how complex the human mind was and how things that happened in formative years shaped who people turned into as they grew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was a case.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just a case.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just something for Rio to draw knowledge from.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yeah fucking right.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who the fuck was Rio trying to fool with that absolute load of bullshit?
    </p>
    <p>
     Likely answer: Herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to pretend that she could walk away, that she could pack her things at any given moment and walk out of that condo for good and it not really matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     After Sunday night? That felt impossible. Rio could still see so much of it in her head, from the way Agatha had taken her over and shoved her fully under the weight of orgasmic bliss to the way Agatha's eyes flew open and filled with panic when Rio had made a poor choice out of innocent ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had never been her intention to panic Agatha, but she had done it anyway. And yet, Agatha pressed on. She kept letting those walls down and even though it had taken a bit, Rio could see that she genuinely was
     <em>
      trying.
     </em>
     But... trying for what? What was the end game here?
    </p>
    <p>
     Overthinking it was going to drive Rio insane and so, she typed back one last message before she started her car.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Goodnight, A. Talk to you tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it was needy or a bit clingy, and really, Rio knew that Agatha didn't owe her a single second of the day, but it didn't mean that Rio could stop herself from engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wasn't her lack of self-control the entire reason she found herself where she was?
    </p>
    <p>
     That night, Rio actually slept in the bed. She realized after dinner when she relaxed on the couch and started to doze that she was doing so to avoid going into the bedroom without Agatha; it felt strange. When she finally did, something close to comfort found her at there mere sight of the room, neat and tidy. The sheets were changed -- likely something Agatha had done before she'd left -- and the bed was made perfectly, everything tucked as it should be.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she crawled in, she was not at all surprised to feel a sudden weight behind her and a soft chirp as it sounded near her lower back. With a light headbutt, Phineas nudged her hip before hopping over it so that he could find a space to curl up against her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last thing Rio remembered crossing her mind before she fell asleep was that she was happy at least she had him.
    </p>
    <p>
     The following day was much of the same as it pertained to work, a mundane and unexciting run of bodies to fill her day. It wasn't that she was letting Agatha's creativity make work less enriching, but Rio's fixation on knowing the answer to the mystery was still entirely too strong and she wanted more to study.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was
     <em>
      fucked
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Even the thought alone that she
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     Agatha to kill more men should have shaken her to her core. It should have worried her, made her feel as though she was losing her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, Rio was resolute in it, morals be damned.
    </p>
    <p>
     After fixing herself a quick dinner of stir-fry, Rio once more found herself on the couch, flipping through channels to try and find something that might hold her attention. She was only two days in; there were at least eight more where she was going to need to try and not let her mind wander to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     But that was a farce, if she were being real with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had checked the burner throughout the day, but truthfully, she knew that it wasn't likely Agatha was going to text every day. They were on opposing ends of the days and what was her daytime was Agatha's nighttime; surely she valued sleeping far more than she valued any conversation she could have with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Around 7pm, Rio had landed on some true crime documentary, though it wasn't beneficial to leading her mind elsewhere. In fact, when the word 'strangulation' touched her ears in the narrator's voice, her mind zipped to its favorite place:
    </p>
    <p>
     A mental construct where Agatha's hand was around her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took little time for her to shoo Phineas away and pop the button on her jeans, slipping a soldiered hand inside to get to work. Her head fell back to fully rest on the pillow beneath it and by the time her touch reached its destination, Rio was too far gone to stop herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hand around her neck. Agatha pinning her knees to her chest. Agatha fucking her so hard she could barely think.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha. Agatha. Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more Rio descended into those thoughts, the more intentional she became in feeling out her body. She was already wet; that happened the moment the memory of what Agatha's hand around her throat felt like. But the more she thought, the more she needed release.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deft fingertips began to circle her clit, hips shifting as a result of the contact. It felt good, but it could feel better. It could feel better if Agatha was the one touching her. So Rio thought about that, about what Agatha's hands on her body felt like, about the euphoria she often felt when Agatha was railing her so hard she couldn't recall her own name.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more the thoughts filtered in, the closer Rio got to finding the euphoria she craved.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, her phone rang.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     phone. The burner phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Incoming Call from A.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Piss poor timing, Agatha!
    </p>
    <p>
     With a grunt, Rio withdrew her hand from her underwear and rolled over so that she could swipe up the phone with the dry one, answering the call as quickly as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey," Rio greeted, trying to sound cool and casual, like she had not been less than a minute away from losing herself to an orgasm at the thought of Agatha completely manhandling her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good morning," Agatha greeted; there was something in her tone, something that almost made her sound giddy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, right. It's morning for you," Rio answered, her brain finally catching up to the fact that Agatha was indeed thirteen hours ahead of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And a
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     good one, at that," Agatha quipped back, her voice irrationally low. It was that voice she tended to use when they were --
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh?" Rio questioned back, breaking out of thought. "And what about it is so good? Did you find a new porn video with insane positioning?" She knew it was stupid to goad Agatha in such a manner, but there was something about the way she was talking, the voice she was choosing that was causing the needy pulsing between Rio's legs to intensify.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Who needs porn when they have security cameras and a ferally horny house sitter?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It took about 3 playthroughs of that question in Rio's mind for her to catch on. At first, it didn't land at all. And then, the pieces began to drop into the blanks and Rio blinked, launching into an upright position, eyes sweeping over the living space.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, in the corner by the windows, was a camera mounted to the ceiling. Seeing it, Rio finally realized that Agatha -- halfway across the world in Taipei, fucking Taiwan -- was likely sipping at her coffee in her hotel room with her laptop open and the live footage of Rio masturbating playing on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're watching me rub one out?!" Rio nearly shrieked, hot from head to toe with embarrassment. The hand that wasn't holding the phone smacked to her forehead, careful to make sure her fingers did not land anywhere that would cause an unpleasant sticky sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean, yes? Did you not notice that there are cameras in every room except the bedroom?" Agatha asked back through her amused laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Clearly not!" Rio responded, her stomach twisting into a knot over the fact that she had been caught.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I just happened to check, figuring maybe you were taking a dip in the pool or being nosy, but... Oh, this is
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     much better than what I thought I'd see."
    </p>
    <p>
     She could hear it, the way Agatha was both delighted and turned-on by what she had found, but it left Rio without a clue of how to react. She'd clearly been busted, but where did she go from there?
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearing her throat of some of the embarrassment that had welled there, Rio straightened up a little bit and cast her eyes toward the camera as if she were looking right at Agatha. She could be shy, could let that embarrassment overwhelm her, or she could rise to the fucking challenge like she knew she was capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you think it could be better?" Rio asked, staring directly at the camera, a devious smirk tugging on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't be entirely sure, but she thought she heard Agatha suck in a sharp breath as if she were surprised by that question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean..." Agatha trailed off, but then Rio heard something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, Rio's eyes widened as she stared down the camera, wishing
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     could see what was on the other side of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     touching yourself right now?!" Rio fired back, that thundering throbbing becoming even more intense.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmmm, yeah. But I bet it would be better if I had more of a show," Agatha informed her just before releasing a soft, worked-up sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By 'more of a show,' what do you mean, exactly?" Rio challenged back, placing her hand beneath her shirt to let it rest on her stomach, exposing just enough of it so that her navel was showing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Pants off."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh fuck. She was serious. She wanted Rio to keep going, but she wanted to see more of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just the pants?" Rio returned, stare not wavering from the lens of the camera. She couldn't see Agatha, but she knew that what Agatha was seeing? It was the closest in that moment that they were going to get to looking one another in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I was... mmmm, I was trying
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     to be demanding. But you're a big girl, you can get as comfortable as you want," Agatha murmured back, clearly submerging herself more and more in her own desire.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a strange sensation, to hear her speak like that, to hear that her breathing was getting heavier, and know that it was all Rio was going to get. She wasn't going to get the breath on her skin that came with Agatha's groans and whispers. She wasn't going to get Agatha's hands on her body. Most of all, Rio wasn't going to get to look into those burning blue irises as she reached her climax.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite all of the things she couldn't have, Rio knew the one thing she
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     have was Agatha on the edge of her seat from thousands of miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gonna put you on speaker," Rio told her, lowering the phone from her ear so she could do just that. In the next second, the phone was tossed to the couch, and while Rio's inclination was to rip her own clothes off, another thought struck her instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a step toward the corner where the camera was mounted, looking right into that void of a camera lens. Slowly, her hands found the hem of her shirt, one moving to her stomach so that as she pushed up, it revealed more of her toned abdomen. The sight was clearly doing
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     because she could hear Agatha sigh heavily over the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You like the show?" Rio teased her, hardly breaking her stare with a blink, let alone to tear her eyes away.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmhmm," came Agatha's hummed response, though another
     <em>
      mmmmm, fuck
     </em>
     followed it the moment Rio's bra-clad chest was exposed as she shed the shirt she had been wearing completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Would be so much nicer if you were the one undressing me, don't you think?" she questioned, cocking her head back far enough for her voice to cast.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If I was, you wouldn't be getting any sleep tonight," Agatha returned, voice inundated with the arousal she had to be feeling when Rio reached behind her to unhook her bra with a lone set of fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, good thing then, hm? What about you? Slacking off at work already?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've got some time," Agatha managed, though as Rio's thumbs hooked into the waist of both her jeans and underwear, she cut herself off with a sharp inhale. If Rio could see her, she'd be willing to bet that Agatha's teeth were bordering on breaking through the skin of her lower lip.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Enough to watch me please myself on your multi-thousand dollar couch?" came Rio's intentional goading, her brows arching in challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha made a sound. It was a sound that surely was meant to start a sentence, but it turned into a low hiss before morphing back into intelligible speech.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, but I want you to get something." Agatha phrased it as something she
     <em>
      wanted,
     </em>
     but the
     <em>
      way
     </em>
     she said it made it sound more like something she
     <em>
      had to have.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Something? As in, something from your toybox?" Rio offered back, a haughty smirk curling her lips. Her arms folded over her chest, bare body still entirely on display for Agatha's viewing pleasure as her weight shifted to one leg defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," Agatha returned lowly, the desperation in her voice growing thicker and thicker. "The glass one."
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh. Oh fuck. Oh fucking fuck.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio already felt like she'd been stunned with a taser, but then Agatha kept fucking talking.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's mine, but I wanna see you fuck yourself with it."
    </p>
    <p>
     A immobilizing chill shot up Rio's spine as she stared at the camera, simply wishing that she could see Agatha on the other side. Was she at a desk? Was she on her hotel bed with the phone by her head and the laptop next to her with Rio's nude body taking up the screen? Had she packed some fun of her own?
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could comply, though, a flare of warmth embolded Rio to ask another question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The others aren't yours?" she posed, head tilting in curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I mean... I own them, yes, but haven't used any on myself aside from the other night. Or... anyone else, for that matter."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a simple enough answer, but Rio heard something else entirely, something that filled her with undeniable delight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had Agatha really invested a hefty chunk of money into being able to provide Rio
     <em>
      choices?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked, but could not find it in herself to ask out loud. What she chose to do instead was grin deviously up at the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think it's fucking hot that you want me to fuck myself with
     <em>
      your
     </em>
     dildo. And it being glass just makes it even better," Rio voiced, though she wasn't bolting off for the bedroom just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffed a sigh at that very fact. "So is there a reason you're choosing to stall instead of hopping to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, dropping her arms from where they had been resting over her chest. She considered for a moment, just eyeing the camera before she found the right words. "Yes, there is." With an intentional pause that drew a throat clearing from Agatha, Rio knew she was sending the point home, even before she continued. "I like
     <em>
      hearing
     </em>
     you get more and more desperate."
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment it left her lips, Rio found herself wishing yet again that she could
     <em>
      see
     </em>
     Agatha as opposed to making due with what she had, but it didn't matter. Agatha's sheer neediness was prevalent the moment her voice sounded again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio! Go get the fucking dildo!" Agatha nearly screeched. It was a demand, but it also sounded as if she were so sexually frustrated that she was on the verge of spontaneous combustion.
    </p>
    <p>
     With one last smirk, Rio did as she was told and returned only a moment later with the decently-sized glass dildo in one hand and a bottle of lube in the other. The moment she came back into view of the camera, Agatha's voice sounded from the phone on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Took you long enough," she snapped, but Rio knew that she wasn't actually irritated. In fact, Rio could still hear in the sound of her voice that she would have waited forever if it meant getting what she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because Agatha
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     got what she wanted. And when she didn't, she took it for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, not being able to
     <em>
      take
     </em>
     was surely doing a number on her, and the frustration seemed to be growing the longer Rio drew it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio, I swear to all fuck, if you don't --"
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been in the process of setting the bottle down on the coffee table when Agatha spoke, but she cut her off by turning away from the camera and leaning down to speak into the phone. She was entirely aware of her stance -- feet placed shoulder-width apart -- and how it left her wet and throbbing cunt on full display for Agatha to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Be patient, my queen," Rio cooed at her. In a move that she knew would draw protest from Agatha (and it did, in the form of a 'Wait! No!'), Rio tossed the dildo to the couch so that she could do something else with the now-free hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bracing herself on her forearm against the seat of the couch, her other hand began to wander. First landing on her thigh, Rio's hand surfed inward just as her feet shifted further apart, exposing her just
     <em>
      that much more
     </em>
     . When those fingers slipped between soaked folds, Rio's head dropped as she released a deep moan that carried right over that phone line.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh,
     <em>
      fuck,
     </em>
     " Agatha rasped back, her voice sounding a little closer that time.
    </p>
    <p>
     A content hum vibrated through pressed lips as Rio's fingertips explored her sex, feeling and pushing and pressing in nothing more than an elaborate display meant to make Agatha so fucking horny she couldn't stand it.
    </p>
    <p>
     So the only logical next step to take?
    </p>
    <p>
     Give Agatha what she wanted but physically could not have.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me what to do," Rio gasped, her fingertips pressing tauntingly at her own entrance. "Tell me how you want me fucked since you're not here to do it yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
     The strangled sounds that filtered out from the speaker almost made Rio want to laugh, but any humor that might have found her right then was impossibly overwhelmed by the immediate demand that Agatha barked through the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Inside. Show me how you like to be touched when it's my fingers inside of you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Jesus fucking Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't going to survive if
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     was how Agatha was going to be ordering her around. In fact, Rio surprised even herself when she complied with the demand and sunk her first two fingers into her own body -- a choked moan spilling from her lips in the process -- and she did not immediately orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmm, you like that, do you? Now show me how fast, princess." Agatha's voice was thick with her lust, but she was being very clear and somehow had managed to regain some form of control when it came to stamping down her own arousal long enough to enjoy the show.
    </p>
    <p>
     "N-Not too fast," Rio mewled, head finally dropping so low that her forehead landed on her arm as it braced her on the couch. "But... when you curl up like -- ohhh! FUCK! Mmm, curl up, like you're trying to do that thing you wanna d--
     <em>
      Goddddd --
     </em>
     wanna do. Do. But c-can't."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was honestly a feat of steel nerves to try and be the one to talk Agatha through fucking her when it was supposed to be the other way around, but Rio was somehow managing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When you orgasm the way you do? Not even worried about trying anymore," Agatha breathed back. There was a shuffling sound over the phone, as if she were moving around, but Rio was too soaked in her own pleasure to give it much thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Y-you mean... mmm, immediately?" Rio voiced back brokenly, her breath hitching between words. Her tone was light, but bore some foreign mixture of humor and pleasure that compelled her to offer a rebuttal.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And often," Agatha added. Rio could hear as she released another sigh, louder this time, before finding her words again. "So maybe -- Maybe try now. Why don't you cum for me, pretty girl? Let me see you feel good."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to,
     <em>
      God
     </em>
     she wanted to. She wanted to give Agatha everything she was asking of her and then some. So, with the addition of a third finger and a few rough thrusts, Rio found herself right at the edge. She was
     <em>
      so fucking close
     </em>
     , and the moment Agatha spoke again?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Show me what I get to come back to."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's fingers spread and flexed within her own body, causing her to cry out the very moment she felt every rippling vibration of her orgasm as it tore through each limb and caused her knees to buckle so badly that she lurched forward. A wild moan sprung from her lungs as panicked fingers immediately left her still-futtering cunt so that she could catch herself and prevent from embarrassingly smacking her face on the back of the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Good girl, Rio."
     </em>
     It wasn't soft, but it wasn't emotionless, either. Agatha's praise always felt good, but knowing that she was clearly satisfying needs for Agatha that she could not be present for, it felt even better.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to poke back, to ask Agatha if she liked the show, if it gave her what it was she was wanting, but her panting seemed to be preventing her from locating the correct words. Instead, Rio let out a low whine and reached for the phone, moving it so she could flop onto her back on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
     With it placed next to her head, Rio used one hand to swipe up the glass piece and allowed the other to lazily trace light lines up and down her torso. The longer she did so, the heavier Agatha's breathing became over the line. If Rio hadn't known any better, she would have said she could
     <em>
      hear
     </em>
     Agatha salivating, even more so when she found the strength to spread her legs, opening herself up yet again for Agatha to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This doesn't even have a zoom feature and I can see how fucking wet you are. Fuck," Agatha whined, trying to keep the absolute need out of her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it frustrating to be an ocean apart and want to fuck one another
     <em>
      so fucking badly?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, but... Rio still wanted to give what she could, and she knew Agatha would always be more than willing to accept. It was the very foundation for whatever it was they were trying to build and it was a dynamic that Rio was plenty happy to contribute to.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the end of the day, Rio had always been a giver. It just happened that when it came to Agatha, what she gave was a little different than was considered to be normal for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio gave Agatha was totality and no hesitation. Rio gave Agatha all there was to give, from her body to her intellect to her company. Agatha could have any of it or all of it, whatever it was she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, what Agatha wanted was for Rio to feel just as good as she might have if they were sharing space again, and Rio could give that to her to what extent she was capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her legs spread and her hands appropriately situated, Rio lowered the one holding the dildo, dragging the tip of it down the center of her stomach. She was being deliberate, tracing it over her stomach, her hips, even the tops of her thighs. It was a tease, of course, but it was also a stalling tactic to hopefully regain a bit of stamina.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was she weak for Agatha and the idea of what it was to be absolutely wrecked by her? Hands down, but it was also something she'd grown a bit self-conscious over. It wasn't something she would admit to, and it wasn't something she knew Agatha would shame her for, but Goddamn if she didn't want to enjoy the ride a little longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, the glass tip slipped between slick-soaked folds and skimmed over Rio's clit in the most delicious way, causing her to whimper at the sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck, Agatha," Rio managed, licking her lips as her eyes slid shut. She had her plans, but for the time being, she was still building her resolve. "Wish it was you."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a sentiment reminiscent of their very first romp around the sheets -- or armchair? -- but it was one that Rio meant even more in that very moment. She
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     it to be Agatha that was the one holding the instrument with which she could wreck every inch of Rio's body and soul. She
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     for Agatha to be the one kissing at her neck and squeezing her throat and fucking her until she forgot how to be a human being for a good ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she had to settle for the sound of Agatha's breathing as she fixated on the image of Rio dragging a glass dildo through her own slick, back and forth in the most tantalizing fashion. It was an okay form of substitute, but Rio already
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     nothing was going to be as good as the real thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Show me," Agatha commanded, tone low and husky. "Show me how badly you wish it was me."
    </p>
    <p>
     There were several spots in Rio's brain that lit up like a lightning-filled night sky as those words landed snugly in her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, she listened.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a slight adjustment of her legs, Rio pressed the glass tip against her entrance and then, a moment later, slipped it further in an inch at a time. Her hips were shifting, trying to accommodate more of the length, but the immediate stretch had all but knocked her senses loose, low rumbles of moans leaving her as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
     "God, Agatha," Rio whimpered, slowly beginning to work the dildo in a steady rhythm in and out of her body. Her head tipped back, but she realized immediately that it was a hinderance to those aforementioned plans she'd been cooking up. Somehow, Rio forced her eyes open and lifted her head just enough to look directly at the camera, as if she were staring right into Agatha's soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck, Rio, you look so good like that. Pussy so full and you moaning my name. God, I --
     <em>
      oh, fuck!
     </em>
     " Agatha's words were needy, they were tight and strangled, but Rio knew why.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew it was because as she laid there on that couch, fucking herself with a completely see-through dildo, Agatha was watching with intent and that intent was her own sexual release.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Guess. Fuck. Guess I'll have to --
     <em>
      ohhhhh!
     </em>
     Have to do m-more of it. When you're back." It was absolutely bratty to imply she hadn't been doing enough of it before, but Rio had realized that when she showed resistance and offered some form of push-back, Agatha
     <em>
      liked
     </em>
     it.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no immediate quip, not as Rio began to use a little more force to thrust the dildo into herself and her back arched in wanting. She was the one in weilding the weapon here, the one who got to decided just how wrecked she wanted to be and yet, all she could do was base it on what she wanted out of Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     Louder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had fallen quiet aside from her intermittent sighs, groans, and moans, but Rio knew she was getting out of it exactly what she had been hoping to find. She could tell, just by the frequency of which those sounds came that Agatha was close to getting herself right where she needed to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was a really fucking good thing, because Rio was too.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha," Rio gasped, hips canting again to try and garner the best angle for climax. "Agatha. I. I want you to cum. I want to hear you cum. Please, I need to." It was so fucking pathetic, the way Rio was begging for what she needed, but Agatha seemed to have no issue complying. It was almost as if she had simply been waiting for Rio to do just that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her begging worked far better than she had imagined it might.
    </p>
    <p>
     "
     <em>
      Ohhh, fuuuuuck,"
     </em>
     came Agatha's deep and guttural moan, just as she did. The moment the words dissolved on her tongue, nothing but choked gasps and grunts followed, but it was the exact symphony of sounds that Rio had been hoping to pull.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was exactly what
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     needed to be able to give Agatha what
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     wanted even more than her own satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     On an inward thrust, the tip of that glass dildo struck the exact right spot, the one that hurled Rio into a state of bliss that she had not been able to achieve on her own in some time. Orgasms were easy to come by, but that feeling like she had been completely and thoroughly fucked to the edge of existence? That wasn't typically a DIY thing for Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, it seemed that anything could change at any time, and she wasn't exactly upset about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her limbs trembled and shook as the pleasure washed through her, pulling her under into the most gratifying haze that she did not want to escape from. Her vocals were prevalent and loud, vibrant and full of every bit of ecstasy that flowed through her, but as the steady thrum between her legs began to lessen, so too did the volume of her cries and whimpers.
    </p>
    <p>
     For only a minute, Rio simply forced herself to breathe, to remind herself that it was a necessary function to maintain survival. And, if nothing else, Rio had to fucking survive to see Agatha come back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jesus Christ, Rio," Agatha breathed into the phone, the wonder prevalent in her tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nah, just Rio," she responded in a huff, a soft giggle slipping from her a second later as her head turned to the side, leaving her lips a little closer to the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There is no 'just' to you to be found, that's for damn sure." Agatha still sounded like she was recovering, her voice still low and rich, but she also sounded like she had found herself in a haze of her own, one that offered a comfort she couldn't have for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the middle of concocting some witty retort, Rio's thoughts were disrupted by another soft hiss from Agatha, one that found form.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Shit."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "What is it?" she asked back, raising a heavy limp to snatch the phone up, as if it would have offered any answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've got to be twenty minutes away for a meeting... That starts in twenty minutes. Fuck." Every bit of that pleasure that had been dripping from Agatha's words was suddenly gone and the weight of the world had come crashing back down around them.  For Rio, it was a nice way to close out her day, but for Agatha? Hers was only just beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then maybe you should clean up and go be a big girl," Rio teased softly, the pleasant fog in her brain keeping her voice low and husky.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Unfortunately, I must. But, if you feel up to going another round, please feel free. I can always pull the video up later." That statement alone caused Rio to grin, and then laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha had called
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     the ferally horny one?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Otherwise, I do hope that you have a good rest of your evening."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a common phrase, but Rio could hear that Agatha meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have a good day, Agatha. I'll talk to you soon."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't return the sentiment, perhaps feeling it a bit too soft for the fact that she had just watched Rio fuck herself to two orgasms from thousands of miles away, but she did still find it in her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sleep well, Rio."
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, the call ended and Rio was left staring up at the black screen, wishing that the woman on the other end of it wasn't so fucking far away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe what they had engaged in could have been called purely sexual, a way for them to each get off and both start and end their days appropriately, but as Rio dropped the phone to her chest, on the ceiling, she could think only one thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She
     <em>
      hated
     </em>
     just how much she wanted Agatha to come back.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hated it even more because she realized
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     she wanted Agatha to come back.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time in her life, when Rio was in Agatha's presence, she finally didn't feel so fucking alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she curled up in that massive bed that evening, she realized the most terrifying part about that realization was knowing -- as she had known all along -- that it was all just... temporary.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Temporary, temporary, temporary.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     All Rio could do was tell it to herself again and again until finally, she drifted off to sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
     When Rio's alarm blared Thursday morning from its spot on the nightstand, the last thing she wanted to do was get up and go to work. She wanted to lay around in bed, Phineas taking up immediate space against some part of her body. She wanted to swim, to make coffee in her underwear now that she knew Agatha was watching.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, like the dutiful employee she knew she would always be, Rio peeled herself from bed, showered and readied herself for the day. With a brief kiss to Phin's head as he sat on the arm of the sectional, she bid him a good day, checked that she had everything she needed, and departed through the elevator doors.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the way down, Rio found herself thinking about something she needed to
     <em>
      stop
     </em>
     thinking about before she got to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     She needed to find a way to push the night before out of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Placing herself on a endless running wheel of those thoughts would lend nothing useful to her work day and would instead only dig the hole deeper, the one she was trying to stay out of where she admitted that she missed Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had told Agatha that she would miss her before she left, yes. While she had not been lying when she delivered the sentiment, Rio instead came to question if she had ever truly known what it was like to miss someone.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was something said with ease whenever distance was instilled, but being apart from Agatha felt different from being away from her dad, or her cousins, or even a partner in the past -- which, she reminded herself, not exactly comparable.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was because Agatha challenged her. She gave Rio a reason to look inward, to question her own motives and rationale for the things she did. More than that, Agatha shoved it right in her face: the stone cold fact that every single human being was capable of change. Every person on the planet could do it, could be something different in both the best and worst ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a choice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha always made choices, much in the way she gave Rio the availability to do so, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     For those first few weeks, Rio had made an assumption. It was a dangerous assumption, and it was one she had held onto for a little too long.
    </p>
    <p>
     In those days, Rio had been almost
     <em>
      convinced
     </em>
     that Agatha was a sociopath. It was clear that her morality was grey, she cared little for consequences, and was a woman who kept a small circle, if she kept one at all. She appeared to have had a flagrant disregard for human life, but that had just been another assumption, one that she had corrected for Rio with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cared perhaps
     <em>
      too much
     </em>
     about life in that she was willing to take one to save many. Rio wasn't one to be the morality police, as she had an in-depth understanding of what morals should actually look like, and so as long as Agatha kept to her guidelines Rio would never feel as though there were ever a need for intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite her pre-work spiral, through the course of seven bodies and a lunch from the deli a few blocks over, Rio had managed to get through the day without completely fixating on the fact that Agatha was still gone and she was still taking up space in Agatha's home in her absence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice had been chipper and full of piss an vinegar after her several nights in a row of fucking wild with the county clerk she'd befriended, which was a tidbit of information she'd witheld until the very end of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, so..." Rio said, exchanging her white coat for a light jacket as they were preparing to leave, "
     <em>
      that's
     </em>
     why you've been a complete monster with your sarcasm and quippy jabs today?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was grinning again as she pulled her own leather jacket on, zipping it up halfway. "I mean, I already told you about her. Did you forget?"
    </p>
    <p>
     With a shrug and a grin of her own, Rio reached for the switches on the wall to cut off the light to her little corner of the building. "I mean, I kinda remember, but... I didn't realize you guys were suddenly going at it like rabbits. But... good for you." Rio's lips pursed as she gave a curt but sure nod of her head in approval.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, good. 'Cause if you were about to give me shit, we were set to wrestle in the parking lot," Alice returned knowingly, brows arching in spite of the smirk she was wearing. "How's that going by the way?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more, all Rio could really do was simply shrug. Well, she could also lie. That was exactly what she was going to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     "She's out of the country for the next couple of weeks. So... I guess I'll let you know when she comes back."
    </p>
    <p>
     The queen of underselling? Maybe, but it was the best lie she could fudge without actually drawing any more of Alice's suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they crossed out into the evening air, Alice turned to look at her and even though she was still wearing a smile that said she was giddy to eventually get more information about whatever their trainwreck was, it was notably softer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you need company or to just go out and do things, you know you can text. Maybe tomorrow night I can bring pizza and beer and we can rent bad B movies."
    </p>
    <p>
     It truly was sweet that Alice was so genuinely heartfelt and caring at almost any given moment, but in that one, it made Rio feel a little guilty over knowing that she had to be evasive.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I was thinking about driving out to spend the weekend in Peoria, so I can go see my aunt and just make sure she's doing alright. Just.. get out of the city for a bit, maybe." It was a bold faced lie, but it was also proof that Rio was getting better at fabricating the truth solely for the benefit of not making things harder on herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     They reached the point in the parking lot that demanded they go their separate ways, but Alice wasn't quite finished being sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you change your mind, just text me. We'll find something to do that's exhilirating but won't get us arrested." As she turned to face Rio, she was grinning again, so wide it wrinkled the corners of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You got it, captain," Rio returned with a mock salute and a smile that sparkled like her eyes. "Have a good night, Alice. See you in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You too, Rio. Call if you need anything."
    </p>
    <p>
     With one last exchange of waves, they departed to their own cars to set about their evenings. The moment Rio was safely inside of hers, she pulled the burner out and a bright grin filled her face immediately. Same as the day before, there was a message from Agatha awaiting the end of Rio's shift.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, it had only arrived ten minutes before Rio looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm up early this morning and don't have anywhere to be until eleven (so in 5 hours). If you're bored, feel free to call. Or rub one out on the couch again. Though, I'd expect both if that were the case. Drive safely."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was rather amusing, just how cut and dry Agatha's messages were, even with the dash of personality thrown in. What was even funnier was that it was an entirely accurate depiction of how she could have conveyed the same message in person. It was just who she was, and it was one of Rio's favorite things about her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't soften, not much, at least not outwardly. And inwardly? Well, Rio was choosing to blatantly ignore the massive steps Agatha was taking when it came to showing more and more of who she truly was beneath the alias, the luxury life, the murder. It wasn't that Rio didn't
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to know, but more so that if she let herself see it for more than Agatha wanting to step out of her comfort zone for selfish reasons, she was going to find more feelings than she could cope with.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been a year since her last relationship and while it had been an okay relationship, Rio hadn't ever actually been happy the way she should have. The sex was great and the woman had a tattoo of a realistic looking plague doctor on her right shoulder blade; it was one of Rio's favorite things to look at when she was fucking the woman from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, things that were spectacular in one fashion did not typically show such excellence in others. The first few months had been easy, that typical honeymoon phase of dating, but the more they tried to make things work, the more they realized that they were simply incompatible. It wasn't anyone's fault and Rio held no I'll will, but ultimately, the other woman just wanted to stay the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, Rio realized, Agatha's willingness to change for seemingly no reason was drawing her in, but in the most dangerous way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if she seemed surly as all hell in her text messages.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Will do, boss. The drive safely and calling you when I get there. The other thing can wait a day or two. Gotta make you really want it, you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
     With the smallest smirk, Rio sent the message and dropped the phone in the cupholder so that she could return to the condo, making a quick stop at the corner store for a six pack of beer. After returning, she stowed the beer and glanced at the camera, giving it a cheeky smile and a waggle of her fingers as she glided her way to the bedroom to shower and chance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Simultaneously, she was hopefully sending a silent message that for the time being, all she wanted was just to exist in the couple of hours Agatha might be able to give her of her time. The night before had been fun and Rio absolutely had every intention of letting something similar happen again, but Rio was of the opinion that an hour or so long conversation with Agatha -- even if all she did was talk about the intricacies of needing to be halfway around the world for purposes far too intellectual for her to understand -- could serve her well.
    </p>
    <p>
     What that actually meant, in Layman's terms, was that fucking off and co-op masturbating through a fucking security camera was an undeniable thrill. That was absolutely true. But... Rio was lonely and yearned for the following Sunday (still stupidly over a week away) when Agatha strode into that condo and hopefully fucked her on every single surface available in that condo.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, maybe, if Rio was lucky, Agatha might let her lay close again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't think Agatha would be so willing to let herself be held again, but at the very least, she might not mind it if Rio curled up against her and just listened to the sound of her heartbeat as she fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those thoughts were the ones that occupied her the most as she washed off in the shower and dressed herself in only a tank top and pair of boyshort underwear that could have doubled as really skimpy shorts. As she pulled them up to rest on her hips, a familiar face appeared through the bedroom to greet her loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Maow!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Phineas was funny that way; he didn't
     <em>
      meow.
     </em>
     No, it was much more assertive than that, as if he were shouting at anyone who would listen. He was present and vocal in the most adorable way, even when he was demanding to be fed as he was in that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, hello, mister. Where were you hiding when I got here?" she cooed at him, squatting down to give him a rigorous petting.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Mrrp, maow!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright, alright. I will gladly feed you. Come on."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood again and led him toward the kitchen, making haste in serving him up the cold and slimy concoction of turkey and gravy he loved oh so much. In the middle of setting the bowl in its spot on the floor, the ringing of the burner phone sounded from the counter above her.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a soft chuckle, Rio righted herself and swiped the phone up and answered it at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Didn't wanna wait for me to call you, huh?" Rio teased immediately upon connecting.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I mean. Yes. I could have waited. But I thought you deserved to be told that your ass looks really cute in those underwear," Agatha informed her matter-of-factly, as if she were the aficionado on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, is that so?" Rio replied, spinning on her heel to grin up at the camera in the corner of the dining area. "Well, thank you for the reminder, but it does beg the question... Just how many fucking cameras do you have in here?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was laughing as she asked it, but she already knew the answer; Agatha had told her they were in every room, she just hadn't gone hunting for them enough to actually verify.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Enough to know when a maid decides to steal from me," Agatha answered honestly and although Rio couldn't see her, she still knew that Agatha shrugged when providing her response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And how many times has that happened?" came Rio's response as she tore her eyes from the camera to open the refrigerator for one of her previously purchased beers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Two. I wrote them a each a twenty thousand dollar check and told them if they needed the help, they could have just asked."
    </p>
    <p>
     On her way to the living room, Rio actually stopped in her tracks at that answer, just blinking at the empty room in front of her. It was only because she simply hadn't been expecting it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who killed unworthy men; Agatha, who took matters into her own hands; Agatha, who wore an air of indifference around her like it was the most comfortable thing in the world; Agatha, who would have said she hated the world and mostly meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     Agatha had caught someone taking from her without permission, understood the motivation, and instead of calling the police (which, understandable) or making their lives hell, had instead given them far more than what they would have gotten from whatever it was they were trying to take, and let them go on about their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     Agatha chose to do the just thing instead of the lawful one, not only because she had a very firm grasp on what it meant to disregard the legal system, but because it was what needed to be done, the right course of action to be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You are... something else. You know that, right?" Rio posed as she unceremoniously plopped down on the couch. Pinning the phone to her ear with her shoulder, she was able to crack her beer open and take a sizeable swig of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course I do. But at least I'm a good lay?" Agatha offered by means of consolation, like she needed to offer it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Good' might be underselling it, my
     <em>
      queen
     </em>
     " Rio drawled, grinning before she took another draw from the can. Setting it down, she also lowered the phone and threw it on speaker before letting it rest on her shoulder so she could hear Agatha clearly. While she turned her attention the throwing something muted on the television as a way to keep herself from looking toward the camera and giving into temptation, Rio could hear Agatha humming softly on the other end of the line.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, I'm sorry, am I boring you?" came a pointed question, though Rio's laughter followed it immediately to indicated she was not at all being serious.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, sorry. Trying to multi-task; I'm also doing some model revisions at the same time. But still able to talk and think about how your eyes roll back into your head when I fuck you just right." There was far too much nonchalance in Agatha's tone for Rio's liking, but it was more of an annoyance than it was an actual distaste.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Rio was simply annoyed that Agatha could say those things without a single quake in her voice and start an uncontrollable heat to form right between Rio's legs. But, Rio reminded herself, that wasn't what this was about. They had gone days between entanglements before, and this would be no different other than a few extra days thrown in.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No show for you tonight," Rio reminded in a playful admonishment that caused Agatha to whine her disapproval, even if Rio didn't buy that she was actually upset for even a second.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's fine," came an immediate dismissal, and then an alternative. "I'll just go back and look at the footage of you bent over in the kitchen. It gave me ideas. Should work well enough." Agatha sounded so sure about it, something Rio quickly understood was Agatha's way of putting her at ease over her refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had the choice to say no, and she had. She had also asserted it again and Agatha seemed to catch the hint that it was a decision Rio did not wish to waver on.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was respect. It was something she knew Agatha had always given her, but the moment she diverted the subject to something else, Rio knew that the matter was sealed shut and would not be revisited a third time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you know that in total, to deliver a three foot by three foot coolant vent to outer space, it costs over eighty million dollars?" she asked aloud, as if she thought Rio might say yes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I do now," she shot back with a light laugh. She leaned forward to retrieve her beer, but instead of taking a drink and returning it to the table, she chose to lean back, letting it idle in her hand instead. "Thanks for my daily piece of knowledge. Even if I will never have any use for it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Glad to be of service."
    </p>
    <p>
     They chatted back and forth for a few minutes about Agatha's schedule and the several meetings she had the following week, but inevitably, Agatha had turned the conversation to Rio once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have you done anything else since I've been gone, or have you just holed up there?" Agatha asked it like she didn't already know the answer, but Rio was smarter than that.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, I know you well enough to know that you have watched as I leave for work, come back, drink beer and go to sleep. Of course I haven't done anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not even popped by the pier for a trip down memory lane?"
    </p>
    <p>
     At that, Rio laughed. It wasn't that she was laughing
     <em>
      at
     </em>
     Agatha, but merely at the idea, and she explained as much.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It hasn't even been a week. And while we had an overall good time, there were a couple of things that I don't really want to spend time thinking about," she informed plainly. Well, that was sort of a lie; there was really only one part of that night she didn't want to think about. The other instance was something she
     <em>
      chose
     </em>
     not to think about because of the implications it held.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Still think you should have let me, y'know,
     <em>
      crrrrrrrk,"
     </em>
     Agatha mused, surely cocking her head like she was trying to break her own neck on the other end of the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know you do, but when you get emotional, you could get sloppy. And that would be a little unbecoming for someone of your status. And we couldn't have that, especially not over me."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I think it'd be justified, you know, being the dutiful
     <em>
      girlfriend
     </em>
     you told him I was."
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the sentence left Agatha's lips and traveled thousands of miles over that phone line, Rio's heart ceased beating in her chest, if only for several seconds before it hammered back to life. As it did, it nearly leapt right into the center of her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was hot again, but unlike the night before, this embarrassment ran much deeper and felt a little more humiliating.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You heard that, did you?" Rio grumbled, lifting her beer to down half of what was left.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That I did," Agatha answered, though the tone of superiority Rio expected to hear was strangely not there.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a soft sigh, Rio downed the rest of the beer and discarded the can to the coffee table before attempting her apology tour.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm sorry. I just... Panicked and wanted him to leave me alone. I thought if I said it, he'd catch the hint and just fuck --"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was firm, but it wasn't a demand. No, the softer way in which her name left Agatha's lips was something... foreign. It was so foreign that Rio didn't immediately know what to call it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cut herself off, but did not vocally prompt Agatha to continue. The obvious implication of Agatha using her name had been to stop her from speaking, from rambling on and on about how she was sorry for doing something that she knew she shouldn't have but did anyway. So, Rio kept quiet to give her the room to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that what you want out of life? A girlfriend?" What Agatha was really asking in fewer words was simply:
     <em>
      Is that what you want out of me? To be your girlfriend?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, the word had always felt a little odd to Rio to be using in her thirties, but the word 'partner' made her actually want to gag. She didn't want to skip around town shouting that she was dating a pretty woman, or that someone had seen something they liked in her enough to commit.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, what Rio wanted was to belong. Somewhere. To someone. It didn't really matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was quiet for perhaps a little too long as she tried to search for the words she needed the most, but it felt more than tricky. She had to say the exact right thing or she was sure she was going to be met by security at the elevator doors to have her escorted off the premises the moment Agatha hung up on her and called them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio?" Agatha asked, that same soft tone laying warmly over a name Rio had heard in too many voices to count.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorry," Rio apologized, chewing on her lip as she stared directly at the television, too embarrassed at that point to look at the camera in the corning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's okay, we can talk about --"
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, Agatha. It's okay. I just..." Rio's lips pressed firmly together, teeth digging on the insides of them as she tried to stall just a little longer to say this the way it needed to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am fully aware that you do not do labels, and that relationships are not... feasible for you. But..." Rio paused again, drawing in a slow and even breath to help slow her wildly thudding heard. "But what I do know is that I want to be yours. It doesn't have to have a name, and it doesn't have to last any longer than you want it to, but for now... For now, that's what I want."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a quiet declaration, but Rio had turned her head just enough that the softness in her own words was picked up by the phone on her shoulder. She knew she could have tried to explain it better, or attempted to search for any and all outs that she could possibly provide to Agatha, but what was the point? Why try to make it worse for herself solely to make things easier on Agatha?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio owed her nothing and yet stupidly, she wanted to give her anything and everything she ever could have asked for. Agatha was a woman of many wants, but from Rio, she would
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     be able to take. It might not always be what it was she was looking for, but Rio knew, especially having that conversation, that if Agatha asked anything of her, she would always try her hardest to accommodate any feasible request.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because, Rio realized, for all the time she had spent trying to convince herself that this fling between them was nothing more, she also realized that maybe Agatha had been doing the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearly, as she'd been hung up on their evening at the pier and the uninvited interruption to their night.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha finally spoke, having digested every bit of meaning and context to what Rio had just told her, it genuinely surprised Rio and also made that familiar heat kick up again between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah. I like it when you're mine."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the silliest thing, the tiniest thought that Agatha had formed into sound waves that carried over the distance between them and yet, it meant every single fucking thing in the world to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha liked it when Rio was hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hers.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     While Rio was not typically the type to succumb to a possessive personality, she knew that whatever it was Agatha was implying was not ownership or claim in the sense that she was stripping Rio of any autonomy. No, the claim she wanted was the comfort of knowing that wherever she went, whatever she did, it was Rio that would be waiting for her to come back. Maybe it had already been true in the physical sense, but Rio also felt like there might have been some shred of relief to be had by the both of them over finally having a mutually shared understanding of what they were doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't going to last forever. It didn't have to have a name.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio wanted to be Agatha's, and Agatha wanted Rio to be hers. It was the simplest form of the most sensical equation and now, Rio finally had her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of all the things she had
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to know since meeting Agatha, the answer to that one question had not been one of them. She hadn't been ready to have her theories proven and her fears realized.
    </p>
    <p>
     For every single time she had told herself that Agatha would break off the moment she was ready, it almost stunned Rio to realize that she might have been very, very wrong to make those assumptions. It should have been obvious in the weekend long rendezvous they'd shared, in the invitation Agatha had extended, and in the smaller things like purchased items and the accommodation she had made in allowing Phineas in her home, but Rio had been too quick to write them off before. She had been too willing to dismiss the idea that Agatha could ever want... more.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as she knew, Agatha took what she wanted, and right then, she was making it clear that she wanted Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe there would never be a day when Agatha would admit to being capable of those deep, rich feelings like romance or true emotional connection, but for now, Agatha was copping to far more than Rio ever truly thought she'd have. That was something she could find peace in, and it was also something that offered her the sliver of comfort she needed to make it through the next week or so.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Me too," Rio responded softly. It took a beat, but she felt the need for recovery; they had softened enough that she was certain Agatha might begin to ruminate if Rio did not provide her mind another avenue to travel down. "So maybe you'll have to show me when you get back just what that means."
    </p>
    <p>
     That time, there was a thickness in the sound of her voice, an intentional layer of lust that coated every word.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't think for a second I won't. And that is both a threat and a promise."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oooh, you've got me shaking in my skivvies," Rio teased back, gaze finally lifting to the camera as a pompous smirk curled her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "More like pounding in your pussy," Agatha snorted in return before falling prey to a bout of laughter she could clearly not control.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, well," Rio offered with a light giggle of her own, "Imagine if I tried keep from orgasming until you got back."
    </p>
    <p>
     "First off, don't put Alice through that misery. Second, if you tried to do that, you'd cum the moment we lock eyes from across the room. While it would be a massive ego boost, I want to at least touch you before that happens."
    </p>
    <p>
     While it wasn't the most alluring conversation, Agatha was still finding a way to tie Rio into knots over the fact that she would have sold her soul just to feel Agatha's hand on her body right then. But, she had to be patient.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had to be, as Agatha liked to call her,
     <em>
      a good girl.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't need to be even easier, do I?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Their laughter together felt like the sweetest song, the most delightful melody that Rio had never wanted to let herself like as much as she did right then.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could have tried to stop it, could have tried to rein in her feelings, but for the time being it seemed as though they were alright to wander around the pen, still contained but with a little more freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
     They talked for another thirty minutes about the weather, about some of the cases Rio had seen that day. They talked about the culture where Agatha was and what she was doing to fill her down time. Finally, though, the time had come for Agatha to set about preparing for her day.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You just want to go shower so you can fuck yourself," Rio jeered playfully, her smile growing despite not looking at the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's not a crime," Agatha retorted, drawing yet another full laugh from Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go, shower. Have a good day, Agatha. I'll talk to you tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Goodnight, Rio. Talk tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio hung up the phone, she was still grinning and fully aware that Agatha could see it. She didn't care. She was happy, and it was a direct result of Agatha's choices, the decisions she was willingly making.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't
     <em>
      need
     </em>
     to get up and relocate to the bedroom, but as she did so with Phin at her heels, it was for only one reason.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio reached the edge of the bed, she flung herself onto it and immediately buried her face into the pillow. Using it to muffle a sound she was sure no one else would have heard anyway, she squealed as long as she could and then rolled to her back, that same grin still stuck to her face as if it had no intention of leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could it? She was happy.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was
     <em>
      Agatha's
     </em>
     and she was
     <em>
      happy.
     </em>

    <p>
     By the time Rio woke up Saturday morning, the weight of her aloneness had finally settled heavy in her bones. She had talked to Agatha the night before until she fell asleep, letting her ramble on about work things until she simply hadn't be able to listen anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been a little embarrassing, but Rio had asked her outright.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm going to lay down, but... since it's Saturday and you're not leaving any time soon... Do you think we could just stay on the phone? If you're not busy I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment it left her, Rio felt like an idiot. She felt like a needy teenager whose crush was finally paying attention to them for the first time. But that wasn't the case, was it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had always been paying attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even before they ever actually had a legitimate conversation, Agatha had taken to watching Rio the way Rio had been eyeing her the entire time. It had been a pre-game before they actually started the mental chess match they'd been playing, a way to read the opposition and attempt to deduce which way they might move.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, they had reached an understanding that instead of attempting to outmaneuver one another, they could move
     <em>
      together
     </em>
     and dominate the entire board.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was still tricky to navigate, but Rio was loosening her hold on the idea that Agatha might bolt, given the right reason.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll throw my AirPod in, as long as you don't mind listening to me bitch about work."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha called it 'bitching,' but Rio quite liked the little tangents she went on when trying to work her way out of an unexpected hole. She used words Rio knew but did not understand, and her irritation waxed and waned only a couple of times before Rio finally dozed off.
    </p>
    <p>
     That morning, she awoke to a text.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've gone to dinner with some colleagues, but I should be up a bit later tonight if you would prefer company for a little while."
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, there was another below it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you know you talk in your sleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
     That one made Rio pale about six shades.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh god
     </em>
     . She did!?
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to ask, to just type a message back of 'what the fuck did I say?!' but instead, Rio just rolled to her back, arm flopping out onto the bed with the phone still clutched in her hand. The very tips of her knuckles graced soft fur and an irritated rumbling sounded from Phineas.
    </p>
    <p>
     In his new spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     On Agatha's side of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Phin, dude, what the fuck did I say last night?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The only answer Phineas provided was a relocation from where he had been to curl against Rio's side with the quietest little chirp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, if he wasn't going to tell her, she supposed if she really wanted to know, she had to ask the only other witness.
    </p>
    <p>
     The message she typed went through about six variations before she finally settled on one, pressing send before she could overthink it again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What did I say?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Awaiting a response, Rio busied herself with stroking Phin's fur and scrolling through Reddit for anything interesting. Before she found anything, Agatha texted back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You said 'but I like the green marbles,' and 'I think the cat ate all of the cheese.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio read it, she burst into laughter. There she was, worried that she had professed her undying love to Agatha and really, she was talking about green marbles and missing cheese. As weird as it was, she wasn't all that upset. In fact, it was pretty fucking funny.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still smiling to herself, Rio typed back a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, at least I didn't give up my SSN or bank PIN."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was fucking
     <em>
      quick
     </em>
     with her return.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean ending in 9866? Who keeps their social security card in their wallet? And not even in the pocket where it won't fall out and land on someone's bathroom floor?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Well,
     <em>
      shit.
     </em>
     Agatha was feeling feisty as fuck on that fine Saturday, wasn't she?
    </p>
    <p>
     "My,  my. Someone's feeling... sassy? Oh! Wait! Are you drinking right now?! Are you still at dinner?!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's smile had amplified into a grin, knowing she had hit the nail directly on the head. Confirmation -- and inflation of her own ego for being able to clock it -- came only a moment later when Agatha sent another message.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dinner ended 40 minutes ago. I'm on the patio sharing a bottle of Kaoliang with Gina while we spend half the time on our phones. But the weather isn't miserable?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Admittedly, Rio had no fucking clue what Kaoliang was. So, she threw it in to trusty Google search bar and had her answer within seconds. Taiwanese Liquor. Well, shit. Agatha was having one hell of a Saturday night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Good for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's what? 8pm there?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was more of a request for clarification; Rio was honestly still half-asleep, but she had not been able to procrastinate when it came to responding to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Almost 8:30, but yes. So... Why are you awake at 7am on a Saturday morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
     That was a fair question; Rio usually slept in to a normal hour of 9 or 10 on the weekends, but truthfully, her sleep had been off a bit the last week or so. It wasn't anyone's fault, but she woke up and while she knew she'd slept, it still felt as though she'd run a marathon through the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know, actually. But it's okay. I'm sure I'll find something to do. Haven't utilized the pool yet, so might put that on the agenda. But you, go! Enjoy your night with your wild liquor and the company of a like mind. I will talk to you in your morning."
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha had one last message to offer, there was something deep within Rio's chest -- a part of her long since frozen over -- that warmed even the tiniest bit.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not the likeness I'd prefer, but I suppose I'm in no position to refute what little I have available."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, so when Agatha was actually drunk drunk, she started waxing philosophical? Both adorable and good to know. Before Rio could get a dig in about it, another message rolled in.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do something fun today. If you don't want to drive, you can text Francisco and he will happily take you wherever you'd like. His number is 312-798-1180. Seriously, go get shitfaced with Alice or something. You've got a DD now. I'll check in when I wake up tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was sweet, too fucking sweet. Not only was it encouraging, but Rio could feel the emotion behind the text. Clearly she had been resigning herself to taking up space in the condo, but they both knew that it wasn't because she was taking her house sitting duties too seriously. It was because she just... needed the time to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then there was Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't ready to spill every single bean to Alice, which was probably why she was going to her go through her weekend thinking that Rio was hours away visiting family. Because Rio had lied. To her friend. It had been a harmless lie, one that had no real consequence, but dishonesty wasn't a common currency Rio liked to use.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, Rio still knew it was the right thing to do. She just needed the open air of not being perceived or judged for the decisions she was making, including practically living at Agatha's very expensive condo above the city for two weeks. She had thought she was finding it by secluding herself, but something else was happening, especially since Thursday night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had started to actually let herself miss Agatha. She had told Agatha it would happen, and it had been to prepare them both, but Rio had realized that there was no amount of preparation she could have done that would have made it any easier to digest.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, Rio fired off one last text to bid Agatha a good rest of her night.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll give it some consideration. Enjoy your kaoliang (yes, I definitely copied and pasted it) and your company. Sleep well."
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Rio would have been fine with leaving it at that, there was another message that came in a couple of minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will. Also, there will be another grocery delivery at 11am tomorrow. I ordered Phineas some treats this time. He's funny to watch when you're at work and he deserves a snack for the entertainment. Night, Rio."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was funny, reading the word 'night' as a closure to a conversation when it was not even eight in the morning, but it was just one more thing that put a smile on Rio's face. It was a smile she found herself wearing for most of the morning as she showered and made herself a breakfast of eggs and chorizo that she'd found in the refrigerator. After grilling up a few tortillas, she gathered her bounty and turned to her three placement options.
    </p>
    <p>
     Living room was already out. She didn't like the idea of eating in Agatha's living room, even if she consistently ate in her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, that left two.
    </p>
    <p>
     The table or the island.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thinking it brave, Rio chose the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three bites in, she picked her things up and relocated to one of the stools perched at the edge of the black marble island countertop so that she could resume her meal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio left the table because she hated it. She hated how big it was, how empty it was. She hated that it was meant for so many and yet, Agatha confessed to occupying it alone. Rio had wanted to ask her a few times when the last time anyone else had sat at it was, but she was considerate enough to understand that it might touch a nerve to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept it for a reason. Rio might never understand the reason, but what she
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     understand was that there was one and that was all that mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was who Agatha was, she was realizing. She was someone with rationale, someone who could provide motivations for almost every single fucking thing she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was intentional. She made her decisions not based on the moment or a feeling, but because they were things that got considered, things that had some form of meaning, one way or another.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made Rio think about the story Agatha had told her about the cameras and the two maids she had fired. She would have had every reason to be angry, to lash out for what they had done. But... Agatha was not spiteful for the wrong reasons, nor did she wish to unjustly punish someone for a minor crime of simply being needy. She could have berated them, claimed she paid them enough for them to steal from her, but Rio sensed that wasn't how that particular conversation had gone down.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Agatha chose to help. Because in her eyes, that was what she was doing. She
     <em>
      helped
     </em>
     by having an expansive and thorough career where she invested her intellect into literal space travel. She
     <em>
      helped
     </em>
     by eliminating threats because no one else could or would. She
     <em>
      helped
     </em>
     by showing compassion to those worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio understood finally that Agatha seemed to think her worthy.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't know it, but that would make itself clear by the end of her day.
    </p>
    <p>
     After her breakfast, Rio had done... not much at all. She considered going for a swim, but then talked herself out of it by saying she could do it another time, that she just didn't feel like it. The truth was that she simply didn't have the energy. It was this mild sense of lethargy that had taken her over, something she hadn't been able to fight off despite her best efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio considered the cause?
    </p>
    <p>
     General work stress and her inability to get a good night's sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     The actual cause?
    </p>
    <p>
     Her inability to get a good night's sleep, yes, but also her inability to truly rest even in those quieter moments. Her mind was churning constantly, a spin cycle of the same fifty thoughts over and over again. Not all of it was bad, and most of it wasn't, but it had been some time since Rio had truly put herself in a position to emotionally invest into another person. Choosing to do so with Agatha, in whatever capacity, felt like a risk she knew she shouldn't take.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, as had rung true until those moments, Rio would continue to risk it every single time when it came to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because even if Agatha herself didn't see it, Rio saw in her every single reason it was worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she carried on about her day, getting a three word text around two in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Goodngiht. I'm sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
     So, apparently Agatha had polished off that bottle after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought of a very drunk Agatha spilling into some ritzy hotel in another country to land face-first in bed kept Rio amused, despite her outward appearance of not doing much at all. It was just television or movies, petting Phin, eating snacks. It wasn't like her to be so idle and yet, the stillness seemed to offer some form of gentle respite from the relentless overworking her mind had been doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of letting herself anxiously twist over the endless possibilities, she chose to exist in what she had. It was peaceful, and it was quiet, even if it was lonely. By 6pm that night, however, it appeared as though her stillness had not gone unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the phone began to ring, Rio scooped it up and answered immediately as a warm smile found her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, ma'am, why are
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     up at seven in the morning on a Sunday?" Rio poked gently, trying not to let herself get lost in the idea that the very first thing Agatha had done when she woke up was call her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha responded, it was after a yawn and her voice still sounded soaked with sleep. "V'been up since five. Had three cups of coffee. I might actually still be a little drunk." She maintained that tightly bound demeanor, even half-asleep but simultaneously caffeinated and hungover but simultaneously still drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what's kept you from going back to sleep?" Rio asked through a light tone. It was meant to both care and tease, but Agatha's silence made a strange twisting happen somewhere in Rio's chest when it followed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio almost asked if she had fallen asleep, but Agatha finally broke through, her soft voice landing right in Rio's ear as it passed through the earpiece of the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You. And how I know you'll say nothing's wrong, but... I know you won't leave tonight. I know you won't text Alice, or go to a bar. So..." Agatha paused and cleared her throat, though she was quiet a moment longer as she took a drink of her coffee. "I think you should invite her over."
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though Rio was deathly aware that Agatha was being serious, it did not hinder the knee-jerk reaction she had to what Agatha had just said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was boisterous and amused, loud and clearly entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, Rio realized, she was laughing alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha really meant it. She truly wanted Rio to call her best friend, bring her over, and spend time with her in
     <em>
      Agatha's home.
     </em>
     Rio realized that the reason it had struck her to laugh was because the idea that Agatha was making yet another concession for her
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     made her feel mildly guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, that's... No, you don't have to do that." Rio was trying to be reasonable, trying to get Agatha to see that she did not have to keep offering things that she wouldn't otherwise offer to anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio didn't see it: Agatha would
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     have made those choices for anyone else, because anyone else could never be who Rio was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're right. I don't. But I'm offering anyway because I have thought a lot about what you've had to keep from her and... She's your best friend. I know we are both of the understanding that you cannot tell her every single thing... But you shouldn't have to hide
     <em>
      everything."
     </em>
     Rio had once assumed that Agatha did not actually understand human connection and relationships in a way that would lend positively to her wanting those things, but it was just that; an assumption.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearly, Agatha
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     understand those things, but in a way that made her wary of attaining them for herself. She understood the complexities of trust and loyalty, the way they bonded people in even a platonic manner.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I guess the point here is that I'm not trying to isolate you from your life. I don't want you to think that in keeping my secrets, you have to shut out what you already had. So... keep a few less and take Alice for a swim." Agatha paused, humming in thought for just a moment before she continued. "And I don't mind if you'd prefer to watch movies in the bedroom, but I do ask that she sleep in the spare room."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was trying to keep up, to process the things Agatha was saying and the metaphorical volume that she was choosing to broadcast her message. Agatha was handing her freedom that she didn't necessarily need but could benefit from, but she was still being overt about her boundaries. Maybe she saw that Rio had zero attraction to Alice and vice-versa, but there was still a line of respect that she wanted left uncrossed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could honor that with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You... You know I'm okay, right?" Rio asked in return, a tight conviction in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, Rio, I know you are just fine and dandy. But... a little company won't kill you. Plus, I wanna watch her reaction for my own entertainment value. So, call it selfish if it makes you quit pouting like that. Or not. Show me more of that lip I can't wait to bite." Somehow, Agatha maintained this careful balance of being genuine, being ornery, and being annoyingly sexy in a way that Rio knew she could never cut herself off from.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes lifted to the camera in the corner and she did just that, pushing her lip out that much more in taunting.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Really, though. Go get her. Enjoy the rest of your night with her, and tomorrow too. Fuck it, carpool Monday morning. Point being... Have fun, Rio. Stop hiding away and maybe take Phin with you to go get her. Let that boy feel the wind in his fur." The longer Agatha spoke, the more prevalent the laugher she was trying to bite back became. It was truly humored and light, a show that she knew how to poke fun and joke and yet still make it mean something.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, okay, you've convinced me."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I didn't doubt that I would."
    </p>
    <p>
     With a gentle but content sigh, Rio's eyes raised to the corner camera again. "I don't know if you're watching, but... Thank you. It's not a necessity, but the insistence is appreciated. I'll message you later, yeah?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please do. But if she passes out in the foyer, I might message you first." That time, Agatha didn't even try to temper her laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please do. Bye, Agatha. Talk to you later."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have a good evening, Rio."
    </p>
    <p>
     The call ended and yet, Rio still sat there and stared at that camera with the widest smile on her face. Agatha didn't need to open the doors of her home to someone who was essentially a stranger, but Rio had given her enough pieces to understand that Alice would always be more friend than foe. More than that, Agatha had verbally recognized that Alice was someone important to Rio, someone that Rio had been feeding a great deal of misinformation to solely to protect the Agatha behind the Amelia, and maybe to protect Amelia, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps Rio had severely underestimated two things: 1) Just
     <em>
      how much
     </em>
     Agatha paid attention, and 2) Just how much Agatha actually
     <em>
      cared.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was never going to show her attention in blatant or unnecessary hand holding or in snuggles on the couch, and that was okay. Rio had never really thought that she would. What Agatha
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     going to do was make informed decisions that provided a benefit to Rio, if not to both of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that very fact in mind, Rio dressed herself and put Phin's harness on so they could descend to the parking garage. Once situated in the car, Rio pulled her phone out -- her
     <em>
      actual
     </em>
     phone -- and typed a message to Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Didn't go to Peoria. Coming to get you if you're home. I have to stop at my place first to grab something, but that only buys you an extra fifteen minutes. Oh, and bring a bathing suit."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned and dropped her phone into the cupholder, setting off to her first destination: home.
    </p>
    <p>
     She needed a bathing suit, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been intentional, the way she had not grabbed one the night she'd stopped for her things, but with company set to join her, she somehow imagined that both Agatha
     <em>
      and
     </em>
     Alice might not be too thrilled with her skinny dipping.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she ran inside and returned to the car, laughing at the sight of Phineas perched so he could look out the driver's side window at her, Alice had texted her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Um. Okay? We're staying in a hotel?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course she was confused. Rio had been vague on purpose because while she had been given permission to share a little more of what she had been keeping close to the vest, there was still a sense of fun to be had when it came to shocking the shit out of her best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Something like that. So a change of clothes might also be a good idea."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started the car again, but before she could put it in drive, another message came through from Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're being really fucking weird. But I'll see you shortly."
    </p>
    <p>
     With a chuckle, Rio fired back one more response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When am I not? Leaving mine now, see you soon!"
    </p>
    <p>
     One more, with her phone dropping into its designated spot, Rio backed out of her space and took off toward Alice's, reaching her destination a good ten minutes later. When she pulled into the drive, Alice was already out front waiting, a small bag slung over her shoulder but a large grin on her face. She clearly knew Rio was up to
     <em>
      something,
     </em>
     she just didn't know what.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled Phin into her lap long enough for Alice to climb in and immediately gave him to her to confine while Rio drove them to where it was they were headed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So are you going to tell me where we are going?" Alice questioned as she reached around the cat to fasten her seatbelt.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a grin as she put the car in reverse, Rio looked over to her. "You won't believe me if I tell you, so you'll just have to wait until we get there."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice rolled her eyes, but chose resignation nonetheless.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This whole new mysterious side of you is actually annoying as hell only because I'm used to you calling me and being like 'WE'RE GOING TO WRIGLEY NOT BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT BASEBALL BUT BECAUSE I GOT FREE BEER TICKETS!' Not being all sneaky and sly," she commented as Rio began to speed up as she drove down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their chit-chat was light and rather funny as they ventured back toward the heart of the city. The moment that Rio turned a new direction, Alice seemed to be on alert, waiting to find out where their actual destination would be.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she got close enough to Water Tower Place that she had no other option than to be in the lane that turned into the parking garage, Alice whipped on her, quick as a bolt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What the fuck are we doing here? Going swimming at a mall?" came Alice's interrogation, but she was grinning like a madwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Rio responded with ease. "We're going swimming on the 72nd floor."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio. Shut the fuck up," Alice fired back, her eyes wide. "What the fuck does that even mean?!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "It means that Amelia asked me to house sit while she's out of the country. And she gave me permission a little bit ago to invite you over. So... We're having a slumber party." It was a factual series of statements, but she could tell without even looking at Alice that Alice though she was full of shit.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio, condos in this building cost millions of fucking dollars. What do you
     <em>
      mean
     </em>
     she
     <em>
      lives
     </em>
     here?!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was nearly screeching at her to the point that Phineas stirred in her lap and stretched out along her torso, one of his paws landing on her chin as though he were reminding her they were in an enclosed space and she did not need to be so loud.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both Rio and Alice laughed at the same time as Rio quickly returned to Agatha's reserved parking space -- which Rio thought hilarious given that she wasn't even sure Agatha
     <em>
      owned
     </em>
     a car -- and shut the car off. When she pulled the keycard for the elevator out and held it up for Alice to see, she was wearing a devious little grin that she could not fight off.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Up we go! You got Phin or do you want me to take him?"
    </p>
    <p>
     With a scratch to the top of his head, Alice offered her answer. "He behaves for Auntie Alice. I can walk him in."
    </p>
    <p>
     That being settled, the three of them unloaded and headed for the elevator. When Rio swiped the keycard and the elevator began to move -- with Phineas starting up his yowling and pacing -- Alice cut to Rio with wide eyes, having no choice but to believe her. With a shit-eating grin and a shrug to match, she simply enjoyed the ride and the obnoxious howling her cat was doing along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     The very moment the doors slid open, Rio unclipped Phineas' lead and he bolted off into the apartment, likely to find somewhere he could recover from the stress the elevator ride had induced within him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, Alice looked around the edge of the door and nearly passed all the way the fuck out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What the..." she breathed, stepping out of the elevator and into the spacious and lavish condo. She was clearly verklempt, which was obvious by the fact that he mouth was hanging open as the direct result of her awe. "What the actual fuck is this, Rio?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was trailing behind her, beaming like a complete idiot as she simply watched Alice, studying every bit of her wonder. The main living space alone was obvious in its grandeur, but Rio knew just how much existed within that home that was most likely going to blow Alice away.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You mean to seriously tell me that she lives
     <em>
      here?"
     </em>
     This time, Alice's head swiveled so that she could pin Rio with an incredulous and questioning gaze,
     <em>
      needing
     </em>
     some kind of clarification.
    </p>
    <p>
     "She does," Rio answered with a nod. "And I believe I am allowed to inform you that she works for an aerospace company. Can't say much more, but... It might help explain..." Rio lifted a hand, waving it around to indicate the entirety of the condo, "...all of this."
    </p>
    <p>
     "...You're telling me she's a fucking
     <em>
      rocket scientist, too?!
     </em>
     " Alice returned, completely disbelieving.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yup. And trust me, when she told me, I did not believe her." She was laughing, but she meant it. When Agatha had voiced it, it had truly seemed like a joke. Now, though, she knew better. Now, she knew that while Agatha had attained the career on the back of a scam, it was something she had sunk a great deal of her life into. It made Agatha happy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, who the fuck actually is this woman?" Alice asked it, but she had already turned back around to venture forth and explore.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Amelia Cohen. That's what you can call her. And Google actually has a fuck ton of results. So... Yeah," Rio offered in answer, shrugging again even though Alice wasn't looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Alice paced over to the wall of windows, Rio could tell that she was actually speechless. Her eyes cast out to the water, just watching for the longest moment before she turned back to Rio, who was posted at the end of the couch, smile still stuck as if it had no plans of leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have you..." Alice began, but then stopped herself to chew momentarily on her bottom lip. "You've been staying here this week? Not actually planning on going to Peoria?"
    </p>
    <p>
     That stuck smile was not quite as permanent as she had hoped it might be, her lips turning down as she realized what Alice was asking. With a sliver of shame wrapping around her spine, Rio shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wasn't sure what I was allowed to say, especially after that day at work. And... I just... Don't really have the energy to go out and be a heathen for the time being. So... I'm sorry I lied, but I really do hope that you'll spend the night with me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice's expression hadn't been injured or hurt, but it
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     convey that it felt odd to accept that Rio had been dishonest with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll stay," Alice agreed with a singular nod. "But on one condition. Well... Two conditions."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt the nerves creep in at being offered ultimatums, but when Alice's lips split apart in a wide smile, they ebbed their way right back out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go on," Rio encouraged, tipping her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "One: You owe me a tour. Two: You have to tell me what you're allowed to. That's it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Actually... Those were two very fair asks that Rio could accommodate. The second would require a bit of a back and forth with Agatha to establish ground rules of what could be said and what was too much, but it was still easily manageable.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think I can do both of those," Rio offered. She stepped away from the couch to move toward Alice, but Alice beat her to it and approached her with open arms, pulling her into a hug.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not upset. I get it. But..." Alice put her hands on Rio's shoulders and pulled back, looking at her at arm's length. "I
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     it had to be fucking
     <em>
      killing you
     </em>
     to not tell me about this."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sagged slightly in Alice's hold, primarily out of relief.  "Oh, in the most ironic way. But... killing me to not tell you would provide a lot less danger than her actually killing me if I fucked up again." The laugh she tacked on at the end was indicative that she absolutely did not think Agatha would actually kill her, even if she fucked up.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, hadn't Agatha already proved to her that even when she did fuck up, forgiveness was an option?
    </p>
    <p>
     Taking a step back, Rio clapped her hands together before letting her gaze sweep the room. "Tour then!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Wearing a bright and relieved grin, Rio showed Alice around the condo much in the way Agatha had shown her the week before. The art room, the spare room where Alice would be staying, and lastly the pool, which had drawn a massive reaction from her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Noooooo fucking way. And it's like... a legit fucking pool, too!" Alice remarked as she moved further into the room, marveling at all that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fun fact: She told me she actually bought this place from Oprah. And again, at first I thought she was full of shit. But then she added in that she conned Oprah into leaving it furnished for an extra two mil... Then sold everything to get her money back and an additional six million. So... I think she meant it." By the time she finished, the humor over it found her again, causing her to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know, I'd say that when you shoot, you shoot for the stars, but your last three relationships have been... absolute duds." Alice paused, turning around to face Rio with an apologetic look on her face. "Sorry, not to imply that you're in a relationship with her or anything. But..."
    </p>
    <p>
     "No! It's okay," Rio assured her, waving her over so they could exit the pool room and tend to filling their evening with food and films and friendship. "I don't know that I'd call it a relationship... But she considers me hers, and I like that. So. We're just... us, for now. I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
     She shut the door behind them, leading Alice toward the kitchen once more so that she could grab one of the pizzas out of the freezer to throw in the oven for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I'm happy for you, as long as you're happy." It was sweet, and it was how friends should support each other, but it was how Alice
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     supported Rio. She could make bad choices, do stupid things, but at the end of the day, Alice still loved her and would always help her through whatever predicament she got herself into.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm very happy, Alice. I promise."
    </p>
    <p>
     While they waited for the pizza to bake, Rio took the time to show Alice the few other things about the home that were exceptional, like the massive fucking TV in the wall. Alice had simply stared at it for the longest time before asking if it was real, which sent Rio into another fit of amused giggles.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How did you not die when you turned up here the first time?" Alice almost demanded in question, though she was clearly thrilled that this was the life Rio currently found herself living.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I almost did. For more than one reason. Ahem." Rio grinned and plopped down on the couch, spending the remainder of the time it took the pizza to cook scrolling through shows and not actually deciding on one while they each argued their own choices.
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, it felt good to be there with Alice. Rio had known that Agatha might have considered the risk she was taking in facilitating it all, but she was thankful for the chance to atone for the way she'd been feeling like a poor friend. Alice wouldn't have even thought to acknowledge it, but Rio was self-aware enough to recognize her shortcomings.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, they ate their pizza and they watched a foreign film Alice had chosen -- thinking it was going to surprise Rio, but when 'A Tale of Two Sisters' appeared at the bottom in English subtitles and Rio squealed her appreciation -- from the large dining room table.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was one of Rio's favorite films, one that gave her goosebumps every single time no matter how many rewatches she sat through. The story, the shots, the acting. Every bit of it was like a comfort to Rio in the most macabre way. It was something she found familiarity in for a plethora of reasons. It was even better when they relocated to the living room, able to appreciate it close up.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the credits began to roll a short while later, Alice turned to Rio expectantly, a warm smile on her face, though there was the tiniest shimmer of mischief in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So... I've been curious... And you can absolutely tell me to fuck off, but..." she began, her smile growing. "Ever since you came in with the hickeys -- so unlike you by the way -- you've... been different. Not bad different! But more like..."
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was fumbling, her dark eyes skipping from point to point on Rio's face in her worry that she might say something offensive. Considering all the talks they'd had over the years about anything and everything, Rio couldn't tell where the hesitance is coming from.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're getting
     <em>
      so fucked.
     </em>
     Not the other way around. It's literally bleeding out of you. So... I guess it just makes me wonder... Why her?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew what Alice was asking, and while she had often asked herself the same question, she wasn't sure that she had ever actually found an answer. At least, she had not found a logical answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why was she comfortable enough to let Agatha have access to her body in a way very few others ever had?
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't about power dynamics or who was 'in charge.' It was simply that with Agatha, Rio just felt comfortable. There was relief over repulsion in the way Agatha touched her, wanted her, would completely wreck her and still handle her with some modicum of respect.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a light shrug, Rio leaned forward and picked up her mostly empty beer, trying to down what few drops remained as if it might help her find the right words. She was grinning as she looked to her friend once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why not her? Nothing else about her makes sense... so why should that? It's cute that you noticed, though." Still smiling, Rio slumped over, letting her head rest on Alice's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, well, I tried not to assume when it looked like you'd been punched in the chest by a horde of babies. But the scratches kind of gave you away."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio almost said it. She almost opened her mouth to voice the thought that those
     <em>
      were
     </em>
     earned through her being the one doing the fucking, but she left it unsaid. Instead, she gave Alice's leg a light pat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I think I'm going to call it a night. Please, help yourself if you get peckish. The fridge will be restocked in the morning." With another tip of her head, one that caused hers to bump directly into Alice's, Rio pushed to her feet and stretched out. "Goodnight, Alice. Thank you for coming over and staying with me. I really appreciate it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course Rio," Alice returned, climbing to her feet as well. With an exchange of waves, they started to separate, but just before Alice tucked into the spare room, Rio heard her melodious singing coming from the other side of the condo.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Thank you for being a friend!"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     With a laugh as she began to shut the door to the bedroom, Rio rolled her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Goodnight, Blanche!" she called.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Goodnight, Rose!"
    </p>

    <p>
     When Rio came-to Sunday morning, it was only because her phone was ringing, and had been for the last several minutes. She was hoping she could ignore it, that whoever it was would just leave a message and she could call them back later.
    </p>
    <p>
     That might have been reasonable if it had been
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     phone that was ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it wasn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     The burner had been ringing and dinging incessantly. By the time she was awake enough to register the sound of the ringtone, Agatha had already called four times and texted eight. Upon seeing the long list, Rio immediately dialed back, not even having checked the time. The moment the line clicked to life, Rio's sleepy mumblings were falling from her before she could think to word them better.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where's the fire?" she grumbled, covering her face with the hand that wasn't pressing the phone to her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No fire, but groceries are there. The front desk staff informed me the elevator has returned twice, still full." Agatha didn't sound angry, but she didn't sound happy, either. When Rio lowered the phone to check the time, she realized why.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Agatha, it was almost one in the morning on a Monday and she had to work later that day. For Rio, it wasn't even noon and was still Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck, I'm so sorry. I forgot to set an alarm," Rio apologized, quickly scrambling out of bed to make it out to the elevator. Thankfully, the rest of the condo seemed empty for the time being, a respite in that Rio did not have to face Alice immediately upon rousing, or any further interrogation she might have had.
    </p>
    <p>
     One fire at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Currently, it was bringing everything in so that she could let Agatha off the phone to permit her to go to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     "One too many last night, then?" Agatha prodded, but Rio knew if she truly wanted an answer to that, all she had to do was watch the security footage from the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she would learn a thing or two Rio might have considered to be previously held close to her chest, but she would see that Rio's exhaustion came from nothing other than comfort and how much of it she felt residing in that condo, even in Agatha's absence.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, just couldn't fall asleep. Once I did, I apparently could not wake up." It was a simple enough answer, but it also gave her an out, one where she didn't have to admit that even though it was nice to have company in the form of Alice, a week without Agatha around was...
    </p>
    <p>
     It was agony, if she allowed herself to be dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Going days, sometimes a week or so, without seeing Agatha and not knowing where she was or what she was doing was one thing. It had been an irritation, an annoyance, but it hadn't been enough to actually instill any form of deeply seated yearning. Now, knowing where Agatha was and knowing she wasn't going to randomly turn up and put her hand around Rio's throat and kiss her until it hurt, it was maddening, frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
     On one side of the page, Rio had been allowed far enough into Agatha's life to be able to miss her. On the other side of that same page, nothing could have ever prepared her for the totality of who Agatha -- or, in this case, Amelia -- actually was and what her life entailed. With the certainty of her location came the understanding that there were still days between them, days when they would have to resort to phone calls and text messages to make the distance manageable.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Should I be giving wake up calls, then?" came a light cajoling over the line, though it was hard to take serious with the way it broke up at the end as Agatha yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the phone pinned to her ear using her shoulder, Rio collected the bags and relocated them to the island in the kitchen. The moment she was sure nothing was going to fall and break, she straightened up again and took hold of the phone, her gentle but dark gaze flickering to the camera in the dining room.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You can call me whenever you wish. Isn't that the whole point of the burner phone being the
     <em>
      best
     </em>
     morning after gift?" Her tone was rich with her teasing, but something else happened the next second.
    </p>
    <p>
     For just a moment, Rio hesitated. She could have tucked back into the bedroom to finish her conversation with Agatha before coaxing her to get some rest before work, but instead, she posed a quiet question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you watching?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Immediately, the way Agatha's breath caught was audible; she'd been busted. It had truly been a question that stemmed primarily from curiosity, but drawing such a reaction caused a smirk to curl Rio's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will take that as a yes." With the intent to usher Agatha off to sleep over the course of the following few minutes, Rio left the groceries unattended for the time being. Surely they'd be fine for the time it took to persuade Agatha to get in bed. She paced forward, down the length of that ridiculous dining room table, finding a suitable place to lean on the corner, leaving her perfectly angled toward the camera that was mounted in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do I need to do to convince you to try and get some shut-eye before you work in the morning?" Rio asked her, the question low and tapered, meant to go no further than the few feet of cubic space around her. Even if Alice did wake up, it wasn't exactly a conversation Rio wanted overheard, but perhaps not for the reasons Alice might have thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was quiet for the longest few moment, almost long enough that Rio began to think she was asleep. And then, her tired voice flittered softly over the line.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Tell me something," came the soft request.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Anything, my queen," Rio teased in return, her gaze still locked on that black shiny lens of the camera on the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What was the best piece of work you did while you were doing taxidermy?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Although she tried really hard not to, Rio laughed. It was a light bark, but it wasn't loud. It was simply an indicator that of all the things Agatha could have asked her, the one she chose was also the most unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you asking because you want to be bored to sleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
     That time, Agatha was the one to breathe a warm laugh, one that caused Rio's heart to thud a little harder in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     God, she was a fucking idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart was fluttering, or skipping beats, or doing whatever stupid thing it did when it felt some unruly form of affection. The more maddening part was that it was doing it in response to the sounds of joy from someone Rio knew was dangerous to covet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Agatha finally answered, though her voice had dropped a little more in a sign that the exhaustion was beginning to pull her under. "I want to hear what it sounds like when you talk about something that you're proud of."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her tongue. She wanted to ask Agatha if she'd been listening, but that felt a little misplaced given the moment they were occupying in time; it wasn't the one where she needed to remind Agatha that she was proud of
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     . Before she could form an actual answer, there was a soft 'click' over the phone line just before another gasped yawn sounded from Agatha. If Rio had to guess, she had closed the laptop and was finally giving in to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It was senior year, a fox. I had seen... some truly nightmarish stuff," Rio began, though she pushed off the table to retreat toward the bedroom. She
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     pretty certain Agatha was settling in, but just in case, taking the temptation to stay focused on the screen didn't seem to be the worst idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio's gaze landed on the bed, an instant grin filled her face at the sight of Phineas curled up on Agatha's pillow. "Sorry, I'll finish in a second. It's... I know you can't see in here, but now feels like a good time to let you know that Phineas has been pretty attached to your side of the bed the last couple of days."
    </p>
    <p>
     A soft but content hum sounded from the speaker as Rio climbed onto the bed and nestled into the mattress, flat on her back with the phone still held to her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I told you," Agatha jeered sleepily. She was trying
     <em>
      so hard
     </em>
     to be a menace, but it was clear that she was tired.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Told me what?" Rio questioned back, her brow knitting slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That I'd win him over. Just didn't think I'd have to fly a million miles away to do it." She sounded confident, maybe even arrogant, but Rio would let her have it. It had been clear for a little while now that while this connection between them wasn't exactly an area of comfort, or even somewhere Agatha occupied space much before they'd met, she
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     it to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I just think he's ready for you to be back," Rio offered simply, although it was anything but. If she had thought she could get away with it and pass it off as innocent, she realized her misstep the moment Agatha spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is he the only one?"
    </p>
    <p>
     That one little question was quiet, and while Rio
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     Agatha would blame it on being tired, it sounded the slightest bit... vulnerable, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know he's not, Agatha," Rio chastised. It held no edge, was not loud, but it was heartfelt and Rio meant it.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a lull over the line, an eerie silence that befell them, one that almost made Rio ask if she had said something wrong.  She was parsing out the right way to say it when Agatha startled her despite the fact that her voice was barely loud enough to be heard over the line.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're right. Because I'm ready to be back, too."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio waited for her to continue, to offering some quippy addendum that might harden the edges of such a sentiment, but nothing came. In fact, the grogginess in that statement alone should have told Rio what was coming next, but she offered a return nonetheless.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm ready, too. I..." Rio paused, her lips sealing tightly in a line that turned them white around the edges. "I miss you, Agatha."
    </p>
    <p>
     For every taunt or jab or inveigling that Rio had assumed Agatha would offer, she was almost unsettled at the lack of response. And then, she realized she had gotten what she'd been after since the moment Agatha had called and Rio realized how late it was for her and
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     , exactly, she was awake at such an unholy hour:
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had finally fallen asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of immediately hanging up, Rio let the tables turn for once. For several long but peaceful moments, she simply tapped the speaker button and set the phone down next to her head on the pillow, a little closer to her than it was to Phin where he rested on Agatha's half of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a good ten minutes, Rio simply let herself listen. It was a soft rhythm without a melody, just the steady in and out of Agatha's slumbered breathing. It was serene, it was calming, but it was also a reminder of why Rio was where she was, and what it was she was waiting for.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe nothing about them made sense. Maybe it was foolish to think that there could ever be a version of their entanglement that wound up being long-term.
     <em>
      Maybe
     </em>
     all of that was true, but as Rio finally lifted up the burner to disconnect the call when the smell off Alice making coffee began to waft in from the kitchen, none of it actually mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
     What
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     matter was that Agatha brought something to her life that was new, it was invigorating, stimulating even. In a world where Rio had fallen prey to the mundane of a day-to-day, Agatha had reminded her what it was to be curious, to chase answers and have little regard for the consequences. Agatha had managed to breathe life back into Rio... by killing people.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps a day might come when Rio actually cared how insane that was at its core, but it was not that Sunday, midday, as she tucked the burner phone in the nightstand drawer to meet her best friend in the kitchen for a cup of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     They spent the rest of the day oscillating between lounging, snacking, and swimming, just cycling through until the time came for Alice to decide whether or not she was going to stay another night. Surprisingly, she had offered a thought for consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Should you ask her if it's okay? I know it's just one more night, but..."
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Alice posed the question, it was a genuine respect for the fact that Agatha had already let her spend time in a space that was sacred to her. It was clear that the last thing she wanted to do was intrude and overstay her welcome; that feeling was rooted firmly in her friendship with Rio. They were both completely aware what they had been given in the form of the weekend together, but Alice did not want to push any boundaries on Rio's behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even more, it was an amends, an olive branch of sorts after what had happened at the morgue that day, the first and last time Agatha and Alice had been in the same room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Checking the time, Rio was suddenly aware that she likely had a message or two waiting for her when she dug the burner back out. Agatha hadn't specifically told her what time she had to be up, but with it being... roughly nine in the morning? Rio had a feeling she was tossing back her morning coffee before whisking off to work.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Be right back." With a lone finger begging a pardon, Rio pushed to her feet and quickly retrieved the phone, returning only a moment later as she swiped up on the screen. As predicted, there were two texts awaiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first one was from an hour before.
    </p>
    <p>
     "There is not enough caffeine in the world to make this Monday bearable. Hope yours is better tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, one from only a few minutes prior.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have been behaving myself and trying not to check in. So, if Alice hasn't left yet, just carpool to work tomorrow. No sense in making her go home tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
     With a soft chuckle, Rio shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What is it?" Alice inquired, though she didn't lean forward in an attempt to steal a glance at the phone. No, she had definitely learned her lesson there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "She informed me that if I have not taken you home yet that we should just ride to work together tomorrow," Rio paraphrased, lifting her focus to land on her best friend, a warm smile curling her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You didn't even have to ask?" Alice questioned, brows hiking in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, Rio let herself understand
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     that might be so surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was because it was kind. It was sweet. It was intuitive and thoughtful. Given the fact that both Rio and Alice knew what Agatha did for a hobby, it was understandable why such softness could be considered suspect so easily, at least from Alice's perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition, Rio understood that all Alice had to say was that it was very
     <em>
      loving
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      attentive
     </em>
     and she would have been put into a box that she could not climb back out of. It was a box where she would have to admit attachment to Agatha, to a literal murderer. It was more than just attachment, though, and that was what made it so fucking dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't ready to tell Alice -- hell, she wasn't ready to admit it to
     <em>
      herself
     </em>
     -- but she knew that she'd started
     <em>
      feeling things
     </em>
     for Agatha, things that would not be pliable enough to shove back inside if they got out.
    </p>
    <p>
     For all the concessions it seemed that Agatha was willing to make, Rio simply could not bear the thought of running her off simply because she could not police her own emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
     "She's very... observant," Rio attempted to explain, a soft chuckle leaving her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Or the security guy downstairs told her we haven't left since we got here," Alice shot back, dissolving into light laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That too," Rio agreed with a shrug, but was quick to redirect the conversation. "So... in any event... What movie should we watch now?"
    </p>
    <p>
     With Alice decidedly staying one more night, the two of them settled in with glasses of wine and a bowl of berries to watch a Canadian film that was mostly in French, one that left Rio in silent tears by the credit scene.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright," she voiced as she wiped at her cheeks and pushed off the couch. "I'm officially mad as fuck at you for that and am gonna go pout in bed until we have to be up for work in the morning." The words Rio chose said one thing, but the smile she offered said something else. It had been a beautiful film, but it emotionally struck Rio in every sore spot she had and while it left her feeling a bit raw, she did appreciate the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was quick to rise, offering a warm hug so that they could retreat to their opposing ends of the condo.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This weekend's been really fun, Rio," she admitted as her hold loosened around her best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It really has. Thanks again for staying with me. It's been a good time," Rio offered, giving Alice one last squeeze before releasing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Goodnight!" Alice chirped, departing with a light wave.
    </p>
    <p>
     For just a moment, Rio watched after her before turning to do the same. Once within the confines of Agatha's bedroom, the door shut behind her. In a whip of motion, the burner was back out and she was typing a quick response to Agatha so that
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     might finally tuck in and rest before the Monday she would greet when she woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thank you. I meant to respond earlier, but we ended up watching a movie. I'm going to sleep now, but I hope your Monday got better. And... Thank you. For this weekend. It's been... really, really nice. And not having to lie so much is cool too. Text if you need anything. Goodnight, A."
    </p>
    <p>
     With the soft 'woosh' sound that indicated her message had been sent, Rio stowed the burner on the nightstand, right next to her own phone, and fell asleep before the sound of a response -- or the several others that followed throughout the course of the night -- graced her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon stirring the next morning, there were six different text messages waiting for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The very first one made Rio choke on a dislodged wad of spit that landed in her windpipe the moment she inhaled a breath so sharp it was nearly cutting.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Need a few things. Mostly my curiosity quelled.
     <br/>
     Thing one: have you ever been fisted before? I mean, not that I want to try. But... just curious. Personally, haven't ever given it due consideration. Something to ponder over, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
     What the
     <em>
      fuck?!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Was Agatha okay?!
    </p>
    <p>
     Who the fuck was thinking enough about fisting at... two in the afternoon (at least, according to the time stamp and Rio's quick mental math) to
     <em>
      ask someone about it?!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     There were still five other messages.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thing two: How many tattoos do you actually have?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Twenty minutes later, another one had come through.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thing three: As an addition, so many tattoos, but have you ever had anything pierced? Hood? Nipples?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Good fucking
     <em>
      GOD
     </em>
     . What the fuck had Agatha put in her coffee that morning?!
    </p>
    <p>
     The next sat directly underneath, delivered five minutes after the previous one.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thing three point five: If the answer to the above question is no, would you consider it? Just hypothetically."
    </p>
    <p>
     That one had a nuanced answer that Rio was not going to have time to dive into before she needed to get herself and Alice to work. She
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     considered it, but it wasn't something she'd actually sunk much thought into; it often felt like something she
     <em>
      should
     </em>
     have done in her 20's, not her mid-30s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another message, another soft bout of giggles that fell in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thing four: I'm actually kind of mad about that time we fucked against the window. I need to invest in a drone so I can see you full frontal with your tits smashed against the glass."
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently, someone was
     <em>
      very, very
     </em>
     horny while spending a Monday at work and she was having the worst time containing it. While Agatha might have
     <em>
      seemed
     </em>
     miserable because of it, Rio was already reading between the lines.
    </p>
    <p>
     The admission Rio had made the night before was a mutual one, but with not having heard it and her inability to openly discuss feelings, Agatha was never going to outright say those words: 'I miss you.'
    </p>
    <p>
     The last message, Rio had been expecting something completely wild and unhinged, but instead, what she saw melted her somewhere near her middle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thing five, and the last one for the time being: Do you think we might be able to go back to the pier again? I've been thinking, and I'd really like a do-over."
    </p>
    <p>
     That one struck Rio a little harder; that night had been damn near perfect, in Rio's eyes. It had been a mess of emotions, sure, and they had struggled to navigate what a social outing actually looked like for them, but over all, it had been a good night out by Rio's standards. For Agatha to ask for another opportunity in the same location, Rio knew that something about it bothered her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some part of her wanted to press, to try and uncover a bit more of Agatha's reasoning behind such a request. However, with less than an hour to get ready, get dressed, and head to work, Rio knew she had to be quick with her responses.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good morning, you devil. What a fucking list of messages to wake up to. I have to hurry and get ready for work, but I'll give answers now and we can go in depth when we have more time.
     <br/>
     1. No. I have not. And I haven't really thought about it either. And it's 6:30am. Not ready to spin down that rabbit hole yet.
     <br/>
     2. Left sleeve, under breast, back of neck, and a little heart on the inside of my right ankle.
     <br/>
     3. I had my eyebrow pierced one time.
     <br/>
     3.5. Have pondered it. Never really got the gumption, though.
     <br/>
     4. ...You want to buy a drone so you can watch yourself fuck me against the window? And they say romance is dead.
     <br/>
     5. I would really like that. Maybe a dinner date this time. (;
     <br/>
     Have a good day, A. We'll catch up tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was too short, and she wished she could have said more, but it would have to do for the time being. Plus, it was probable that Agatha was unwinding for the day, perhaps while eating a meal with a colleague, or indulging in a glass of wine in her hotel room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, that was what Rio had assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
     As it turned out, Rio was learning pretty quickly that making any kind of assumption when it came to Agatha was a fool's errand.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Rio had brushed her teeth, washed her face, put on deodorant, and dressed herself for the day, there was a message waiting for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "For the sake of brevity and not keeping you from work, I appreciate the responses. Dully noted. I hope you have a good day at work. Tell Alice I said thanks for keeping you company."
    </p>
    <p>
     For just one fleeting moment, Rio was truly frustrated over the circumstances that left the two of them on opposite sides of the world. She hated that as she was waking up, Agatha was ending her day. By the time she was closing out hers, Agatha was preparing for the next one. It was annoying, it was upsetting, and oh the things Rio would have given just to hear Agatha voice the messages she'd been sending through text.
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, maybe not
     <em>
      all
     </em>
     of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     ...Who was she kidding?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Especially
     </em>
     all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have a good night, A. Talk soon. xx."
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could stop herself, Rio sent the message. And then she saw it, as well as the automatic closing that she hadn't felt the need to use in a message to
     <em>
      anyone
     </em>
     for at least the last decade.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, at least it wasn't a stupid heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rolling her eyes at herself, Rio made her way out of the bedroom only to be greeted with the smell of coffee that emanated from two travel mugs on the counter. Bent over in front of Phin's food bowl, Alice was clearing a container into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, good morning," Rio offered warmly as she paced toward her awaiting mug of coffee. "Don't have to make my own coffee or feed my own cat? Might just see if you can stay all week." There was an air of teasing to her tone, but honestly? Rio wouldn't have minded the company, especially with not having any official word of when, exactly, Agatha would get to make her return.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, well," Alice returned, standing to full height so she could discard the empty cat food container, "An extra night might have been a gift, but I
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     don't want to piss her off again. I can't have another dry spell for you on my conscience."
    </p>
    <p>
     Unable to contain her laughter, Rio huffed it into her coffee as she attempted a sip, lowering it the next second to prevent disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh my God, you're so dramatic," Rio shot back, rolling her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, well, in a truly dramatic fashion, if we don't get to work, we're gonna be hung out to dry," she returned, striding over to snatch up her own coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, okay," Rio conceded, snatching up her keys from the small hanger on the side of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, they were off and on a mission to chug through the work day. The morning had been easy enough and kept Rio fairly busy, but by lunch, she found her mind wandering back to the series of insane text messages she had received while she had been sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently, she'd gotten a little too lost in the thoughts; the way she placed a bite of mac and cheese into her mouth and left the spoon there as she stared at some undetermined point on the wall behind Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Helloooo, earth to Rio. Come back, space captain," came Alice's gentle teasing. It might have been soft, but it was like a booster engine that sent Rio jettisoning back into reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Huh?" Rio blinked, gaze landing on Alice who was wearing a piqued expression with her brows cast into arches. Immediately, a pink dusting and a sheepish smile found Rio's expression. "Sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where did you go?" Alice questioned, tilting her head curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     That sheepish grin widened and Rio ducked her head to focus on the needless stirring she had started in her container of macaroni.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, come on. You're not going to start holding out on me now, are you?" Alice popped a tater tot into her mouth and chewed contemplatively, but her burning stare had not wavered in its silent interrogation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could have prefaced the conversation, could have tried to provide some context, but it felt unnecessary. Instead, she chose to ask a simple question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have you ever thought about getting your nipples pierced?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The abruptness clearly caught Alice off guard, at least judging by the way she sputtered and nearly choked on her drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What the fuck?" she asked through a laugh, raising a lone eyebrow in question. "
     <em>
      That's
     </em>
     what you're thinking about on your lunch break?"
    </p>
    <p>
     With an agreeable downturn of her lips, Rio just shrugged. "I mean, I was thinking about it before work, but I'm thinking about it again now." While she hadn't said much, the expression Alice was suddenly wearing indicated that she had said enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     "She said something to you, didn't she?" Alice challenged, suddenly uninterested in the remainder of her meal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, Rio shrugged, acting like she wasn't suggesting at her ripe old age of thirty six that she suddenly make a body modification, and for a woman no less.
    </p>
    <p>
     That wasn't what it was, though, not really. What Rio saw in the question Agatha asked was an encouragement, an approval that she could and should do whatever it was she wanted with her body. It was a reminder that there was always time to try new things, to make new choices. While she had been pulled out of her boring and mundane routine the moment she had chosen to track Agatha down, Agatha was showing her that the change could extend further and touch other parts of her life, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've thought about it a time or two, but I thought it was probably too late. Plus, I heard the healing process is a bitch. I don't know if I could go that long without her touching my chest." It was a flat admission toward the end, but it was an honest one that was
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     flat because Rio realized what it was she had said.
    </p>
    <p>
     It would be six to eight weeks for her nipples to heal. Inadvertently, she had just admitted that for the next two months, she did not envision anyone else touching her body other than Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     The blush that filled her cheeks was instant, but it only accompanied the panic in her eyes as she made the realization. Instead of looking away this time, Rio sat up a little straighter and cleared her throat. Her lips parted but no sound emerged as she tried to find the right words, but Alice cut her off before she could form them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So just do one. I know it'll make the second one way worse, but... Might be worth some thought?" Alice leaned back in her chair, but the look she was wearing was a little on the smug side, made worse by the way she crossed her arms over her chest. She knew she had given Rio exactly what she needed: a workaround.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, Rio's lips parted, but this time it was to run her tongue along them, the debate warring in her mind. Before she could think her way out of it, she posed a simple question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Want to go to Cleopatra with me after work?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The wild grin that filled Alice's face was both wicked and delighted, her amusement sparkling in her eyes. "Which one will you do first?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, but she knew she
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     need to make that decision. However, she did not think she should make it alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have an idea, but I think I should get confirmation first." With a smirk, she leaned forward and slid open the top drawer of her desk, quickly producing the burner phone that she actually remembered to bring in that day. In less than thirty seconds, she'd pulled up her chat with Agatha and sent a quick question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Which boob is your favorite?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was one in the morning for Agatha, and as such, Rio did not expect an answer at least until she got back to the condo that evening. However, as she went to set the phone back in the drawer, it vibrated in her hand. Those lips were twisting up again as she opened the message and grinned so impossibly wide that it almost hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mine or yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mine, obviously. Like... Which one would you prefer to pay more attention to?" Rio was fighting for her life to not look like some kind of giddy school girl as she typed the question out and then sent it, hardly having time to look up at Alice before another text came through.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Right."
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of providing any further elaboration on why she was asking such a question, Rio's response was succinct and to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thanks. (:"
    </p>
    <p>
     She almost expected the phone to ring, for Agatha to call and interrogate her on why
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     was suddenly the one posing off the wall inquiries. Instead, another text message came buzzing through.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're welcome. Anything else you'd like to know before I force myself to sleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio considered this for a moment, the softer side of her winning out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why can't you sleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew it was probably too personal, and that Agatha would likely redirect and change the subject, but she still felt it worth asking. When she read Agatha's next message, she felt herself fill with both shock and warmth simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I want to be home already."
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't an 'I miss you,' but it was even closer than Agatha's prior banter. Surely, Agatha had previously reveled in a life where she did not have to stay rooted, and yet, it was becoming apparent that she was not thriving in such a setting in the ways she might have before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice had resumed her meal, knowing that she still had half a shift left, but she had been watching Rio like a hawk throughout the text exchange. What she was seeing was everything that Rio would not admit. She saw the soft gleam in her eyes as she stared down at the phone. She saw the genuine smile, and the excitement that was etched into her features.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Alice was seeing was a Rio she had never truly known before, a Rio that was actually happy without making sacrifices to get there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you know when she gets to come back?" Alice asked unprompted, causing Rio's gaze to snap up to her, wondering if Alice could actually read her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, but I was literally just going to ask." With another drop of her chin, Rio did just that.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you know when you get to come back?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The little bubble appeared immediately as Agatha typed her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Looking like Thursday, maybe. If everything goes well, at least. If not, it will be Monday. Hoping for sooner rather than later."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could have chosen to be soft, to offer comfort, but she sensed that it was not what Agatha needed. What Agatha needed was a reminder of what was waiting for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What's the matter? The sights not living up to the expectations?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a gentle prodding, but Rio could have predicted what would come in return even before it did.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The sights are fine, but the ones in my bedroom are much better."
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she read and processed the text before her, Rio's stomach churned and a dull pulsing began between her legs. Her skin was flush and hot, but she was trying to control her bodily response as to not completely give herself away, though she was doing a piss poor job of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright! Time to go for me!" Alice announced, slapping her hands down on the desk to stand. When Rio looked up from the burner phone, she realized that Alice had already cleared her lunch trash and was ready to jet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Snapping her focus upward, Rio offered a guilty smile, realizing that she had spent the last few minutes of their down time together ignoring Alice so that she could talk to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will see you shortly. But, you'll really go with me?" Rio asked her, tilting her head. "She said the right one, by the way."
    </p>
    <p>
     Grinning so wide her eyes wrinkled at the corners, Alice gave a nod of assurance. "Left it is! I'd call and make an appointment, just to be safe."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Definitely. Have a good run!"
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Alice was off and Rio was typing one last text to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go to sleep. When you wake up, you'll be a little closer to coming back. I've got to go back to work now. But really, get some rest."
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she sent it, the phone was stowed and the other was removed so that she could call the piercing shop to make her appointment for right after their shifts. With that mission accomplished, she was back to work, returning to the teenager that Alice had brought in before their meal. Suddenly, her lunch time conversation wasn't enough to bat away the slight ripples of sadness that filled her at seeing a life lost so young.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finding a way through it, Rio did as she always would and handled the boy with great care as she completed his autopsy and stored him away. The rest of the afternoon was much of the same, but toward the end, she began to feel the nerves of anticipation when she considered what she would be doing when they left those offices.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time they were clocking out and climbing into that little Tiburon, Rio was practically
     <em>
      buzzing.
     </em>
     It didn't help much, but having Alice around definitely did. The piercer -- a woman named Dominique -- was ready and waiting for her when they arrived and was
     <em>
      phenomenal
     </em>
     when it came to being informative and attentive.
    </p>
    <p>
     While Rio hadn't been
     <em>
      scared
     </em>
     , there was nothing that could have prepared her for that sensation, or the ones that followed immediately after.
    </p>
    <p>
     Helpfully, Alice had chosen to drive them back to the condo, even in spite Rio insisting that she should be the one to take Alice home. That had been shut down quickly as Alice insisted that an Uber ride back to her house would not be the worst thing in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon arriving back to a highly dissatisfied Phineas who was impatiently waiting for someone to feed him, Alice commandeered the evening duties and insisted Rio relax on the couch. After a moment, she appeared above the spot where Rio had chosen to lay, holding out an ice pack.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know as well as I do that it'll help with the swelling," Alice informed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Disappearing again, she tended to Phineas and made them a quick bite to eat, knowing Rio would need something on her stomach. Alice was also fully aware that once she stepped foot in that elevator, it was unlikely Rio would move again for the rest of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     With their meal consumed and Rio laid back on the couch, the ice pack cold and comforting on her left breast, Alice's duties for the evening were completed. She pushed to her feet and shuffled toward Rio, giving her shoulder a light pat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I wouldn't wear a bra for a few days," she offered softly with a gentle chuckle. "My Uber's almost here. But if you need anything, just text me and I'll come straight over."
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a gentleness to Rio's expression as her gaze flickered upward to take in her friend, one that showed just how much it meant that Alice was always there and always so fucking supportive.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know sometimes I think you're too good to me," Rio teased softly. She wanted to continue, but was stopped when a yawn took her over.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What you give, you will get in return," Alice reminded her lightly. "Have a good night, Rio. I'll see you in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You too, Alice. Thanks again. Get home safe!" Rio called in return as Alice paced toward the elevator and disappeared inside, the doors shutting quietly behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time in days, Rio was alone again.
    </p>
    <p>
     To remedy the bout of emptiness that filled her at the thought, she dug out the burner to see that Agatha had been texting her over the last hour. Having been set to vibrate, Rio hadn't heard a sound for any of the notifications. Apparently, Agatha had checked the camera after Rio's shift, expecting her to be home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is everything okay?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Five minutes later:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you alright?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, again, ten minutes after that one, another one came through.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Call me when you get this."
    </p>
    <p>
     Before heeding that request, Rio read through the other messages.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alice brought you back? What happened? Are you hurt? I saw the ice pack. What's going on?"
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a swirling of mixed emotions that began to pool in the pit at the bottom of Rio's stomach. She was softened by the show of concerned, but she also felt guilty for not having checked the phone while she had been out being a mischievous little asshole.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm fine, A. Just wasn't paying attention and ran into something. Do you still want me to call, or are you already in the throes of work?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's lips pressed as she stared at the message, trying to parse if there was any other way to respond that might sound better, but she was coming up empty. She didn't want it to seem
     <em>
      dry,
     </em>
     but she also didn't want to give away the surprise of her hare-brained decision before Agatha could see it for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm headed to a meeting now, but should be done around noon if you're still awake. Also, watch where the fuck you're going maybe."
    </p>
    <p>
     That message made Rio laugh. It was loud, it was bright, and it truly tickled her to see that despite the distance, Agatha was still Agatha. No matter how soft she might have gotten over how badly she was pining to come home, those edges would
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     fade.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Will do. Enjoy your meeting. Give a ring when you're finished."
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been Rio's goal to stay awake until eleven that evening, but the crash after such an adrenaline rush got to her first. Staving off the exhaustion hadn't worked for even a second, pulling her under before 10 pm. The next morning, there were a few texts from Agatha, though nowhere near as insane as the previous day.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was nice to hold light chatter with her in the morning, but by the time Tuesday evening rolled around, Rio finally had an answer to the question of when Agatha would be returning. It came in a lengthy text message, an explanation for how things were going to play out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will be back Thursday evening around 4 pm. Francisco will pick me up from O'Hare around then, and then I have some work to tend to. I know that you work until 5, so I will be gone by the time you return to the condo (if that is what you'd like to do. I'm not saying that you have to stay once I come back, but I would like for you to if it's what you would want). I should be back later on in the evening."
    </p>
    <p>
     At this, Rio leaned forward on the couch, her elbows digging into her knees as she held the phone up with both hands, staring at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had been busy, apparently. She didn't need to state so plainly what 'work' she was going to be doing on a Thursday night because Rio knew her well enough to know that the itch had certainly been itching and Agatha was fiending for a fix.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that in mind, Rio fired back a response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So I can meet you at the barn Thursday night?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's answer was immediate.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, my little freak, you can meet me at the barn Thursday night."
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      My little freak.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was so stupid, but the pet name made Rio grin like an entire idiot. Never before had she felt so accepted and seen by another person, much less someone she was actually attracted to, and it made her feel important. It made her feel like, to Agatha, she mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Perfect. Now, how long do you have before you have to be out the door? Planned on crawling into bed and working one out before I sleep, but if you've got time, I can stay out here."
    </p>
    <p>
     The pleasurably painful grin she had been wearing only seemed to grow when Agatha answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've got time."
    </p>
    <p>
     Even before Rio had time to read the full message, her phone began to ring.

     Wednesday was miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was slow, it was repetitive, and it was
     <em>
      downright agonizing
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Thursday was even worse.
    </p>
    <p>
     Focusing on work felt impossible; no matter how hard she tried, Rio found herself frequently glancing at the clock with the assumption that an hour had passed solely to be met with the reality that it had been little more than ten minutes. It was frustrating, it was draining, but over all, it just made that dull ache in her chest that she refused to name so much more prevalent.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Alice arrived that afternoon with a plastic sack from the nearby deli clutched in her hand, she
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     Rio was practically crawling out of her skin. It was on her face, but she instead chose to offer topics of conversation that might serve as a minor distraction from the way Rio kept glancing at her desk drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Cub's losing streak, the recent brawl at the Pier, nor the upcoming lineup of drag shows seemed to do the trick, providing no resistance against Rio's compulsive checking of the burner phone every few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Alice could take it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "She isn't going to text you while she's on the plane," she offered finally, her voice light but words painfully honest.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was gentle in that Alice had never witnessed such compelled behavior from her best friend before and as such, she understood just a little more how much it all
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     meant to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     How much Agatha -- or, rather, Amelia -- meant to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know, I just..." Cloudy and dark eyes dropped to her desk, scanning briefly over the day's unfinished crossword puzzle, suddenly unable to look her best friend in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're worried because you like her," Alice supplemented gently, leaning forward over the desk, her elbows propping her atop her thighs. "And it's very apparent that she likes you, too. I know it's tricky and normally I'm a total 'keep the future in mind' kinda gal, but... with everything... Maybe this one time, it's okay to live in the moment."
    </p>
    <p>
     Hearing such a statement from Alice, Rio simply blinked at her, digesting it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     the kind of person who was vigilant, trying to navigate her way toward a life she wanted to be living. For her to say something completely opposite to her normal worldview, Rio realized that she could see it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice could tell -- without actually having spent time with both Agatha and Rio in the same room for more than a few minutes without it turning hostile -- that whatever this string of fate was tying them together, it was tight and binding.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Alice saw was that Rio had changed in the last months, and for the better.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah? And still no padded cell?" It was teasing, but it was clear that she understood that her behavior was... a little... clingy?
    </p>
    <p>
     "No promises there. You still make plenty other questionable choices. Who puts fruit on pizza?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't be mad because you don't have taste buds," Rio shot, tipping back in her chair the tiniest bit. "But, I digress. Thank you, Alice. I have... questioned my sanity a lot lately. So, even if I
     <em>
      am
     </em>
     losing my mind, at least I have your support."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rising to her feet, Alice was grinning again. "We're friends, Rio. And I'll only ever interfere in your life if I think you're in danger. Which, oddly, is not something I've considered about this scenario." She paused, her brow furrowing in thought for the briefest moment. She looked pensive at first, but it quickly evaporated the moment a grin filled her face. "Shit, maybe
     <em>
      I'm
     </em>
     the one losing it."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The descent into madness is at least a fun one?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "If anyone would know, it's certainly you."
    </p>
    <p>
     With a wave and a light encouragement that she could press on for four more hours, Alice had departed for her first afternoon run.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where that left Rio was up to her elbows in work and spinning in circles in her own mind, far too anxious for time to progress just a
     <em>
      little
     </em>
     faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     About an hour before the end of her shift, there was a buzzing that sounded from the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
     It meant that Agatha had come back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even in the middle of an autopsy on a middle aged white guy who'd been decked in a barfight and suffered severe brain trauma, Rio felt an immediate wave of warmth as it washed over her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything was going back to normal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, it would once they were sharing space again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not rush, but she did work as fast as she could while still maintaining her professional integrity, finally finishing about twenty minutes after the text had come in. After washing up and scrubbing down her work area, the first thing she did was bolt toward her desk, scooping the phone up hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     There it was, what she had been waiting for:
    </p>
    <p>
     "Back on US soil. Heading home to shower and change, but I am certain I will be gone before you get back. 9:30p. See you then, princess."
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh God, seeing that in text
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     had more of an effect on her than when Agatha poured it into her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, she reread the message and the totality of its weight finally started to sink in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Five hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     After she had managed ten days?
    </p>
    <p>
     She could manage five more hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe.
    </p>
    <p>
     If the anticipation didn't cause her to spontaneously combust first.
    </p>
    <p>
     The exact second the time changed from 4:59 to 5:00, Rio clocked out, grabbed her bag, bid Alice a farewell and all but sprinted to the car. If it weren’t for the three times she dropped her keys, she might have made it back to the condo just a little sooner, but the end result would have still been the same; she still had to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the doors of the elevator pulled open, Rio had known already that Agatha would not be there. Some part of her had hoped that maybe they might share even a moment in passing, but realistically, she knew it wasn't going to happen. What
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     there, still hanging in the air, was the scent of Agatha's perfume. What was also there was her still-full suitcase as it sat behind the couch, completely discarded and untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not in the physical sense, right at that moment, but in the sense that when Rio fell asleep that night, she wasn't going to be in that massive bed alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, it was going to help substantially that she'd had enough forethought on Wednesday to request that she have Friday off. She hadn't told Agatha, but somehow did not think she would find a distaste for the decision, at least
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio understood Agatha's motivations for wanting her to keep to her routine, but the idea of three days together where they could do whatever the fuck it was they wanted? Three days where they could fuck and swim and bask in the light of the sun as it streamed through those windows and never even leave the condo?
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning that down would have been insane, and given the list of things that had gotten Rio to that point in her life? That was saying something.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, she thought about that almost-too-soft request that Agatha had made at the end of her barrage of probing questions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wanted to go back to the pier. She wanted to have a 'do-over.'
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe they could do that over the weekend, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio shuffled further into the apartment, she was surprised to find Phineas curled up on the couch asleep, but not because of where he was or that he was slumbering. What surprised her about his appearance was that he was wearing a collar. More than that, he wasn't fighting to get it off.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was an intricate pattern, colorful in its weaving. It was clearly something Agatha had brought back with her, something she had picked up solely because she had seen it and it had made her think of him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something about it turned Rio's middle molten. Agatha didn't have to give gifts or bring anything back and yet, something in her had felt motivated to do so for Phineas.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was more than that, though, wasn't it? It wasn't just about Phin; Agatha cared for Phin
     <em>
      because
     </em>
     she cared for Rio, and Phineas was the most important thing in Rio's life, a being she loved and cherished.
    </p>
    <p>
     What it actually was? It was another way that Agatha was able to say she had missed being away without her having to say the words aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a shower and a change of clothes that consisted of form-fitting skinny jeans and a slightly-too-tight black t-shirt that revealed the smallest sliver of her stomach -- and clearly displayed the new addition to Rio's left breast -- she attempted to make herself something for dinner. In spite of her best efforts, she just ended up pushing the serving of noodles around her plate anxiously, stomach churning far too much for her to consider enjoying the meal.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time eight-thirty rolled around, Rio couldn't take it anymore. She had tried television, she had tried sitting in the pool room and staring out at the night sky. Frankly, she was going stir-crazy and she needed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, with a kiss to the top of Phin's head, she grabbed her keys and found her way down to the parking garage, wasting no time in peeling out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Going to the barn that early was pointless; she would just sit there, feeling the exact same way she had in that condo as she paced and sighed and checked the time over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Composing a better plan, she chose to drive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Winding her way out of the city, Rio could feel as her heart began to slow and steady a little more in her chest. Her pulse wasn't pounding quite as hard in her neck and the thin layer of sweat that had formed on her brow actually stayed gone when she wiped it away one last time.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't panic, wasn't anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was simply knowing she was less than an hour away from seeing Agatha again. For the time being, she was ignoring the emotional weight that came with that, even as it wreaked havoc on her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     She drove, and then she drove a little more. The moment she finally met country roads, Rio felt a little more at ease. There was no destination for forty minutes, but there was something freeing in the way the night air whipped her hair around as she traversed the countryside with the windows down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon checking the clock for the umpteenth time, Rio had fifteen minutes left. Thankfully, from where she was, it was all the time she would need to make it to where she wanted to be. With a grin that happened for no audience, Rio executed a U-turn in the middle of the road and began her journey to the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she had hypothesized, she turned up before Agatha; the way no light seeped out of the cracks of the front swinging doors only offered affirmation. Parking behind the structure, she shut the headlights off and did the only thing she could: she waited.
    </p>
    <p>
     Punctual as ever, four minutes later at 9:30 on the dot, Rio saw the flicker of headlights as Agatha turned into the drive and bumped her way toward the barn. Instantly, Rio kicked her car door open and tried to get out, annoyed when she was halted in place by the seatbelt she had forgotten to remove in her haste.
    </p>
    <p>
     Climbing out and making a beeline for the corner of the barn, there was a brief shout in the far reaches of her mind. It was a warning, one to not get too far ahead of herself. Running and leaping into Agatha's arms was not going to be the smartest play here and Rio was fully aware of that fact. She had somehow managed to draw Agatha in closer emotionally despite the physical space that had resided between them, and there was no part of Rio that wanted to chance wrecking that by being too physically aggressive.
    </p>
    <p>
     The very second Agatha's SUV came into sight, the door swinging open, Rio felt acutely as her breath caught in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was even more breathtaking was the devastatingly charming and excited grin that filled Agatha's face, even in only the moonlight, as she laid eyes on Rio's corporeal form for the first time in ten days.
    </p>
    <p>
     Surging forward, small pieces of sense seemed to filter back and and while Rio did not run to Agatha, her pace was brisk and surprisingly, Agatha met her halfway.
    </p>
    <p>
     For every bit of restraint that Rio had been trying to show, Agatha didn't seem to care. She, herself, pressed forward and raised her hands to immediately find the angles of Rio's jaw, using that hold to draw her in for a kiss they had both seemingly been
     <em>
      aching
     </em>
     for.
    </p>
    <p>
     God, kissing Agatha had always felt so fucking good, but right then, it felt damn near transcendent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lips were just as warm and full and soft as Rio remembered, but the way her fingertips flexed into Rio's skin made her heart hammer a little harder in her chest. It was a familiar kiss, but it was also... new, somehow. It was desperate, it was hot, it was even bordering on messy, but Rio didn't give a shit. All she cared about was the fact that she could actually
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     how badly Agatha wanted it and needed it through the contact alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't have to say it, but as their lips parted, Rio
     <em>
      did.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "I missed you," she whispered, but instead of choosing to reiterate or elaborate, she chose to initiate another kiss, one that was probably a smidgen too wild for where they stood in front of that barn. Agatha didn't seem to mind, though, and fed that wild and starved energy right back. Before letting it escalate any further, she took a breath of reprieve, but it was simultaneously one that seemed to offer clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let's get inside," she suggested, though her mildly pained expression nearly shouted that she could have pinned Rio to the wooden walls of that barn and had her way with her without a second thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, Rio agreed with a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll get the doors," she offered sweetly, stealing one last chaste kiss before departing to do just that.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took only a moment for her to open them, allow Agatha to drive in, and seal them once more with a soft
     <em>
      click
     </em>
     of the deadbolt. When she turned back, Agatha was already out of the car and closing the space between them. This time, there was no hold on her face but rather, Agatha's arm strongly and securely wrapped around her waist, drawing her in for another delectably fervent kiss that just about set her on fire from head to toe.
    </p>
    <p>
     With little hesitance, Rio's lips parted the second they felt the pressure of Agatha's tongue, clearly begging for access to taste a mouth she had clearly since longed for. Rio let her. Agatha could have done any fucking thing in the world she wanted to right then and Rio would never have voiced a single complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was back, she was there, and she was trying to consume Rio whole with a drugged man passed out in the passenger seat of her SUV.
    </p>
    <p>
     God, this was the fucking life.
    </p>
    <p>
     What an insane thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     That didn't make it any less true, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shifted, pulling Rio closer in a way that caused her to hiss slightly into the kiss, pain radiating from the left side of her chest. Agatha didn't seem to notice, though, and continued to kiss and lick and suck and nibble every bit of Rio's mouth she could get to.
    </p>
    <p>
     That felt like hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt like
     <em>
      desperation.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The attention was too much to contain as Rio nearly melted into Agatha's hold, a deep moan rattling both sets of teeth as it rumbled up her throat. She was falling deeper, crumbling further and then --
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly left with cold lips and an empty mouth, Rio's surprised gasp was immediate and far louder than she thought it might be. Dark and startled eyes flew open to zero in on the woman before her who bore pink cheeks and seemed slightly winded.
    </p>
    <p>
     "As much as I'd love to keep going," Agatha husked at her, gracing her lips with another quick swipe, "I have something to tend to and I fear I may be running out of time."
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a smirk that found her, one that twisted Rio's stomach in delight and caused the dull thrumming between her legs to increase enough that she finally became aware.
    </p>
    <p>
     However disappointed Rio was to finally have Agatha so fucking close and have to let her go, it paled in comparison to knowing what would happen and likely how the rest of the night might go.
    </p>
    <p>
     "One more," Rio requested in a murmur just before sealing the space between them with another heavy and needy kiss. After only a moment, she found just enough resolve to separate the contact and release the tight grips she had formed on Agatha's biceps beyond her own cognition.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a tip of her chin toward the vehicle in silent prodding, Agatha finally let her go, much to both of their chagrin, and began her process. This time, Rio didn't separate herself entirely. No, that was no longer a need to be
     <em>
      too
     </em>
     detached. Not anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of standing back against the far wall, her courage paved the path for her to be a bit closer, though still several feet from Agatha's steel table.
    </p>
    <p>
     The precision that seemed to bleed out of Agatha as she dropped right into a routine she had not had in weeks was nearly tangible, her muscles tensing and flexing as she moved about the space. In the transfer from the vehicle to the table, it was almost as if she were hauling around a bag of potatoes instead of a full grown man that appeared to be slightly taller than she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not wanting to break Agatha's focus but not being able to keep quiet at the same time, Rio posed a question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you work out a lot to kill time while you were gone?" It was genuinely curious, but there was a new energy to Agatha that Rio had not quite seen before when she had undergone her clinic in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's head lifted from her task of transferring the man to the table, a confused expression twisting up her gorgeous features.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, an almost-shy smile filling her features. "When you grabbed me, and even now... you just seem... stronger I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly, the wild grin that lit up Agatha's face caused that prevalent pulsing to begin again between Rio's legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah? And I assume you like that?" she returned, her voice low and thick with her mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, another shrug, but this one took a little more effort to come across as nonchalant. "If you haven't learned yet, I kind of like your penchant for marking your territory."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Noted," Agatha offered in acknowledgement. Not a moment later, she was right back to work, managing to hoist her newest victim onto the table so that she could position him exactly how she needed him.
    </p>
    <p>
     It should have been alarming how positively calm Rio felt in those moments, but she didn't need Agatha to read off this guy's entire rap sheet to know that she had done her research and chosen carefully. It had been weeks at that point; she was not going to fuck up her own source of joy because she simply needed the fix without any thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was calculated; it was one of the things Rio had grown to adore about her. She didn't make entirely rash decisions without some form of reasoning, even in other facets of her life that expanded beyond her deadly hobby.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the man was secured in the bindings, Rio found herself unable to ignore the impulse to step closer, closer than she had ever dared get in their previous encounters. Agatha's head snapped up abruptly as Rio's lower half appeared in her line of vision, an unspoken question written on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Just watching," Rio voiced calmly in explanation. Truthfully, she already knew all that she needed to know, but the idea of a closer look sent a thrill racing up her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     The smirk Agatha bore in the next second did much the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     With no other elaboration required, Agatha grabbed the collar from where it hung, clutching it in one hand as she raised the prongs that then pressed pointedly into the man's chest with the other. Once accomplished, Agatha was almost poetic in the way she moved, sinking the collar down around his neck to
     <em>
      click
     </em>
     it into place. The mere sound caused a ripple of heat to course through Rio's body, ultimately landing yet again between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had long since abandoned the idea that she was a bad person for being complicit in this, mostly because Rio could
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     get behind any reality where Agatha was considered a bad person for what
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Legal or not, what Agatha did was
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     and that was what mattered most in Rio's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her focus locked in on the man on the table, Rio watched as Agatha's hand found enough purchase in the man's hair atop his head, forming a snug but secure grasp. A deadly grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's focus was locked-in, not wavering even the slightest bit from that immobile corpse-to-be. She knew what happened next, and like a dog waiting for a bone, she was practically salivating (behind both pairs of lips) for it to just happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had something else in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio," Agatha beckoned, her voice firm in its request. Rio's gaze did not lift, at least not until Agatha spoke again. "Rio, look at
     <em>
      me.

     "
    </p>
    <p>
     It was not exactly an uncommon ask, but it was typically reserved for when clothes were off and temperatures were raised. It wasn't even that far off from the very first time they'd stepped foot in that barn together and Rio had leapt into the madness that was Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
    <p>
     At least, that was what Rio assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, she was making assumptions when it came to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such a foolish game to try and play.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's real reasoning?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had already thrown herself into too much of this, and while at that point, she had only actually witnessed the true act the second time, Agatha didn't want her to do it again. As she had said that night about the wallet from the man on the pier: She would offer Rio what plausible deniability she could.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, Rio couldn't see it that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, her mind was too clouded with the euphoria she felt at realizing that she and Agatha were in the same room again, that they had
     <em>
      kissed
     </em>
     again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even more than that?
    </p>
    <p>
     She would go ho-- She would go back to
     <em>
      the condo
     </em>
     and she would wait for Agatha to return, even if she made herself five cups of coffee to stay awake in the process, so that she could feel those hands on her skin, those lips on every single spot of her body that Agatha wanted to press them to.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a matter of hours, Rio would be right where she was meant to:
     <em>
      with
     </em>
     Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was all she'd wanted for ten days.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, it was right in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Now
     </em>
     , those blue eyes were looking directly into hers as a very obvious reminder that the distance was gone, at least for now, and they could revel in all that meant in just a short while.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a quick jerk that was only visible to Rio in the way Agatha's arm flexed, it was over, just like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling conflict over it anymore was a moot point, especially given the way her body reacted at simply
     <em>
      knowing
     </em>
     what was happening, even if she hadn't actively watched; all she wanted was to simply teleport back to that massive fucking bed and let Agatha put her hands on her in any fucking way she wanted to.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, there was a time and a place, and Agatha had a process. It was one she had started and as such, it was one she had to finish.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was quiet for a few moments as Agatha worked to unfasten the binds and remove the collar, hanging it up in the exact spot she had pulled it from. Before she loaded him back onto the dolly, however, Rio had a question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you feel better?" she teased softly, her arms still folded over her chest as she beheld the site before her: a dead man and the woman she lo--
    </p>
    <p>
     WOAH.
    </p>
    <p>
     NO.
    </p>
    <p>
     WHAT. THE. FUCK?
    </p>
    <p>
     Nope.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      We are NOT going there, Rio!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Before the horror could paint Rio's pretty features, Agatha both hoisted the man up and answered her at the same time. Thankfully, she did not steal a glance, leaving Rio with a couple of extra seconds to corral her thoughts and try to jam them into the box they had snuck out of, the one she kept at the very back of her mind.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "I do, actually. It's been too long," Agatha voiced, rolling the man toward the back of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time, Rio was shuffling over to meet her as she lifted the hatch. She was careful, cautious to avoid getting too close -- the last thing she needed was any kind of transference; there would be absolutely
     <em>
      no
     </em>
     explaining how any part of her had landed on a victim before he ever got to her table -- but more than a couple of feet between her body and Agatha's felt positively unbearable when they were in the same room.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well," Rio hummed in thought, her attention completely honed in on Agatha as she moved around, relocating the man to the trunk of the vehicle before shutting the hatch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of walking the dolly all the way to its designated space, Agatha pushed it off to the opposite side of the SUV,. Where it landed, it was no longer an obstacle; not only to her when she left, but to her closing the distance between them after so much time apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like lightning, Agatha's focus snapped to Rio, a dashing grin pushing up her cheeks as she surged forward and her arms snaked around Rio's back as if it were their new home.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt so fucking good to be so close, to be
     <em>
      held
     </em>
     by Agatha for even three seconds despite knowing it was only so that she could initiate a hot and hard kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't let herself think that Agatha was holding her just to hold her; no, Agatha needed physical leverage, a way to make sure Rio did not get away from the crushing force of her hot kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That had to be it.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment their lips met again, the hammering in Rio's chest felt so goddamn intense that it nearly sucked the breath from her lungs and deposited it right into Agatha's. The sudden and insatiable feeling that nearly took her over at what it felt like to get unfettered access to the taste of Agatha was nearly so overwhelming that it felt irrational.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <em>
      ridiculous.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet...
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio needed
     <em>
      more.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She needed teeth and tongue and hands and claws.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, the few sessions on the couch as Agatha vocally coached her through what she wanted done had been
     <em>
      hot
     </em>
     , and it had helped carry Rio through those feelings she knew Agatha didn't exactly want to hear. However, at the same time, Rio knew that
     <em>
      nothing
     </em>
     was ever going to compare to what it felt like when Agatha was grabbing at her, or biting at her, or sucking at her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing was ever going to match up to what it felt like to be desired by Agatha, and to get to actually
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     it at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lips parted and tongues met, playful and light upon first contact, but quickly gained heat. It took little time for Agatha's hands to begin to move, sliding down Rio's back and around her sides. As her right hand graced upward, Rio had little time to process before it shifted inward, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Agatha's palm made contact with the fabric that clung to her still-healing nipple, the pained and unstoppable yelp that fell from her was instant. Her head whipped back, cleanly severing the kiss as her eyes flew open in pain. What she saw was a very perplexed and slightly concerned Agatha staring back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand had been removed instantly, and as she processed the interaction, her eyes finally dropped to Rio's chest, shifting over to the left side. There were noticeably three ripples in the fabric, the obvious one of her nipple in the center, as well as one on either side. When the realization finally struck her, Agatha's lips parted into an 'o' shape and her eyes widened before snapping back to Rio's.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio Vidal," she husked in playful admonishment. "Did you get your nipples pierced while I was away?" Her head dropped, their lips gracing every-so-slightly; Rio wouldn't have even called it a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Rio murmured back, taking an actual kiss for herself, one she let linger for
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     a moment longer than was probably necessary. "I got
     <em>
      a
     </em>
     nipple pierced."
    </p>
    <p>
     The flash of recognition in those stunning blue eyes was immediately followed by a rather wicked smirk as it found Agatha's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's why you asked," she deduced, her breath hot on Rio's face, hotter than it might have been otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course it is. I figured what better time than now," she teased back, taking one more kiss out of nothing but pure selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're rotten," Agatha accused jovially; her nose was so close to Rio's that all Rio had to do was turn her head
     <em>
      just barely
     </em>
     to make contact. She almost did it, but simply could not commit for fear of pushing Agatha away.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was too intimate.
    </p>
    <p>
     No matter how fond Rio had grown in Agatha's absence, it did not mean Agatha felt the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, you just offered me motivation to do something I never would have done on my own," Rio corrected lightly with a lax smile on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, tickled pink to reap the benefits in two months," Agatha breathed hotly, pressing her lips against Rio's in a full and rich kiss that seared her from head to toe.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, when the kiss deepened, it was the right breast Agatha chose to palm, essentially melting Rio on the spot. It wasn't quite skin on skin contact, but the neediness and desperation in her grip did enough to make Rio wish that they could climb into the back seat of that SUV and forget about everything that had kept them apart until that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a dead body mere feet away?
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, even Rio had
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     lines she wouldn't cross.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss lingered on for a few long lust-filled moments, Agatha's hands roaming Rio's body while Rio's gripped and tangled in that wild mane of hair she missed far too much to make sense of. When reality found them once more, Agatha's palms rested idly on Rio's hips and their lips finally separated with a soft
     <em>
      smack,
     </em>
     though she stayed close.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I really need to go," Agatha informed her in a soft whine, as if it was something she had absolutely no interest in doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You do," Rio agreed, unable to keep from placing a kiss to the corner of her mouth despite knowing it was probably too soft a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're going back to the condo?" came the low and murmured question.
    </p>
    <p>
     The shock of the inquiry showed on Rio's face as her head pulled back to behold the woman before her, the incredulity etched so clearly into every facial muscle she possessed. "Agatha, I did not spend ten days 'house sitting' for you to not be there when you crawl into bed the first time since coming back."
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a quick flicker of something that resembled giddiness in Agatha's features that lasted but a few seconds before placidity and calm seemed to find her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Does that mean what I think it means?" she questioned, her mischievousness beginning to bubble into her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still so close she could smell the faint scent of grenadine on Agatha's breath, Rio offered a light chuckle and gave a curt nod. "I'm going to go back and tend to Phin, but I'll probably get in bed. It's been... a day," Rio explained, but the disappointment immediately caused Agatha's form to sag. Her grip on Rio's hips tightened the slightest bit, as if to say she
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     something she could not form the words to ask for.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But when you come home, you should wake me up." The statement itself was innocuous, but mostly because Rio wasn't sure how to phrase it so plainly without overstepping any lines. The moment
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     string of words hit Agatha's ears, though, she perked right back up as if her lapse in hope had been nothing more than a blip.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh?" She posed, pulling Rio a little closer so that their fronts pressed, but was cognizant of the fact that Rio's left breast deserved a little more consideration and careful avoidance. "And how should I do that?" As the last word left her, Agatha's head shifted and dropped to the side, her lips brushing along the length of Rio's neck until she reached her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     A quiet but pitched hum of satisfaction vibrated through Rio's pressed lips as she tried to focus on providing an answer, but the kisses Agatha was leaving were
     <em>
      so fucking distracting.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aren't you a rocket scientist?" Rio muttered back. In retaliation, she felt a sharp pain on the side of her neck as Agatha nipped at her skin. A soft gasp fell from her lips, a subconscious hand flying up to land in her hair. "I'm --
     <em>
      mmm,
     </em>
     " she attempted, but was stalled by the way Agatha's tongue laved over the bite. "I'm sure you'll figure
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     out."
    </p>
    <p>
     There was an invitation there, one that Rio was not quite sure how to vocalize. As though they were tuned into the same frequency, Agatha seemed to catch on. This was indicated by the very quick jerk of her head as it snapped up, wild blue irises nearly being swallowed whole by enlarged pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
     What met her was a dangerous smirk and an equally dark stare, one that held a challenge in it, maybe even a dare.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's gaze stuttered, sweeping back and forth, up and down over every inch of Rio's face to try and read the implications behind such a declaration. After only a moment, she found her voice although it was low and soaked in her arousal.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh princess," she breathed, reaching up to tuck a few strands of Rio's hair behind her ear. "Are you telling me you want to wake up with me inside of you?" Those words were pointed and sharp, but they were curious and clearly seeking out explicit clarification.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hearing it stated so plainly washed Rio in a red tint, a heat-spurred pinkness that flushed every visible -- and not visible -- inch of her skin. It
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     what she had been insinuating, but the way it fell from Agatha's lips somehow only amplified the fantasy.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was something Rio had thought about, dreamed of, but in any physical or romantic relationship she'd attempted to develop previously, the comfort had never truly amassed enough for her to actually
     <em>
      ask
     </em>
     for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     With Agatha, things were different.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Agatha didn't know that, or maybe she'd overheard her conversation with Alice. Either way, it didn't really matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Rio, in her chest, she
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     she could trust Agatha in that capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
     She
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she delivered her quippy response, Rio lips were demanding of another kiss. It was one she took of her own volition, only ending it by sinking her teeth into Agatha's lower lip to give it a hearty tug as she pulled away.
    </p>
    <p>
     "See?" she murmured, close enough that her lips brushed against Agatha's when she spoke. "I knew you were smart." With another playful nip and a light pat to Agatha's chest, Rio pulled away and stepped back so that she could allow Agatha to tend to the rest of her work.
    </p>
    <p>
     The look on Agatha's face was completely struck, like she had been coursing with lightning since the very moment she'd understood the suggestion. For a moment, Rio almost considered the idea that she could read Agatha's mind through that wild look in her eyes. If she had to guess, there was a voice in the back of Agatha's mind, screaming.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was demanding to know the answer to one question:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      WHY THE FUCK DO I HAVE A DEAD BODY IN THE TRUNK OF MY CAR?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lust was palpable and the way she finally found movement enough to lick her lips sent a spike of wanting directly between Rio's legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will see you at the condo, then?" Rio offered, not hesitating to take a few steps in the direction of the barn doors, her hungry gaze dancing with lights of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quickly, Agatha's expression shifted and those eyes grew stormy with desire. "Not soon enough," she grumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then I suppose you should hurry it up," Rio called over her shoulder while pushing the large wooden doors. With that, she cast one more alluring glace to the woman behind her, a daring smile playing up her lips, and disappeared through the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
     After only a few seconds, her head poked back the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "By the way..." she offered, causing Agatha's head to jerk back, chin over her shoulder, as she began to climb in the car. "If you just want a late night snack, that's okay. I know you prefer that I look you in the eyes when you're inside."
    </p>
    <p>
     She did not stick around, did not stay positioned with her head in the empty space long enough to visually gauge Agatha's reaction, but something else happened that gave her away anyway:
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the loud smack of flesh on metal as Agatha slapped the side of the SUV, releasing a grunt of pent-up sexual frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she made her way to her own car, all Rio could do was chuckle through her smirk, already minutely aware of the fate that awaited her once Agatha returned home, truly home.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she could not have been more excited.
    </p>

    <p>
     Electric.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt positively
     <em>
      electric
     </em>
     from the moment she started her car until she -- for the last time in the foreseeable future -- stepped out of that elevator into an empty condo.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was empty, but wouldn't be in a couple of hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a couple of hours, all would be right in the world and Agatha would be right where she belonged. As it turned out, that meant two things.
    </p>
    <p>
     One thing: She would be within the walls of her home where she could exist as her whole self with no fear of scrutiny from the outside world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Second thing that Rio absolutely would not allow to breach her lips: She would be with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who was Rio trying to fool? There was no hiding it anymore; that trip had changed a lot of things. In fact, it had changed
     <em>
      so many things
     </em>
     that Rio was not actually sure might have changed, had Agatha not needed to leave. Work would always be an important part of her life, Rio had come to realize, but if they could so easily navigate her absence for two weeks?
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe there was hope for them yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finding Phineas in the bedroom, curled up right below Agatha's pillow, Rio felt a gentle fluttering in her chest that only repeated itself when she turned on the nightstand light, soft gaze falling right back to that little collar around his neck. She was still a little mystified that he had not wanted to get it off badly enough -- if he had, it would have been laying somewhere else in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Strange, Rio thought, that there was no resistance or pushback on something he usually was not fond of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hm. Rio supposed she could empathize with that, at least when it came to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      But I don't have a pretty collar to show for it.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought crossed her mind and caused a jolt of searing heat to rocket up her spine; her fingers stilled in their work of stroking Phin's fur as she just blinked down at his form on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, that was certainly a thought to think. One that maybe Rio should have tried to...
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     think, for a few reasons, but mainly that the undeniable yearning that completely drowned her before she finally exhaled a breath she did not realize she had been holding.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had only been a few months, and even less time since they had been properly acquainted. That was a fact that Rio tried to use as a very blatant reminder of what she was doing with her life, and what she was doing with Agatha. She had spent so long convincing herself that it was purely physical, that nothing real
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     ever grow between them, but there was a reason for that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite how fond of Agatha Rio had found herself to be, she'd always had a sneaking suspicion that Agatha could have very well been a sociopath. She knew that she was in no place to be making such a diagnosis and for the most part, she'd been able to silence those thoughts. What she was starting to understand, however, was that what Agatha experienced was more along the lines of alexithymia, if she
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     to put a word to it.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were a couple of reasons for that realization, but none more than Agatha's rigidness and need for structure. Agatha had never outright said it, and Rio had found cognizance in the fact that perhaps she might not even know herself, but there was a likelihood that in the insanity of her youth, things about that beautiful brain of hers had gone unnoticed and undiagnosed.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't like the mother who killed her child's only friend and buried him behind their home would have cared enough to get a better understanding of the things that went on in Agatha's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     The point was moot, now, wasn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was literally a successful rocket scientist, no matter how forged the degree, and she had made a life for herself that kept her afloat. Rio wasn't sure she would have labeled it as fulfilling or enriching, but it had been enough to get Agatha by.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had sat at that too-large table or looked out those massive windows and had known her place in the world, that she was at the top of it. She would dunk her ankles in the pool for a short while, or find herself perched on a stool in her restoration room. She would drink her coffee and blend her smoothies and sit at the island while she researched her next target. She had floated about her domain -- and only hers -- for God knew how long before she allowed Rio into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now, Rio wasn't sure how she was ever going to be able to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     U-Hauling
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     a thing, but there was no reality in existence where that would
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     be considered a good idea when it pertained to the two of them. Agatha was a wealthy, intelligent, driven, busy woman and Rio was
     <em>
      still
     </em>
     trying to convince herself that there was no place for her in that life long term.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, as she paced around the ridiculously huge bed and began to strip down, a catch of fabric against her tender nipple made her recall something she had previously overlooked.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Tickled pink to reap the benefits in two months."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I
     </em>
     <em>
      n two months."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "T
     </em>
     <em>
      wo months."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     For every single time Rio tried to convince herself that there was no possible way to make this enigma between them last, Agatha was quietly and contextually offering hints that she was not of the same mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     That, for example, was far more telling than it might have been for anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two months technically was not a lot of time.
     <em>
      However...
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha saying that as if it were as easy as breathing was the truly remarkable feat there. It had been so thoughtless, so
     <em>
      earnest
     </em>
     in her intention. Rio had physically modified her body because she knew it was something Agatha might like; the least Agatha could do was stick around to enjoy the perks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then again, that felt dismissive of the way that Agatha had all but lit up under the haze of the moon the moment they saw one another again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way the moonlight had glimmered in her eyes, the way her smile had completely illuminated every inch of her face? They had done things to Rio's heart that she was more than ashamed to admit. She knew she was in far too deep -- and a whole hell of a lot deeper than Agatha was -- and yet, she wanted to keep sinking, keep dropping lower and lower until she found herself nestled in the depths of all that Agatha Harkness could be.
    </p>
    <p>
     With at least two months on the horizon, dangling in front of her like a treat, maybe Agatha might start to want to sink into Rio, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once in the nude, Rio took only a few moments to wash off in the shower before toweling off and climbing into bed. Both phones had been idle on the nightstand, no ding or hum to signify any attention. Atop that duvet, attention was all Rio craved.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although she closed her eyes and finally began to let the exhaustion of her anxiety seep into her bones, falling asleep immediately was not a tick on Rio's body that evening. She was still, just listening to the soft sounds of Phin's dream-induced chirping, but she couldn't stop thinking about Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her arms on full display by means of the dress she had been wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hair, wild and messy yet not making her look disheveled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes, so fucking bright and burning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands, so damn strong and desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lips, hot and warm and full and familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everything about Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Always.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somewhere in the midst of her exhaustion-fueled immersion into her memories, Rio's hand had wandered up her stomach and came to rest on the left side of her chest. She gave a light pinch to her nipple and thought about the look Agatha wore as she realized the choice Rio had made in relation to her body while she had been away, a soft moan spilling from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind then wandered, slowly slinking to the realization of what was awaiting her when Agatha arrive back from her night of thrill and normalcy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another pinch, another moan, and an opposing hand that began to slide down the peaks and valleys of Rio's abdomen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her own hand dropping lower.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Contact. Wet, wet contact.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Another moan spilled from her, though it was nowhere near loud enough to rouse the slumbering cat beside her -- whom she had forgotten about entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Attentively circling her clit with a light but present touch, her knees bent slightly to open herself a bit more, though her target audience was still driving around the city somewhere, or creeping around a cemetery.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was probably using those strong and toned arms to haul a deceased piece of scum to the foot of a grave of someone he had wronged.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was probably utilizing that solid core between her breasts and pelvis to arrange him just the way she wanted him.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was probably tying her hair back with the thin fabric hair tie that Rio had noticed she kept on the gear shift the night they'd sat in her car and talked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she was even thinking about the naked woman in her bed that she would be coming back to who had gotten a nipple piercing simply because she'd opened the door to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The further down she spiraled, the quicker Rio's circling became. Her breathing hitched, her back arched and a weak-willed whine escaped her as she imagined what it was going to feel like when Agatha touched her again after so long apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Would she grab her harder? Would she still want to choke her? Would she mark her up the way Rio had come to ache for? Would she make her feel even more reprieve that they were so close again?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew the answers to all of those questions was likely the same: yes.
    </p>
    <p>
     With such certainty came her imminent orgasm, washing over her in the most blissful waves. Her moans were loud enough that Phineas had decided he'd had enough and leapt off of the bed to run out the bedroom door. His agenda had immediately become finding somewhere to hide if that was the kind of ruckus he was going to be enduring.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, he had no clue.
    </p>
    <p>
     As her limbs quelled in their trembling and her chest began to slow in its rise and descent, clarity seemed to find her once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     She needed to go to sleep. She needed to close her eyes, breathe in the cool air of the condo that smelled faintly of Palo Santo and let herself drift off.
    </p>
    <p>
     But first!
    </p>
    <p>
     She rolled over to her side, swiping up the burner from the top of the nightstand and turning on the lamp that sat near it. With a decision made and a rather mischievous idea in mind, Rio wiggled her way down the mattress enough that she could lift her arm, phone secured tightly in her grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the front facing camera on, Rio adjusted enough to catch the majority of her body -- nipple piercing included -- in frame, the grin she wore being the only visible bit of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     With several taps to the screen, Rio composed a quick message of accompaniment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Your midnight snack awaits you, my queen. xx."
    </p>
    <p>
     That grin suddenly bordered on feral as she tapped the 'send' icon and watched as the message appeared, processed, and then successfully delivered. Pleased with herself, she set the ringer to silent and discarded the phone so that she could shut off the light and settle into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bed that would have Agatha in it when she woke up the next time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe, if she was lucky in the morning, Agatha might let her snuggle in again.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was the last thing that seemed to float, light like a feather, around her mind before she fell asleep.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     "
     <em>
      Christ,
     </em>
     " came a frustrated -- and maybe slightly pissed off -- grunt, strong arms wrapped snugly around the tree trunk of a dead man that had been stowed in the back hatch of Agatha's SUV.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you gain twenty pounds on the drive over?!" It was a snarl, low and unintelligible from more than a foot or so away, but Agatha didn't care. She knew there was no one around, knew that no one would have heard her even if she
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     a bit louder. All she had to do was drop, position, verify and make her exit.
    </p>
    <p>
     The clean-up would follow.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a couple more soft grunts, Agatha managed to relocate the man's corpse to where it needed to be, dropping him with little care to the ground. She had no respect for him, no reason to be gentle with him whether he was dead or alive. He had met his end as all things did, and now, it was time to display her prize.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't take trophies, didn't keep things from her victims. Even in spite of the fact that she had taken the man at the pier's wallet, it wasn't something she practiced in when it came to her normal routine. What came into the bar with the man would always remain with them until found. They would be tagged, bagged, and loaded into the back of Alice's transport to wind up on Rio's autopsy table.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio would probably smirk as she admired Agatha's work.
    </p>
    <p>
     Silently, she placed herself at the man's feet and bent at the waist, arranging him exactly the way she wanted him. His heels were together, toes pointed up, and his arms were straight at his sides, palms flat against the ground. Lastly, planting by his head, Agatha pushed his eyelids open so he was left staring at a utopia he would never reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Satisfied, Agatha slapped her hands together as if she were dusting them off, clearing away the toxicity of the blight she had now officially disposed of.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she climbed back into the SUV, her mind fell to one place and one place only: Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ruminating there for a moment, Agatha felt flooded all over again with intense affection when she recalled the sight of Rio in the moonlight as she had come around the corner of the barn. It had been overwhelming in the best way, but overwhelming all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     The truth was, Agatha just didn't like people. She had her reasons, clearly, but it had been how she had always chosen to operate. She kept her distance, sourced pleasured solely from the physical and kept moving. She lived in a condo that was very obviously too big for just herself and fell asleep in a bed so big it made Agatha feel like her own resolute island in the middle of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha liked the solitude. She liked the quiet she could control when the one in her own head was unattainable. She liked not having to answer to anyone or to follow any rule anyone might have tried to issue her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, she liked it when Rio was there, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     She liked the way her skin smelled of peaches and jasmine, the way her hair waved a bit more when it air-dried as opposed to when she used a blow dryer. She liked when Rio would float about the condo like she owned it, little question in her mind that she did not belong. It had been the weekend before Taiwan, and Agatha had seen it so, so many times when she could occasionally check in via the security cameras.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not going home to an empty condo was a new experience for her, something that had never once happened in her adult life. That was something that, while it
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     a break in routine, it wasn't an uncomfortable one. It wasn't one that caused Agatha to panic or get angry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, the idea of going home to Rio brought only an ethereal sense of peace that Agatha did not quite know what to do with.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had led a peaceful life -- well, hobby aside -- and yet, this was drastically different. It wasn't a quiet, or a sense of being alone. It was a comfort of the understanding and care that awaited her at the end of a seventy-two floor elevator ride.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the smallest upward twitch of her lips, Agatha started the SUV and swiped up her phone from the center console to check the time. Seeing it was just after midnight, her gaze dropped to see that she had an awaiting message from Rio's burner phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     With an attachment.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Agatha unlocked her phone and opened the message, an involuntary moan left her at what she saw, thankfully contained by the rolled-up windows of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, in every striking bit of her naked glory, was the woman who had waited for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a life where Agatha
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     nothing to be tied to and where no one chose to care when she came and went, Agatha actually felt missed. Sure, that mouth-watering photo was a vivid reminder of the carnal, the pleasure, the lust... But it was also a very clear showing that Rio was there, in her home and in her life, and she had no plans of going anywhere too far, anywhere Agatha couldn't chase.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, wasn't that poetic?
    </p>
    <p>
     The hunted had become the hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
     While backwards, it felt... Right. Rio felt right.
    </p>
    <p>
     That hungry gaze drank in every detail of that photo from the glinting silver on her left nipple to the way the light beside her created the most delicious shadows down her body. She had been carved of gold, of that Agatha was convinced. She was beautiful, of course, but everything about her seemed to glint even in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was a treasure, and Agatha was selfish.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted Rio. All of her. She wanted the hot and heavy nights, but she wanted the idle days where the television droned on and they focused on other things, too. She wanted the biting and sucking and fucking, but she also wanted the knee bumping and coffee drinking at the kitchen island. She wanted those dark eyes that could be black in the more primal moments, but that could be soft in their reverence, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had been wanting something new in her life for a while, but she hadn't been able to decide what it was. While she absolutely would have never considered the idea of that want being a companion, life had a way of catching her by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio had a dogonned determination to know everything she could know, including the answer to a riddle that had made her work life drive her insane. With that determination, she'd found what she had been after. Maybe she'd gotten a little more than she bargained for in the sense that surely she had never considered the idea that she would find connection, but so had Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     There had never been a doubt in Agatha's mind that no one would ever
     <em>
      get
     </em>
     her; being misunderstood was an important part to hiding who she was behind the forged degree and fake ID, but Rio?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had always seen right through her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every single time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The text below the image filled her face with a dangerous grin, her eyes shimmering with an undulated affection that she was thankful did not choose to present itself in front of Rio and was reserved for the solitude of the car only.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she didn't know how to form those three words in succession, and Agatha had never actually
     <em>
      missed
     </em>
     anyone in her life, but the bottomless longing she'd felt while on the other side of the world had been... something.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she wound down for the night and opened her laptop, she knew that Rio knew she was watching. It was in those little tossed glances toward the lenses and the small smirks that would find her when she would right herself from feeding Phineas in her underwear. When she woke in the morning, the first thing she did was check in; by her third night away, it was almost a compulsion, something she
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     to do before she could start her day.
    </p>
    <p>
     There Rio would be, lounging on the couch with Phin on her stomach, or sitting at the edge of the pool with her legs in the water. Sometimes she stood at the window and looked out on the water, posture slack despite the way she often held onto herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Realizing that her marvelling was only stalling the inevitable, an inevitable she
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     , Agatha tucked the phone away again and set off toward a detailing garage tucked away in a dark corner of the city. It belonged to a connection, someone who had helped her out a time or two when she needed a new vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't take her long, but the interior had been thoroughly scrubbed and vacuumed, looking almost as if it had just rolled off the lot. With that, she could finally,
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     find her way home. Her way to her safe haven, her comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could also find her way back to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe those two things had more similarities than Agatha was ready to admit to even herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she had parked and strode into the elevator, it was nearing two in the morning. She knew without question that Rio was still asleep; she hadn't received any further bratty text messages and so she felt it to be a safe assumption. On the way up, something within her felt restless but not nervous and it showed in the way she paced the small space, back and forth until the soft
     <em>
      ding
     </em>
     sounded above her and the doors pulled open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing the interior of her own home washed in the moonlight filled her chest with an unfamiliar fondness, one she did not exactly understand. Her foot crossed the threshold in that decorative heel and the sound that reverberated from below her helped her realize why.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, at the base of the doors, sat a poised and attentive Phineas, as if he had been waiting for her to come home. The grin that spread her lips and showed teeth at her welcoming committee was far softer than almost anything she had ever managed before in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, hello. Are you my welcoming party?" she cooed at him. Her voice was low, just above a whisper as she continued into the foyer area so that she could lean on the decorative table to remove her heels. In the process, Phin had paced to her and rubbed against the leg that had been supporting her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was sweet, honestly. Agatha had never considered herself much of a pet person, but in her mission to win over the wily feline, he had accidentally won her over, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     With both shoes removed, her full attention was on him as she bent and scooped him up -- heavy little fucker given that he was a
     <em>
      cat
     </em>
     -- so that she could both cradle him and scratch behind his ears, her palm canvassing the back of his thick neck. In response, all he did was close his eyes and purr as if there were a boat engine in his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thank you for the greeting. You're a pretty sweet boy, aren't you? I should never listen to your mom when she calls you a menace, hm?" Her hand shifted as she began to glide toward the kitchen, finding the drawer where Rio had stashed the cat treats she'd bought with the last batch of groceries.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled the small tube of pate out and brought it up to her mouth, tearing the top off with her teeth; with him secure in her hold, two handing it hadn't been an option. Once it was open, she pinched at the bottom and watched as his nose began to twitch, focus snapping toward the treat as Agatha held it up for him to devour.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now, when you're done with this, I'll open the spare room door for you and you can hide in the back corner. You'll probably want to. For a couple of hours at least."
    </p>
    <p>
     He was a cat. He had no fucking clue what she was saying. It was still sage advice, regardless. She almost pitied him; if he couldn't tuck into the farthest corner of the condo, he was likely not going to be thrilled with the sounds that were going to be wearing on for the next few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took less than a minute for him to consume the treat in its entirety and though she fought the urge to kiss his head for the briefest moment, she did not and carried him toward the spare room. Once all four paws were on the floor, she pushed the door open and offered a nod of encouragement to coax him inside. With a quick glance of consideration, he zipped inside and Agatha was alone in the hallway again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Drawing in a steadying breath, Agatha's gaze lifted to the door on the other side of the living space, open and waiting for her to walk through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanting nothing else in the world, that was exactly what she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or at least, she got there and then stilled directly within it at the view before her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Folding her arms, Agatha leaned against the door frame in a beat of adoration and appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
     There on the left side of that massive bed, Rio was flat on her back and completely naked from head to toe. The lamp on Agatha's nightstand had been left on and dimly illuminated the luscious and full curves of her breasts, the valleys and peaks of her abdomen. There was space between her ankles, but it was a lax posture that also had resulted with one hand flat on the bed and the other resting in the center of her chest. Her lips were parted, but it did not look like her mouth was actually open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bare and beautiful, Agatha found herself stricken with awe in the most confounding way.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she saw Rio, she saw the connection for her, the one Rio so clearly felt. She saw the intellectual stimulation, the thrill of the chase, the eagerness to keep learning. She saw that Rio had found something she liked, something she kept liking and had even grown to
     <em>
      want.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That was one hell of a concept.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted the murderer, the planner, the meticulous thinker. She wanted
     <em>
      Agatha.
     </em>
     Not Amelia. Rio wanted Agatha. It was that simple.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time, it wasn't simple at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     There had been a moment, over the weekend, that she knew she had not meant to bear witness to. She had done a quick check of the cameras out of nothing more than habit, something she had since wished she could take back.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she stood there, watching Rio's chest so slowly rise and fall with her slumbered breathing, Agatha was struck cleanly in the chest with a startling realization.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and Alice had bantered about it, but Rio had made the admission that in the majority of her relationships, she did not prefer to take. Rio was a giver, someone who liked providing in that sense, and yet, Agatha
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     would have known, if not for that conversation. The way Rio was so pliant, so ready to take whatever it was Agatha had to give her --
     <em>
      whatever
     </em>
     Agatha had to give her -- Agatha had simply assumed that it was an intricate piece to her sense of self. What she knew now was that Rio was making choices.
    </p>
    <p>
     Much in the same way that Agatha had tried to make choices to contribute toward the efficacy of their situation, Rio did the same, but she did so quietly. She made them in a way that made Agatha think them normal to who she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, asleep in that big bed, Rio was making another choice.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was choosing to trust Agatha. She was in the most vulnerable position, asleep and detached from consciousness, and yet she had clearly voiced her desire to be touched, to be worshipped, to be devoured. She had asked, and then she had followed through. Agatha would be the world's biggest idiot to not honor it for everything it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pushing off the frame of the doorway, Agatha finagled the zipper of the dress down and slipped out of it, leaving it in a puddle of fabric on the floor. Without stopping her stride, Agatha made a decision. That decision carried her right into the closet, flipping the light on as she passed the switch.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shuffled toward the back and bent to lift the lid of her chest, making a quick selection of one of the dildos that she had figured out was Rio's preferred choice. After grabbing a harness and a bottle of lube, the light was back off and she emerged in the bedroom, clad only in the thong she'd slid on earlier in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Agatha could not do was give herself time to overthink it. She knew what Rio had said, what she had requested, and what she had given permission for. Getting nervous at that point wouldn't have done Agatha any good, and it certainly would not have done Rio any, either. So, Agatha made her way to the foot of the bed, standing in the middle so that the toss of the three items from the closet landed a little closer to the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze shifted, drinking in the sight of Rio before her, from her manicured toes to the tousled mess of hair atop of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was
     <em>
      Agatha's
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     For the taking, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every movement made was careful and cautious, knees shifting in ways that would minimize disturbances until she found herself straddling one of Rio's legs in a way that enabled her to lean over. With her hair tied back and out of her face from the effort of cleaning the car, it made it a little easier and less intrusive when her lips brushed faintly over Rio's forehead, her left cheek and then right, her chin and her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was an easing, but it was light enough that it didn't seem to offer enough reason to stir. With that baseline established, it was easier for Agatha to dig up a little more courage. Those lips moved, brushing over the warm skin of Rio's neck, down to her collarbones. One hand raised to support her weight, planting just far enough from Rio's form as to not cause the mattress to sink. The other was damn near feather-light in its skating up Rio's ribcage, tender fingers lightly gripping the flesh of her left breast while steering clear of the still-healing nipple.
    </p>
    <p>
     The lower Agatha's kisses traveled, the warmer they got until those soft lips were hungry for more. Pursing around a stiff and unpiereced nipple, the tip of her tongue flicked over it
     <em>
      just barely;
     </em>
     while she was being intentionally too-gentle, the move still drew a slight shifting from the woman below her, the quietest little whine echoing in the hollow of her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly, Agatha felt as though she had leapt into a raging volcano, heat searing her from head to toe. Rio did not otherwise move, but the tiny twitches and that sound? For the first time, Agatha considered that
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     might be the one that wouldn't make it out of this alive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lips unlatched from Rio's bare breast and resumed their journey, peppering soft kisses down the length of her torso until they branched off to her left hip. There were no nips, no hickeys left. That wasn't what that particular moment was about. It wasn't about Agatha wanting to get so fucking lost in Rio's pleasure as well as her own. It wasn't even about actually
     <em>
      fucking
     </em>
     Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, it was about showing Rio that she was missed, even if Agatha couldn't quite form the words to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lips brushed tenderly down the top of one thigh and up the inside of the other, this time drawing another mild reaction in the form of Rio's body tensing and then relaxing in the next second. As Agatha repositioned herself, Rio's leg hitched just enough on its own to allow Agatha to settle on both knees between her calves, as if she somehow
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     what was coming, even still asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Agatha's wanting gaze raked down Rio's body one last time before settling on the prize: a very cum-soaked patch of hair that housed nothing more than sheer desire.
    </p>
    <p>
     Attentive to every single pressure applied to the mattress beneath her, Agatha lowered herself to the bed and took station on her stomach, head dropping to exactly where it needed to be. Her lips were only an inch or so away from Rio's waiting sex, but she had also arranged her body so that she could have access to a set of digits, should Rio wake prematurely.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a slow inhale, Agatha let herself be taken for just a few seconds by the heady scent of Rio's desire. Rio's desire for
     <em>
      her.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Without waking her, Agatha wiggled her arm forward, her first two fingers swiping between Rio's folds to gauge what it was she was getting herself into only to find herself nearly sick with lust at just how fucking wet she was. Something in her just
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     that RIo had pleasured herself before succumbing to sleep and it only made her more desperate, only filled her with more of that aching hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
     No longer able to restrain herself, Agatha's hand retreated and was immediately replaced with her hot and starved mouth, tongue slipping between folds to meet a sweet but familiar taste. The immediate intoxication Agatha felt at the simplicity of the act and what it instilled within her was disorienting, but it was also amplified as a low rumble sounded above her and Rio's legs stirred slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The movement was minimal and stilled after a moment, but another sound emitted from her, low and pitched in its whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was nothing more than encouragement for Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her tongue was lax but lush in its strokes, long and flat in its journey from entrance to just below Rio's clit. It was a way for her to taste all of what she wanted and yet, not offer too much stimulation as to startle her into consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another few moments wore that were soft and slow, nothing more than Agatha utilizing her tongue and lips to kiss and lick at the most intimate part of her lover. It was unhurried and yet, something in her flared each and every time Rio would move the tiniest amount or offer a pleasured squeak that she could not control.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had debated snaking a hand down her own body, but before she could, something startled her out of her cum-driven haze.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was RIo.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was speaking, saying something.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It'slikethat," she slurred, her palm sliding over ribs to grip at her uninjured breast. Agatha's eyes snapped upward, but instead of finding Rio's black gaze staring back at her, she realized something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was still asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was talking. In her sleep. Again.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this time, whatever dream she was having was definitely
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     about green marbles or Phineas eating all of the cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever dream Rio was having, she was feeling
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     within it. Maybe that was because she was feeling good outside of it, too, she just didn't realize it.
    </p>
    <p>
     That thought alone was enough to make Agatha feel as though she was going to cum spontaneously, without ever even touching her own body. There was something about it, though, about the idea that she was making Rio feel
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     good that it had slipped into her subconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had every intention of resuming her task, but another vocalization pulled at her attention first.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Goooooooooooo."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     So, go she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's attention was still attentive and thought-out, but it was far more intentional. Gone were the prolonged moments of her avoiding the main pleasure center at the apex of Rio's inner labia, Agatha's tongue finding it with ease as it began the ministrations needed to bring RIo where she needed to go.
    </p>
    <p>
     The twitches grew in frequency and Rio had started to shift a little too much for Agatha to think that she was not beginning to wake, but she did not slow down or stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment she felt a hand snap to land in her hair, she knew she had been right. Those bright blue eyes flew open in the dim light of the room, landing right into those black and mystified ones that were staring directly back at her. That wasn't the most prevalent thing that Agatha noticed, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, that was the absolute shocked pleasure completely covering Rio's entire expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     With their eyes locked and a full understanding that Rio was fully alert and awake, Agatha made her move.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shifting again to scoot her arm forward, that gaze never wavered from Rio's as her first two fingers slipped easily inside of Rio's tight and fluttering core. While Agatha had absolutely been fueled by the eye contact, there was something even more satisfying about the way Rio's head dropped back into the cradle of her pillow and a strangled moan landed right in Agatha's ears, driving her on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those fingers were slow in their steady thrusting and curling, but Agatha had already been too aware of just how close Rio had been to cumming even before she was awake.
    </p>
    <p>
     When it took less than another minute to bring her to climax with the team of Agatha's tongue and fingers inside of her, Agatha absolutely could have razzed her for it, or given her a hard time, but there was no point.
     <em>
      Technically,
     </em>
     if Agatha were being honest, that was actually the longest Rio had lasted out of all the times they'd been physical.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was kind of proud.
    </p>
    <p>
     That could be a heckling for a more appropriate moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     In that moment, Agatha withdrew her fingers and lifted her head, scrutinizing gaze searching over every inch of Rio's body and what of her face she could see, trying to gauge how it had all landed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's chest continued to heave in her pleasure, but the moment she seemed to find herself again, she surprised Agatha yet again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a  slight wrinkle in her brow, Agatha lifted herself enough that she could begin the trek back up RIo's body, not faltering despite the way it was still trembling with her giggles. By the time Agatha reached the apex of her ribcage, she had actually started laughing, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, with her face over Rio's, their lips met for the fifth time that night, but their laughter prevented it from becoming anything that could have
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     been called a kiss. It was playful, it was silly, and although it felt foreign, Agatha welcomed the warmth that came along with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmm, hello princess," Agatha murmured richly, vibrating Rio's lips with her quiet crooning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hi, my queen," Rio whispered back at her, stealing what was more of a kiss than that first contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instilling more space between their mouths, Agatha chose to keep close and pressed a light kiss to Rio's cheek before she spoke again, tones hushed in accordance with her question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you want to go back to sleep?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Another laugh, though that one was dripping with allure.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Absolutely not," Rio offered in return, licking her lips. "That was just a warm up."
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Agatha's earlier sentiment was correct:
    </p>
    <p>
     She was
     <em>
      definitely
     </em>
     not making it out of there alive.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>

   <!--chapter content-->
   <div>
    <p>
     "Are you ready to sleep, my queen?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The inquiry was hardly a hum as it floated out from between Rio's lips, her hands having come to cradle both of Agatha's cheeks. It felt
     <em>
      so good
     </em>
     just to touch her, to feel her, to know that she was
     <em>
      right there
     </em>
     , their bodies brushing every so slightly with the way Agatha was supporting herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh no, no," Agatha chimed back, her quiet tone almost dangerous. She swiped her lips across Rio's in a way that caused her body to ripple with tiny little pinpricks that induced chicken-skin over every inch of her body. "In fact, I brought options."
    </p>
    <p>
     That sure as hell sounded like the most promising threat Rio had ever heard in her life. When Agatha began to
     <em>
      show
     </em>
     to prove her
     <em>
      tell
     </em>
     by pulling away, Rio wasn't quite so ready to let her go. One of her hands swooped around the back of Agatha's neck, fingertips greedily pressing into muscle to keep her stilled. The question in her blue eyes appeared before it ever thought to release in sound, but Rio answered without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a grin bordering on heinous, she lifted her head, kissing Agatha again -- a true,
     <em>
      real
     </em>
     kiss -- in a way that displayed just how fucking grateful she was to have Agatha, and everything that entailed, back with her once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been hard missing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Way harder than Rio
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     would have considered before her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was risky.
    </p>
    <p>
     But if this was the reward?
    </p>
    <p>
     Worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The wetness and sloppiness of that shared lip lock only grew the longer Rio refused to stop. Thankfully, Agatha seemed to be of the same mind, one of her hands finding Rio's side, sliding up and down in a caress that all but screamed that it was something she was glad to be doing after so long of not having the ability.
    </p>
    <p>
     After just long enough that her lips started to ache, Rio's head dropped back to the pillow, a dopey and still sleepy grin stretching across her lips. Her eyes fluttered open to behold Agatha above her, but Agatha was faster, dropping to steal
     <em>
      one more kiss
     </em>
     before pushing herself back to her knees. Once planted firmly, Rio lifted her head to watch as Agatha curved backward, a perfect arch that puffed out those toned abs and perfect breast, but the gymnastic pose clearly had a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once righted, Agatha had gathered something from a corner of the bed. Her hand raised, clutching both the dildo she had selected as well as the harness, a proud and ornery grin lighting her up more than her nightstand light ever could.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's gaze dropped to it and for once, the immediate thrill did not write itself on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, full lips pressed inward and worried against one another as Rio's thoughts began to pick up speed in the laps they were running within her head. Would it have been absolutely fucking incredible to let Agatha slide into that harness and fuck her stupid until the sun came up? Of course it would, without a question to be had.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, Rio thought, maybe that wouldn't have actually
     <em>
      shown
     </em>
     Agatha what it was she wanted her to know.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to be closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted Agatha to
     <em>
      let
     </em>
     her be closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was fully aware that those two things might have existed on opposite ends of a spectrum.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only way she was ever going to find out what was acceptable -- as she had learned earlier in the evening -- was to ask. If her need to be closer turned out to simply be
     <em>
      too
     </em>
     close for Agatha's liking, then a no would more than suffice. Rio had no intentions of pushing for the things she wanted, knowing that they could be worked on in time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Realizing she had almost taken too long to find a response, dark eyes swept up Agatha's gorgeous face and landed in those depthless blue pools, hands landing gently on her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have something else in mind," Rio voiced softly, encouraging fingertips sinking into Agatha's skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's response?
    </p>
    <p>
     A slightly pinched brow and a cocking of her head toward Rio's left side. It was clear she was curious, light dancing in her gaze at the same time her lips hitched into a sly smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh? And what might that be?" her tone was inquisitive, but bore a huskiness that made Rio's core flutter involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio already knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     She already knew that what she wanted was far more than she should have asked for, far more intimate than Agatha would probably ever let her, and still she could not help herself. It was too large a want to not at least ask, but there was perhaps a need for her to preface it first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Darting back and forth from one side to the other, Rio searched Agatha's gaze for the longest moment, trying to find the right way to press forward. Before she could settle on suitable phrasing, a possessed question spilled from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you trust me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a kicked oil barrel, Rio could see the implications of her question as they spilled out around them, pooling and making a bigger and bigger mess. What the fuck had come over her that she'd asked
     <em>
      that?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a heavy question and yet, Agatha looked... almost amused?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, Aladdin," she fired back sarcastically, lowering her hand to drop the items within it back onto the bed. "I'm absolutely
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     Princess Jasmine in this situation."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not fight her soft chuckle, but she could tell Agatha's immediate quip was a sign that she was perhaps a little nervous. Such a vague question had put her on alert, but the immediate way Rio's palms smoothed over the tops of her thighs seemed to settle her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No strap," Rio started to explain, though she was hawklike in her assessment of Agatha's body language before she dared to continue. "But I want to be on top."
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, Agatha's brow pinched, but this time it was sharp in her misunderstanding. It was clear that Rio was asking for the upper hand here, but it was also apparent that she was omitting a bit of context. Slowly, Agatha's critical stare began to shift, a little loading wheel circling above her head as she tried to work out in which ways that would be possible. The processing was happening, but her body was beginning to tense up at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hands slid higher, landing on the thin strips of her thong on her hips, and gave a gentle squeeze to beckon Agatha's attention back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you trust me?" she asked again, her voice somehow softer and with an added layer of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, Agatha's lips were the ones to press, the contemplation causing her to tense up again for another moment before finally, she seemed to relax as she offered a small nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio requested her to reposition, she took the opportunity to sit up, the front of her body making light contact with Agatha's as she tipped her head back in wanting. Without hesitation, Agatha knew what she was asking for and lowered to gift her the kiss she so clearly been searching for.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't animalistic, wasn't ravenous. At the same time, there wasn't much tenderness to be found, but was rather something that felt more like understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt kind of like trust.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha finally broke the contact, Rio could feel that the tension in her muscles had eased and she wasn't as nervous as she might have initially been at the suggestion. With another brief lip lock, Agatha placed her hands to Rio's shoulders and lifted herself up, swinging a leg over so that she could do as she had been asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     The flip happened quick, Agatha on her back and Rio up on her knees at Agatha's side, her hungry gaze finally drinking in the sight of Agatha in her totality. Rio was convinced even more at the sight of her that she'd most assuredly sunk several hours in the gym while away; God, the idea that she'd gotten any stronger was powerful merely in its ideation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're staring," Agatha pointed out, though it did little more than cause Rio to grin. She didn't actually stop marveling at the body before her, at least not for a few additional seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So I am," Rio agreed, reaching out to run a set of impossibly light fingertips down the center of Agatha's torso until hooking into her thong, giving it a gentle tug.
    </p>
    <p>
     The suddenly helpless look that found Agatha's face in that moment was both delicious and encouraging at the same time. Agatha hadn't actually answered her, hadn't verbalized that three letter word of acknowledgement, but as she seemed to melt there beneath Rio's touch, Rio knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha trusted her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as she had chosen to trust Agatha, Agatha was giving her the exact same in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a little finagling, Rio looped her fingers through the waist of the thong and pulled it down Agatha's legs, leaving kisses atop both thighs alternately before it was off and nothing more than an afterthought as it landed noiselessly somewhere on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kissing her way back up Agatha's body, Rio took her time. It was dustings of affection up her legs, ones that turned to brushings as they reached her middle. Those sculpted abs, that perfect little navel, those lush and full breasts. Those, Rio paid a little more attention to with the quickest nips, sucks and licks before she resumed her journey upward, eventually finding herself propped up on her elbows as her face loomed over Agatha's.
    </p>
    <p>
     The support of holding her body up was not for her own benefit; no, she would have collided again and again with Agatha, no matter how bad it made her newly pierced nipple hurt. The reason she was choosing to maintain space was simply out of respect for Agatha. The last thing she wanted to do was garner Agatha's trust to immediately pin her to the bed; it would have defeated the purpose entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could be closer, but she didn't have to make Agatha feel trapped in doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the distance still between them, Rio lowered her head, a warm and calm smile on her lips. "I'm really happy you're back," she whispered, getting close enough so that their lips could touch. "I missed you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she shouldn't have said it, maybe she should have tried not to reinforce the idea that she was attached, but what was the point? Why would trying to hide now do her any good at all?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was because she was telling herself that she'd let go of her inhibitions too much and that she had slipped too far down into her feelings for the woman below her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Agatha breathed her response, that changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I missed you too."
    </p>
    <p>
     In a blink, Rio felt as though her heart had leapt so high that she was suddenly choking on it. It was an admission that she had never,
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     thought she would hear from Agatha's lips. It was something she had convinced herself would
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     happen, and as such, hearing it for the first time truly struck something within her, something that both shocked and pleased her at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were so impossibly close that deep down, some part of Rio hoped Agatha remained ignorant to the way her lips split wide in a grin that caused her face to ache instantaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had
     <em>
      missed
     </em>
     her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe... Maybe they weren't as out of sync as Rio had tried so desperately to convince herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without another word spoken, all that was left to do was to seal the distance between them, and so she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss that followed such a sentiment was rougher, hungrier; Rio's sudden desire to prove to Agatha what she had just admitted was practically paramount in a way that felt all consuming. Agatha needed to know, needed to be aware of just how badly Rio had wanted her to return, and just how agonizing the wait had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was first nothing more than hungry lips quickly turned into a flurry of tongues and teeth and sighs and moans, Rio's body still hovering only inches above Agatha's. It was a kiss filled with every bit of the longing and yearning and needing and wanting that Rio had been feeling for the last ten days, a kiss that shouted as loud as possible that Agatha's absence had only made Rio want her more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hands had been restless in the way they traversed Rio's sides, her back, though never pulling her closer. It was desperation, but the most cautious form, and Rio noticed. It was her own showing of want, of need. The way Agatha touched her, those hands clearly said they had yearned to feel nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the sweetest and simplest pleasure to just... kiss Agatha that way, to lightly rake her fingers through the hair she could reach near Agatha's hairline as she tasted all of her there was to taste. It was becoming reacquainted, though she wasn't entirely sure that was the best word for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was simply connection in its most raw and primal form, the
     <em>
      one
     </em>
     way Rio
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     she was allowed to show it.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a need for air, Rio pulled away, Agatha's chagrin becoming apparent immediately in the volume of her disappointed whine. As Rio's lips found her neck in the next breath, however, the sound she made was much,
     <em>
      much
     </em>
     sweeter: a moan that Rio
     <em>
      swore
     </em>
     almost made her cum on the spot. Even more, those strong fingertips sank into the lean muscle of her back, nails biting in their pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not hiss, did not shy away from the desire-fueled assault. No, she chose to kiss even higher toward Agatha's ear, teeth skimming intentionally as she breathed softly into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let me show you how much I missed you."
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Rio pressed off the mattress, lifting herself to her knees where she had purposely straddled Agatha's thighs. She began to move, not daring to look at the confusion that was likely painting over every bit of Agatha's expression. She had a plan, and for that plan to work, she had to be quick and decisive and trust
     <em>
      herself
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Positioning herself to straddle Agatha's right thigh, Rio still had not quite found the courage to look at her. Gently placing a hand on Agatha's left knee, she applied enough pressure to bend and lift so that she was able to slide her own knee beneath it. The moment she settled, Rio's hot and wet core pressed flush to Agatha's thigh, drawing a low rumble from deep in her lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio, what are you --?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Hearing her name, Rio's attention finally swept upward, distracted gaze landing on Agatha's face, though what she saw almost panicked her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked nervous, but more than that, there was... fear? Worry?
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio did not realize was that the implications of their sudden positioning had stirred an emotion within Agatha that she could not identify. What she could never have known was that Agatha had never once allowed someone so close, allowed them to be
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was fully aware of the intimacy, of the vulnerability, but the thought that Agatha had never allowed such a thing?
    </p>
    <p>
     That had never crossed her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Understanding the need for attention, Rio's thumb lightly brushed at Agatha's knee while her other hand landed firmly -- but not roughly -- on Agatha's abdomen, solely for a slight repositioning despite the way it lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio, I --"
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, when Rio's gaze found Agatha's, she bore nothing but understanding. Maybe it would need to be a conversation at a later time, but in those slowly passing seconds, Rio knew that what Agatha needed right then was to be soothed and put at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, trust me?" she requested for a third time. That one? that one was the most earnest of all three.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those wild and flighty blue eyes were darting from point to point on Rio's face, searching for solace or reassurance, and Rio offered all she could. The longer it wore on, the more she started to wonder if the idea had been nothing more than a poorly timed one.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, as Rio realized she was unable to verbalize an answer, Agatha's fingers found and filled the spaces between Rio's where they rested on her knee. The moment Rio felt the pressure of her fingertips in the back of her hand, she understood, but the nod Agatha had to offer provided more comfort in the form of a definitive answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Carefully, before making any move forward, Rio bent enough that she was hanging over Agatha again, raising a hand to lightly drag knuckles against her cheek. She didn't offer any promises, didn't tell Agatha that she would be safe; that had already been implied, and Agatha had offered her acknowledgement in the way their hands were still joined on her knee.
    </p>
    <p>
     With all the gentleness that she could muster, Rio simply kissed her. It could have been feral, could have been wild and unhindered, but that wasn't what the moment was needing.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Agatha needed right then was to be reminded that of anyone in the world, Rio was the only one who could actually
     <em>
      see
     </em>
     her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, Rio did everything in her power to tell her with that kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     When it came to an end and Rio pulled away, she was staring into those blue depths once more, her face only an inch away. Despite knowing she didn't need to offer the comfort, it fell from her lips anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I've got you."
    </p>
    <p>
     It could have been the equivalent of an emotional anvil, but Rio
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     her to hear it. She needed Agatha to know that whatever happened in the next minutes, it was going to be okay. If she told Rio to stop, she already knew that she would. Nothing about their relationship was rooted in forcefully taking things from the other; no, it was an understanding that one could give, but nothing needed to be pried away.
    </p>
    <p>
     With one last brushing of their lips, Rio righted herself and stole one additional quick glance at Agatha before kicking into gear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Head dropping, Rio's free hand dropped to land between them, gracing the apex of Agatha's legs, light and intentional fingers finding her core as she lifted herself from Agatha's thigh. The soft gasp that left the woman below here was enticing, driving her on with the knowledge that she seemed to already be going about things the right way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Knowing that any more time might cause one of both of them to overthink the entire situation, Rio scooted forward less than an inch, still keeping Agatha's wet and hot sex exposed, and dropped herself down, right against that awaiting pool of want.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio felt as their cores came to rest flush against one another, a moan spilled out of her, fingertips digging into the back of Agatha's hand. Her head was swimming, causing her to fight her way through enough of the immediate high to focus more on Agatha's pleasure than her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio," Agatha whimpered, but her grip on Rio's hand indicated that it was not sourced from panic or nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, that sweet, sweet sound of her name on Agatha's lips made it sound like she wanted
     <em>
      more.
     </em>
     As Rio's focus shifted up, Agatha's expression shouted the exact same despite the fact that her eyes were closed and her head was tipped back in her pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Licking her lips, Rio finally began to move, hips shifting downward to apply more pressure to the needy cunt below her. While she was intentionally showing more care than had ever been required in regards to their dalliances in the past, she was also so fucking
     <em>
      needy
     </em>
     . Almost two weeks apart had left her wanting, but instead of Agatha completely man-handling her and making her remember their entanglement for days to come, this was somehow even more intense.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, breasts starting to gently bounce as Rio's hips began to pick up in their pace, Agatha was laying beneath her, euphoria beginning to melt its way into her muscles. The way she had started to huff and whine and whimper only made her desire clearer, but it was when her hand snapped to Rio's thigh and rough nails sank into skin that Rio truly understood it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     this, but she was never going to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now that it was there, it was clear she was succumbing to the totality of her pleasure pretty quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not desisting the slightest in her pace, Rio's hips rolled more fluidly and with a bit more fervor as a moan escaped her, surprising even her. It felt so fucking good to just seek out that pressure, that stimulation, and know that it was coming from Agatha's own pleasure and need. The sounds of sloppiness were soft, but Rio could hear them acutely in the moments that they were not being drowned out by Agatha's steady moans.
    </p>
    <p>
     In an irrational gesture that Rio likely would not have committed to in a normal state of mind, her free hand whipped down to land atop Agatha's as it rested on her thigh, grappling it immediately upon contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, with their cores hot and pressed in the most immeasurably pleasurable way, Rio and Agatha were connected. It wasn't about the sex, it was about the fact that as Rio had Agatha in one of the most vulnerable and intimate positions, Agatha was holding onto her for dear life, and Rio was holding on right back.
    </p>
    <p>
     God be damned if Rio wasn't going to make her realize just how good of an idea it was to trust her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hips began to rock a little harder, a little faster, and with a quick check-in of Agatha's twisted but pleasured expression, Rio knew Agatha was getting close.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do... Do you think..." Rio rasped, her hips rocking down harder, applying more pressure, "you can... can cum?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The question was an earnest one, but the way Agatha moaned immediately in response was almost enough of an answer. To amplify it, each of her hands gripped desperately at Rio's fingers, nails once again digging into skin to find stability and purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
     While completely tuned in to just how loud Agatha's body language was, what she did not expect was to hear an encouragement sound from below her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio, baby," she practically gasped, her hips shifting and lifting to try and gather more of the delectable contact Rio was offering her. "Don't stop."
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a switchboard in a crisis, almost every fucking inch of Rio's brain completely lit up to hear Agatha use
     <em>
      those fucking words.
     </em>
     She could have said anything, could have voiced any hazy thought that crossed her mind, and
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     was what she chose to say.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her breath catching in her chest, Rio's hips canted and dropped lower, though with Agatha's body in the way, all it did was increase the pressure against Agatha's clit in a way that caused her to first sputter and then cry out, desperate fingers gripping at Rio with all of their might.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow, despite the sheer chaos ricocheting within her, Rio found her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I w-won't. I won't until you cum for me."
    </p>
    <p>
     She had absolutely not been expecting the way Agatha's eyes flew open and snapped down, finding Rio's ravenous gaze in an instant. She almost asked if everything was okay, if she should stop, but she quickly realized what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wanted to look her in the eyes as she came.
    </p>
    <p>
     The very second the understanding washed over her, it only pushed Rio to work faster, to grind harder. Keeping that eye contact the entire time, she realized something dangerous, something she had been fighting for so long.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, with their bodies joined and their pleasure leaking between them as Agatha's face projected nothing but pure ecstasy, Rio knew the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     She loved Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment it hit her, she had little time to process or begin to freak out, but mostly because Agatha's grip became vice-like and her head dropped back to the pillow. It had all been indication enough, but the moan that ripped from her lungs and bounced off of every wall in that room was a clear voicing that she had finally lost the battle of wills and her pleasure had taken her over.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if she had been possessed, Rio kept going, but only long enough for the weight of the moment to flip the right switch in her brain. As Agatha began to ride out the waves of her pleasure, Rio did too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Like sticking her finger in a live socket, Rio felt everywhere at once as her orgasm slammed into her, all but yanking every bit of air from her lungs. It was delicious, it was intense, and it was damn near debilitating.
    </p>
    <p>
     The whimpers and moans and gasps for air were hot and heavy as they landed around them, Rio's hips finally slowing to a halt as she nearly folded over Agatha's knee, completely winded. The physical exertion was surely a part of it, but more than that, Rio was suddenly reeling from her own internal admission, the one she'd been smart not to cry out as she had stared Agatha in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio loved Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was stupid, and it was reckless, but the truth was that Rio couldn't help herself. Maybe there would always be the possibility that Agatha wouldn't feel the same, but did it matter one way or another?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had found this woman, this complete riddle that had fought so hard to keep up every single wall she had and yet, there she was, full and breathtaking in her beauty as she laid bare and vulnerable to Rio's desires.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe, Rio considered, she'd already known how she felt about Agatha. Maybe it was why she'd made such a request in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe... Just
     <em>
      maybe...
     </em>
     That was also why Agatha had agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still panting from the effort, Rio wanted to move, to relieve herself of being upright, but there was a question she wanted to ask first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can I..." she huffed, suddenly calmed by the feeling of both of Agatha's thumbs brushing over the backs of her hands. At the same time, she felt a little more emboldened to make her request. "May I lay against you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze was soft in its inquiry, but she needed Agatha to know it was a genuine request more than it was a selfish one. She could tell, though, by the flush of Agatha's skin -- even as high as her cheeks -- that something was different, that something had shifted. She didn't look flighty or worried, or like she needed to lock herself away in the bathroom to process what it was she might be feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Agatha just looked... happy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You may," she whispered, giving Rio every bit of the permission she needed to separate their bodies, no matter how much the sudden coldness seemed to take her breath away. That empty space didn't matter when she filled the one at Agatha's side, slipping easily beneath her arm. Even more surprising than her permission was the fact that Agatha's arm -- for the very first time -- lowered to wrap firmly around Rio's back, holding her close.
    </p>
    <p>
     In that moment, it felt as though there was so much to say and yet, there were no words to say any of it. There were
     <em>
      no
     </em>
     words to explain that Rio had identified that dangerous feeling that had been gnawing away at the edges of her heart, or to articulate just how foolish she was for having such an emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, it was just sweat-slicked skin sticking together and the feeling of Agatha's fingertips as they graced lightly over her side.
    </p>
    <p>
     For everything Rio
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to verbalize, she simply chose to show it instead. With her head laying on Agatha's chest and her arm snugly around Agatha's middle, she let the silence speak for her as she drifted off to sleep, comfortable in the hold of the woman she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she awoke the next morning, it seemed as though the jetlag had finally caught up to Agatha; they had repositioned sometime throughout the night and while their legs were still tangled, Rio had rolled to her opposite side, and Agatha had followed, spooning Rio's bare body from behind. An even bigger indicator of her exhaustion were the soft snores that were breathed into the back of Rio's neck, jostling the hairs there just enough to tickle.
    </p>
    <p>
     As consciousness seeped more and more into her form, it all hit her like a train.
    </p>
    <p>
     On top of the heart-stopping revelation she had made the night before now lie the fact that for the first time since they'd met, Rio had woken up in Agatha's arms. It was surprising, but also, it was proof that even in her sleep, Agatha felt like she was worth holding onto.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio didn't want her to let go.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was motivation enough to stay still and relaxed, calm in the arms of the woman that she had immeasurable feelings for, at least for a little while. After what was likely twenty minutes or so, a soft call came from over the edge of the bed, little grey paws appearing before claws sank into the sheets as leverage. In the next moment, those orange little eyes were peering at her, nothing visible below Phin's nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good morning," she whispered to him, reaching out to scratch his head carefully, not wanting to rouse Agatha behind her. "I suppose you're hungry, hm?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The only response?
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Mrrp.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently, even Phineas thought that waking Agatha up wasn't worth it to get what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     With considerable caution and awareness, Rio slowly and gently removed herself from Agatha's hold, only panicking for a moment when Agatha released a low grumble that was then soothed when she rolled to her back, still asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a quick rinse in the shower and dressing herself in a t-shirt and a pair of shorts, Rio set about her morning routine, though it was a fight to keep her mind from drifting to the woman in the bedroom, back to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deep down, Rio
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to tell herself it was just sex. It was just trying something new, a way to be a little closer. But... The ways that Agatha had grabbed at her, that look on her face and in those eyes,
     <em>
      those things
     </em>
     had said so much of what Rio knew Agatha could not find a way to speak aloud. Those things were the ways she
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     communicate, the ways she could
     <em>
      show
     </em>
     Rio how she was feeling when she could not tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pacing figure 8's between her legs as she opened the container of his food, Phineas seemed none the wiser to her internal crisis or the way she had considered that if her thoughts moved any faster, they might actually break through the confines of her skull. All he seemed concerned about was his breakfast, which was expected. He offered another soft chirp, one of thanks, as she patted his head and disposed of the trash.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning to face the counter, Rio's initial inclination was to make coffee, but another thought appeared in its place. Yes, she could make coffee and breakfast, but there was the chance that it might provide another show of domesticity, one that could potentially cause Agatha to regress or pull inward. It was the last thing Rio wanted when she finally felt as though she had been making progress, finally getting to the point where Agatha might have been willing to let her as close as she wanted to be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Armed with that knowledge, Rio made another choice. She chose to pace back into the bedroom, change into a pair of jeans, and grace Agatha's temple with a light kiss before she departed and headed for the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe if she wasn't the one to make breakfast, it might not seem as heavy as it really was.
    </p>
    <p>
     With the memory of the morning after their first night together, Rio found herself a bit nostalgic as she climbed into her car. It might have been too foolish or too sentimental, but nonetheless, she headed straight for Gotham Bagels, a warm smile curling her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     It hadn't taken her long to get in, order their bagels and coffee, and get back out with her bounty, but the moment she made it to her car, her phone began to ring. Setting everything on top of the Tiburon, she was quick to fish out her phone, the screen very colorfully informing her that Alice was calling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Hey! Good mo-- Afternoon? Shit, I don't even know what time it is."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio! Rio, are you with her?" Alice demanded, her voice louder than normal in her greeting. It was the urgency that began to cultivate a pit in Rio's stomach, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I'm leaving Gotham now. I came to get breakfast," she explained, fighting to keep her tone neutral despite the sudden rolling of panic she felt in her stomach. "Alice, is everything alright?" Rio's concern was genuine, but she had misunderstood Alice's question. She had assumed that Alice was asking because they needed to have a private conversation, but she could not have been more wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I just left Cavalry. I'm on the way back to the morgue and... Rio, they've started to get smarter. They know it's a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was meant to help, Rio knew, but hearing Alice say those words out loud made her stomach lurch so uncomfortably that she considered she might throw up. That would suck, given there was nothing on her stomach
     <em>
      to
     </em>
     throw up aside from bile.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wh-What... Alice, what do you mean?" It was a stammer, a stumbling of words that Rio did not actually
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     the answer to, but knew she needed all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice drew in a sharp breath, loud enough that Rio could hear, but she understood it as a need for courage.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I didn't hear the whole conversation but Shaw and Groves were talking about it, about how they realized the men were perpetrating violence against women... And I... I just kept walking, but you... I think you should tell her. I mean, not instructively, but... She should be careful." The way Alice was rambling, the way she was just spitting out her words to simply get them out, Rio knew that she was genuinely concerned, that she actually cared enough to make them both aware.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps Alice would never understand the relationship Rio and Agatha had somehow constructed haphazardly, but she understood what it meant to Rio, and that was more than enough to push her into action.
    </p>
    <p>
     No matter what Alice thought about the whole thing, she was still a good friend to Rio. Maybe it meant bending a few laws in the process, but Alice always proved it, time and time again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay, okay. Just... Breathe. I mean, I'm panicking too, but I'll let her know when I get back. I'll text you with an update in a bit, okay?" Rio offered calmly. The truth was, she was absolutely losing her mind, but letting Alice know as much wouldn't have done her any favors.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay," Alice agreed in a huff with the soft clicking of her turn signal sounding in the background. "I'm pulling up back to work now. But... Also want to let you know that Eugene is a fucking bore and you're not allowed to take time off if he's the one covering your shifts." It was sharp, but only in the sense that Alice was trying to divert their attention, to offer some form of humor to a situation that was... not all that funny.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Noted, friend. Have a good rest of your shift."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio?" Alice returned quickly, trying to keep Rio from hanging up prematurely.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Be careful."
    </p>
    <p>
     While it was a warning and a well-wishing at the same time, Rio knew that Alice wasn't talking about Agatha in terms of what she might do to Rio. No, Rio knew that what Alice was referring to?
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     was an advisement to not let her own feelings play her if Agatha was going to go down.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will, Alice. Have a good day."
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Rio cut the call and braced herself against the top of her car, forehead dropping to her arm as a low groan spilled from between her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     This wasn't good. It wasn't good at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was even worse?
    </p>
    <p>
     Having to be the one to break the news to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time pertaining to their relationship, Rio had finally found something she did
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     want to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it fucking
     <em>
      sucked
     </em>
     .

    <p>
     Keeping her cool while on the phone with Alice was one thing. Standing by her car in a shabby and too-small parking lot while she contemplated the implications of their conversation immediately after? That was something else entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was panicking. If the cops had even
     <em>
      started
     </em>
     to think -- as Alice assured her they had -- that the spinal cord killer was a woman, it was only a matter of time until someone with a little less sense than Rio but a little more than the rest of the force was able to follow the exact same breadcrumbs she herself had.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had taken Rio time and a great deal of effort, but the cops were actually
     <em>
      paid
     </em>
     to follow those threads. She did absolutely like to consider the idea that there were things she had picked up on that no one else could, but she also knew not to discount the impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then,
     <em>
      anything
     </em>
     was possible and that was a terrifying inevitability.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was beginning to catch heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     That could only mean one thing: If she started to burn, she was going to run. Likely, she would run without Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she would say that it was a necessity, that it was for Rio's safety, that she had a job and friends and a life she couldn't just leave behind. Agatha would make so many arguments to convince Rio that her life was better off without her around, but Rio already knew that was a fucking lie.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew it was a lie because she knew it might actually break her to have to watch Agatha walk away.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <em>
      stupid
     </em>
     , and she had always known it, but what would be so easy for Agatha might in turn pain Rio far more than she might ever be able to handle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dating had always been a sinister game to play for Rio, mostly in the context that she considered herself a little too immersed in the heavier sides of life and therefore had never found ways to truly relate to the women she dated. Something was always wrong in the dynamic, whether it was her fault or theirs, and it would dissolve in time. Sometimes it was an amicable split, others it was Rio being berated for leading someone on, even if it had never been her intention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever this was, being Agatha's, it wasn't anything close to dating. That was -- by all technicalities -- what they were doing, but it didn't feel the same, didn't have the typical sense of dread Rio felt at knowing things were destined to end. Well, it had that sense, but for a completely different reason.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio heaved a disgruntled sigh and climbed back into her car, she had actually shifted the car into reverse until she remembered something very important.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bagels and coffee were still on top of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Throwing the gearshift into park again, she clamored out and collected their breakfast, though she wasn't as interested in it as she had been before she had answered her phone. It had been a genuinely thoughtful move, but the moment Rio blew into that condo and informed Agatha that the pressure might start growing, none of it was going to matter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or so she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Crossing over the threshold into the condo, Rio was on red alert, gaze scanning the space for any sign of Agatha, to which she discovered none. With a quick placement of the bagels and coffee on the kitchen island, Rio all but sprinted into the bedroom, completely confounded when Agatha was nowhere to be found in that big bed of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha?!" Rio nearly shrieked in her panic, quickly zipping around to the doorway of the ensuite, though the light was off and it was empty, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha!" Rio shouted, much louder that time, loud enough that it carried to the other side of the condo where she had not even thought to see if any doors might have been open.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio?" Agatha called back, a beckoning that snapped Rio's attention across the length of the home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even from that vantage point in the doorway of the bedroom, she still could not locate Agatha exactly and so, her stiff and aching legs carried her from one end to the other. The moment she got far enough, she realized that the door to the art room was open and the light was on. Appearing in the doorway, Rio's panicked demeanor softened instantly at the sight displayed before her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perched on a stool with a liquid-filled bowl in one hand and a q-tip in the other, Agatha sat perched in front of her latest project. That wasn't the part that struck Rio with a fondness that calmed her. No, that was Agatha herself, clad in a purple and black trimmed sports bra and a pair of dark grey leggings. Her hair was pulled up in a similar fashion to the night before, but it was clear it was still damp from her shower.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was
     <em>
      doing
     </em>
     nothing in particular, and yet she was still somehow
     <em>
      everything
     </em>
     in her simplicity. She was poised and beautiful, dedicated and meticulous even in her less violent hobbies.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, staring at that innocent expression on her fact that was woven with slight alarm at the way Rio had been calling out to her, Agatha looked every bit of what Rio wanted her future to look like.
    </p>
    <p>
     She also looked like every bit of what Rio knew her future couldn't ever be.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you okay?" Agatha questioned, her brow knitting in her concern. She had immediately gauged that Rio's posture was tense, her eyes were wild, and there was a deep crimson that had filled her cheeks and what was visible of her neck and chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I..." Rio started, but her fumbling became apparent immediately, though she was fighting for her life to keep any glassiness from ever touching her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The truth?
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't okay.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew what was going to happen, had convinced herself that this had no happy ending, no ending where she would ever be able to tell Agatha the realization she had come to the night before. There was no future where the might get to be happy
     <em>
      together
     </em>
     , and that was a shit revelation to have to come to terms with.
    </p>
    <p>
     "
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     am okay. But..." Rio stalled, tucking her bottom lip between her teeth in a way that both allowed her to source some resolve and also inflict enough pain on herself to keep her grounded. With a soft sigh falling from her, Rio paced into the room and planted herself at Agatha's side, taking in the sight of the painting that was almost halfway to being completely restored. She couldn't look at Agatha when she said it out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The cops are catching on. They... Alice heard a couple of them talking and they are realizing it's a woman. And... As much as I don't want to say it because I will always think myself smarter than those shit-coffee consuming dickweeds, I..." Still keeping her gaze away from the woman who was now staring up at her profile, Rio considered a moment longer how best to proceed. "If even
     <em>
      one
     </em>
     of them follows the same crumbs I did... Agatha, I..."
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Rio was still completely aware of her surroundings, the way Agatha discarded her items and used her right arm to reach up and across to grace her fingertips across Rio's left cheek, it actually startled her.
    </p>
    <p>
     What startled her even more?
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, that would have been the absolute shit-eating grin that Agatha happened to be wearing when they finally made eye contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can you do me a favor?" Agatha asked, her tone even and almost cool. Frankly, it was
     <em>
      too
     </em>
     cool to be a reaction to the information Rio had just divulged. When Rio did not immediately respond, frantic eyes darting over Agatha face in their panic, that touch of solely fingertips morphed into a warm palm that cupped her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Take a deep breath," came the instruction without answer. Maybe Rio couldn't think clearly enough, maybe she was too deep in the pits of her anxiety and fear, but Agatha? Agatha looked as relaxed as could be.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha, I am telling you that you're not as invincible as you think you are, and you're asking me to breathe?!" It wasn't a shout, but there was clearly an edge to Rio's tone that stemmed from nothing more than sheer panic and concern.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, when Agatha laughed, Rio felt like a bolt of electricity had shot up her spine, leaving tingles in its wake.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am. Because you are getting worked up over something I am not concerned about," Agatha answered evenly, her head tipping slightly to the side. "I know that it seems scary, but... I, too, believe that you are more intelligent than the Chicago police force. Ten times more determined, too. And I have taken
     <em>
      plenty
     </em>
     of counter measures since you're little sleuthing journey to redirect anyone who tries to follow suit."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's words weren't exactly cold, but they had a placidity to them that should have alarmed Rio. Instead, it actually started to offer... comfort? Soothing? It was irrational that this might seem at all okay, but she was understanding that for the first time since they'd met, Rio had actually underestimated just how thorough Agatha actually was.
    </p>
    <p>
     When someone got a leg up on her, she ensured that no one else would ever again, or at least that seemed to be her line of thinking right then.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio should have known better than to panic and think that the world was coming to an end, or at the very least,
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     world. No, Agatha was smarter than that, more calculating and sly. Admittedly, perhaps Rio hadn't been giving her the credit she so justly deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
     After all, hadn't she been killing men for nearly a decade and a half? It stood to reason that perhaps she
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     had a plan,
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     had a way to cover her tracks and disappear without ever moving an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was fucking
     <em>
      intelligent
     </em>
     , and while it was something Rio had always been very, very aware of, it was also something that she was realizing she might have critically underestimated.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way she was soothing Rio's nerves and anxieties with a gentle and light brushing of her thumb over Rio's cheek was working, but even though her heart rate was slowing and her pulse began to thud a little less intrusively, the concern did not immediately ebb. Instead, she offered a much softer, much more genuine inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And... What if it's not enough? I mean... I know you know what you're doing, but... What if you have to leave?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was pathetic, Rio was aware, but she knew Agatha understood the real statement there:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I don't want to have to watch you go.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I'm not ready.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, Agatha swiveled on her stool and pushed to her feet. The moment they were on level footing, her idle hand raised and both palms cradled Rio's face, requesting eye contact. The moment she found it, Agatha did not speak, but instead chose to place a light kiss across Rio's lips, those blue eyes fluttering shut at the contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was kissing her like that to calm her, but all it did was cause Rio to wonder just how many more of those she might have left. How many more times would she actually get to feel Agatha touch her like that? Kiss her that way? Want her to stay so close?
    </p>
    <p>
     In the midst of the barrage of panicked what-ifs, Rio's own eyes slipped shut and she finally offered surrender, kissing Agatha back in a way that showed she was still engaged, if not a little flighty. When Agatha broke it off, Rio made the first move and tipped her head forward, leaving their foreheads pressed together despite not opening her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We will cross that bridge when we get there, okay?" Agatha whispered. She was still for only a moment before she lifted her head but only to place a too-soft kiss to the direct center of Rio's forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was too sentimental, too gentle, but it was also
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     what Rio needed in that moment to steady her wildly hammering heart as it threatened to break ribs. More than that, it gave Rio the courage she needed to request clarification.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We?" she asked meekly, dark brown eyes finally opening to behold the woman before her.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a flash of something Rio could not quite identify across Agatha's face, as though she had realized what she said and was momentarily startled by her own phrasing, but her expression smoothed quickly as she formed her response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you haven't run for the hills by then, then yes, 'we.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was smooth, it was controlled, but that look in her startlingly soft blue eyes told Rio that Agatha was being honest, even if it was killing her to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were so many things behind that gaze that Rio knew Agatha would never say and yet, she was still being so fucking loud with the words she
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     choose. They were heavily considered and yet, they were rich in their truth. Agatha wasn't good at feelings, that much had been obvious from the get-go, but the effort she was making? Rio could see it, could appreciate it, and could return it in the same respect.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't have to hold her face. She didn't have to kiss her so gently. She didn't have to grace her lips against Rio's forehead to try and calm her down when it was clear that adrenaline was spiking through her veins.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chose to do each and every one of those things. For her.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why--?" Rio began, but Agatha was quick to shake her head in dismissal the moment the word hit her ears. At the same time, her hands dropped from Rio's face and she turned back to the painting, staring at it with a feigned sense of hyper-focus.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't want to have that conversation. It's... I don't know how yet, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost immediately, Rio could hear the shift in tone; Agatha
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to throw her walls up, but it was clear that something had changed for her, something that was causing her to fight the impulse. Rio wanted to soften at the thought, but her still looming anxiety put a stopper in that rather quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her lips pressed a moment, a hot debate raging within her. She wanted to continue that particular conversation, but she realized that for the time being, Agatha wanted it pinned. With that in mind, Rio diverted, shifting back to a previous track of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So... That's just... It? You're not worried about the police... At all?" Rio knew it might have been a stupid question, but Agatha was far too calm for her liking. Didn't she have a single concern? Couldn't she feel the hairs on the back of her neck standing up as if something was coming, like Rio did?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's stance shifted, one arm folding across her middle as her opposing elbow perched on her hand so that the other could support her chin, eyes sharp in their critique of her own work, but Rio knew it was a tactic, a ploy that she could hide behind so they did not have to have this conversation face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
     While part of Rio wanted to press, to stand in front of Agatha and make her look her in the eye as they sorted through... whatever the fuck this was, the part of Rio that had always been able to actually
     <em>
      see
     </em>
     Agatha seemed to take over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite her pursed lips, her rigid stance, and her heavy avoidance of eye contact, Rio could see that she was sorting through the catalogues of reactions within her own head. The more she studied that profile, the more Rio started to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had always been alone. She had never had to take into account that someone else would be there to ever give a shit. She'd never been in a position where someone wanted to help or, at the very least, did not want her to simply disappear off the face of the planet with no hope of return. Agatha had roamed freely and while maybe her ties to Rio were not exactly restrictive, it was painfully obvious that they were something new she had to factor in when making her moves across the board.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two queens, once moving against each other, now finding a way to harmonize on a path forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     "This happens sometimes. It happened when I worked in New York City. I had to stop for almost a year. It was... miserable. But... If I think they're getting too close, we will work out a plan." Agatha's voice was firm, but it had lost most of its warmth. She was in full assessment mode; as she stared at that painting, she wasn't criticizing her own work. No, she was visualizing a map of what things would need to look like for her to evade any suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, hearing her use that two letter word did something to Rio's heart in the center of her chest. It was an unruly fluttering, one that almost made her clear her throat in its appearance, but she shoved the feeling down and instead gave Agatha's words their due consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lips pressing and twisting again, Rio breathed a soft sigh and stepped forward, rooting herself resolutely at Agatha's side as her arms folded across her middle, holding her sides tightly. "I know that you want me uninvolved, but I hope you know that doesn't mean I won't keep an ear to the ground when I'm at work," Rio offered, gently giving Agatha's arm a nudge with her own. "I just don't--"
    </p>
    <p>
     Catching herself, Rio sucked in a sharp breath, gaze lifting above the edge of the canvas to pin a spot on the far wall. She'd already told Agatha once that she had missed her. She had even shown her just how much, but to admit it in the light of day while fully clothed felt like a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't what?" Agatha questioned, finally turning her head to peer over at the woman beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't look, couldn't be the one to make the eye contact that time, and as such, she was missing the completely genuine and earnest expression that had painted Agatha's beautiful features. She was interested, wanted Rio to stop hindering herself and just admit the truth, but it was fucking
     <em>
      hard.
     </em>
     It wasn't the act of being honest that was hard, in itself, but rather the vulnerability that it required. That was where the true difficulty was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not cry, or overtly show any display of emotion that Agatha could have deemed to much with ease, but when she spoke, there was the tiniest crack in her voice that betrayed her inner turmoil.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't want to have to miss you like that again."
    </p>
    <p>
     The admission itself sounded downright pathetic, even as Rio heard herself say it. Hell, she had known it would be even before it had found form in the sound waves and still, actually hearing it made her feel sick all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not suck in a breath, did not scoff, did not make
     <em>
      any
     </em>
     sound at all as such a deep sentiment settled over her. Rio had considered the idea that Agatha might walk off, that she might isolate in a different part of the condo, and she would have understood it. What she had given no thought to was that Agatha would actually have a response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was soft but not weak, low but still a demand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not meet it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "
     <em>
      Rio.
     </em>
     "
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't exactly softer, but there was an urgency there the second time that had not existed the first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please look at me."
    </p>
    <p>
     The normal shiver that might have run up Rio's spine at such a request was absent as it landed within her. Agatha wasn't begging her, but she was imploring her to comply. Truthfully, Rio wasn't ready. She wasn't ready to look at Agatha and have to find a way to repeat herself in Agatha imminently asked her to.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't ready to have to see the look on Agatha's face when Agatha told her that it wasn't a mutual sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not turn her body, but the hand closest to Rio did lift, a barely-there fingertip gracing just under her chin in want. Rio had been fighting it, but just how lightly Agatha was touching her was not lending to any sense of resolve. Instead, that resolve only began to whither away, remnants of ash as they were whisked by the wind of Agatha's need.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, that gaze broke its steady hold with the wall and Rio compliantly turned her head, meeting Agatha evenly despite the way it seemed to vacuum every bit of air directly from her lungs. It wasn't that she was struck by the look on Agatha's face -- even if it felt way too fucking gentle to be something she was choosing to wear -- but rather by the reiteration of her admission as it hammered into her skull.
    </p>
    <p>
     Missing Agatha had been pure misery.
    </p>
    <p>
     Having to do it for the rest of her life was not a reality Rio even wanted to consider, let alone have to face.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that feather-like touch still lingering beneath Rio's chin, Agatha leaned forward and eliminated the distance with a kiss that offered Rio the briefest moment of quiet within her own mind. When she pulled away, it also reminded her to breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know you aren't. And I know how that feels. So... We will play it by ear, okay? I'll be extra careful in my research, and picky, and you will just... do whatever it is you want to do. I don't
     <em>
      need
     </em>
     your help in any way, but I also understand that telling you no is like shouting at a wall. You're your own person and I will never control you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's words were far beyond sincere as she looked not only into Rio's soul, but into the very essence of who she was as a person. Agatha was admitting that while she wanted Rio to remain separated, she also knew that Rio -- being every bit of the Rio she had ever been -- was going to do what she thought was right, no matter the opinions of others.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, Agatha's opinion held a little more weight to it, but even then, Rio knew she would make decisions that Agatha might not sanction willingly, and she wanted the freedom to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was giving that to her. Willingly, Agatha was reinforcing the reality that while they had become something pretty great in the way they had come together, they were still two very different people who would make very different choices.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Agatha was acknowledging was that she trusted Rio to now make them if it put her in any form of jeopardy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could make good on that without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So..." she started, searching gaze still studying Agatha up close, her breath still warm on Rio's cheeks. "What do we do now?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It was an honest question, a genuine need for knowledge, but Agatha simply smiled in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I suppose it depends," Agatha returned, both of her hands lightly finding Rio's t-shirt as she rubbed the soft fabric between her fingertips. "Where were you when I woke up? I knew you didn't run away because you left Phin here." An almost playful smile tugged on the corners of Agatha's lips, but it did not quite reach her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio roller her eyes, but her own smile seemed to find her easily, matching Agatha's in intensity. "I thought it would be less clingy if I went out and got us breakfast -- or, rather, lunch -- instead of making it myself with the plethora of groceries in the fridge," Rio answered with a shrug that she tried to play off as nonchalant, but Agatha saw right through her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Very kind of you. Do you think maybe we should go eat it now that you seem a little more at ease? Or just drink coffee if you're not ready for food?" The genuine concern that lightly dusted Agatha's features was endearing and while Rio knew it was not the first time Agatha had shown that she gave a shit, it was the first time it felt so... gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't want to eat anymore, but coffee does sound good. Let's go."
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio stepped away so that she could make her way for the door, she had not expected the way Agatha surged forward. An instant hand snapped out, catching her by the wrist as the other rose to land along the crook of her jaw. The necessity was apparent for Agatha as she drew Rio in closer and kissed her once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     it, right then.
    </p>
    <p>
     She
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     that something was different in Agatha, in the way she was touching her and kissing her. She was not an idiot; calling it out and making a show of indicating that a shift had occurred wasn't ever going to be the right way to go about it, but she would have been remiss not to make
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     mental note about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as Rio considered the kiss might have drawn to a close, she felt the tiniest gracing of Agatha's tongue along the underside of her top lip, though it was gone just as quickly as it appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmm," Agatha hummed contentedly as their mouths broke apart. "You still kind of taste like toothpaste."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh?" Rio questioned with the smallest smirk. "Guess I
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     need to coffee to fix that, then, huh?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Guess so."
    </p>
    <p>
     For just a fleeting moment, Rio thought that Agatha might slide her hold down and encompass Rio's hand inside of it, but she was not entirely disappointed when Agatha let her go and ushered her toward the main area of the house and the awaiting bounty Rio had brought back with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha saw the box from her place behind Rio as they both glided into the kitchen, a tender smile filled her face, the same sentimentality taking her over that had compelled Rio to go to the bagel shop in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Feeling mushy this morning, are you?" Agatha teased, sliding up next to her with a bump of their hips in jest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio simply shrugged, removing her coffee from the flimsy holder. "Just thought about it. Sounded good. Don't make it weird." Even though her tone
     <em>
      sounded
     </em>
     non-plussed, she knew that the moment Agatha's head turned, she could clock the grin Rio was wearing from a mile out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Everything about you is weird, princess," Agatha offered back with a light chuckle. A gentle hum sounded from her as she lifted the lid to the box and began to assess her options. "You might be hungry but I'm absolutely famished. So, don't mind if I do!"
    </p>
    <p>
     While Agatha prepared herself one of the bagels -- an everything with garden vegetable cream cheese that Rio took mental note of -- Rio shuffled with her coffee in hand to place herself at the dining room table, but Agatha had other plans instead. With her breakfast supported by a paper towel, she offered another hum, this one a light 'nuhuh' as she saw Rio begin to sit. When Rio met her with a confused gaze, Agatha tipped her head in the direction of the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was an abnormal decision, but it seemed as though Agatha was having an easier time of making them since she had when Rio first met her.
    </p>
    <p>
     After turning the television on and locating a documentary called 'The Deep End,' which Agatha quickly informed Rio was about a woman's journey from being in a cult to inadvertently creating her own, they had both settled into their breakfast --? Lunch? Brunch? -- and fell into a comfortable silence for a short while.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before the end of the first episode, Rio's mind had started to turn circles almost enough that she started to panic again.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if she noticed, Agatha's voice sounded beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I was thinking," she offered right before tossing the last bite of her bagel easily into her mouth. She instilled a dramatic pause for effect, one that was given away in its taunting by the smile that curled her pressed lips. "I want that do-over this weekend. Would you be up for dinner and Navy Pier tomorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more, that surprising flutter happened again in Rio's chest in a way that caused her breath to catch in the middle of her sip of coffee, causing her to cough slightly in response. As she settled and recovered, her head turned and she was looking at a profile of a woman who wanted to appear as she did not give a fuck, but had actually just asked a pretty loaded question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I would," Rio agreed easily, a grin blossoming across her lips. "And I promise I won't even look at the wheel this time."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had maybe expected a 'thank God,' or even a 'what a relief,' but when Agatha spoke, she found herself caught off guard yet again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No promises, but... I want to try again. And wouldn't be mad if it ended the same way, but hopefully minus the embarrassing panic attack that got thrown in for unnecessary spice." Finally, Agatha's gaze swept to the corners of her eyes, just enough that she could see Rio as a calm smile crept onto her features.
    </p>
    <p>
     The look itself as a silent admission, a promise of effort but not necessarily a guarantee.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You know," Rio offered before taking the last drink of her coffee. The cup was discarded to its designated coaster on the table and she leaned back into the couch, an idle arm flopping over to lay along the small of Agatha's back as it came to rest on the cushion behind her. It was a lightly established contact, but it also established presence. "I can't wait for the day when you figure out something I don't
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to do, but will because you ask."
    </p>
    <p>
     At such a statement, a truly delighted laugh reverberated off of every nearby surface as it bubbled up Agatha's throat and spilled out around them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah? And why can't you wait for that?" she inquired, cocking a brow as she turned to take Rio in.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because," Rio answered simply with another shrug. "I guess I'm just eager to show you it's not all one sided."
    </p>
    <p>
     That could have been the end of the conversation and Rio would have felt as though she'd said what she needed to say, but Agatha wasn't quite ready to let it lie.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a quickness Rio had not expected, Agatha snapped to her left and placed a well-intentioned kiss to Rio's cheek, though she'd used a little too much force as her nose collided with Rio's temple and sent them both into another round of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was in that moment, as she leaned into Agatha and the sounds of their joy echoed around them, that Rio knew the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Agatha had to leave, it was going to destroy her.
    </p>
    <p>
     In kind, she would do anything in her power to make sure that did not happen.

     "I'm not taking you anywhere else."
    </p>
    <p>
     At two in the afternoon on a Saturday, in the middle of a Marc Jacobs dressing room, Agatha clearly had made
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     That morning when they roused after an entire Friday of skin on skin and lips on skin and tongues in sex and hands in hair -- which had left Rio unreasonably fucking sore -- Agatha had made a suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to go shopping, and her conviction had been deep.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "And what might we be shopping for?" had been Rio's immediate response.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Dinner attire!" It was bright, perhaps a little too chipper for the hour of the morning, but Agatha seemed... excited?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "We don't have to go shopping for that. I can run home and grab some--"
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "You could. Or you could let me buy you a nice dress that you can add to your collection. I much prefer the second option, just so my opinion is known." Agatha's tone wasn't hard or harsh, but as Rio looked into those beautiful blues and raised her right hand to fit her fingers in the spaces between Agatha's where they rested on her hip, she could see that she was being genuine.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Rio could have asked for reasoning, or motivation, but she didn't need to.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Agatha didn't do things she did not
      <u>
       want
      </u>
      to do, not ever.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      If she was offering to slide a credit card that likely had no limit over the counter of a luxury designer shop, it was because she wanted to. Trying to tell Agatha she could not do something she wanted to do?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Well, that was never going to play out well.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Not saying 'no' did not mean that Rio would also not ask questions; that was something Agatha should have seen a mile out.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Can I ask why you're offering?" Rio posed, light fingertips pressing into the back of Agatha's hand in silent acknowledgement that the question she was asking was probably mildly uncomfortable. She knew she was asking Agatha to be more open, to explain things she might have waved off and been mysterious about only weeks prior.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      With the way she was laying, the shrug that Agatha offered was only one-shouldered, but it was clear that it was a stalling tactic while she attempted to find the right way to answer such an inquiry.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I guess..." Agatha began, her gaze shifting to land on their hands as they rested on Rio's hip. "I guess I realized we haven't actually been on a real -- well, at least successful -- date and..." Agatha paused again, her thumb lightly brushing over the the back of Rio's own thumb.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I think I just want to do it right. I want to buy you something you like that you'll look completely fuckable in and then torture myself by behaving as I stare at you in it all night. And then I want to let other people see how fuckable you are in it as we stroll the pier, all the while knowing that I'm the one that gets to bring you back and take it off of you."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Admittedly, Agatha had her in the first half. The second? Well, Agatha might have been crass in her delivery, but Rio heard what it was she was really saying.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I want the world to see that you, in all of your beauty and allure, are mine."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     So, in their third luxury designer shop of the day, the second dress Rio had chosen had been the one to garner the most titillated reaction out of Agatha -- who looked like she was half way to shoving Rio into the stall to fuck her right then and there (which, she was already sore enough as it was) -- as her eyes went wide and jaw dropped just barely.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's the one."
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, Agatha's response had been a relief; the off the shoulder and shimmering viridescent dress she was sporting had been Rio's favorite of the day. It wasn't too heavy, too flashy, or anything that might had made her uncomfortable. Even though she was allowing Agatha to spend thousands of dollars on a dress for her, she still wanted it to be a show of who
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     was, or maybe who she had become when she was at Agatha's side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lifting her head to take in Agatha once more -- perched there on a plush lounger with her legs crossed at the knee -- Rio could see the approval, the appraisal, the
     <em>
      hunger.
     </em>
     Agatha clearly favored the dress, but Rio knew why.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't because her shoulders and collarbones were showing.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't because there was a decent amount of cleavage it created.
    </p>
    <p>
     What it was?
    </p>
    <p>
     It
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     the slit that ran up the left side, peaking at the bottom of Rio's hip, showcasing the entirety of her toned and smooth leg.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked damn near like she was going to dive right in, but as Rio cleared her throat, those ravenous blues snapped up to take in a grinning Rio who was clearly satisfied by such an intense show of favor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you
     <em>
      suuuuure?"
     </em>
     she teased, giving a slow spin for good measure.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh God, between the slit and the way it makes your ass look, I don't know that we're going to make it to dinner." Surely, it was not a conversation to be having at a volume that was likely audible at least ten feet away, but Agatha didn't care.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We have to! No disruptions! We are absolutely going to make this our first successful date, no matter how hungry you get for other things," Rio reminded her, though that grin she'd been wearing easily dropped into something more akin to a smirk. As if to prove her point, both eyebrows arched only a second later.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're right, you're right," Agatha returned with a slightly disappointed sigh. It had been her idea (literally all of it), but she was also insatiable when it came to the physical between them. Rio's aching body was more than proof of that. "And I promise not to rush us through. Have to stick with the whole 'torturing myself' bit since I was foolish enough to make the offer."
    </p>
    <p>
     A bright laugh spilled from Rio, her only other reaction being the rolling of her eyes at Agatha's coy banter.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, poor you. You'll have to keep it in your pants for a few hours... Er- Or dress. Which!" Rio stalked forward, feet bare against the soft carpet beneath them until there was only a foot or so of space between them, Rio's head tipped downward to take in the woman below her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have spent
     <em>
      all day
     </em>
     trying on dresses. Is there a reason you've chosen not to participate?" It was meant to be menacing, but Rio found herself unable to keep a straight face as her lips split into a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's brow furrowed slightly, her head tilting to the side as she leaned back into the lounger. "I didn't plan on getting myself anything. I was waiting to see what you'd pick so that I'd know what to wear in accordance." Agatha offered a nonchalant shrug, a light display of indifference. "Plus. You've seen my closet. Not sure I need to add anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio would hand it to her; of all the things Agatha could be, she was
     <em>
      nothing
     </em>
     if not practical.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do I at least get a hint? I should get to have
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     idea of where on the fuckable scale
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     might be landing," Rio pointed out, cocking a lone right eyebrow this time in silent interrogation, hands raising to rest on her hips as if it might prod Agatha into being a bit more forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, the laughter that sounded from Agatha was immediate and airy, clearly tickled pink over the fact that there Rio stood in the middle of Marc Jacobs, clad in that multi-thousand dollar dress, and still maintained the mouth of a sailor. As if she had not just been gushing over the way Rio's ass looked in that damn dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have some decorum, would you?" Agatha teased, pushing off the lounger to get to her feet. Wasting no time in closing the space between them, her hands fell to Rio's hips -- effectively pushing her own away -- though Rio did not miss the way Agatha's thumb skated, just barely, along the bare skin at the apex of the slit in the dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Decorum!' she cries as she touches my bare skin," Rio fired in response, her voice far quieter than it had been only moments ago; with Agatha suddenly so close, nothing louder was needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, save for the warm and full kiss that Agatha pressed to Rio's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     That spoke volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Go change. Let's go home."
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been light and the smile that found Agatha was more than encouraging, but as she gave Rio's hips a light squeeze before letting go, Rio realized something.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those last three words, they
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     something to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't a "let's head back," or a "let's go to the condo."
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Agatha had said they were going
     <em>
      home
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It was slightly reminiscent of the night Agatha had whisked her away to the condo for the first time. Yet, there was a new gravity to the sentiment, especially given the fact that Rio did
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     actually live there, even if she'd seen more of those walls in the last fortnight than she'd seen her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     For all of the mental ass-kicking Rio could have done over the giddiness she felt at such a statement, the truth was, she was tired.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was tired of lying to herself by means of discrediting Agatha's efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was tired of acting like this was all unbalanced and that
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     was the one falling harder and faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it had only been a couple of months, but Agatha was proving time and time again that she had invested herself into whatever it was they were building. It might have been in more unconventional ways, but hadn't she always been the one to say
     <em>
      'Hello, I am still here. Do not forget about me.'
     </em>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     She said it with a burner phone. She said it with bagels. She said it by making home cooked meals and always starting a pot of coffee in the mornings. She said it with options, choices. Louder still, Agatha all but shouted it by proving that she could do things that fell outside the realm of her comfort simply because she wanted to do them with the help of Rio by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who was
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     going to judge her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who was
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     going to have her best interests at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who -- unbeknownst to Agatha --
     <em>
     </em>
     loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, who in that moment was impossibly thankful as she changed out of her dress and emerged to Agatha signing the credit card receipt with an all-too-thrilled smile on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Watching her from the doorway of the changing room, Rio realized that for the first time since she had known her, she was seeing Agatha as she wore a new aura so plainly over every inch of her physicality.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked
     <em>
      happy.
     </em>
     Not just the kind of happy where she was home and relieved and well fucked.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, the kind of happy that Agatha was radiating right then as she lifted her head and their eyes locked?
    </p>
    <p>
     That was
     <em>
      true elation.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That was the kind of joy that permeated her entire being, that lit up her face with an affectionate smile and made her eyes sparkle with appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Knowing that she was the one who had brought that out in Agatha?
    </p>
    <p>
     For as modest as Rio could sometimes be, that one thing was something she knew she had to take credit for. Her presence had clearly shuffled things around in Agatha's life, but it had all been of Agatha's own volition. She had been the one to extend the invitations, the one to hold space for Rio in her days and nights. Agatha had proven time and time again that what it was she wanted was simply to have Rio around.
    </p>
    <p>
     Admittedly, it made Rio feel really fucking good.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made her feel good to walk up to an outstretched and cordial arm, one that she hooked into with ease as they departed the store and climbed into the back of the awaiting SUV.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made her feel good when Agatha placed a gentle hand atop her thigh on the ride back to the condo and did not immediately try to pull away when Rio lightly covered it with her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made her feel good when -- with the bag still dangling from her fingers -- Agatha carefully backed her into the wall of the elevator and kissed her almost the entire way up.
    </p>
    <p>
     It even made her feel good when she climbed into the shower, seeing a moment later through the frosted glass as Agatha entered and placed herself on the small bench nearby, setting her own ensemble down next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you want to join me?" Rio called, just loud enough to be heard over the sound of the shower.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No thank you," Agatha answered and while it could have felt like rejection, Rio recognized it for what it was: Agatha wasn't quite to that level of intimacy just yet and there was absolutely nothing wrong with that.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were taking steps, but Rio could
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     ask Agatha to pick up the pace. Up to that point, those strides had been noticeable, something Rio had developed a true appreciation for and trying to ask for more? It would only do more harm than good. Agatha was still moving, no matter how far she shuffled or leapt or ran and that was all Rio could truly ask for.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if Agatha wanted to simply share space, or watch her shower?
    </p>
    <p>
     She was okay with that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Intermittent hums sounded from Rio as she busied herself with her routine, only minutely startled when Agatha spoke from the other side of the glass walls.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Would you prefer The Palm or Stetsons? " There was a pause, but Agatha continued a beat later in blunt consideration. "Do you even like sushi?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Lifting her head to spot the other woman through the glass, Rio could tell she was on her phone, likely waiting for a response so she could submit their reservation. With a warm laugh, she offered her reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I do like sushi, but I would prefer The Palm, if it's okay with you." The truth was, Rio didn't actually give a shit where they went, but she knew that Agatha was only asking because she wanted Rio to be the one to choose. Agatha might been the one to cook up the idea of a do-over, but she still wanted Rio to have a say.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a sentiment that Rio had noticed time and time again, the undeniable need that Agatha had to make sure Rio knew she would
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     have to do anything she did not want to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     All Rio could hope for was that Agatha was aware it was a two way street.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wasn't that the beauty of whatever was growing between them?
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't ever about control, or about who had the final say.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, what they had?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was deeper than that, a mutual respect for one another's boundaries and comfort that Rio had never truly experienced before in a relationship. It wasn't that she had dated selfish women, persay, but rather, she had simply been dating just to not be so fucking lonely. It had been a way to keep her warm at night, but no one had ever given enough of a shit to make her coffee in the mornings or ensure that she had
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     on her stomach to start the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her own shower drawing to a close, Rio's gaze swept to the frosted panel Agatha occupied just in time to see her discard her phone and begin to strip. "Reservations for 6:30 at The Palm are set. Do you think you can get ready in... an hour?" Agatha's voice was rich with her taunting, but Rio was too stuck on watching her form through the glass to give an immediate reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that a 'no?'" Agatha prodded again, a low chuckle sounding from between her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I- I can," Rio finally returned, rinsing the remaining conditioner out of her hair. In an attempt to not lose focus, she let her eyes cast toward the ceiling. "Sorry, got distracted."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Not difficult for you," came Agatha's teasing as she stepped out of her jeans. "Are you done yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, yes, sorry. You could have waited to get naked until I was done. Made it hard to remember where in the process I was at." Instead of shutting the water off, Rio let it run as she pushed open the door to an awaiting Agatha who was already clutching one full-body towel and one wrap for Rio's hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Look at you being so sweet," Rio taunted lightly, a bright grin plastered to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You really have to stop pointing that out, or I'm gonna quit doing it," came a playful warning in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reaching for the body towel first, Rio should not have been as surprised as she was when Agatha cocked her arm back, pulling it just out of her reach. "You're close enough, you might as well kiss me while you're here," Agatha murmured, gaze flicking first down to her lips and then back up to those warm brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was still being annoying, yes, but this was... Different. It was playful and light, and if she were being honest with herself? Rio hadn't really considered the idea that Agatha could have such a side to her. She was consistently surly and demanding, but right then?
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, Agatha was
     <em>
      showing
     </em>
     she wanted affection without actually having to say it in those words.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio understood, her own view shifting from blues to soft, soft lips, back to blues again?
    </p>
    <p>
     Of anyone in the entire fucking world,
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     had been the one to offer the safety to explore those emotions, those wants, those needs.
    </p>
    <p>
     For years on end, affection had been a foreign concept to Agatha. There, in her bathroom, their naked bodies a hair apart, she was finally learning that it was okay to ask for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without question or pause and still soaked from head to toe, Rio leaned in to close the space between them, sealing it with a lush and warm kiss. It was loud but soft, wanting but giving and perhaps lasted a second longer than it should have.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, it wasn't time to let those feelings sneak their way in.
    </p>
    <p>
     As proud as she was of the consistent work Agatha put in, she couldn't let herself slip even further. Rio knew that falling even deeper to a point where she was compelled to admit it out loud was far too fucking dangerous. Between the heat from the police and possibly slipping up and pushing her away?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha would run.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't ready for that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not when they were an hour away from leaving for their date.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their faces were still close as Rio pulled away, close enough that she could feel Agatha's breath on her face, but they had a timeline to keep to and Rio was not entirely sure that if they kissed again she could keep her hands to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Now give me that, you." A hand shot out, hooking into the towel before Agatha had a chance to pull it away again, soft laughter leaving them both as she succeeded and wrapped it around herself. When going for the hair wrap, though, Rio did not give any room for protest. Instead, her towel-covered torso bumped into Agatha's nude one as Rio reached for it, grabbing it at the very same time her lips found Agatha's again in a chaste but warm kiss. "Shower. Or you'll make us both late."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sir, yes sir!" Agatha barked back, as though she were a cadet in training, swinging a hand up in a faux salute.
    </p>
    <p>
     All Rio could do was roll her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're kind of annoying sometimes. In a hot way. But still annoying," she mused, bending at the waist to flip her hair forward, gathering it in the towel a second later and pinning it to her head to dry.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't something she would have said before that point, before Agatha laid claim to her, but it was a comfort she had found, one where pointing out little blemishes -- especially in a joking manner -- would not directly or negatively impact the budding relationship between them. If anything, it was Rio's way to gauging exactly where they were on the scale of how comfortable they could be with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio? She would have let Agatha do or say whatever the fuck it was she wanted to do or say, so long as it was never out of malice.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Agatha? Well, maybe Rio would have been an idiot to not see that Agatha was slowly reaching that same level of comfort and security. It was more of an effort for her, something that she had to actually work at; knowing as much, Rio's patience would know no bounds. Agatha was
     <em>
      trying
     </em>
     , and she was doing it all for Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     That fucking meant something.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah, well, you're about to willingly plant yourself across from me for an hour, so what's that say about you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, Rio
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     have said it. She could have just blurted it out loud and run the two of them collectively straight into the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't ready to ruin things just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It says that I have the patience of a saint," Rio returned, looking to Agatha with a smirk. With a snappy hand, stiffened fingers struck Agatha's hip with a soft
     <em>
      'smack'
     </em>
     before a final chastising. "Get in the shower!
     <em>
      You're
     </em>
     going to make us late!"
    </p>
    <p>
     With one last devilishly charming grin, Agatha heeded the instruction and climbed into the shower, though it seemed as though she needed the last word the moment the door clicked shut behind her
    </p>
    <p>
     "By the way... I don't think you should wear panties."
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     While it had been her second time walking into a restaurant with Agatha, this time felt different.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it was the way Agatha had willingly walked her in with their arms linked, or the way they had spent time together in getting ready, finishing with Rio's application of lipstick to Agatha's full and lush lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or
     <em>
      maybe
     </em>
     it was that heinously attractive deep violet three-piece suit Agatha had chosen for herself. The best part about it happened to be that she had opted out of a blouse, leaving her chest on full display for Rio to visually feast on through their night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had
     <em>
      known
     </em>
     that Rio's dress was going to be a tantalizing punishment when she'd purchased it, but Rio had been completely and entirely clueless of just how fucking
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     Agatha was going to look in her own dinner attire. At the same time, something else about it had piqued Rio's interest enough to ask about after their orders had been placed and they sipped at the wine that had been poured.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Why a suit?" she posed, tilting her head slightly to the side in consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, Agatha simply stared at her, lips pressed firm against one another. Although she didn't look perturbed by the question, something about the sudden shift in the air around them made Rio feel as though she shouldn't have asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     The storminess in Agatha's blue irises quieted and then resolved, replaced by a soft shimmer of reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Every date, 'work'-related or not," she began, but stalled a moment longer to find courage in a draw on her wine, "I have always worn a dress. Because... Because Amelia Cohen was dating someone."
    </p>
    <p>
     Her answer presented as vague to anyone else who might have been listening, but Rio heard
     <em>
      everything
     </em>
     Agatha was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had scheduled dates for hunts. She had perhaps tried her hand at dating in the true sense. She had even gone on a date with Rio when she had been convinced her cover was intact.
    </p>
    <p>
     All of those instances, Agatha had been projecting who she needed the world to see.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right there, in a corner of The Palm as she sat across from Rio, she was finally just...
     <em>
      Agatha.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "I feel like
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     , in this, here, with you."
    </p>
    <p>
     The way it rolled off her tongue, it was so impossibly casual and light. It was like she was trying to float it to Rio, like it might be a good idea. No matter how light she
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     it to be, Rio knew just how fucking heavy that was.
    </p>
    <p>
     For one singular instance out of her entire life, Agatha felt seen. She felt as though being herself, making choices that she wanted to make but never felt safe enough to do so, it was never going to negatively impact what was between the two of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "As much as I know this was your favorite of the day," Rio offered, flourishing a hand to indicate the dress. "I feel a lot like me, too." It wasn't consolatory, or patronizing, but was rather honest given their setting.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha spoke again, though, Rio found herself both surprised and delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I like it when we're us."
    </p>
    <p>
     A truly pleased smile filled Rio's face, her leg extending enough to run the top of her foot along the outside of Agatha's calf.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Me too, A."
    </p>
    <p>
     For the quickest second, there was a flash of emotion across Agatha's face, though it was gone in an instant. It told Rio all she needed to know. It told her that Agatha
     <em>
      heard
     </em>
     what she was saying. For the sake of her cover, Rio obviously couldn't use her name, but in the same vein did not need to use her alias to show affection.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because to Rio, she would never be Amelia.
    </p>
    <p>
     To Rio, she was Agatha through and through, and even if the world couldn't know it,
     <em>
      she did.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     With the arrival of the appetizers came a deeper barrage of questions from Agatha's end, things she'd seemingly thought about in their time apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you close with your parents?" had been the first, which came with the easy answer that they had both since passed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When did you realize you were a lesbian?" Something about that one had struck Rio somewhere low in her chest; it felt
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     to hear it out loud, to hear someone else say it with no shame or worry about who could be eavesdropping. The answer to that had been a little more complex in that she'd known young but spent too many years trying to maintain a 'normal' appearance. Being fifteen in a church attic and spending an hour making out with some other girl during the lock-in had been pretty valid confirmation, just not the religious kind.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What would you be doing if you didn't live in the city?" It had been a thoughtful question, but Rio had an easy response.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The exact same thing I do now, just in a smaller setting." It was honest; Rio still loved her job and always would, enough to the point that if she wasn't directly in the middle of all the hustle and bustle, it was still something she wanted to do with her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they were finishing up and awaiting for Agatha's credit card to be returned, Rio found a question of her own that begged to be asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can I ask you something?" she posed before tossing back the rest of her wine. Maybe she was moderately buzzed and perhaps would not have posed such a question in a more sober state, but she'd already opened the door. When Agatha nodded her head in permission, Rio all but ran through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where will you go if you have to leave?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It fell between them like a ten ton anvil, causing Rio's stomach to twist nervously at the stoic expression on Agatha's face as she seemed to contemplate the gravity of what had just fallen from Rio's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     The waiter returned a second later, handing over Agatha's credit card before bidding them a good evening. Alone again, Agatha found her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know, but when I do... You will too."
    </p>
    <p>
     That answer? It was just as heavy as the question that had brought it on and yet, the way Agatha was smiling said anything but. It was calming, a balm to the sudden flare of nerves that spiked up in Rio's chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, they made their exit from the restaurant, finding an awaiting Gio at the curb. Also, to be noted, was the pair of flats Agatha had stashed for Rio on their way to dinner. Sure, the heels were nice for show, but walking the pier in them would have likely left her sore and not in the way she preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
     Climbing out of the SUV, Agatha offered her hand with a warm grin on her face despite Rio's switch to more sensible footwear. Rio took it with no hesitation, but when Agatha didn't let go as they set off toward the pier?
    </p>
    <p>
     That was the moment it all made sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was never going to be able to measure their pace on the same scale, simply because they had lived such impossibly different lives. Her own had led her to be compassionate, to problem-solve and remedy any wound. Agatha's had left her detached and separated from a world she truly wanted no part in.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Rio had learned to love, it was uninhibited and raw in the sense that when she found someone worth that emotional investment, it was hard to remember to pump the brakes every now and again.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha felt affection? It was an entirely different experience, Rio was realizing. It was something Agatha truly had to think about instead of just letting herself feel it.
    </p>
    <p>
     There as they strolled down the pier hand-in-hand, it was Agatha's well thought out showing that she wanted Rio to be closer, that she wanted to physically hold onto her. It was a display that Agatha
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     care about her and now, she
     <em>
      didn't
     </em>
     care if the world bore witness.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a sense of security for both of them, just for different reasons. It was how they stayed, walking up one side of the pier and down the other. Their chatter was light but sparse, at least until Rio caught something out of the corner of her eye for the third time since they had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept stealing glances at the Centennial Wheel. By the time they were close enough to the ticket booth, she had stilled completely with her chin pointed toward the highest gondola, a place that surely had sour memories for her. They could have started walking again, could have just done another lap around the pier, but Agatha had other plans.
    </p>
    <p>
     Didn't she always?
    </p>
    <p>
     "We should get tickets," she stated, as though her mind was already made up. Her gaze shifted as her chin lowered, but she was looking at the ticket booth, not Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     "A-- Babe, we don't have to do that," Rio returned, giving Agatha's hand a tight squeeze. She understood the sentiment, but the last thing she wanted was for Agatha to push herself right into another panic attack for the sake of trying to prove a point.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Agatha turned her head, resolved blue gaze meeting Rio's slightly confused one evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know we don't, but... I want to. The sun's almost gone and... Please?" It wasn't so much the ask itself that melted Rio, but rather that soft word that got tacked on at the end. It was a clear sign that while she didn't know how to funnel her wants and needs into words, it did not stop her from having them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was a taker, and Rio had always given, but in that moment, Agatha wasn't taking.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, she was asking Rio to lay this experience in her palm, to let her have another shot at something she felt she had mucked up the first time around.
    </p>
    <p>
     Raising a hand to cup Agatha's cheek, Rio searched those beautiful blues for any hesitance, any sign that this was not something she wanted to be doing, but... surprisingly, she found absolutely none.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Only if you're sure," Rio finally answered, the honesty ringing clear in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm sure."
    </p>
    <p>
     So, they did just as Agatha had asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     They bought their tickets, waited in line, and climbed into the gondola. The entire time, Agatha never let go of Rio's hand. Not once.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you alright?" Rio posed softly, pressed firmly against Agatha's side while still clutching her fingers tightly in her own grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's focus stayed fixed on the thin orange line, the one that signified the end of another day, a day they had spent together, and for the longest moment, she stayed quiet. As the car ascended even high, Agatha appeared to lose a bit of the nerve she'd been clinging to while still on the ground. Her head snapped to the side and while it was obvious she was trying to hide the panic she was feeling, Rio could still see it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio," Agatha breathed, the sound a little strangled.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes, my queen?" came a quiet return, one that was accompanied by the familiar gesture of Rio's palm cradling Agatha's cheek affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can you kiss me?"
    </p>
    <p>
     In the blink of an eye, Rio all but melted.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was such an honest question, a question that was practically dripping in its need for distraction.
    </p>
    <p>
     With only a silent nod, Rio gave a gentle tug with the leverage she'd found near the back of Agatha's neck, closing the distance between them with a soft kiss. It wasn't needy or rushed, hurried or frantic. It was a kiss of patience, of understanding, of... well, love.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha seemed to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way their lips moved, latching and sucking softly, only the tips of tongues making their presence known, it was
     <em>
      sensual.
     </em>
     It was soft and -- dare Rio think it --
     <em>
      intimate,
     </em>
     even
     <em>
      .
     </em>
     Agatha's muscles released the overwhelming tension, but it was clear that she craved more, as evidenced by the soft plea she made when they broke apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lean back."
    </p>
    <p>
     As instructed, Rio leaned into the bench of the gondola, utterly gobsmacked when Agatha began to shift, turning and swinging a leg over Rio's thighs to straddle her. A second later, firm palms landed on the side of her neck, beckoning her attention. The effort wasn't exponential, but as she lifted her chin to take in the sight of the woman on her lap, Rio felt torn.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to tell Agatha the truth of how she felt for the third time that day and yet, the reality of who Agatha was happened to be right in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     That reality being that of all people in the world to fall in love with, Rio had done so with the only person who might not know what to do with it and who might
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     say it back.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, instead of parting her lips and daring to spill that three worded secret, Rio chose to kiss her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the fact that they were positioned rather intimately, nothing about the way Agatha kissed her felt sexual. It felt desperate and panicked, but it didn't feel like she wanted to immediately tear the dress from Rio's body and let it drop the hundred feet blow them. No, all it said was that she was busied, she was distracted, and the hold Rio had on her waist made her feel grounded when they were gently swinging around in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the wheel slowed and their car lowered down toward the bottom, Agatha begrudgingly broke apart the kiss and removed herself to sit back on the bench, apparently of the mind that they did not want to be banned from riding the wheel ever again. Still, the sight of her winded with pink-dusted cheeks was enough to bring an immediate smile to Rio's lips, one that stayed even as she took Agatha by the hand and unloaded them back onto solid ground.
    </p>
    <p>
     "One more lap? I'd like to stop by the observation deck before we go." Agatha's request was earnest, but there was a sweetness to her tone that melted Rio somewhere near her middle, leaving her skin warm and flush with affection.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course. Let me pop into the ladies' and I can meet you back there?" Rio offered, lips curling up assuredly.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a nod, they departed toward the end of the pier, only separating with a kiss once they'd reached the washrooms so that Rio could tend to her business -- which was rather easy given that she'd heeded Agatha's earlier request. After washing and drying her hands, Rio followed through as she'd said she would and headed toward the observation deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she found was a contemplative and wondering Agatha as she stared out at the purples and blues of the water and night sky, meeting in a reflection of beauty on beauty. Quiet footfalls carried her further, landing her directly behind the woman she cared for so deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took only a moment for her to make a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     Holding Agatha wasn't an option; it was not something Rio wanted to risk in a public setting and so, she chose a less physical alternative instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reaching forward silently, both of her hands found light holds on the bar in front of Agatha, effectively caging her in but leaving enough room to not make her trapped. Once stationed, her front found Agatha's back, fitting together like puzzle pieces that so easily formed a bigger picture. Settled and confident that Agatha was not about to respond in any vein of panic, Rio's head turned, her nose nuzzling tenderly into that mess of a mane she had grown fond of.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Thank you, for tonight. It's been amazing," she nearly whispered, placing a kiss to the side of Agatha's head, though lips found no purchase other than hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could have responded with a simple 'you're welcome' and Rio would have been pleased, but what she did instead?
    </p>
    <p>
     There was an unmistakable gentleness to the way Agatha took hold of her right wrist and gave a light tug that quickly clued Rio into what it was she wanted. Before she could act on her own volition, though, Agatha lifted her wrist and brought it up to the other side of her body, effectively placing herself in Rio's hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could have questioned it, could have asked Agatha if it was truly what she wanted, but a semi-frequent though struck her:
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha never did
     <em>
      anything
     </em>
     she did not want to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she wanted, right then, was to be held by someone who cared for her, cared
     <em>
      about
     </em>
     her, and it was exactly what she got.
    </p>
    <p>
     For just a little while longer, that was where they stayed, just watching the water and the way it shimmered in the moonlight. It was a peaceful series of moments, one where words weren't exactly necessary. Instead, all that needed to be known was that there stood Rio Vidal and in her arms was the most important person to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was love.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you ready to go home?" came Agatha's quiet question several minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the second time Agatha had delivered such a sentiment and yet, it still had not lost its ability to make Rio's heart trip up in her chest, squeezing and falling out of rythym for the quickest moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     She
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     said it,
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     let it slip:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Whenever we're together, home is exactly where I am.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     of all things was inappropriate given their standing, both in the relationship they were trying to form and in the physical sense. In its place, Rio offered a much simpler answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes. I'm ready to get you out of that suit."
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
     The rest of the weekend had been spent tucked in the little corner of the world that was known as Agatha's condo. It had been a chance to catch up on lost time, a chance to remember skin on skin for as long as they had wanted it, and a chance to remember what it was like to simply
     <em>
      be together.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Random times throughout the week, Agatha would occasionally grow quiet as she sat on her laptop next to Rio on the couch, doing research for her next outing. By Thursday, she was rearing and ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only difference this time was that as she got dressed and ready, Rio sat at the end of the bed, watching her. She didn't ask questions or make needless observations, but rather just studied and assessed. It was the very first time she'd gotten to be privy to Agatha before she became Amelia and as such, Rio found the transformation rather riveting to watch.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she stepped out, fully clad in a breathtaking black cocktail dress with a portion of her hair pinned back and the rest curled, she was a goddamn vision, though not nearly as much of one as she had been for their date.
    </p>
    <p>
     The truth was, Rio understood her need to present, her need to showcase a version of herself that men would find attractive and want to spend time with. She was still breathtakingly beautiful, but Rio now knew that it paled in comparison to what it was like when Agatha showed off the side of her she only wanted Rio to see.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shutting off the bathroom light, Agatha paced toward the end of the bed, planting herself firmly between Rio's knees and took hold on her chin, angling it upward with a playful question dancing in her eyes before she spoke it aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you going to meet me at the barn later?" The grin she bore was bordering on immoral, but Rio ignored the slight tremble it instilled within her -- there would be time for that later -- and gave a light nod in Agatha's hold.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Of course." It was soft, but only because a lone thought had crept into her mind: the cops. It was a recurring thought, but one that she had been able to bat away with ease up to that point. Maybe right then, it was a gut feeling, or an instinct that she was not aware she possessed. Whatever it was, it compelled her to offer her next warning. "Just... be careful, okay?"
    </p>
    <p>
     The laugh that left Agatha in return was almost admonishing, but Rio knew it was only because Agatha thought she was invincible.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't, and Rio
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     fucking meant it when she told her to be wary.
    </p>
    <p>
     "For the sake of soothing your nerves, I will." Agatha leaned to offer a soft peck of goodbye before straightening up again. "I'll see you soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "See you soon," Rio answered, leaning up to request one last kiss before Agatha headed out for the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wordlessly, Agatha met it instantly, a hand raising to cradle Rio's jaw affectionately. As they separated, she had one last grin to offer before making her way out into the rest of the condo. Just before the elevator doors closed, Rio heard her call one last thing into the home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Phineas, keep her company while I'm gone, would you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     A soft chuckle left Rio's lips, far too soft for Agatha to hear, but it rose in volume the moment Phineas appeared through the bedroom doorway and leapt onto the bed, as though he had listened to the deliberate instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a few minutes to shower him in attention, feeling only a little guilty about not giving it to him as much over the last few days. In all of... whatever this was, he had been the one being to truly carry her through it all and as such, deserved a little extra love.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the quiet settled around them about ten minutes later, Rio heard something for the first time that night.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the buzzing of her phone in the nightstand drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not the burner phone
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Rio's
     </em>
     phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a little too much gusto -- that startled Phin as he jumped off the bed and bolted out of the room -- Rio flung herself in the direction of the night tand, bouncing atop the mattress as she did so. As she fished the phone out of the drawer and peered at the screen, something in her went painfully cold.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were six text messages, all from Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Opening them, the chill only intensified.
    </p>
    <p>
     "EMERGENCY."
     <br/>
     "PICKED UP A SHIFT. OVEHEARD OFFICERS."
     <br/>
     "UNITS MOBILIZING."
     <br/>
     "THEY TALKED ABOUT THE SPINAL CORD KILLER."
     <br/>
     "RIO FUCKING ANSWER ME."
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, the last one, sent a moment before Rio grabbed her phone:
    </p>
    <p>
     "WARN HER."
    </p>
    <p>
     With her heart between her teeth, Rio understood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was in trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
     And only Rio could save her.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     <em>
      Trill. Trill. Trill.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     For the fourth time in less than three minutes, all the goddamn phone did was ring and ring and ring and ring.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearly, Rio thought, if she was blowing Agatha's phone up all to hell, it was for a fucking reason. It
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     from the burner, so she obviously knew who it was that was calling her incessantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     So why the hell was she not answering?! There was no way she had made it to the bar already; she hadn't been gone long enough for that. In fact, if Rio had run her calculations correctly, Agatha
     <em>
      might
     </em>
     have been pulling into the parking lot, but it was still no excuse to not answer the first four times.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was not needy. She was not selfish.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of all, she knew better than to interrupt Agatha when she slipped into the headspace of the primal predator she could be when it came time to reap.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mother fuck!" The frustrated cry touched every wall -- glass or not -- as Rio punched the red button and ended the call.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, fifth time's a charm?
    </p>
    <p>
     Losing hope and gaining heaps of panic in its place, Rio punched Agatha's contact one last time with a forceful finger. Bringing the phone up to her ear, she was not sure she could keep herself from vomiting if Agatha didn't answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Trill. Trill. Tr--
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The line clicked on and the rush of relief hit Rio squarely in the chest like a speeding train.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, before she could push out a warning, Agatha spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?!" It was snappy, it was bitey, but most of all? Agatha sounded
     <em>
      fucking pissed.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Where are you right this instant?!" Rio demanded to know, not offering any formal introduction, not with the way Agatha had answered the phone. There was only a direct path to getting her the fuck out of this mess and if she wanted to be angry about it, she was more than welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could be mad at Rio for days to come, or weeks even, so long as she stayed the fuck out of prison.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Getting out of the fucking car! Why are you blowing me the fuck up?" Her tone was sharp and laced with venom, her irritation paramount at the fact that Rio was interrupting what they both knew was a sacred routine. It meant something to Agatha, and Rio was getting right in the middle of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get back in the car," Rio attempted, flustered over the fact that she was struggling to phrase things so plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, I'm not getting back in the fucking car! I don't know what the fuck you think you're doing right now, but we're not doing
     <em>
      this.
     </em>
     " It had been some time since Agatha had spoken to her with so much ire in her tone, and truth be told, it was rattling Rio even further.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd never really had a panic attack in her thirty odd years of existence, but if she had to guess? She was dangerously close to one in those moments.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm trying to fucking help you, Agatha! You
     <em>
      cannot
     </em>
     walk into that goddamn bar!" The backs of Rio's eyes were stinging with the threat of tears and as such, her voice had started to crack and break the longer she failed to just
     <em>
      spit it out
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yeah? And why is that, Rio?" Agatha clipped in response, clearly only growing more irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had to say something with enough gravity to make Agatha turn the hell around and get back into her car, but she had no clue
     <em>
      what
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     "The cops! The fucking cops are there, they're waiting for you!" For as cracked as her words had been before, they were crumbling as the urgency and panic took her under. The tears that had been walled by lids suddenly slipped, rushing down Rio's cheek in nothing but sheer anxiety and concern.
    </p>
    <p>
     The clicking of Agatha's heels over the line came to an abrupt halt without the sound of the bell ringing over the bar door.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What the fuck did you just say?" Agatha snapped back lowly, her voice having dropped substantially.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I said the goddamn cops are there! And if you walk in there, they absolutely will arrest you and detain you and question you for the rest of the goddamn night!" Rio managed, stronger this time. That strength was only sourced from sheer terror, the terror that when Agatha had planted herself between Rio's knees and kissed her like that, it had been the very last time.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't even dare to fathom a life where Agatha couldn't kiss her. Not only did she not
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to, but more than that, it would kill her to envision it first only for it to become reality simply because Agatha did not trust her enough to pull her from harm's way.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How do you know that?" Agatha snarled over the line, the clicking of her heels picking up again in the background, much softer that time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alice. She picked up a shift tonight and heard a few officers talking. She texted me right away. Please, Agatha. You have to get out of there." By those last two sentences, something embarrassing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     More than just silent tears down her cheeks, Rio actually began to cry. She knew it was stupid, knew that she shouldn't be so damn emotional over it, but she simply could not help it. She had just gotten Agatha so fucking close -- hell, they'd had the most incredible night on Saturday with dinner and the pier and the countless hours of hot, sweaty,  and savage sex that had followed -- and staring down the barrel of a gun that said she might never get to do that again?
    </p>
    <p>
     That was a lot more horrifying than looking down the barrel of the
     <em>
      actual
     </em>
     gun Agatha held in front of her face all those weeks ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I cannot fucking believe--" Agatha huffed over the line, clearly lowering the phone in her frustration. A moment later, a woosh sound cut across the line as Agatha brough it back up to speak again. "You're sure?" it was tight, it was angry, but Rio understood that Agatha needed solid confirmation as motivation to actually listen to Rio's warning.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I... I am. You... you
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     I wouldn't have done this... any of this, if I wasn't sure."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was broken, but it was honest. Rio never would have interfered; deep down, she knew Agatha was certain of that, but her desire to keep on the path of her crusade was so damn strong that it was pushing her to not heed such a call.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fucking -- Goddamnit, Rio," Agatha grunted. The clacking of heels grew louder, but it was clear Agatha was still seething.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Meet me at the barn. Just... Just get out of there and meet me at the barn."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't see it, but the next beat of silence only happened because Agatha was glancing back to the bar, fighting the urge to walk right in there and commit herself to her plan for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why couldn't she just believe Rio when she said she'd be committing to a lot more than that?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha!" Rio nearly shouted, her voice trembling over the name that she'd grown to love the taste of on her own lips. And yet, right then, it tasted like straight bile.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?!" Agatha snapped again, this time solely because she had not fully registered Rio's request to meet at the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn't going to listen, not when Rio was a blubbering and crying mess. No, she had to buck the fuck up and handle this like the grown ass woman she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Meet me at the fucking barn," Rio finally barked, the order strong and thick with her authority. It was an authority she did not have, not over Agatha, but she tried to fake it anyway. Although her chest was still quaking, she found a way to offer an end cap that Agatha could either listen to or simply ignore. "Goodbye."
    </p>
    <p>
     Hanging up the phone was the most painful thing Rio could recall doing in recent years, but she was not going to sit there for ten minutes waiting for half of the CPD to descend on her and haul her to the precinct in cuffs. Agatha could listen to her, or she could not.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only way Rio was going to find out what choice Agatha would make was to take that elevator seventy stories down, climb into her car, and drive out to the stupid barn.
    </p>
    <p>
     That fucking barn.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the very first place Rio had gotten to see
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     for all that she was. Even if she hadn't known her name then, she'd still seen through the veneer of the millionaire lifestyle Agatha had curated for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, months later, Rio had fallen in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she was going to have to sit on her hands and watch as Agatha blew her own life apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Agatha didn't realize was that her life wasn't the only one she was going to destroy if she let this ticking time bomb go off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite her shaky hands and the way she felt she couldn't catch her breath to save her life, Rio poured herself into the elevator, out of her mind enough that she paid no attention to Phineas during her wait as he rubbed at her calves, obviously sensing that she was upset.
    </p>
    <p>
     As much as she loved him, there was not a shred of her attention that she could spare, not when she was so focused on making it to that barn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every bit of that attention was zeroed in on the idea that Agatha might not listen.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she didn't, the last thing she would hear from Rio was that very curt and very snippy goodbye.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had already thought it through; if Agatha got caught, if she went to jail, there was no fucking way in hell that Rio could ever go see her, visit her, partake in conjugal visits, not without outing herself in the process. She had been a silent accomplice, even if only because she knew what it was Agatha had been doing and had not responsibly flagged down the law to lock her up.
    </p>
    <p>
     She never could have, not even if she tried.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had been a mystery, a riddle for Rio to try and figure out. However, for every single layer that she had managed to peel bad, Rio saw even more of who Agatha was and it was all she could seem to think about as she got behind the wheel and peeled off toward the edge of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who had seemed nothing short of a damn hurricane.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who had stayed so damn guarded that Rio was almost
     <em>
      certain
     </em>
     she would have never revealed her true name.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who saw Rio for who she was, past the 9 to 5, the white lab coat, and the devotion to her job.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who was never overtly affectionate but had chosen to hold Rio's hand as they walked the pier, and had made the choice to climb into Rio's lap and kiss her until she saw stars simply because she thought Rio's beauty was far more important than the light of the setting sun as it dipped to reveal an inky night sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who though she was unlovable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, Rio loved her anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Telling her sure had gone out the window, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now there was not a chance in fucking hell that Rio would utter those words. No, having just pissed Agatha off to the max? She would have been shooting herself in the face to make such a stupidly blatant confession.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow, she'd thought herself in enough circles that when she looked up through the windshield, she realized there were no street lights and she had reached the outskirts of the city. She was closer to the barn than not and yet, she had zero recollection of how she'd gotten there.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was dangerous; running on autopilot was not something she usually did, but it seemed as though Rio could find little else to focus on other than the blind hope that Agatha would do as she had been instructed and go to the damn barn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, illuminated in her headlights, the barn came into view and Rio wasted absolutely no time in driving around back and throwing her car into park. With a brisk pace, she wound around the front of the barn and quickly spun in the combination to the lock. She knew it was stupid; she'd done it before yes, but right then she was putting her fingerprints all over a mother fucking crime scene.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't care.
    </p>
    <p>
     This was going to go one of two ways:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1) Agatha was going to listen to her and meet her there and they would avoid the police entirely.
     <br/>
     OR
     <br/>
     2) Agatha wasn't going to listen, Rio would wait at the barn all damn night, and would leave when the sun came up, only for the police to surely find it at least a few days later.
    </p>
    <p>
     Obviously, option one was the prime choice, but Rio was all too aware that Agatha? She was not someone who could be controlled or told what to do. She was not someone who would be given ultimatums and choose the option that best suited the other party.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Agatha did what was best for Agatha, everyone else be damned.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took only a moment to push one of the doors open far enough for Rio to slip inside, flipping on the overhead light as she passed the switch.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha still was not.
    </p>
    <p>
     All that was left to do in the interim was pace.
    </p>
    <p>
     And pace.
    </p>
    <p>
     And pace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was so deep in the trenches of her own thoughts that she did not hear the sounds of crushed gravel outside, nor the sound of Agatha's car door slamming shut so that she could open the doors to allow herself entry.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only thing Rio heard was the sound of those very doors opening, and it scared the absolute shit out of her. Jumping out of her skin, Rio spun in a startled hop to see Agatha -- still wearing that delicious black dress -- with a face that could have given the paint job of a fire engine a run for its money.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked positively
     <em>
      irate.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not speak once the doors were all the way open, or on her way back to the car. Even still, she did not utter a single word as she shut the car off, climbed out and shut the heavy doors with fervor, causing them to clank as she slammed them. The moment she slid up the deadbolt so hard she nearly tore it clean off, Rio finally realized just how angry she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she did not understand was
     <em>
      why.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paced on heavy heels back toward the car, a hand flying up to press rough fingertips to her head as she fought to find exactly what it was she wanted to say. Rio tried to stop her before she said something they would both regret.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha --" she attempted, but Agatha's hand snapped away from her forehead and stilled, palm facing Rio in an attempt to make her stop talking.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What the fuck do you think you're doing?! You have no righ--" It might have been sharp enough to cut, but Rio didn't care and cut her off anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No right?! No fucking right?!" Rio trilled, her voice climbing octaves with almost every word spoken. "Be serious right now, Agatha! You're
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     standing here because Alice texted me and I called you. You know DAMN well that you were ready to walk into that bar with who KNOWS how many people watching you like a fucking hawk!"
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm a big girl, Rio, I can handle myself," Agatha snapped, brow pinching tightly in a scowl that made Rio's stomach twist around itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can you?! Can you really, Agatha? Because what I see is someone who's so fucking sure of themselves that they're resistant to the truth. You were
     <em>
      caught
     </em>
     , Agatha, the moment you stepped into that bar." Rio's own tone had risen in volume, but it had also increased in its edge. She simply could not bring herself to understand why Agatha was acting so goddamn ungrateful when Rio could have possibly just saved the version of life she had where she remained free and not locked behind bars until she was old and grey. "And whether or not you want to give credit,
     <em>
      we
     </em>
     are the ones who cared enough to stop it from happening. And Alice doesn't even fucking
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was trying to help, trying to point out the obvious, but those shades of red all over Agatha's face were only deepening the more pissed off she got.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So what, exactly are you hoping to accomplish here?" Agatha fired, brow pinching even tighter in her anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're joking, right? What the fuck does that even mean?!" came Rio's venomous reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You think I'm just going to throw in the towel because you
     <em>
      think
     </em>
     that I
     <em>
      might
     </em>
     have been arrested tonight? You think I should just fucking
     <em>
      quit
     </em>
     because you say so?"
    </p>
    <p>
     That?
    </p>
    <p>
     That was a blade, one that pierced cleanly through a section between her ribs and lodged firmly in her chest, her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Agatha truly thought that was what this was all about, she was an absolute idiot. How could she truly think that all Rio cared about was forcing her hand? Hadn't she learned enough over the last months to know with certainty that that was something Rio would
     <em>
      never fucking do?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It stung. It stung something awful.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it had to show in the expression Rio had immediately found, one that looked like Agatha had physically struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's fucked if that's what you think, Agatha," Rio finally managed, taking a step back that left her ass pressed to the steel table -- Agatha's murder table.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then what is it, Rio? Why the fuck would you do this?" Agatha was still angry, but Rio
     <em>
      swore
     </em>
     she could hear something else seeping into her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     It sounded a lot like fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     There Rio stood, only worried about keeping Agatha safe and out of the clutches of the law. What she did not have the capacity to give due consideration to was the fact that Agatha's internal monologue was not a repetition of 'She fucked this up for me.' In fact, Agatha's internal monologue, unbeknownst to Rio, was quite far from that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, in that very moment as those wide and wild blue eyes stared her down, Rio couldn't hear the one thought on repeat in Agatha's head:
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      If I stop, she won't want me anymore.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, all Rio saw was deep crimson cheeks, bared fangs, and a fire burning white hot in those eyes she so often wanted to drown in. Now, wanting that seemed dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
     After another moment of doing her best to collect her bearings, Rio finally found her voice to provide the answer Agatha had been demanding, even if it was noticeably lower than it had been in their vicious sparring match.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because I care about you, Agatha. I thought that much was obvious."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had hoped that she could see the impact those words made, but little wavered in Agatha's expression. She was still teeming with rage, boiling over due to the disruption to her routine. She had her set ways, had her practices, and all she could see in those moments was that Rio had done the one thing she'd sworn she would never do: Rio had stepped in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had caused a rift to open between Agatha's picture perfect methods and the reality that she was not as slippery as she might have considered herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Agatha was seeing in those moments was that her life was going to change, one way or another, and
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     had to be the one to decide which way the pendulum would swing first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got it, she truly did; Agatha was terrified of change. That was something Rio had parsed pretty quickly after meeting her. She had
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     realized just how terrified she actually was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you really cared, you'd --"
    </p>
    <p>
     "ENOUGH!" Rio shouted, cutting Agatha off before she could dig that knife in Rio's chest deeper, ad then twist. Her hands both launched up in front of her, signifying just how done she was with having such an argument when Agatha was very obviously not going to give her much to chew on in return. "If you want to go back to the fucking bar so bad, then
     <em>
      go.
     </em>
     But when they haul you off in the back of a cruiser, I can't be the one you call. And... we
     <em>
      both
     </em>
     know that I would be the
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     call you could make."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was biting, it was piercing, but most of all, it was honest.
    </p>
    <p>
     That honesty slapped Agatha clearly in the face, leaving
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     the one looking like Rio had just assaulted her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's fucked up," Agatha returned, suddenly without edge or rage.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But it's not wrong," Rio bit back, her own cheeks painted with her frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
     For just a moment, a heavy and painful silence fell to rest between them. Agatha was stony in her outward appearance, but Rio was only looking at her eyes. Those scared, frightened, unsure, nervous blue eyes that she had come to love just as much as she loved Agatha herself. They were darting over every inch of Rio's face, panicked as they searched for... something, anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what was she looking for?
    </p>
    <p>
     Another several moments of tense silence stayed completely stagnant between them, brown eyes burning into blues and blue burning right back, just as hot. It was a showdown for the ages, trying to see which one of them was going to break first; Rio knew it could not be her.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she lost the battle of wills, she would completely dissolve into a puddle of tears as she sniffled and begged for Agatha not to leave her behind, whether it was her taking off or her choosing to go to prison for the rest of her life. It would have been unbecoming and she did
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     want Agatha to form the opinion that if they had a disagreement, she was going to break out the tears in an attempt to be convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they stood with several feet between them, Rio would have done anything else to convince Agatha to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was beginning to wonder if it actually mattered at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was right: She was a big girl and she had handled herself for nearly forty years to that point and had been fine.
    </p>
    <p>
     But no one could keep playing the game she had been playing all that time without finally running into the consequences of their actions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not even Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Composed, put-together, collected Agatha who was now realizing that she had a choice to make, one that would determine exactly how the rest of her life would go.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could choose Rio, and a life that they might be able to build together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or she could choose a life in captivity, one where she woke, ate, shat, and slept on someone else's schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was up to her, and they both knew it, but Rio was also painfully aware that she could not voice such an ultimatum without risking what was between them even more than she already had. She couldn't. She
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to, but if it blew up and she had to watch Agatha climb into that SUV one last time, never to be heard from again?
    </p>
    <p>
     It would kill her, far more painfully than Agatha ever physically could herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I don't know what you want me to say," Rio finally managed, slicing cleanly through the silence that had just been sitting there, waiting to be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Say you'll stay out of my way as far as this is concerned," Agatha replied, tone tightening again in an attempt to make herself seem more in control than she actually was. Rio could see it in her face, though. She was losing her hold on all she knew, and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can't. Not so long as we're together. I give a fuck about you, Agatha, and I don't want to see you rot in some cell for the rest of your fucking life! I don't know where you're taking issue with that, but sort it the fuck out." She could have walked. Right then, Rio could have stomped off and slammed those barn doors shut for nothing more than effect. The truth was, though, that she didn't want to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't want to walk out on Agatha, mostly because she realized she was the only person in Agatha's life who had ever even obtained such an ability.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm not doing this anymore," Agatha dismissed, waving her hands in front of her as though she were completely doing away with the entire conversation they'd been having.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more, another blow landed directly to the center of Rio's chest, nearly knocking the breath right out of her lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was it?
    </p>
    <p>
     It was that fucking simple for her?
    </p>
    <p>
     How could it be so goddamn easy?
    </p>
    <p>
     As she started to turn around, a lone plea fell from Rio, choked and broken in the form of her name.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha..."
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands were back up again at her sides, her back completely to Rio as she began to pace toward the car to make her exit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had fought so fucking hard, all that time, just to keep her around.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't just
     <em>
      walk out
     </em>
     and act like it all meant absolutely nothing to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Could she?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched in abject horror as Agatha reached for the handle of the door, so ready to jerk it open and leave that she was practically radiating the heat of her indignant anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Toss the burner. I'll have your things, and Phineas ready by 11pm tonight for you to pick up from the lobby."
    </p>
    <p>
     Fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     No.
    </p>
    <p>
     No.
    </p>
    <p>
     No no no no no no no!
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't fucking do this! Why did it seem like it was the easiest thing in the world for her to just
     <em>
      leave
     </em>
     ? And do what? Go back to that stupid bar? Get herself caught?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Y-You... Ag-atha... You c-can't..." Rio tried, but the way her voice shattered stopped her from pressing on, mostly because it offered space for Agatha to interrupt her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Watch me."
    </p>
    <p>
     It shouldn't have happened, but Rio knew it was going to the moment the boiling in her chest rolled up into her throat, carrying a string of words she
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     she never should have said out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
     The truly amazing part was that it was strong and even despite everything inside of her falling apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm in love with you."
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment the words hit the air, Rio regretted them. She regretted how desperate they sounded, how pathetic and weak. She regretted saying it, but mostly, she just regretted the way Agatha's body tensed as though she'd been struck with a cow prod.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't," she snapped. "Don't fucking say that."
    </p>
    <p>
     She might have been angry, but she had let go of the door handle; a small victory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was downright terrified, but not nearly enough to back off. She had said it because she meant it, whether or not Agatha wanted to believe her. She
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     love Agatha and she had spent the last week and a half telling herself that she didn't, or at the very least, that she could never tell her. She had spent so long thinking it would be the one thing that could actually doom them to a fate apart, but right then it might have been the
     <em>
      one
     </em>
     thing that could save them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am, Agatha. I
     <em>
      love
     </em>
     you. And I know that we exist in a reality where you may never be able to say it back, but that doesn't stop me from feeling it. I... I don't know if you feel it too, but...
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     is why I called you.
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     is why I demanded you meet me here. And it's why I..." Rio cut herself off, hearing the unmistakable tremble over her own words. It was fucking stupid to be pouring out every secret feeling she'd been harboring since Agatha had left for Taipei, but she simply couldn't help herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's why it's going to
     <em>
      kill
     </em>
     me to watch you leave, if that's really what you want to do."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's back was still to her, but with her hawklike stare, Rio clocked the minute shifts in Agatha's posture and the way it slackened
     <em>
      just barely.
     </em>
     She still looked completely enraged, but something was shifting, moving, sliding around to make a space for that information to fit into.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to keep going, to give her a laundry list of reasons she should stay, but would it have made any difference?
    </p>
    <p>
     Wordlessly, she chose to instead step forward, purposely dragging her feet over the dirt covered cement floor so that Agatha knew exactly what it was she was doing. Even with that knowledge, she did not immediately reach for the handle and jerk the door open so she could storm off, likely driving right through those damn doors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Surprised but somewhat relived, Rio kept moving.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kept moving until her front was flush with Agatha's back, though she did not wait for the assistance as she wrapped both arms firmly around Agatha's middle, holding her close.
    </p>
    <p>
     "
     <em>
      Please,
     </em>
     " Rio begged weakly, tucking her face into the hair that covered Agatha's neck. She drew in a slow breath, taking in the scent of her shampoo and perfume while of the mind that it might be the last one she'd ever get. "I love you, Agatha. I'm
     <em>
      in
     </em>
     love with you. And I... Please stay
     <em>
      with me.
     </em>
     "
    </p>
    <p>
     For the longest minute, Rio felt as though she were clinging to a statue. She was holding on to something that might never change, set in stone. Agatha was her own person and if she did not want to stay, she wouldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     So when she lifted her arms to lay them directly atop Rio's, it was the first thing that caught Rio off guard, but it wasn't the last.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Okay,"
     </em>
     Agatha finally breathed, her fingertips sinking into the skin of Rio's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Okay. I'll stay."
     </em>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
     Hearing those words, it was like being struck by lightning, not once, but twice in the exact same spot. It was a shock to the system in the way that every single limb suddenly felt numb and yet, Agatha still somehow found herself standing, even if her hand had fallen from the handle of the car door as if it were the grounding that had allowed her to feel that lightning so fully.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you. I'm in love with you."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It ran at least three laps in her head before she barked her response, knowing full well that the only reason Rio was saying it was to make her stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't! Don't fucking say that!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't actually love her. No one could love her. Love wasn't an emotion associated with Agatha Harkness -- not ever. She was saying it to make this decision even harder than it already was.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact of the matter was that right then, trembling like a leaf as she stood less than a foot away from her quick exit, Agatha had no fucking clue what the right thing to do was. She wanted to keep going, simply because her crusade had since turned into a compulsion, but deep in the caverns of her chest, Agatha
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     Rio was right. She
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     that if she kept going and chose not to relocate, it was only a matter of time before the police finally found a grip and dragged her right to a cell that she would reside in for the rest of her mortal existence.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the other hand, there stood Rio mere feet behind her, claiming an emotion that Agatha was not sure she was even capable of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then she realized something very unsettling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she didn't need to think herself capable to actually
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     it, even if she didn't know what to call it.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she knew, with certainty, was that she would have done almost
     <em>
      anything
     </em>
     to not have to walk away, but in her panic and terror, she almost had.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Rio had said it, the one thing that could stop her in her tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
     For as much as Agatha wanted her to backtrack and tell her it was a joke and make it even easier to leave, Agatha wanted her to mean it just a little more.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio kept going, she got just that.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I am, Agatha. I
     <em>
      love
     </em>
     you. And I know that we exist in a reality where you may never be able to say it back, but that doesn't stop me from feeling it. I... I don't know if you feel it too, but...
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     is why I called you.
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     is why I demanded you meet me here. And it's why I..." Rio stopped speaking and while Agatha teetered on the edge of not wanting to know what else she might say, her burning eyes closed and she drew in a shaky breath, not knowing what else might need to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's why it's going to
     <em>
      kill
     </em>
     me to watch you leave, if that's really what you want to do."
    </p>
    <p>
     Since getting that fifth call, Agatha had come up with about sixty different reasons why Rio would be better off without her, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <p>
     - Rio had never needed to be complicit in the things Agatha had been doing. Yes, Rio had been the one to seek her out, but Agatha
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     should have taken her to the barn.
     <br/>
     - Once Agatha
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     taken her to the barn, she should have threatened her not to come back, simply because Agatha had always taken things on alone and no one else needed to be in the midst of the fucking storm she could be.
     <br/>
     - Rio had known stress and anxiety like no other since Agatha had walked into her life.
     <br/>
     - Rio's job put her at an even bigger risk of catching some kind of heat, especially if Agatha went down. She spent time around the law, assisted it in finding answer. Being so close to a goddamn serial killer was never going to end well for her.
     <br/>
     - Rio deserved better, and more. Sure, Agatha knew that she had come to treasure Rio's presence and she ached to have her around, but Agatha wasn't the picture perfect partner and she was certainly not wife material in the least.
     <br/>
     - Maybe, without her around, Rio might know a peaceful life, a life where some impossibly lucky woman would get to wake up in the middle of the night to her sleep talking, or stir in the morning to realize that she was gone, but likely only to get breakfast. Maybe it would be a life where she could trust someone else to handle her the way she trusted Agatha to.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Agatha didn't realize?
    </p>
    <p>
     For as much as Rio was one of a kind in her eyes, she was much the same in Rio's.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not move, she did not speak, and honestly, she was barely even breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     What should she do?
    </p>
    <p>
     How could she stay, if it was only going to bring more chaos into Rio's life?
    </p>
    <p>
     But how could she walk away from the only person in her entire life that had ever loved her?
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could run herself into the ground over it, Agatha heard a sound. It was quiet, the sound of rubber soles scuffing against the floor of the barn, but she knew what it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
     It meant Rio was coming closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     It meant Rio was coming to
     <em>
      her.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could think of
     <em>
      some
     </em>
     kind of reply, Agatha felt it all at once as Rio's body pressed to hers and her strong -- albeit not as strong as Agatha's own -- arms wrapped firmly around her middle; it was a move that mere days ago, Rio was too afraid to commit to on her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had stopped being afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
     So why couldn't Agatha?
    </p>
    <p>
     It all happened at once as she felt Rio nuzzle into her neck, that quiet plea falling from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "
     <em>
      Please,
     </em>
     " came her cracked and uneven whisper, jostling enough of Agatha's hair that it almost tickled as it brushed against her skin. She couldn't have laughed, though, not as they existed in that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I love you, Agatha. I'm
     <em>
      in
     </em>
     love with you. And I... Please stay
     <em>
      with me.
     </em>
     "
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had begged plenty of times before in their dalliances, but it had always been in the bedroom, or in Rio's living room. It had been a way to spur Agatha on into giving her more, into taking all she wanted. Rio had begged for harder, for faster, for deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, she was begging for the deepest thing that Agatha could give her; a future where they could be together.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was stalk still as her thoughts whipped circles around the inside of her skull, pinging and dinging off of every single surface they could find.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could she say no? How could she reach for Rio's arms and pull them off of her and get back into that car? How could she walk away from the only person in the world that had actually
     <em>
      seen
     </em>
     her, in every bit of honesty that she was?
    </p>
    <p>
     The answer?
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, her arms raised and landed along the lengths of both of Rio's, clutching at her like
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     might be the one to pull away and declare it had all been nothing more than a joke. Deep down, Agatha knew Rio would
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     do such a thing to her -- especially given their current predicament and the hot water they were practically boiling in -- but fear was an irrational creature.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only way Rio wasn't going to leave was if Agatha would just give her a reason to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Okay,"
     </em>
     she managed, but the sound of it as it hit her ears was foreign, like she didn't recognize her own voice.
     <em>
      "Okay, I'll stay."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment it left her lips, Agatha felt it everywhere as Rio's hold on her tightened and pulled her in even closer, though there was nowhere else left to go. She had expected Rio to say something, had hoped she might, but when she instead nuzzled in a little deeper to create a window to the skin of Agatha's neck, Agatha knew Rio didn't need to say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
     She did all she
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     to do when those warm and soft lips pressed ever-so-lightly to her skin not once, not twice, not even three times. Hell, Agatha lost count at six. It was only when she stopped to speak that Agatha regained some sort of rational thought, which immediately went out the window the very second she processed what Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      "Say it again. Please, say it one more time."
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     In a flash, Agatha's heart was trying to bolt away, slamming into her ribcage with fervor at how such a request made her feel.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt
     <em>
      needed.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     All by Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Drawing in a slow and uneven breath, Agatha found her voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will stay. Here," she whispered, grip tightening around Rio's arms, "with you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did not chuckle, did not sigh, did not make much of a sound at all that was not the quiet smacking of her lips as they resumed their work on Agatha's neck. In addition, Rio had started to squeeze her so tight that it was possible she might just snap her in half.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't care.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could hold on as tight as she wanted for as long as she wanted, and Agatha would have let her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately for her, Rio had something else in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     What had started as a light peppering of kisses had grown warmer, fuller, as Rio not only kissed at her neck, but began to suck and nibble too. It was a sudden shift in gears, but Agatha understood it as best she could.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had almost walked away from Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     To Rio, it would have been akin to death to watch it happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     So instead of dwelling in that 'what almost was,' Rio was very blatantly laying a path forward to what could be. And right then, the possibility of more was what was fueling Rio's hunger. If Agatha had to guess, she wanted to touch, to feel, to taste, to savor all that was in her arms, all that Agatha was and could ever be.
    </p>
    <p>
     All Rio could hope for in a companion, a partner.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was what she was, and Rio was finding ways -- very quickly -- to show her just that.
    </p>
    <p>
     When her arm began to move, something in Agatha felt panicked, like she didn't want to let Rio put any kind of distance between them, but with a soft
     <em>
      'shhhhh'
     </em>
     breathed against her skin, Agatha's grip loosened and allowed Rio the freedom to shift.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she did with that freedom was almost tender and soft, but it had an ulterior motive. Rio's arm raised, reaching behind and around Agatha to gather her hair, pulling it aside and pushing it over the opposite shoulder. Her reasoning for such was simple: Rio wanted more, and Agatha realized it the moment Rio's hungry pecks fell to her neck again. First at the crook, then travelling upward to Agatha's ear, Rio's kisses only stopped so that teeth could find purchase on skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     A whip of heat cracked up Agatha's spine, striking her several places at once. It hit her brain, setting it alight. It his her heart, overheating it beyond reason. And, despite the fact that it might have been a little irrational, it struck her right between the legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been angry, so angry, but it had only been to cover up the sheer terror that she'd been so able to hide mere days ago when Rio had burst into the apartment in a frenzy. Things were not exactly perfect as they stood, but they were together and that was more than enough for Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     To then add to it the sudden and affectionately heavy assault Rio was currently committing on her skin?
    </p>
    <p>
     It almost felt overwhelming, but only in the sense that she suddenly realized she was standing in the very reality she had told herself she could never have.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wanted to live in it as long as she fucking could, even if it killed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio continued, the tip of her tongue running along the edge of Agatha's ear, a need found Agatha that she simply could not contain, no matter how hard she tried.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Say it again," Agatha suddenly pushed  in a gasp as the arm that remained across her middle began to move via Rio's volition, surfing upward toward her chest. It was her turn to beg to hear the things she wanted, even if it didn't sound like it. For as strong as Agatha tried to make it, for as resolute as she tried to be, there were the softest notes of desperation hiding there, the ones that ached to hear it just
     <em>
      one more time.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Heeding the request by pressing her lips to the shell of Agatha's ear, Rio's response was nothing more than a whisper as it filtered right in, burrowing as deep into Agatha's brain as humanly possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I love you, Agatha Harkness."
    </p>
    <p>
     For only a split second, a surge of emotion welled in Agatha's chest, causing her breath to stunt and stutter just noticeably enough that as their arms reached their destination and Rio's hand gripped firmly at Agatha's left breast, Rio found a way to apply pressure with her forearm, too, holding Agatha tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once more, for good measure, she spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I." Kiss to neck. "Love." Kiss to ear. "You." Her hand raised from Agatha's chest, gently slipping beneath the one atop it and reached for the left side of Agatha's jaw, turning her head enough that their lips made full contact as Rio's head craned over her shoulder. When she pulled away, she did not go far, but had something else to say. "Now let me prove it to you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was not sure what she had been expecting, but the immediate attack of starved lips on her neck once more quickly jacked up the temperature of not only her body, but also the air around them. The softest moan spilled from her lips, but a substantially louder one followed at the feeling of Rio's teeth sinking into her flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hand that had turned her head had resumed its position on her chest, though Agatha did not at all miss the way it deftly slid into the cup of the dress, her warm palm making contact with a bare and sensitive breast. Fingers were nimble and precise as they found and toyed with the nipple, pebbling it enough to pinch and lightly pull.
    </p>
    <p>
     For as soft as the moment before might have been, something had clearly shifted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact of the matter was, feelings had never been the easiest thing for Agatha, and she knew that she wasn't the most communicative person in the world, but sex? Sex was the one way Agatha knew how to converse, how to have the harder conversations. Well, okay, that was an exaggeration simply because it was never a vehicle in such a way before, but with Rio, that was all it had ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even that first night, the night after their stupid date where Rio had asked too many stupid questions and pissed her off, Agatha knew that the insane fucking they partook in that night had said something.
    </p>
    <p>
     For her, it said that she had come back against her better judgement for some asinine reason solely because something about Rio kept drawing her in.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Rio, it had clearly voiced that she knew exactly who Agatha was and it held no bearing on her opinion of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had always been a way to say the things Agatha didn't have words for, even as recently as the prior Thursday night when Rio had all but pleaded to be on top, promising Agatha that she was safe. That had been the loudest conversation of them all. Rio had asked her three times that night to trust her and even though Agatha had never verbally agreed, it had become painfully obvious that Agatha trusted her
     <em>
      implicitly
     </em>
     with little question.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, with Rio biting at her and squeezing at her and pinching at her, she was saying what she'd already said out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio loved Agatha. And Agatha? Well, she needed Rio in ways she could not explain and some part of her was almost certain it was kind of the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio," Agatha breathed, reaching behind her to slide her fingers into Rio's hair, gripping lightly the more she smothered her in physical affection. Before she could find anything else, make any demand or plea, Rio began to move.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hand that was not gripping at Agatha's chest landed on her hip and applied the lightest pressure, a gentle request to follow her as she stepped back a few feet, coming to an abrupt halt as the backs of her thighs made contact with the steel table behind her. Her touches had become almost harsh in their demand, but Agatha didn't care.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could bruise her up, mark her down, and Agatha would not have given a single fuck in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because for as much as she liked it when Rio was hers, it was very,
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     clear that Rio liked it when Agatha was hers, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a flurry of completely unexpected movement, Rio's hands were moving, shifting; her left one rose to slide up the length of Agatha's neck, sending a spark right into her lower belly, one that she felt immediately in the heavy pulsing between her legs. It only seemed to worsen the moment Rio's other hand found her breast and with her hold, tilted them back enough that she pressed herself between the table and Agatha's body.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha could still feel those ravenous kisses to what parts of her Rio could reach were causing her heart to hammer in her chest, thumping so loudly she could hear it in her ears, drowning out any worry, anxiety, or concern that had been plaguing her mere moments ago. By the time the hand of Rio's that was not holding her jaw to expose more skin wound down her body and began to bunch of the bottom of her dress, that hammering was damn near
     <em>
      deafening.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck, Rio," Agatha moaned again, her body shifting as much as it could given their positioning so that more of the dress could be hiked up. The very second Rio had accomplished her goal of getting it up high enough and her fingers found the damp fabric of Agatha's underwear, the throaty giggle she released against Agatha's skin nearly made her cum on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I like that you wear panties when you hunt but not for me," she murmured just before dragging the tip of her tongue up the length of Agatha's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmm, y-yeah?" Agatha attempted, but the way a couple of Rio's fingertips graced the hem caused her breath to catch in her chest. "And... And why's th--
     <em>
      ohhhh
     </em>
     ." Agatha had been trying, really trying to engage in the witty banter, but Rio made it damn near fucking impossible the moment her touch slipped beneath the cum-tarnished fabric and intentional fingernails raked over the patch of coarse and soaked hair she found there.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because,
     <em>
      my love
     </em>
     , I get to feel how wet it gets you."
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, so, that second bit was surely the part that was meant to rile Agatha up, especially given the way Rio's touch slipped between her folds to find all that was awaiting her, but it was the first one that nearly jettisoned Agatha's soul right out of her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      My love.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was two little words, and yet, it damn near made Agatha feel as though she was going to burn up from the inside out. Without physically being capable of such a thing, mindless words slipped from her in a moan instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ohh, Rio, I -- Fuck!" She wasn't sure what, exactly, she had been trying to say, but she was cut off anyway as Rio's fingers began to tauntingly run the slowest circles around her clit. Her hips shifted toward the touch, but all Rio did in response was sink enamel into flesh as she bit down on Agatha's shoulder, drawing another longer and louder moan in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing made sense in that moment, and nothing made sense as Agatha's body nearly melted the moment two of Rio's digits skated down through slick and pressed against her entrance, though did not immediately slip inside. Instead, Rio had a question to pose, one she very plainly
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     to hear the answer to.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you want, Agatha?" she all but purred, the hum of her question vibrating the shell of Agatha's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     one answer to that question.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You, Rio," Agatha replied back in a gasp, hips shifting downward as one of her hands found its way to the back of Rio's arm, gripping it so tightly her nails almost pierced through skin. "I want you."
    </p>
    <p>
     The most devious hum sounded behind her, rattling out from behind Rio's full and pressed lips and it only amplified the utter longing that Agatha had spent so long trying not to feel. It was out, now, in the open and Rio could
     <em>
      hear
     </em>
     just how fucking much she meant it, Agatha
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     she could.
    </p>
    <p>
     Satisfied with such an answer, Rio gave Agatha exactly what it was she wanted by means of pressing two fingers into that pulsing and needy core. Another moan ripped right out of Agatha's lungs, desecrating every flat surface in the entire barn as it ricocheted and bounced off of each one.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time in her life, Agatha finally understood what it was to
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     someone to touch her, to
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     them to do it out of more than physical attraction. She understood, in that moment, what it was like to be shown true emotion when it could not be properly channeled into words.
    </p>
    <p>
     It that meant that Rio was going to fuck her stupid while sandwiched between her and the table Agatha had killed countless men on? Well, that in itself was hotter than fuck, but it was yet another reason why Agatha could never find it in her to offer protest.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she could offer was a series and whimpers and moans and groans as Rio maintained a steady rhythm as she thrusted back and forth, pulsing in and out of Agatha's body in the most delectable way. When she shifted below Agatha's weight, Agatha had not been expecting the way Rio's leg raised, bending at the knee, so that she could use it as leverage to push Agatha's own leg a bit more to the side, opening her up further for the taking.
    </p>
    <p>
     And boy, did Rio fucking take.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow, she managed to finagle a position that allowed her to both fuck every inch of Agatha that she could reach and also make intermittent contact with her clit at the same time, drawing her closer and closer to the edge of her pleasure. It was becoming paramount, the need Agatha felt to give Rio what she was so clearly aching for and what her own body was aching for at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio. R-Rio," Agatha stammered, words tripping up as they fell from her lips in a desperate warning. She wanted to continue, to tell Rio what was about to happen, but Rio cut her off first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Cum, Agatha. I
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     you want to cum for me." It was low, it was raspy, and it struck every single appropriate point in Agatha's brain, allowing her the final release of one of the most intense orgasms she had ever experienced in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     It could have been the way Rio was pawing and gripping at whatever part of her body she could touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     It could have been the fact that Rio seemed to know
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     the right way to touch her.
    </p>
    <p>
     What it actually was?
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman who loved her had handled her -- while still with desire and need -- with care in the most savage way possible, and it made her cum so impossibly hard that she almost forgot how to breathe. The disorientation was strong and immediate, causing her to suck in a breath that idled in her lungs for just a little too long before releasing in a long, deep moan that caused Rio to tense beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could feel every single place in her torso where Rio's chest was heaving beneath her, fighting to draw in her own oxygen to steady herself, though the way she had been kissing at Agatha's neck and face and hair had not actually stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck," Rio whispered against her scalp, placing one more kiss there before her head lulled back against the table and Agatha's followed suit, dropping over her shoulder. She was still winded, still fighting to remember what it was to breathe, but she wasn't quite so ready to move unless Rio announced any discomfort at the weight bearing down on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Little did she know, the still-panting Rio below her could not have been more content to be exactly where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     A soft whimper left Agatha as Rio withdrew her fingers, though they came to rest on the bare part of Agatha's hip that was still exposed due to the way her dress had been pulled up. The moment the sound hit Rio's ears, those lips were working again, this time able to find purchase on Agatha's warm cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You did so good for me, my love," Rio murmured, stealing another couple of pecks as her other arm wound around Agatha's middle.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You..." Agatha huffed, finally reaching a point where her heart had finally stopped hammering so hard that it made it difficult to think. "You g-gotta stop doing that." It was meant to be an instruction, but what came out fell a little closer to a chastising that never reached its full potential.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmmm," Rio crooned into her hair, her nose lightly grazing Agatha's temple. "And why is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because," Agatha managed, a little stronger that time. "If you keep doing it, I might actually spontaneously combust."
    </p>
    <p>
     The laughter that lightly shook their bodies was instant, but it remained soft despite the humor Agatha's words had brought on.
    </p>
    <p>
     After only another moment of simply existing in such a way, with Rio's arm tightly around her middle and every single inch of Agatha's spent weight weighing on her, Agatha finally found the ability to shift, sliding first off to Rio's side, and then off the edge of the table. Righting herself, she reached down to fix her dress, her hooded gaze lifting to the woman on the table who, in that time, had stripped off her shirt and was propped up on her elbows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio being shirtless was not the first thing that caught Agatha's attention, however.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, what drew her focus immediately was the way Rio had both of her hands securely wrapped around the inner wrist straps of the table below her and was grinning like an absolute madwoman.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're serious?" Agatha questioned with a mild sense of disbelief coating her words.
    </p>
    <p>
     "As a fucking heart attack," Rio responded.
    </p>
    <p>
     In that moment, peering down at that gorgeous, half-naked woman as she was all but begging to be strapped down to the metal table that she
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     countless men had been murdered on, Agatha hardly knew how to process.
    </p>
    <p>
     One thing she realized, though, was that it never could have been anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
     It only ever could have been Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What about the collar?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's next question immediately catapulted her from her reverence, an immediate and unfamiliar horror gripping her by the throat as her eyes went wide and her head shook instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Absolutely not," Agatha fired back; while it was a complete turn-on that Rio wanted it, there were implications there and emotional assignments that had been bestowed upon that collar when Agatha had crafted it and not a one of them were, in any way, related to sexual pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seeing the immediate pout that formed in Rio's expression softened her enough to offer an alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But... That doesn't mean I can't get you one of your own, if that's what you want." It was offered as a statement, but there was a question in the tone Agatha had used. It was a question Rio answered immediately with a bright and eager grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Really?!" she gushed, sitting up a little more in her excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes really, my little psychopath," Agatha offered with a laugh, stepping forward to begin the work of securing the wrist of Rio's that was closer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Says the serial killer," Rio quipped back, that devilish grin only deepening.
    </p>
    <p>
     "
     <em>
      Reformed
     </em>
     serial killer, thank you," Agatha voiced, a mock pout causing her lip to jut out.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Babe," Rio reminded. "Ninety minutes ago, you were ready to kill an undercover cop."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Semantics," came Agatha's reply, slipping a finger between the binding and Rio's wrist to assure that they were not too tight. As she stepped around to complete the task a second time on the opposite wrist, her eyes lifted to Rio who had been watching her the entire time. Upon eye contact, that very dangerous grin found her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You'll put the prongs up won't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Disbelieving, Agatha released a low laugh, though her hunger had grown exponentially in a matter of a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You really are a fucking freak."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And you want to fuck me for it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Truth be told?
    </p>
    <p>
     She was right.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha would never argue.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     As Agatha slipped a couple of fingers beneath the second leather strap and gave a light tug to ensure Rio's safety and comfortability, Rio prayed to any and all gods that might have been listening that Agatha did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why?
    </p>
    <p>
     Because if she did, Rio would not have heard a single word that fell from her lips, not over the absolutely unrelenting thunder that was happening in her ears as a result of her hammering heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they existed in that very moment, Rio felt completely dismantled in the best way. Her reservations were gone, her inhibitions in the wind. She had no hesitation in allowing Agatha to see
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     for all she was, just as Agatha had been willing to give preview to in the same regard. The further they tangled into one another -- in any and all senses -- the easier it became to just be... real.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, with every inch of her hindside pressed to cool steel and the woman she loved towering over her with that dangerously vicious grin, Rio felt the most real she ever had in her life, and that sure was fucking
     <em>
      something.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Ropes, lace, handcuffs? Those were fine enough given the proper setting, but being bound to a table that's sole purpose had been to pry away human life?
    </p>
    <p>
     No one in their right mind would have ever asked for such a thing and yet, Rio felt like a live wire waiting for a ground, waiting for a chance to shock any and everything that touched her, Agatha included. There was no grounding her right then, no leveling her enough to think this through from an objective standpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      She fucking loved Agatha Harkness.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And whatever Agatha Harkness wanted to do to her, she absolutely could.
    </p>
    <p>
     For as wild and unhinged as Rio felt, Agatha seemed... the complete opposite: cool, composed, but there was a sinister delight flickering in her eyes as she faced the head of the table, her hip pressing to the side as she leaned against it. Her hand raised, two fingertips landing painfully light directly between Rio's breasts on her sternum.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Mmm, what're you doing?" Rio hummed, lifting her head slightly to glance down at the touch before her eyes swept up to Agatha's calculating blue gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     An echoing soft hum escaped thinly pressed lips as Agatha considered, teeth showing a moment later in a show of cunning. "Planning," she answered, her voice velvet smooth as those fingers began to dance down, tracing out the lines of the geometric ink imbued upon Rio's skin. The lower she wound, she turned, the front of her body pressing to the edge of the table as she watched her own work. The moment that touch met the waist of Rio's jeans, tugging on the button lightly, Agatha spoke again. "But, it might be worth mentioning that I'm thankful you still can't wear a bra."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, I know," Rio shot back, unable to keep from wriggling the slightest bit beneath Agatha's taunting touch. "I catch you staring at the left one more often than you think."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oohhhh," Agatha admonished, finally popping the button free that she'd purposely been idling with for so long. "If I knew it wouldn't actually hurt you, I'd absolutely give it a little smack right now." She was speaking, and Rio was listening, but she was also acutely aware of the fact that Agatha's nimble fingers had caught hold of her zipper and was working it down in a
     <em>
      painfully
     </em>
     slow fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Licking her lips, Rio actively caught and consequently stopped herself from goading Agatha on in a manner that might actually hurt, letting her head fall back to the table. She drew in a steadying breath at the very same moment she felt Agatha reach across her body to hook fingers from both hands in the waist of her panties, shucking them with ease right along with her jeans.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I know you're having your fun," Rio rasped, hips shifting against the cold metal, "but fuck, Agatha."
    </p>
    <p>
     A snide but delighted chuckle hit the air around them as Agatha discarded the pants to the side and set about the task of shedding her own dress, leaving her there as nothing more than a complete visual feast for the bound Rio to consume with her eyes. Her wild hair, cascading over her breasts. Her pink skin, flush with the remnants of her orgasm. Her soaked underwear, still clinging to her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What do you want?" she husked, leaning against the table again so that she could drop a hand to drag the tips of her fingers up the length of Rio's thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could have verbalized an answer, but instead, felt compelled to respond in a much more practical way.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a flash, her head jerked up off the table so quickly that even Agatha seemed startled for the briefest moment, but when their eyes locked and Rio's mouth fell open and her tongue rolled out in a clear but silent demand?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's legs squeezed and rubbed, a surprised moan slipping out of her before she had time to consider keeping it in. At the exact same moment, her fingertips halted in their tracing, mere inches from Rio's dripping sex.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're insane," Agatha admonished, though her words seemed to be chipped at the edges and lacking the strength she wished they had.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Because I want you to ride my face while I'm strapped to a table? I'm sure you've made
     <em>
      much
     </em>
     more questionable choices," Rio countered with a daring and hunter-like look in her eyes. It might have been audacious or bold, to consider herself the hunter when
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     was the one in the most compromising position.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact was, she hadn't intended to hunt in her own way and yet, she'd captured the most important thing: Agatha's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Rio suspicions would always be right, and maybe there would never come a day when she would hear those big three words fall from Agatha's lips, but it didn't matter. She would never have to say them so long as she lived, because she'd already proved it. Standing there, being so willing to fuck completely raw and nasty on that damn table while knowing she'd soon have to dismantle it, that said it loud enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even quieter, but more meaningful, she had declared she would stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha loved her, that much was clear, and Rio would never need her to word it aloud for it to be understood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was giving up the most important part of her life so that she could
     <em>
      stay with Rio
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It was still insane to consider, but it was something that deserved such consideration, just perhaps at a time when she wasn't practically begging the woman she loved to climb up and let her taste the fruits of her labor.
    </p>
    <p>
     For as insane as it might have seemed, Rio wanted to know what it tasted like when Agatha came
     <em>
      knowing
     </em>
     she was loved. Of all the completely unhinged thoughts she'd had over the last few months, surely that one wasn't the worst, but it
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     the most prevalent in her mind as Agatha seemed to waste little time making her decision.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way she shed her panties and practically vaulted up the table would have been disorienting if not for the way Rio's head dropped back, thudding softly against the table as a dreamy and satisfied grin filled her face at the thought of getting exactly what it was she had asked for.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, it was not what she got -- at least, not at first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Agatha's strong and warm hands found her hips as she knelt between Rio's knees, positioned specifically so that when she leaned to place a few firm and hot kisses to Rio's hip, she was not at all jostled as Rio's legs raised and tried to nudge her on.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agathaaaa! Noooo!" came her weak protest, one that was shattered at the end by a yelp at the feeling of Agatha's teeth catching just over her hip bone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't worry," Agatha murmured in response, her tongue dragging lightly toward Rio's middle. "You'll get what you want. But I get to have my fun first." She stopped speaking just long enough to press a kiss to the the very spot where the bush there began, but then lifted her head with a daring gleam in her eyes. "And you can't stop me."
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it was the sultry tone of voice she had chosen, or maybe it was the look in her eyes. Whatever it was, looking at Agatha as she stated such a fact sent an immeasurable heat pulsing through every noticeable point in Rio's body, including the aching cunt mere inches below Agatha's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     enough for Rio to break form, to beg that Agatha just take whatever the fuck it was she wanted, but she had clearly asked a question, one that had an answer not from her wants, but from Rio's.
    </p>
    <p>
     As always, the choice was Rio's, and she'd made herself abundantly clear.
    </p>
    <p>
     But also as always, Agatha had to torture her a little first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those hungry but somehow reserved lips placed a series of kisses upward, covering the expanse of Rio's abdomen, her ribcage. The higher she kissed, the more frequently Rio accidentally fought the confines of her binds, trying to reach for Agatha's head, for her arms, her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     It never mattered and yet, she still tried again and again, finally resorting to her only means of communication aside from the soft gasps and sighs that fell from her; she writhed and wriggled beneath the scrutiny of those licks and sucks and bites, but the very moment Agatha's head ducked to her right side and a hand raised to her left breast, Rio stilled in anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't sure
     <em>
      what
     </em>
     she had been anticipating, but it was definitely not the way Agatha's strong fingers gripped at her left side while a lush and languid tongue ran flatly over her right nipple, but only once. The most astounded gasp left her at how fucking
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     it felt, but it was of little consequence to Agatha who simply continued her way up, nibbling and sucking and kissing her way from breast to neck to ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hot breath against her ear, Rio's lips parted to offer a command, but Agatha spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You have no idea what it's doing to me to see you like this, princess," Agatha purred, teeth catching the lobe before giving it a light tug.
    </p>
    <p>
     "So," Rio managed back, though she choked on the word and had to swallow it before she could continue. "How about you give us a taste so we can find out?"
    </p>
    <p>
     For the quickest moment, Rio could feel all at once as Agatha tensed above her and sucked in a sharp breath against her ear, one she released in a low and needy moan that slipped in to flood every single inch of Rio's consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're incorrigible," Agatha accused, stealing one final swipe of her tongue along the outer rim of Rio's ear, one that left her wanting Agatha even more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could have offered another jab, another quip, but the time for banter was over; she wanted what she wanted and what she wanted was
     <em>
      Agatha,
     </em>
     every last bit of her. Thankfully, as Agatha began to shift around to reposition, Rio was going to get
     <em>
      just that.
     </em>
     She didn't care that she couldn't touch, didn't give a single shit that really, she had little control in the situation. All that she seemed to care as Agatha straddled her head and sank down onto her awaiting mouth was that Agatha was there, right there,
     <em>
      literally
     </em>
     on the tip of her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there she would stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     With Rio, she would stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow, with those thoughts racing spirals around her mind, Rio found herself of the opinion that the taste of Agatha was infinitely sweeter than it had ever been. It was still much the same, that salty, sharp, sweet taste of her sex, but it was simply
     <em>
      better
     </em>
     with the knowledge that it was Rio's and Rio's alone for the foreseeable future.
    </p>
    <p>
     A lax tongue met Agatha's weeping cunt easily, but once more Rio momentarily lost sight of their arrangement, attempting to lift her hands to cradle the cheeks of Agatha's ass in order to dictate a bit better and moaning her disappointment when she could not.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound, and the way it vibrated the parts of Agatha it could touch, drew a sharp but pitched sound from Agatha in return, animalistic in nature as it ripped its way out of her throat. Her hips rocked down instinctively but then lifted a moment later as she became aware that they had only just begun; if she came right then and there, Rio had absolutely
     <em>
      no
     </em>
     plans of letting her live it down, especially after all the shit she'd been giving Rio since the first time they'd stripped down and fucked raw.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck Rio," came a sharp hiss above her, causing her eyes to fly open and divert up, finding ravenous blues boring into her, jacking up the temperature so high that Rio considered she simply might just evaporate under the heat of her scrutiny. This time, when Rio struggled against her bonds, she knew what she was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beginning measured by paced swipes through every bit of Agatha's slick she could get to, Rio wanted more. Wanting more and being able to get it, though? Two completely different things.
    </p>
    <p>
     While being limited, Rio was by no means incapable. In fact, the way her head tilted back just enough that she could drag the very tip of her tongue up to catch the fleshy ridge of Agatha's clit elicited the most pleasured groan. Following it almost immediately, Agatha's hips canted down, stalling just a moment before finding their way back into rhythm as she rocked against Rio's insatiable mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     There beneath her, Rio felt as though she had completely left the spiritual plane and any existence where were not together was not an option. She was there, with Agatha, tasting what of her was available and she was downright determined to make Agatha feel every bit of emotion that so wholly consumed her. She wanted Agatha writhing and screaming above her, even if she had the power to get away.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wouldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wanted it as much as Rio did.
    </p>
    <p>
     She made it known a moment later as she broke their deadlocked stare, hair cascading down behind her as she tilted her head and extended her arms back so that her palms fell to the backs of Rio's hands and her fingers filled the spaces she found there. The rolling of her hips never once stopped against the wanting tongue beneath them, but as she gripped at Rio's fingers, she knew that Agatha was close.
    </p>
    <p>
     And boy, did she want to see Agatha cum with a view like
     <em>
      that.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could have been strung tight with the way she was bowed and fired right off, but all Rio could see was valleys of absomens, peaks of breasts and the very point of Agatha's chin as he jaw dropped and a bumbling of words fumbled its way out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck, Rio. I'm -- Oh,
     <em>
      fuck!
     </em>
     "
    </p>
    <p>
     To Rio's ears, it was nothing but a plea for
     <em>
      more.
     </em>
     So, she listened. Dropping her chin again, her tongue stiffened with purpose and as Agatha shifted down, Rio made her move. Easily, the tip found Agatha's entrance and slid inside, immediately feeling the clenching as Agatha thrust her hips forward, clit accidentally swiping against Rio's nose in a mistake that only made her sieze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Rio couldn't see Agatha's face, she realized they both became aware of the same thing at the same time: if Agatha did that so much as
     <em>
      one more time,
     </em>
     she was going to come completely undone.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Rio tried to make her do it again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her tongue -- still snug in Agatha's tight and fluttering core -- began to curl with purpose and intention in time with Agatha's movements, timed exactly to maximize her pleasure. When Rio happened to graze an impossibly sensitive spot, her excitement flared somewhere low in her belly at the primal noise Agatha expelled right before she released Rio's hands only to fly forward, her grip fastening tightly around the corners of the table as her orgasm careened into her at full force.
    </p>
    <p>
     From where Rio was laying, it was a fucking
     <em>
      sight.
     </em>
     Every inch of Agatha began to tremble with her moans and cries, her hips bearing down with almost her full weight against Rio's tongue and lips -- and nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling every clench, every flex, every pulse of Agatha's orgasm around her tongue, Rio was convinced she could die happy. In fact, she was
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     convinced that as Agatha continued to grind down against her to milk every bit of pleasure she could from the way Rio was eating her up, Rio didn't even fight her constraints as the oxygen in her lungs became harder to come by,
    </p>
    <p>
     She did not cry out, did not bite or try to wrestle her head from beneath Agatha's hot and throbbing pussy. No, Rio simply fought to keep going until she simply couldn't anymore and the immense pleasure began to blacken the edges of her vision.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, that wasn't pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was actually suffocating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ah, who fuckin' cared?
    </p>
    <p>
     As her movements began to lose strength, however, Agatha seemed to notice that something had changed. Gathering enough wherewithal to peel her fingers from around the edge of the table, her head dropped and blue eyes opened to find that those homely brown ones were not staring back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio looked a little... blue?
    </p>
    <p>
     Instantly, Agatha lifted her hips and was both relieved and mad as fuck to hear the gasp below her. And... she was also a little more turned on, too, but there were more pressing matters at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio! What the fuck?!" she nearly crowed, all but scrambling away as a lucid and dreamy smile curled the corners of Rio's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What?" she managed back dumbly, head filled with the utter fog of pleasure that had completely inundated her at the lack of oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You couldn't breathe?! Why didn't you bite me?! Or make noise?! Or try to get away?!" Rio could
     <em>
      hear
     </em>
     the panic in Agatha's voice, but she thought it quite unnecessary. She was fine. Agatha had noticed. She would always notice. And, well... Rio hadn't wanted her to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
     "'Cause I didn't want to," she answered honestly, licking what remained of Agatha off of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hanging over her, Agatha reached up, securing a light hold along Rio's jaw as she looked her over, as if she might find any indication that she had damaged or hurt Rio in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was still wearing that stupid fucking smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You are literally insane," Agatha clipped, though her tone was low as if she were trying to be intimidating.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If I died and the last thing I got to do was eat you out, I'd die a happy woman," Rio assured her in a drawl, an airy and light quality to her voice that wrapped around her words warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a hardly audible chuckle, Agatha dropped her head, pressing her lips to Rio's warmly in a chaste kiss that ended with a drag of her tongue across the underside of Rio's top lip, surely a show that she had liked Rio's commitment to her pleasure just as much as Rio appeared to, herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If I killed
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     on this table, I'd bring you back just to kill you again," Agatha murmured haughtily against her lips before she pushed herself into an upright position to survey her handiwork. As Rio peered up at her, she could
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     Agatha's gaze as it roamed her body, drinking in every last inch of marked and bruised skin, from the hickeys and bite marks to the small bruises left in all of the places Agatha could not seem to hold onto tightly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Does that mean you'll let me have a round two?" Rio rattled, mischief washing cleanly over her expression, tinting the light in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Atop her, straddling her stomach, Agatha seemed to consider the request, but those hungry blues were darting too fast for it to ever be a simple yes. She could have caved and given Rio what she wanted, but Rio could see as the indecision flickered over her thoughtful but ever-so-beautiful features, causing those lips to twist into a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "On one condition," she finally agreed, letting a hand drop to trace out those dark and prominent lines on Rio's abdomen. All the while, she never once dared look away, lest Rio miss the absolute devilment that had taken her over.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh?" Rio returned, giving a gentle tug on the leather around her wrists. "You'll untie me this time?" Her grin was bright and wide, but dimmed the very second Agatha shook her head in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     The longer this wore on, the longer Agatha dangled the opportunity in front of her like a carrot, the most desperate Rio grew. Sure, she'd already doled out two orgasms, but if Agatha would let her? She'd offer a hundred more, caveat or no caveat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I haven't gotten to touch you," Agatha declared, as though that were enough of an answer. Given the slight remnants of disorientation via oxygen deprivation that were gripping at Rio's brain, she did not immediately register what it was Agatha was implying. At least, she didn't until Agatha started to move.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way the cool air rippled across the skin of Rio's stomach was foreign, causing her to lift her head in search of understanding; the moment her eyes landed on the cum-slicked patch of skin around her navel, a husky and low chuckle left her, head thudding back against the table again for effect as Agatha stilled on her knees by Rio's thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Something funny?" she questioned, though the knowing look on her face immediately gave her away.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Marking your territory, hm?" Rio offered in return, lifting her head to glance at her stomach in indication. The moment Agatha followed and saw the source of Rio's entertainment, her own wicked grin grew and then deepened even further.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I can lick it up if you'd like?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Another thump, another low groan as it left Rio's lungs, body flushing with heat and rippling with goosebumps beyond her cognizance. The things Agatha did, the things she so easily said? It was, quite frankly, a miracle that they got anything else done other than the endless marathon of sex Rio could easily commit herself to if given the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'd rather lick other things instead, though," Agatha added, running the pads of a few fingers up the inmost part of Rio's far thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     How she did it, Rio would never known, but the utter sex appeal that was practically bleeding out of Agatha would always be the most delicious mystery, one that Rio did not actually care about solving. For as much of Agatha as she had always wanted to figure out, there were simply some things that could enchant her until the end of time and she would
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     find it in her to complain.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You promised me a round two," Rio tried to argue, but the convincing factor fell a bit flat.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wouldn't it be three?" Agatha teased, but before Rio could fire off a rebuttal, she was moving again, this time to straddle Rio's head, this time facing the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh fuck.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     was the caveat?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wanted to fucking
     <em>
      sixty-nine
     </em>
     while Rio was strapped to that fucking table?
    </p>
    <p>
     Jesus fucking everloving Goddamn Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had considered it before, the idea that maybe things like soulmates might exist, but right then, she realized the truth of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     They didn't have to be soulmates to still be made for one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     For every woman Rio ghosted or broke up with because she knew she'd always be hiding parts of herself, and for every single person who had disappointed Agatha in her life, they had simply been waiting for one another without ever knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew, with certainty, that she was
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     going to love someone the way she loved Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     What she also realized was that even though she was likely the first person Agatha had ever loved, no matter what happened between them, it was also probable she would be the last as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Never again did Rio think that Agatha would ever allow anyone else in the way she let Rio in; no one would ever get access to Agatha the way Rio did simply because no one else could ever
     <em>
      be
     </em>
     Rio. No one else could ever see Agatha the way she was, or treat her body with the respect and attention she'd been intentionally starving herself of for so long.
    </p>
    <p>
     No one else but Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the sudden ache to have her hands free solely to touch the woman above her, Rio still lifted her head to meet Agatha's hot and sloppy core for the second time that night, tongue instant and precise in its contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was strangely sensational, the way Rio's mouth found Agatha at the
     <em>
      exact same time
     </em>
     Agatha's starved lips latched onto her thigh, sucking roughly before teeth sunk in deep. They sank so deep, in fact, that it drew a pained cry from deep in Rio's chest, one that poured right against every inch of Agatha's body that was cradled between those hungry, hungry lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, fuck!" Agatha rasped, strong hands moving to cradle the backs of Rio's thighs, palming the crease of her ass in a way that allowed her to pull and rearrange those slender and toned legs as she saw fit. The moment she achieved the precise angle she had been seaking, it was Agatha's turn to take
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     what it was she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Rio felt her, truly felt her, she almost forgot what it was she had been trying to accomplish in providing Agatha her third orgasm within the hour. All that she could think about, all that consumed her entirely was the feel of Agatha's tongue, firm in its motions as it traced up the length of one fold and down the other before sinking between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "
     <em>
      Ohhhhhhgoddddd."
     </em>
     It was hardly a sound as it escaped Rio's lips to burrow deep within Agatha's body, a weak whine of satisfaction as all at once Rio felt every single stroke, every single pass Agatha made.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was something she had experienced before, even at Agatha's mercy and yet right then, Rio found herself in an active battle to just fucking
     <em>
      enjoy it
     </em>
     for as long as humanly possible. It was
     <em>
      just fucking like her
     </em>
     to be so goddamn easy for Agatha and yet, she'd desisted in her own work of Agatha's pleasure to make sure hers last just that much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what a battle of fucking wills it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     When, after only a minute, Rio started to feel the oncoming wave, she resumed her own ministrations in an attempt to distract herself. She was desperate in the way she lapped up all of Agatha's slick and hot cum she could manage, but it wasn't proving to be as helpful as she had hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, the moment Agatha shifted the position of her hand in a way that enabled her to press an easy digit straight into Rio's pathetically needy core, it was fucking
     <em>
      over.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio would have had full use of her hands, she would have grabbed at Agatha's hips, pulled them down, and all but screamed her pleasure into Agatha's cunt. Instead, her head thudded -- substantially harder that time -- against the table beneath her as her back arched cleanly off the metal and her hips shifted uncontrollably beneath the assault of Agatha's tongue, relentless in the attention it was paying to her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Ag-Agatha!" Rio nearly screamed, her own strength surprising her as she fought against the leather straps, her fingers digging into her palms harshly in her need.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite her cries, Agatha did not stop, not for the fucking world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Twisting beneath her, the pleasure of that initial orgasm never actually waned; instead, Agatha continued her work, never relenting in her need to have Rio crying her name
     <em>
      over and over and over again.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And that was exactly what she got, and endless cycle of
     <em>
      "Agatha!"
     </em>
     s and
     <em>
      "Fuck, baby!"
     </em>
     s and
     <em>
      "Oh my godddddd!"
     </em>
     s that looped again and again through two more orgasms in the span of less than three minutes, though Rio wasn't convinced the first one ever ended in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she was nothing but a limp and whimpering mess with pleasured tears streaking her temples, Rio finally recalled what it was to breathe as Agatha's voracious assault finally tapered off and she removed her weight to plant herself on her bare feet at the side of the table. Before she made any move to undo Rio's restraints, a gentle hand dropped and soft knuckles caressed her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you okay for me to unbind you?" Agatha asked her and for just a moment, Rio considered saying no. She was
     <em>
      okay,
     </em>
     yes, but that didn't mean she was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then again, spending the entire night fucking in the barn probably wasn't the best move to be made, no matter how much of an absolute thrill it had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, Rio's lips worried in thought as she peered up at the woman hanging above her, that lazy and satiated smile warmly tugging on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, above her, her whole fucking world.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she would never be able to get enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," she finally answered in something that was barely above a whisper. "But only if you take me home."
    </p>
    <p>
     The look in Agatha's eyes as the words registered in her mind nearly stole every bit of oxygen from Rio's lungs, this time in an entirely different fashion. That was a look of understanding, of affection and unadulterated devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, Agatha was saying it without saying it, and Rio
     <em>
      saw it.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     With another kiss as her hands began their work on the straps closest to her, Agatha's reply was barely a breath across Rio's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I will absolutely take you home."
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Funny,
     </em>
     Rio thought again, much in the same way she had when they'd been at the pier the prior weekend,
     <em>
      that is exactly where I am whenever I'm with you.
     </em>

    <p>
     Rio
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     have driven herself home.
    </p>
    <p>
     As in, it was something she was more than capable of doing on her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the moment Agatha helped redress her, placed the lightest peck to her lips and then coaxed her into climbing the SUV while she herself tended to opening and then closing the doors, Rio never could have argued.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sure, she was capable, but that didn't mean that it was what she wanted to do in any way. What she
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     in those moments was not to be any further away from Agatha than she absolutely had to be. It wasn't a clinginess, or a worry that if they split up, Agatha might actually run; no, they were long past that, Rio was certain. What it was instead was simply Rio's need to foster the tenuous and still unstable connection.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, Rio had admitted the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes, Agatha had chosen to stay with Rio, though the finer points of what that entailed surely needed to be hashed out still.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, all of that was true and somehow, Rio was still nervous. She didn't think that Agatha would so clearly bolt if given the chance, but there was a deeper part of her that wanted to ensure that Agatha did not feel alone, not even in the twenty or so minutes it would take to get them back to the condo.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio understood the reality of the situation, point blank:
    </p>
    <p>
     Every single bit of their entanglement had been new for Agatha, had been something that she had never before let herself indulge in. Even more than that, the deeper things seemed to run between them, the more Agatha immersed herself in the world of things that she had convinced herself she could not have. It was a sight to behold from Rio's vantage point and yet, it also helped her get the full picture of who Agatha truly was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, the beautiful woman with a sharp smile and even sharper claws.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, the intelligent woman beyond measure who had covered her life with an identity that was not
     <em>
      who she was
     </em>
     and was still so much of her brilliant mind and dangerous cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, the voracious sexual partner who could never seem to get enough of the chemicals and euphoria that were only brought forth by the way their bodies tangled and twisted and tasted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, the schemer, the builder, the tinkerer, the rocket scientist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, the loner.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, the vicious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, who had done every single thing in her power to fight the pull of human, emotional connection.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     The one and only woman Rio would have gone to the ends of the earth for.
    </p>
    <p>
     For every sharp and cutting edge that Agatha had, Rio had somehow found the cracks, the ones that were
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     big enough for her to slip through. First it had been through the shield of Amelia, and then it had been through the armor of Agatha. What Rio found beneath that? A bruised but still beating heart that needed tending to, that needed to be taken care of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio would never consider herself any kind of supreme lover and there had surely been a time or two where she had found it in her to be vicious out of little more than fear, but when it came to Agatha, things were different. That had
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     been different.
    </p>
    <p>
     When it came to Agatha, Rio
     <em>
      saw
     </em>
     something there.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had seen it in the police reports, in the tox screens, in the old internet articles.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio saw was a woman who had been so severely misunderstood by the world, someone who had lost all she had that mattered far too young, and she had finally said 'enough.' What Rio saw was a woman who had picked up what little ash had remained of her old life, held it in the palm of her hand, and blew with the gust of the deepest breath she could manage solely so she could watch it as it was carried away in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio also saw was a woman who had convinced herself that being alone would always be far better than chancing the risk at trusting another human being in a world where human beings were notoriously untrustworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she sat in that quiet car with the radio droning on softly in the background and placed her hand atop Agatha's thigh on the drive, Rio turned her head and saw a profile of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     She saw a woman who was loved, who now knew she was loved, and who was doing her best to prove that
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     in her felt the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was patient, would always be patient, and that was something that would simply never change.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being patient, as it turned out, had its perks.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of those perks came in the way Agatha's hand dropped and blanketed Rio's where it rested on her leg, even if she did not wrap it up in the warmth of her hold. That didn't matter, anyway. What mattered was that as she used the majority of her focus to get them safely home, she still wanted that touch, that contact, the one that she found comfort in solely because it was Rio who was providing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     For every quiet moment that carried them to the condo, a moment of frenzy matched them the second the doors to the elevator slid shut and they began their ascent to their kingdom above the city.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha might have been calm and collected up until the mechanical whirring began, but a beat after, all bets were off.
    </p>
    <p>
     The speed with which she surged forward, using the full power of her hips to pin Rio to the wall of the elevator was mind-boggling in the best way, but Rio had little time to question it before she felt everywhere as Agatha's hands found both sides of her face and those luscious but starved lips found her own in a hot and hungry kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been startling, in all honesty, shocking in the sense that for about eight seconds, Rio simply stood there completely stunned. Yes, the barn had been fucking
     <em>
      hot
     </em>
     beyond measure -- and Rio could still feel five small but sharp stings between her shoulder blades as irrefutable proof -- but the way Agatha was touching her and holding her and kissing her as they climbed higher and higher above the city was
     <em>
      new
     </em>
     . She was still rough in her hunger, but there was something else there.
    </p>
    <p>
     It could have been reverence, or maybe even appreciation, but it was
     <em>
      warm
     </em>
     in a way that wasn't quite scalding hot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something in that hold and those kisses told Rio
     <em>
      more.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     What it said to her was that Agatha was holding onto something that she did not want to let go of. It wasn't just Rio in her physical form, but also in the one that had crept into the chambers of Agatha's heart with slow and careful tendrils, soft vines of ivy, and had wrapped around it like a protective layer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was holding onto the shield Rio had offered her, the one that was secured around the most vulnerable part of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was holding onto the love, and Rio was more than happy to stay exactly where she was to keep letting her have it, every bit of it that she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let Agatha take it in the way their lips meshed and only parted so their tongues could become reacquainted. She let Agatha take it in the way her left hand slid under the right side of Rio's t-shirt and pawed at the metal-less breast in a way that practically screamed her need. Rio even let Agatha take it in the way her hands dropped and she stooped -- somehow without once breaking the kiss -- to grab the backs of Rio's thighs, lifting her with ease to be pinned to the wall behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     With just as much ease, Rio's legs wrapped around Agatha's waist -- pulling her in tighter, holding her closer -- and rubbery arms draped around her neck, anything that might keep her
     <em>
      that fucking close.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The taste of Agatha, the taste of that kiss, it was new too. It was still ravenous and a seizing of every last thing Agatha wanted out of her, but Rio could taste the longing there, the devotion. It was sweet like honey, and just as thick, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Completely lost in everything that kiss was and every single place where their bodies were pressed together, Rio wouldn't have heard anything else in the world; not a bomb going off, not all the alarms in the world, and most certainly not the quiet ding overhead that signified they had reached their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nor the soft chirp that sounded below them the as the doors parted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thankfully, Agatha seemed to hold onto a little more of her own cognizance that Rio was capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio could question it, Agatha was still kissing her but pulled her from the wall with her large, strong hands still supporting her weight. Instinctively, Rio's legs tightened around Agatha's waist, her hands coming to rest on either side of Agatha's jaw as she took more and more of that kiss and every bit of that sweet honey taste on the tip of her tongue as it scoured Agatha's mouth searching for even more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't notice Phineas, didn't notice as the doors shut behind Agatha, and hardly noticed as Agatha breezed through the condo and headed straight for her bedroom, clearly having not gotten her fill from their barn encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, Agatha was kissing her like she might
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     get enough of that so long as she lived.
    </p>
    <p>
     For Rio, she would have been happy to provide it until she physically no longer could.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment her ass touched the mattress, Agatha took the opportunity to utilize the sensory distraction to sever the kiss, withdrawing her wild and wanting tongue from Rio's mouth far quicker than Rio could consider stopping her, drawing out a long and disappointed whine with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Aga--" Rio began to protest but was silenced mid-call by a light finger that pressed to her lips. Dark eyes flickered up to find those daring blues boring into her, but the smile that Agatha was wearing was not devious in any way and rather shouted a tenderness that she probably did even know herself capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without a word, Agatha reached down for the hem of the loose t-shirt on Rio's frame, pulling it off with a little assistance in the form of Rio's raised arms and discarded it with a flick of her wrist. As she closed the space between them with another kiss, those deft fingers worked with precision to unfasten Rio's jeans for the second time that night. When she hooked them through the belt loops and gave a pull, Rio's hips lifted and once more, she was bare and bright there in front of Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     One more time, all for Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still not of the mind to say much, Agatha started to turn, likely to head to the closet, but Rio wasn't ready to let her go quite yet. She showed as much by the whip-like hold she took on Agatha's wrist, keeping her planted. With her free hand, she reached up and wound long fingers into that mess of long hair, using it as leverage to pull her close. Just before their lips reconvened in another display of what Rio was now certain was passion over lust, the quietest whisper escaped her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I love you."
    </p>
    <p>
     She did not have the intention of giving Agatha enough time to respond or panic, leaning the rest of the way to kiss her, but it happened anyway in the most minutely considerable ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt it in the way Agatha's fingertips sank into the most bony parts of her hips on either side, felt it in the way she tensed beneath Rio's hold. She felt it in how tight the kiss was at first, and how reserved it became in the next moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Noticing all of those things, she could not refrain from pulling away to check in, at least visually, with the woman before her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The expression that she found the moment her eyes fluttered open was not one of pleasure, or even happiness. What Rio saw as Agatha's sharp blue gaze found her was little more than worry, concern, and perhaps a dash of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha..." she whispered, fingers moving to caress the scape of Agatha's cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I... I can't... I d-don't..." Agatha attempted, but it was clear the words tasted like chalk in her mouth as she tried to form them. She was struggling, trying to communicate, and Rio could see every single spot in her features where she was growing upset that she couldn't speak, couldn't tell Rio what she wanted her to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio heard it anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I can't say it back. I don't know how.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Didn't Agatha see? Couldn't she just
     <em>
      look
     </em>
     at Rio and see that it wasn't what Rio
     <em>
      needed,
     </em>
     wasn't something she
     <em>
      had to have?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     For as nice as it would have been to hear those words roll so sweetly off Agatha's tongue, Rio was nothing but a realist, so she made it known and let it be heard. With another soft but measured kiss, Rio found her voice in the quietest murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You don't have to. Show me instead, my love."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a simple command at its core, but they were both fully aware that it ran far deeper than the surface levels of simplicity in any and all capacities.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was being said in the limited space between them was that Rio knew without having to be told, and she also was aware that Agatha could say it in other ways. Maybe it would be a little bit away from what she knew to be familiar and comfortable, but the only thing Rio truly wanted was all of Agatha that she might be willing to give up.
    </p>
    <p>
     It registered and then wound through Agatha's cortex, solidifying and cementing as the demand became clear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those frightened blue irises softened with understanding as Agatha finally got it, the lines of her frustration with herself smoothing as she realized just how heard she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe, staring back at one another, Agatha
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     realized that Rio had been listening the entire time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was moving, but not far, as she closed the remaining expanse between them by sealing it with another kiss that spoke of understanding and patience and delivered the sentiment that she felt so impossibly validated and seen.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way her tongue timidly pressed at Rio's lips as her hands moved over Rio's sides, the way she met Rio's warm and awaiting tongue to dance and brush and wind around, the way she stepped even closer to the bed despite not being able to actually move, they were the loudest cries, the most assured declarations.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha was nowhere near done.
    </p>
    <p>
     That sweet and savored kiss wore on only a few moments longer before Agatha found it in her to progress, separating their lips with the lightest gasp that sounded delightfully shocked landing in Rio's ears. Her fingers had found their way to Rio's jaw, lightly tracing the angle of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get comfortable," she instructed in a whisper, her eyes flicking toward the head of the bed just before she took one last kiss.
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     one felt like an ask for courage, and Rio delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although Agatha had given her a command to be followed, Rio did not immediately move as Agatha stepped back and departed for the closet, shedding her dress along the way. It was nothing more than an afterthought as she passed through the door and the light inside flipped on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, Rio still sat, poised at the edge of the bed with her dark gaze fixed on the empty doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was just a minute, just one moment she needed for herself in an attempt to correctly align every feeling that was trying to drown her in their euphoria. It was just a few seconds where Rio could see the full picture for all that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     She loved Agatha, and Agatha wanted her around.
    </p>
    <p>
     What that might actually end up looking like was still to be determined, of course, but there was hope in the potential. Maybe they would stay in the city, or maybe they might move somewhere else. Maybe Agatha would finally find it in her to step away, or maybe they might find another avenue for her to channel her frustrations. Whatever the outcome, Rio didn't actually care about the circumstances so long as they were together for all of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a few moments longer of basking in her contemplation and appreciation, Rio finally adhered to the request that had been made of her and slid back on the bed. It was far enough that she could twist and adjust to draw back the duvet, folding it over to one side so that it was out of the way enough to not be a nuisance. Once accomplished, Rio had just begun to settle into her place on the bed when the shadows whipped and wavered by the closet door and Agatha stepped out, shutting the light off in her wake.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been the last remaining light in the room that was not created entirely by moonlight
    </p>
    <p>
     And boy, did Agatha look an absolute stunning vision there bathed in those white hues.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moon clung to her tightly, illuminating every curve and protrusion of muscle, tissue, flesh of her lithe and built form. At the same time, the deepest valleys of shadow curled into the divots and dips formed in her physique.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had always been a specimen, but as she turned to take in the sight of Rio splayed out on the bed, awaiting her return, that always-stiffened posture seemed to melt and she was more of a vision than she had ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
     For every time they'd done this dance, Rio had been able to look to Agatha with the certainty that she was the predator, that she would consume Rio whole each and every time she was given the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Right then, Rio didn't feel like prey. She didn't feel like Agatha would tear her apart by means of pleasure just because she could. No, as she finally understood the look that Agatha was wearing, Rio
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     it.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were equals.
    </p>
    <p>
     They always had been, just in different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where Rio gave her body over so freely in the bedroom, Agatha gave over other parts of herself like her mind and her heart via the choices she not only made, but also provided to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally,
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     , Rio could see it for the balance it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a newfound grace, something almost cat-like, Agatha slinked forward without raising her gaze from the task of lightly lubing up the silicone that stood at attention around her hips and immediately discarded the bottle afterward. She was being meticulous, but Rio realized something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's avoidance of eye contact (when Rio knew how fucking important it had become for her) gave her away; she looked
     <em>
      shy.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't the kind of shy where she might run away or hide because of shame or embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, it was the kind of shy where maybe she thought that if she looked Rio in the eyes for too long, she might lose her nerve.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sensing as much, Rio stayed quiet, just following her with a warm and loving gaze as she moved about and climbed onto the bed, stalking forward to where Rio's ankles lay parted atop the sheets. Silently, she placed herself on her knees between them and straightened to raise both arms so that she could tie that unruly hair in a wildly messy bun atop her head. It wasn't gorgeous, but it was practical and that was all that mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Rio got what she had been waiting for in the form of Agatha's gaze lifting and locking with her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't look scared, or worried, or nervous anymore, at least not in the way that had been permeating her posture.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, looking down to behold Rio as she laid naked and waiting, Agatha looked at peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Come here, my love," Rio beckoned lowly, pushing herself up so that an extended palm found a warm home on the side of Agatha's neck, fingertips sinking into lean muscle to draw her close. With her only a breath away, the space was gone as Rio placed another kiss to her lips and allowed herself to fall back to the cradle of the mattress beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fluidly and with little hesitation, Agatha moved with her and caught herself on both palms, leaving her poised above Rio with a strong sense of resolve seeping out of her kisses. The moment she extended her neck just a hair too far and their noses smashed together, though, that resolve shattered into nothing more than breathy giggles.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a tender moment, a silly one, as tendrils of humored breath curled around one another in a harmonious ringing of their laughter. It was quiet as it was, but as it tapered and drew to a close, it was barely audible before being swallowed in another kiss entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha was kissing her, the way her tongue gently probed and licked and tasted what it could of Rio's mouth was far softer than it had ever been, a showing of just how far Agatha had truly come when it pertained to how she channeled her emotions into a physical showing.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio?
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, Rio just let her. She had made the request and now, it was time to simply let Agatha answer it in kind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her first answer was
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     kiss, the one that pulled Rio further and further in, that warmed her more and more the deeper into Agatha she sank. The second answer was the way Agatha pulled away only to duck her head to the crook of Rio's neck, pressing a line of barely-there kisses up the length of it to her ear. There, those lips hesitated, her warm breath covering the shell upon each exhale.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was like she was willing herself, like she was trying
     <em>
      so fucking hard
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But she couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Rio did.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I love you," she breathed again, head turning so that her lips could catch the curve of Agatha's jaw in a quietly encouraging kiss. It was the gentlest nudge and also held the place of the constant reminder Rio would always be willing to provide, the one where Agatha was
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     aware of how she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another breath fell against her ear just before Agatha's soft kiss followed suit. While one hand held her up, keeping a small amount of space between her torso and Rio, Agatha's other hand landed along the soft skin of Rio's side, sliding downward along the outside of her hip. It finally halted at her knee, fingers curling beneath it in a light hold that allowed her to position it in exactly the way she needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if nothing more than automatic, Rio's opposite leg shifted and turned out, opening up a perfect cradle for Agatha's hips to fall into whenever she was ready. It seemed as though before she fully committed to that, though, she had a few more well-placed kisses to leave, peppering them over every bite mark and hickey she had imbued upon Rio's skin in their barn-time activities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Shifting again, Agatha began to move in a way that both braced herself and readied her for what it was she wanted to do, but as her head lifted from Rio's chest and a hand reached between them to steady the slick strap between them, a sudden panic sparked up Rio's neck, igniting her brain like a match to kindling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "W-Wait!" she nearly gasped, a hand flying up to anxiously grip at Agatha's bicep. All at once, it seemed to draw her attention, confusion writing itself across her expression as she peered down at a breathless and frenzied Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What is it?" she rasped in concern, though she did not otherwise move, still so painfully close that there was less than an inch between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I..." Rio attempted, her mouth suddenly so impossibly dry that words felt like little more than sand. She knew it was silly, knew it was completely stupid, but she also knew her body and knew that this? She wanted it to last. Her lips twisted and worried for a long moment, gaze never daring to leave Agatha's before she finally found the words, however quiet they came out. "I'm... I want to... last."
    </p>
    <p>
     It almost sounded ashamed, and the concern only deepened as Agatha released the lightest laugh, almost a giggle above her. Before she offered any verbal assurances, though, she offered a kiss first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll go slowly," she promised. It was so sincere, so fucking honest that Rio couldn't help but believe her. "And if it's too fast, just tell me." Another kiss, another promise. "I've got
     <em>
      you.
     </em>
     "
    </p>
    <p>
     For the longest moment, Rio felt every bit of emotion she possessed as it balled up in the middle of her throat, nearly choking her. The way Agatha was looking at her, the way she said those words, it was as if she had taken a page right out of Rio's book and mirrored every single thing she had done to soothe Agatha's nerves the night she'd come home; it was the same night she'd let Rio closer than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was leading by example and the example was the very precedent Rio had put into place.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had one another, and always would.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could have agreed aloud, but a silent nod found her instead just before Agatha kissed her again. That one was warmer, hotter even, to a point where it was all Rio could seem to focus on, at least until she felt that familiar pressure at her entrance just before Agatha sank inside. It was not an unfamiliar stretch, but something about Rio's nerves and how completely lit up they were made her ultra aware of every single
     <em>
      centimeter
     </em>
     as Agatha slid further into her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was gentle, the way Agatha began small but measured thrusts, ones that allowed her to slip a little further each time without completely overloading Rio's body with the pleasure she wanted to fill it with.
    </p>
    <p>
     The closer Agatha got on each pass, the lower she dropped and the tighter Rio clung to her, arms wrapping around her neck to pull her in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't
     <em>
      crying
     </em>
     , exactly, but the quiet whines that escaped her every time Agatha's hips cut off any space between them, sinking further and further into her were a sure showing that this wasn't just about sex for her. It had been the bar that had been set, and yet, as they vaulted cleanly over again, Rio hardly knew how to contain herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, she didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I love you," she whimpered, turning her head so that her nose landed between strands of hair as they were pulled back against Agatha's scalp.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Agatha's head dropped, her lips grazing Rio's shoulder, it left them so impossibly close that Rio didn't even
     <em>
      care
     </em>
     how badly her left nipple hurt as it was sandwiched between them. All she could ever think to concern herself with was the light panting and grunts as they spilled into her ear with each move Agatha made.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was saying it, Agatha was fucking
     <em>
      saying it
     </em>
     without ever speaking a word, and Rio could
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     every last bit of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the most intense sensation; yes, they had fucked feral several times over and it had been some of the most incredible sex that Rio had ever had, and while this was matching that energy to a degree, it was still
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     different.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     be gentle, of that Rio was aware, but the way she was handling her, touching her, feeling Rio out was a new kind of tender that Rio did not doubt was probably even surprising Agatha herself. It was light, gracing, a barely-there touch that traced lines over what of her Agatha could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made Rio feel wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made her feel appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made her feel
     <em>
      loved.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Unwittingly, when her pace began to increase, so did Rio's panic. Her teeth had caught hold of the lobe of Agatha's ear when she felt it, nearly barreling at her full-force. She had tried to speak before, but wound up only cutting herself off mid-sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I lo--
     <em>
      ohhhhh, fuck Agatha.
     </em>
     Slow. Slowslowslow," Rio nearly begged, fingernails sinking into the lean muscle of Agatha's back in an attempt to corroborate with her request.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't
     <em>
      panicking,
     </em>
     but she was by no means ready for it to be over so soon and Agatha seemed to be of the same mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thankfully, she both heard and felt Rio's cry, hips slowing substantially in their thrusts as she seemed to pull herself closer; she might have slowed down, but she didn't ease up, not in the least. Each thrust was deep, it was hard, but it was primarily just a way of getting nearer and nearer with the automatic movements.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I love you," Rio actually managed that time, breathing it into Agatha's hair between labored and hitching breaths.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pleasure was both intense and immense, but the feeling of Agatha's body against her own was where the true stimulation was rooted. It was the most impractical crackling of electricity that occurred in every single spot where their skin touched and brushed and rubbed, so slick with their sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
     After only a minute longer, Rio's legs shifted and raised only to lock her ankles along the small of Agatha's back, holding her tighter, encouraging her to come even closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she listened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Teeth sank into the skin of Rio's shoulder as her hips picked up pace again, this time striking entirely new spots with the way Rio had positioned herself. It was overwhelming in the best way, the one where Rio's consistent 'I love you's became more frequent but less intelligible. It only took a few more well placed strokes for Rio to realize what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, she thought she did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's hips canted in a very precise way, not once but twice, and Rio's awareness suddenly hit her at full force.
    </p>
    <p>
     Something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     Okay, not
     <em>
      wrong
     </em>
     , but something wasn't
     <em>
      right.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a pressure, a new one that Rio had never felt before. It felt like a wall, almost, a wall that was holding her back from achieving orgasm.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the same time, it almost felt like... she had to pee?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's teeth had moved to her neck, but Rio's panic quickly won out as her cracked voice spilled into Agatha's sweat-stricken hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh noo, nononono, something's --" she whined, fighting between pushing Agatha way and pulling her closer; she wasn't sure which she wanted more. "Agatha, I have to --"
    </p>
    <p>
     She might have kept going, but the speed with which Agatha's head flew up silenced her pretty quickly, even if Agatha's pace actually
     <em>
      increased
     </em>
     instead of slowing down. The look in her eyes, and on her face, seemed almost knowing, like she was in on some secret that Rio was not privy to.
    </p>
    <p>
     From that view, Agatha clearly saw that Rio was panicking, but instead of stopping, Agatha's head dipped as she looked Rio in the eyes and placed a soft kiss to her lips and whispered quietly against them. "Let go."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was so simple, so soft, and yet, Rio just... listened.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stopped fighting the sudden pressure low in her core and in the blink of an eye, an orgasm unlike any she had ever experienced before hit her so hard she saw white at first, and then nothing but stars. She did not see the obviously uninhibited grin Agatha was wearing between the kisses she peppered to Rio's face as she whispered against her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Good girl, let it go."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Breathe, baby."
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're okay."
    </p>
    <p>
     It was all Rio could hear, just those lovingly soft affirmations as Agatha breathed them against her cheeks, her chin, her lips over the sounds of her own cries and moans, ones she hardly knew how to stifle.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a startlingly loud gasp, Rio sucked in a breath and seemed to find herself again, realizing several things all at one time:
    </p>
    <p>
     1) Her nails were practically embedded into Agatha's back from how tightly she'd been holding onto her.
     <br/>
     2) Her calves were positively burning from the effort of staying fastened around Agatha's waist.
     <br/>
     3) Every single inch of sheet beneath her bare ass and lower back felt... completely soaked?
    </p>
    <p>
     "What --?" she began to ask, but Agatha swallowed her question with another fervent and hot kiss, one that only slightly detracted Rio's focus from the way her cunt was still absolutely pulsing around Agatha inside of her and her limbs were nearly unlockable in their stations.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha pulled away, that very same bright-as-fuck grin was covering her face. This time, Rio could see it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Never say never, hm princess?" Agatha posed, looking like she'd just won first prize at the school science fair.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, it just spun on a loop inside of Rio's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     What was she talking about?
    </p>
    <p>
     What did that mea --
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh my god, I didn't..." Rio finally breathed, the realization slamming into her almost as hard as that fucking orgasm had.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, you did, pretty girl. Who knew I just needed to show you the important stuff to make it happen?" It was a low purr, but Rio could hear both the pride as well as the pleasure that hung thick over Agatha's words as she allowed herself to rest her weight atop Rio's body, her face pressing into her neck for just a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew she wouldn't stay like that, knew that it was too much contact at one time, but for those ten to fifteen seconds that she
     <em>
      swore
     </em>
     she could feel Agatha's heart beating against her own, Rio reveled in every bit of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was right; it didn't last long, but as Agatha lifted herself up, she did not immediately whisk herself away and instead simply stared down at Rio with a look on her face that was only strange in the sense that it was one she had never really worn before. Her eyes sparkled in their affection, but the way her pink cheeks pushed slightly with her smile showcased a softness that Rio felt
     <em>
      so fucking lucky
     </em>
     to bear witness to.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she did her best to make it known.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I love you too," she said this time, her chest finally beginning to slow as she beamed up at the woman above her.
    </p>
    <p>
     That softness rippled slightly across Agatha's expression, but it did not entirely fade. Instead, Agatha simply looked... taken.
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment passed them by and Agatha's head dropped, another kiss gracing Rio's lips before she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You really should pee," she murmured, finally finding it within her to push away, much to Rio's chagrin. "But I'm going to start us a bath really quickly. If you wait, you won't even have to walk." Agatha's voice was stronger than her own felt, but it only helped Rio lull into comfort at what she was being presented with.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aftercare.
    </p>
    <p>
     Real, true aftercare, the kind that wasn't just sweaty half-cuddles and bumping hips to assert presence.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha had used another two letter word.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Us.'
    </p>
    <p>
     Was she really going to take a bath with Rio?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was still running through it in her head as Agatha shifted and pulled out, drawing a pathetic whimper from Rio who had never before known an emptiness like
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     one. It was new, just as was almost everything else they had experienced that night. As much as she hated it, she kind of liked it a little bit, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha righted herself at the side of the bed, it had been Rio's intention to follow, but Agatha beat her to the punch.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Nuhuh, c'mere," she voiced, leaning forward so that she was able to slide one arm beneath Rio's knees and the other behind her shoulder. Catching on, Rio was quick to raise her arms -- or, as quick as she could be given that they each felt like they weighed ninety pounds a piece -- to fasten around Agatha's neck, holding tightly as Agatha lifted her into a cradle of raw strength.
    </p>
    <p>
     In only a few strides, Agatha crossed the room and slipped into the bathroom, setting Rio down with ease to tend to her business as she turned on the dual faucets to the iron claw-foot bathtub. A moment later, she turned and leaned to place a kiss to the top of Rio's head, though the way she hesitated made Rio wonder if it had been an automatic action as opposed to one Agatha had actually thought about.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'll be right back. You can climb in when it's high enough."
    </p>
    <p>
     In spite of the fact that Agatha was clearly working through a plan in her head, Rio wasn't quite so ready for her to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But what are you--?" she began, but before she could finish, Agatha's fingertips found the underside of her chin as she planted another warm kiss to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Gonna change the sheets so we have a dry bed to climb into," she informed softly, the tiniest smile causing the corners of her lips to twitch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, but as she watched Agatha pace out of the bathroom and turn toward the closet, she honestly felt like she could cry.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't the kind of cry where she was upset or worried. It was the kind of cry where she realized that Agatha was
     <em>
      still doing it.
     </em>
     Agatha was
     <em>
      still
     </em>
     showing her what she couldn't say.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she kept it up, Rio wasn't going to know what to do with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     It took a few minutes for the water level to reach a suitable height, but once it had, Rio slipped easily into the warmth and let it envelop her, soothe her aching muscles. She could hear the faintest sounds coming from the bedroom and then, the quietest conversation. Well, a one-sided one, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No more noise, I promise. But you'd probably be better off hanging out in the living room for a while. I don't know if your mom will want to cuddle with you after a bath."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been melting away down to nothing all fucking night and yet that? That little snippet of Agatha's conversation with a cat who could not respond?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had never felt more softened in her entire fucking life.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a little more shuffling and Rio could hear as Agatha left the bedroom and returned only a minute later, finally making her appearance in the bathroom known with a soft acknowledgement.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorry," she offered, sidling up to the tub as she gave a soft pat to Rio's shoulder to encourage her to sit up. That in and of itself stuck Rio as something huge; Agatha was willingly placing herself between the cool porcelain of the tub and the warm heat of Rio's body simply because
     <em>
      she wanted to
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't a conversation, wasn't a debate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was just doing what she wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Took me a little longer than I thought. I forget how hard it is to put sheets on that fucker," she voiced, sliding down easily to fit perfectly behind Rio's form, thighs cradling her hips. Her voice was light and tinged with a hint of laughter, but it almost sounded foreign in its newness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sounded happy. Not the kind of happy brought on by surprise ice cream or finding a hundred dollar bill on the street.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, Agatha sounded the kind of happy that was brought on by being loved and knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have you ever thought about a smaller bed?" Rio posed with a gentle giggle as she settled against Agatha's chest, pleasantly surprised by the way Agatha's left arm landed gently on her stomach beneath the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No," Agatha answered simply. lifting a hand to snatch up a bottle of body wash and the loofah that hung on the small hook above it. "Because really, I didn't have to change the sheets. We could have slept on my side and been dry as a bone. But... I don't know, I was trying my hand at being chivalrous, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
     That time, they both released the brightest sounds of laughter, ones that only seemed to echo in the acoustics of the tile around them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quieting down, a tender silence fell over them as Agatha prepared the loofah and set down the body wash, placing a soft kiss to Rio's shoulder as she did so. It did not break as she began her work, first wetting Rio's skin with a palmful of water before lightly working the soap into her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, it felt too fucking good to even consider speaking. It was almost transcendent, the way it warmed Rio from head to toe, even beyond the capabilities of the water. It was so gentle, so caring as Agatha washed at her skin, one arm first and then the other. As she then moved onto Rio's back, the sound of her voice caused Rio to jump the most minute amount simply because she had not been expecting it.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No one's ever said it," she stated lowly, otherwise focused entirely on her task and the skin of Rio's back before her. "Not even my mother."
    </p>
    <p>
     At first, Rio wasn't catching on. And then, when Agatha tacked on her addendum, Rio finally understood.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Then I guess that means I've got quite a few years to make up for then, doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't a pittance or any shred of sympathy. No, what it was was something far greater: it was a promise.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It wouldn't be your responsibility," Agatha returned, her voice notably even lower than it had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're right," Rio responded. She leaned back, causing Agatha to pull her hands to the sides, so that her head could tip back to rest against Agatha's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It would be my
     <em>
      pleasure.
     </em>
     Not my responsibility." It was a guarantee, one followed by an assertion of that very fact. "I love you, Agatha Harkness."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't see it, but from the way the side of Agatha's face was pressed to her temple, she could
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     the smile as it pulled at Agatha's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of finding something to say that she thought would compensate for her inability to use
     <em>
      those words
     </em>
     , Agatha simply turned her head and kissed at what of Rio's face she could reach, humming her contentedness all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a little more TLC to Rio's own body, the two of them worked to rid Agatha of the sex-induced film before climbing out to dry off. Shedding her towel to hang it on the bar, Rio had been all too ready to climb back into that big bed and curl up with the woman she loved, but Agatha's plans seemed to be more pertinent.
    </p>
    <p>
     She surged forward and, much like she had before they entered, scooped Rio into her arms, cradling her as she delivered her back to their safe haven and its freshly changed sheets. What Rio immediately noticed the very second she settled was that in Agatha's place was a medium-sized bowl of cut strawberries. Laying next to it were two bottles of water and a couple of Liquid IV packets beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
     For what felt like the millionth time that night, Rio felt like she could completely dissolve into tears, the ones that said she felt it, felt every bit of the love Agatha had for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You got us a snack?" she questioned, clearly struck by the kindness of the gesture as she propped herself against the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
     "We've been at it for a while. Car break or not, we haven't had anything to eat or drink since this afternoon. I thought it could be good for us."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's answer was so simple, so genuine, and yet, Rio could hear the 'more' there.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You took care of me, so now let me take care of you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     And so, that was exactly what Rio did.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, at least that was what she did
     <em>
      after
     </em>
     she tried to grab herself a strawberry once Agatha had moved them closer only to be met with a lightly admonishing smack to the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Let me," she voiced, reaching for one as she held it up, poised before Rio's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could have laughed, could have told Agatha that she could feed herself, but Rio saw it for all that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without protest, her lips parted and she took a bite, though it was far juicier than she had been expecting and a small stream of it trickled out of the corner of her mouth. Before she could even consider raising a thumb to wipe it away, Agatha was
     <em>
      too quick
     </em>
     in the way she jolted forward, a warm tongue cleaning up the mess first.
    </p>
    <p>
     The quietest sound slipped out of Rio's half-full mouth, somewhere between a whine and a moan, though as her eyes fluttered open, she found Agatha watching her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You alright?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Yes," Rio answered shortly, though she squirmed a little in place. "But if I cum again tonight, I might actually die and that
     <em>
      definitely
     </em>
     isn't helping."
    </p>
    <p>
     With a satisfied smirk, Agatha brandished the second half of the strawberry, light positively sparkling in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, Agatha Harkness would be the death of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio couldn't have been happier about it.
    </p>

     Finally, the quiet had come.
    </p>
    <p>
     It fell only after strawberries and water and a quick trip – robed and slippered – down to the parking garage to grab Rio’s phone from where it had been idling (and vibrating with eighteen text messages and thirteen missed calls from Alice) since they’d arrived back at the condo.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the reassuring texts had been sent and a voicemail had been left at the County Coroner’s office declaring that Rio was ‘ill’ and would not be in that Friday, the air settled and stilled around them offering enough peace to lull Rio into sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     But not Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     With Rio curled peacefully into her side, sound asleep, Agatha simply stared at the ceiling, trying to do all that she could to gather the pieces of her life as they laid at her feet and attempt to rearrange them into a new picture, a new vision.
    </p>
    <p>
     Things had changed that night,
     <em>
      so many
     </em>
     fucking things, and if she were being honest with no one other than herself, Agatha had no idea what any of it meant.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t know what it meant when she wanted so badly to tell Rio what she wanted to hear, but could not find the words.
    </p>
    <p>
     She did not know what it meant when she patted Rio's knee instead of offering a kiss to her head or cheek when she departed to fetch the phone and Rio seemed… disappointed?
    </p>
    <p>
     No,
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     was in Agatha’s head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing she did – at least in the context of their operating relationship – had ever, and probably would ever, disappoint Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     But why was that?
    </p>
    <p>
     What, exactly, did Rio see when she looked at her?
    </p>
    <p>
     For just a moment, Agatha let herself rewind her night, searching for something specific. When she found it, those tireless eyes slipped shut and she let the film roll on the screen of her skull.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     moment, the one where she had climbed out of the car, practically frothing at the mouth, to see that absolutely terrified look on Rio’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Long before Rio had made the declaration out loud, that look on her face had shouted her feelings right then and there. It had been the sheer horror of realizing that Agatha had every bit of power she could possibly possess to simply turn around and walk away and not knowing if she actually would.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the first time in Agatha’s life where she’d had to see the repercussions of her actions up close and personal. Murdering men was easy, but threatening to pull the rug out from Rio and completely upend her life as she had come to know it? That had been something that had
     <em>
      hurt
     </em>
     , even as Agatha maintained composure to make it seem as though it were so easy.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t easy. It was far from easy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had realized, staring into those glassy, wide, panic-stricken brown eyes, that it was one of the hardest things she had ever attempted to do in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact of the matter was truly simple at its core:
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was probably the
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     thing in fifteen years that Agatha had actually given a shit about. In turn, Agatha was not stupid; she could see very clearly that for whatever reason, Rio also cared about her. She knew she might never understand it (after all, she was a literal serial killer who could barely stand the feeling of sweaty palms without getting unnerved), but perhaps she didn’t need to. Maybe all she needed to do was just… accept it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since blowing into Agatha’s life, Rio had changed so much, had shown Agatha so much more than she had ever understood in life. It had been almost instant and yet, Agatha had always tried so hard to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had tried that night at dinner when Rio’s constant pressing had spooked her and caused her to storm out.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had even tried again that night after (stupidly) making the decision to go back to Rio’s apartment and Rio had demanded to know her name despite already knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Agatha had quickly realized was that it was all pointless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sure, she was fully capable of shutting Rio out and pushing her away, but the more Rio fought against it, the less Agatha
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to. By the time Agatha had become of the mind that she wanted to share space with Rio, even for a weekend, the idea of trying to close her out seemed laughable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, weeks later, they laid in that big bed as Rio snored softly into her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio the relentless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio the fearless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio the stubborn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio the lover.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     That phone call while she had been in Taiwan had changed a lot, even if Agatha had always done her best not to let it show. It had established a claim for her, a stake in something bigger than she had let herself have before. It was all-encompassing in that way that Agatha had never called someone hers in the entire time she had been alive. She had things that were hers, a home that was hers, but Agatha had never had someone to call her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, she had Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, she had more than she’d ever had in her life before and while it was a startling realization, it was also a comforting one.
    </p>
    <p>
     The truth was that when Rio was around, Agatha felt like she actually
     <em>
      mattered.
     </em>
     The important job, all the money in the world, they were all just… things.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was a feeling, a warmth that sometimes washed over Agatha in the quieter moments, in the moments where she was lost to a world of dreams and fantasies and sometimes murmured snippets out loud for Agatha to peek into her subconscious mind. She was an anomaly in the most astounding way, the only thing that Agatha had never actually been able to parse out or see with true clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not until right then, tangled in that bed with Phineas meowing softly from some distant part of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could see it,
     <em>
      truly
     </em>
     see it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had always convinced herself that she wasn’t worth meaningful attention, or positive attention, and as such had always bristled at the idea of any kind of connection. Rio hadn’t given a single shit about that. No, Rio had kicked down every single reinforced door that Agatha had put between herself and the rest of the world with little hesitation and even less regard for the panic it might cause within Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because how could she have known?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knew her place in the world, as Amelia. She knew the status that came with that name, the wealth, the achievements. But…
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     had never truly known any place in the world, not after that night over fifteen years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio looked her in the eyes and said her name for the very first time, it had been like a slap to the face but only because it was a name Agatha had not heard in over half of her life. She knew who she was, but no one else ever had and she liked it that way. It was safe, it was comfortable, it was how she protected herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Rio knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had given enough of a fuck to do the research, to
     <em>
      really fucking dig
     </em>
     at uncovering who Agatha was.
    </p>
    <p>
     It made Agatha feel like someone actually
     <em>
      saw
     </em>
     her. It made her feel, for the first moment but not the last, like Rio understood her for all that she was and still wanted her around. It didn’t seem to matter how angry she got, how much she lashed out. Rio could not bring herself to give a shit, apparently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or, maybe more than that, maybe she liked it. Maybe she had realized just how steeled to life and truly pleasurable experiences Agatha had made herself to be and so breaking her down and pulling away those defenses to a point where Agatha showed actual emotion? When she acted like something fucking mattered? Rio ate that shit up. It was all she seemed to want.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, Agatha wondered, was it because
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     was getting to see the more human side to Agatha, or was it because she was making Agatha see it too?
    </p>
    <p>
     As things stood, Agatha was certain of one thing:
    </p>
    <p>
     She did not know
     <em>
      what
     </em>
     to call the things she felt for Rio, and having been someone who truly did not understand the complexities of love and all it entailed, Agatha was not sure that was what she would call it. There was another reason that Agatha was hesitating to put a name to it, though, one that was a little bit bigger.
    </p>
    <p>
     If Agatha were to claim to love Rio, would it be honest?
    </p>
    <p>
     Was it Rio that she could love, or was it merely the idea of her?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had grown far too attached to the idea that someone out there could actually understand her. She knew that what she did would always be deemed unsavory and criminal in the court of public opinion, but Rio didn’t see it that way. Rio saw the truth, Agatha knew that much. She saw Agatha’s motivations, that her desires ran deep to simply eradicate what blight she could in the form of men who perpetrated harm out of malice and anger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did not kill because she was angry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha killed because she felt it was the right thing to do when no one else would take consequential action.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew that, and she chose to stay. She made the choice to –
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmmm, this is the life, huh Phin?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The words were nothing more than a quiet mumble into Agatha’s skin as Rio seemed to cling a little tighter to Agatha’s form.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was sweet, impossibly so, that
     <em>
      those words
     </em>
     were the one to tumble out of Rio’s mouth in the midst of her slumber, and it only added to the inner throwdown Agatha seemed to be having inside that head of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was happy, that much was painfully apparent. Agatha knew that there was still a lot to learn, so many things that Agatha had been trying to put off in the chances of an inevitable separation, but what she did know of Rio was that she had found something in the laylines between them that she had clung to, that she had not let go of for the world. Even when faced with the fact that Agatha was so willing to walk away, she did not release that iron-clad grip.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, she chose to double down instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had said those words likely already knowing the ramifications and still, she’d braved on. She’d said them because even if she would never admit it, Agatha
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     deep down that Rio was aware it wasn’t a sentiment anyone in Agatha’s life had ever associated with her. Rio had told her that she loved her because she had felt that Agatha had needed to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she wasn’t wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s arm as it lay wrapped around Rio’s slumbering form tightened, holding her closer. It was a strange sensation that still made Agatha’s skin prickle beyond her control, but it wasn’t uncomfortable as it had initially been. Instead, Agatha found respite in the way it made her so very hyper-aware of every inch of Rio there was to be pressed against.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a way, Rio almost felt like a blanket. Not one of wool, but perhaps one of silk as she remained so steady in every way possible. It wasn’t just in those moments, but in all others. Rio had been a balm for her in a world where Agatha would have stubbornly insisted she could take the heat and the burn that life had to offer her. Rio had soothed her in ways she did not know she needed to be soothed.

     In the middle of that train of thought, Rio shifted beneath her hold and rolled to her opposite side, just out of Agatha’s reach. It wasn’t intentional, of course, and Rio had no active idea what it was she was doing, but the moment Agatha let the coldness and emptiness that now occupied that side take over, she decided she fucking hated it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hated not having the feeling of Rio’s skin flush and warm against her own. She hated the space, the distance that was suddenly between them. She hated that Rio was any further away than she needed to be right then.
    </p>
    <p>
     So Agatha put an end to it almost immediately after it occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
     Silently she, too, rolled to her side, a strong arm wrapping around the woman before her as her front pressed fully to Rio’s back and her nose landed in hair that smelled faintly of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knew she was not going to find sleep that night, but it did not bother her. Instead, it gave her all the time in the world to think about all of the ways she might be able to show an emotion she could not name. Even by the standard textbook definition of the word, Agatha did not feel that ‘love’ was all encompassing of every intricacy of what she felt for the woman in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, what Agatha felt for Rio was more, even if she might not be able to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the clock ticked past five in the morning, another string of words spilled out onto the pillow beneath Rio’s cheek, still entirely consumed by her subconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The rooted tree does not leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That one made a little less sense than the one a short while before it, but it also pierced cleanly through Agatha like a steel arrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pressing a kiss to Rio’s shoulder, Agatha whispered back a reply that she knew only Phineas – who had hopped up onto the bed and was curled up in the corner – could hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am only rooted in you.”
