<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Rio knelt over the bucket and twisted the towel as she rang out the sickening mix of vomit and soapy water. The hardwood floor was stained with patches of damp from many similar morning cleanings. Every floorboard felt a sense of deja vu each night as it re-lived the same trauma from the same broken man. </p><p>Tony had never been cruel, he wasn’t always temperamental, nor sappy or miserable. But, four months out of work, and his pride was in the gutter. </p><p>When Rio arrived in New York City a year ago, he had the same spark in his eye that had first pulled her in back in their hometown of San Juan. He was working at a cigar factory downtown with his cousin, Miguel, pulling in $250 a month in hard-earned wages. They shared a 2 bedroom, 5th floor walkup with another couple from Puerto Rico, and they got by. It wasn’t glamorous or ritzy, but in comparison to their life back home, Rio felt like she was living in a postcard. </p><p>She still remembered the feeling of seeing the skyline from the boat on her arrival day. It was akin to the first breath of air after diving underwater. It was like seeing the concept of possibility as a physical reality. Every dream she had conjured was no match for the breathtaking beauty of New York. </p><p>She had held the letter from Tony in her pocket for the five day journey, alongside a dark pink flor de maga that her sister had picked for her as she boarded the ship. “So you’ll always remember la isla.” She had whispered in her ear at their final embrace on the dock. </p><p>It was a battle to fight off seasickness as the boat tossed and lurched with each wave. The words in his letter were a mantra she repeated to ground her mentally (and physically).</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> Mi preciosa,  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> These past few months without you have tested my every will. The city is everything we imagined and more but sometimes I feel so alone and lost. You cannot believe the sheer size of everything! I feel like a pitiful little bug at times, dwarfed by the magnitude of buildings and steel above me. I now know how the ant experiences the world and why they seem to scurry in terror.  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> I am so grateful for each letter you send - your words keep me steady and resolute. I cannot wait until we are together again as one heart. Please tell me that you are coming soon. I have enclosed the boat fare and hope this conveys my genuine commitment to you. My job is steady and will provide us a life that is not possible on the island. I know we are yet to become man and wife, but it is my sincerest promise to make that so in due time. You are the light of my life, mi futura, mi corazón, I love you with every piece of me.  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> See you soon,  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> Antonio </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>Now his letter lay forgotten in her bedside drawer - a reminder of empty promises. And the flower lay shriveled, limp, an apt reflection if there ever was one. </p><p>Rio stared down at the man sprawled out on the double bed they share. The stench of gin wafted from his every pore despite the early morning hour. </p><p><em> How did we get here? </em>She thought to herself with a long sigh before hauling the cleaning bucket to the kitchen sink and disposing of the evidence. She gathered the glass bottles in the living room and washed them out quickly and efficiently. </p><p>Although the sale of alcohol had been illegal in the US for the past two years, it was not actually illegal to consume it. Still, she knew it was better safe than sorry and any evidence was unwise, especially as immigrants. </p><p>Tony had been trading cigars for liquor with the variety of neighbors who had home stills and cranked out bathtub gin or good old-fashioned moonshine. But at this point, the cigars were long gone, along with their money. Rio didn’t know how he was getting his fix anymore, and she didn’t know if she wanted to. </p><p>“Tony,” she called for him as she re-entered their tiny bedroom, “Papi, time to wake up.” </p><p>He failed to stir, failed to do much of anything. “Tony, ay, please! We need to talk.” She raised her voice and pulled on his arm that flopped over the bed. </p><p>Her man rolled over and looked at her with bleary eyes that seemed to see nothing at all. “Por favor, I’m tired…” He grumbled, exhausted. </p><p>Rio’s patience was gone. She went to the bathroom, grabbed a cup of water, stomped back in and unceremoniously dumped it on his head. “Tired from what Tony?! You haven’t worked in months, you barely leave this apartment! We have no more money. We have nothing! </p><p>“Rio, mi amor, I just” he started but was cut off immediately. </p><p>“Don’t start with me now. I’ve heard this before.” Rio felt her anger rising like a tidal wave, but it fell flat when she saw the tears start to flow from Tony’s eyes. </p><p>“I’ll be better. I will.” Tony rose to a kneel on the bed, the springs squeaking beneath his imposing figure. “Please, mi vida, I’ve been lost, but I can do this for us. I’ll go out today and take the first job I see. I don’t care what it is. I’ll wash dishes, I’ll clean toilets, whatever it takes.”</p><p>“And the drinking?” Rio lifted an eyebrow. She could convey so much with a look and could see the way he shrank beneath her stare. The embarrassment written across his face, so plain and bare. </p><p>“I’ll get off the juice.” He conceded, head down as if avoiding her stare could save him some dignity. </p><p>“One more thing,” she started, “I’m going to look for a job as well.” </p><p>“<b>No</b>” The sudden boldness caused her to step back. He stood quickly, towering over her in a flash. </p><p>“It wasn’t a question. We’re on the nut, Tony. We are flat broke. If it wasn’t for Miguel and Claudia, we would have starved weeks ago.” She clapped her hands together in emphasis as she stated the facts for him. Unafraid yet blind to the way his knuckles were clenching, his face contorting to a grimace, his eyes narrowing. </p><p>“Women don’t belong on a payroll. I’m not letting my gal go out there and do, who knows what?” Tony looked down on her with all the machismo he could muster on a hangover. </p><p>Rio looked up at him and saw how he was trying to rebuild his ego. “Fine. You have until tomorrow to scrounge up some dough. But, we need the money. If I can get it, then why does it matter where it came from?”</p><p>She was suddenly staring at a pigeon flying across the clouded blue sky. Her head a full 45 degrees turned to the right when just a moment ago she had been looking right at her partner. The pain didn’t even register until she realised her left eye had started to water and she saw Tony’s open hand fall back to his side. </p><p>The words that were sitting next in line on Rio’s tongue dissolved like cotton candy on her lips. She grasped her cheek and turned heel towards the kitchen and let her feet carry her out the door. The five flights of stairs passed in a blur as she floated down the street completely unaware of her surroundings. She had fled without a hat, coat, or proper rags but proprietary was the last thing on her mind. </p><p>Her feet took her down the street, past her regular shops and familiar faces. The buzz of the city settled her nerves and calmed her down. Where it once felt like a concrete jungle of noise and fear, she now felt energised and at home. Rio walked and walked, watching the other folks go about their business, feeling both like a stranger and a part of something bigger. The gnawing anxiety of returning home to Tony quieted. </p><p><em> It was just a mistake. </em> She allowed herself to think. <em> He has never raised a hand to you before. He’s not like those violent sorts. Not my Tony.  </em></p><p>She found herself down in West Harlem, wandering among a street of bustling restaurants feeding the lunchtime crowd. A sign in the window of a corner drug store stood out among the otherwise grey landscape. It was beautifully painted, a brilliant deep purple and read “Help Wanted - Shop assistant, regular wages, inquire within.” </p><p><em> He said no. I really shouldn’t…I don’t even know the first thing about working. </em>Rio stood kitty-corner to the shop and read the sign outside, “Westview Prescriptions - Drugs, Soda, Luncheonette”. The windows reflected stunning calligraphy, and the interior looked inviting with fully-stocked shelves lining every wall. Before she could talk herself out of it, Rio crossed the street and opened the door. The light silver bell jingled in announcement as she stepped into the warm space, unaware of just how cold she was without a coat. </p><p>A counter ran along the entire east wall, with a few wooden stools available. A soda fountain near the back, while the impressive cash register stood sentry near the front door directly in front of the rows of cigarettes. The pressed tin ceiling drew the eye up, while the perfectly organised boxes of goods filled each shelf and cabinet. </p><p>An old dame looked up at the bell and greeted Rio with a smile from behind the counter. “What can I get you, doll?”</p><p>“The sign in the window - The “help wanted” one? Do I talk to you? I’m Rio. I’m new to the city.” Rio suddenly felt shy in front of the older woman with brilliant curly grey hair and all-knowing eyes that seemed to sense hesitation. </p><p>“I’m Lilia. I’ve worked here since my father opened the place back in 1901. We recently expanded and need a bit of extra help during the week and on some weekends. There’s a new Big Cheese running the joint. Just looking for someone to help stock the shelves, work the register, help with service during meal times, you know? What experience do you have?” </p><p>Rio bit her lip and looked away. Of course, she’d made a fool of herself again. How could she be such a dumb dora? <em> What am I meant to say? My boyfriend’s a drunkard, and I need the money or else we’ll be homeless in a week. I have never worked before, but I’m desperate. No, god, why did I think this would be a good idea? </em></p><p>Lilia took in the woman in front of her with appraising eyes. She noted the lack of normal accouterments to her outfit, the accent to her English, the angry red tone to her left cheek, the quiet battle being waged in her head. <em> She’s taking a risk being here </em>. </p><p>Before Rio could speak, Lilia asked, “Look, we’ve had that sign up for a while now and need someone who can start immediately. The boss prefers female staff anyway. If you’re able to make it here every weekday from 10am to 5pm, then the job’s yours. It’s not much, but we can offer you $20 a week to start.”</p><p>Blinking in confusion, Rio could only nod quickly, “I can start tomorrow. I won’t let you down, Lilia.” </p><p>“I expect that you won’t. Now, we don’t have a formal uniform, but I will provide you with a standard apron and ask that you show up clean and presentable each day. I don’t tolerate tardiness or foolhardy behaviour. Any personal problems are to be left at home, understood?” Lilia noted the look of gratitude on Rio’s face, in addition to anxiety and fear. </p><p>She hoped she wasn’t making a mistake, but Lilia had always been able to read people. Ever since childhood, she could get a sense of a person within minutes of meeting. Her father called her his little divinaturi, Sicilian for “diviner”. And what she saw in Rio reminded her of her mother. Tender, eager to please, new to the country, strong yet reserved, and under the spell of a man who wielded his power over her. </p><p>“See you tomorrow, doll.” She watched Rio exit in a whisper and prayed that she would see her the next day.</p>

  <p>When Rio arrived back home after her sudden departure that morning, she looked around for any sign of Tony. He wasn’t in bed (for once) and didn’t seem to be anywhere else in their tiny abode. She sighed down into the couch and laid her head back. </p><p>She had a job, a real one. She would be making money for the first time and could finally put food back on their table without relying on handouts and pity. Her shoulders relaxed for the first time in months and the weight that had sat upon her chest eased slightly. But then, she remembered the slap, the reaction Tony had at even the suggestion of her working, and the pressure returned to her body. </p><p>What was she going to tell him? How could she explain her daily absence and sudden appearance of money? She kneaded her hands and closed her eyes. </p><p>The front door opened and Claudia, Miguel’s wife, strolled in, “Chica, why the long face?” She asked, setting her bag and coat down gently.</p><p>Rio groaned into her hands. As she raised her head, Claudia caught the swollen red mark along her hairline and cheek, the red slowly turning yellow and light purple. </p><p>“What kind of pill did this to you, sweets?” She ran a tender hand along her face, tracing the angry marks with her finger. Claudia and her were not close friends by any means, but the two had found solace and familiarity in each other’s company while living together. </p><p>“He didn’t mean to. He’s never even raised his voice before.” Rio’s voice was quiet. “It’s the drink, it’s…changing him. I see why they outlawed it in the first place. What good can such a devilish drink bring? Tony isn’t like this, I swear.” </p><p>Claudia had seen the way Tony had spiraled downward quickly once the factory laid off half its workers. Miguel had survived the cuts due to sheer luck and thank god he had, but Tony wasn’t so lucky. She saw the glass bottles he stuffed in his pockets and carried up the stairs, clinking with each step. She watched him disappear drink by drink and end up on the bedroom floor most nights. She hadn’t thought him a violent fellow, but how long can a person suffer before they break?</p><p>“It never starts with pain.” Claudia looked into Rio’s heartbroken eyes. “It starts sweet and beautiful. A rush of ecstasy and bursting with love and adoration. If it started with pain, nobody would be married, Rio.”</p><p>“I just told him that I was willing to get a job to help with money. It wasn’t an attack or a jab. You know how much we need it right now. We’ve got nothing left, I don’t even know if we’ll have enough to cover rent this month.” Rio felt the energy leaving her as the reality of their situation settled in her bones. </p><p>“Men don’t like to feel worthless. They don’t want to feel like they can’t take care of their family.” </p><p>“But he isn’t taking care of us!” Rio retorted.</p><p>“You’re right, but that doesn’t make it hurt any less.” Claudia replied. “Tony is blinded by self-pity and shame. Violence is often the quickest reply that animals turn to when backed into a corner.”</p><p>Rio seethed with her own feelings of rage. It wasn’t fair. She wasn’t going to sit silently like her abuela, who suffered an entire lifetime at the hands of a volatile husband that wouldn’t let her enjoy a second of independence. </p><p>A moment passed in silence, then “I may have already gotten a job.” Rio couldn’t help but smirk guiltily. </p><p>“Ay dios mio, you’ve done it now! How are you going to explain that one?” Claudia asked. </p><p>Rio tried to put on her best puppy dog eyes. “Please, can you just tell Tony that you got me a cleaner position like you? Maybe he will accept it if it's something familiar.”</p><p>“And what are you actually doing?” </p><p>“Shop assistant at a pharmacy. Nothing fancy.” Rio replied.</p><p>“What do you know about all that? You’ve never worked in a shop before!” Claudia chuckled at the thought. </p><p>“Hey, they really needed help and they are going to pay weekly in cash! I can learn whatever they want. It can’t be that hard.” </p><p>“Alright Rio, but you owe me for this.” She headed to the kitchen to start prepping supper. </p><p>Rio waited for Tony to get back, but as the hours passed and the sun set, she started to wonder where he could be. She readied herself for bed when she finally heard the front door open. </p><p>As she was standing in front of her dressing mirror, taking her hair down. A boisterous voice called out “Rio! Mi amor! Wonderful news - I got a job downtown. Meet the newest longshoreman of the Manhattan Docks.” </p><p>He tumbled into the bedroom and lifted Rio off her feet in a twirl. They laughed in relief and joy before falling into bed. His eyes staring deep into hers, trying to convey what he couldn’t say out loud - <em> I’ll be better for you. </em></p><p>Tony placed a big wet kiss on her, and she tried not to pull away. Tried to feel grateful and enamored - rather than guarded and repelled. She had so much love for her boyfriend, despite his faults. But something had shifted, and she hoped it wasn’t permanent. </p><p><em> Maybe it will be okay. </em> Rio let herself hope and decided not to tell Tony about her own adventure today. She knew that dock worker hours were long, and the subway journey from their place in Washington Heights to Manhattan would be time consuming. <em> He doesn’t have to know - </em>was the last thought as she drifted to sleep. </p><p>She woke up the next morning regretting her spur of the moment job hunt. Should she even bother anymore? Something inside her felt excited at the prospect of getting out of the house though, and she resolved to give it at least a day. If she felt uncomfortable or completely out of place, she could always quit. No harm, no foul. </p><p>Luckily, Claudia came through and said that she needed an extra pair of hands this week for a big cleaning job at a nearby office building. Suddenly, Tony didn’t seem as fussed about Rio leaving the house; he was too elated in his own prospects to see much else. </p><p>She left the house promptly at 9:15am, donning her dark green cloche hat, longline wool coat, and walked the 20 minutes to Westview Pharmacy for her first day. </p><p>Lilia smiled as Rio entered the drugstore, the bell dinging as usual when the door clicked open. “Welcome Rio, glad you made it.” </p><p>“Of course, I wouldn’t miss it. Where should I put my things?” Rio asked earnestly. </p><p>“I’ll show you to the backroom, follow me.” Lillia quickly rounded the counter and walked them towards the back of the small shop. Through a wooden door, they were in a little lounge room with a few sitting chairs, a dining table, and storage shelves. </p><p>“You can place your bag on the shelf, and hang your things up here” She pointed to the coat rack along the wall. </p><p>Rio noticed the most beautiful coat hanging up already. A deep navy blue, verging on teal, with a stunning purple silk interior from what she could see along the cuffs. It was clearly custom, tailored to perfection, and utterly original. Whoever wore that coat meant business. From the little she knew of Lilia, it did not fit her in the slightest. So who could the owner be? There wasn’t anyone else in the shop that she could see.  </p><p>“Whose coat is that?” Rio asked innocently. </p><p>Lilia didn’t even need to glance back at the coat rack to know what she was referring to. “The Big Cheese herself” She laughed. “Don’t worry about that for now, I have to make sure you’re on the level first before you go meeting anyone else.” </p><p>Rio’s brow knitted in confusion for a moment, wondering who else there could be. However, this passed quickly as she jumped into her first day of work. She learned the in’s and out’s of everything the shop sold, where the products came from, how to work the ancient cash register, how to stock a shelf, who the regular customers were, and every other piece of knowledge Lilia could bestow upon her. </p><p>Around 11am, a young man entered the store. “Lilia, I’m here!” He announced loudly. Dressed in grey slacks with a slightly wrinkled white shirt and tan suspenders, he sauntered down to greet them.</p><p>“Billy, will you keep it down? I’m training our new little bird - meet Rio.” </p><p>“Hi Rio, pleasure to meet you. I run the soda fountain during the week. I can’t wait to work together! It’s been a pain handling the lunch rush alone.”</p><p>Rio extended her hand, which Billy shook quickly. “Nice to meet you too.” She stated plainly. Her mind overfilled with all that she had learned that she could barely register the teen. Lilia continued her training until being thrown into the deep end of lunch service with Billy. </p><p>“Okay, here they come! It’s really not so bad. Just write down each order on a ticket, post it up here, and move on to the next one. I’ll handle the rest.” He ended it in a wink as the customers started taking up stools along the counter. </p><p>Rio was a quick study and found it surprisingly easy to converse with the customers. Her idle chit chat kept them occupied as Billy whipped through orders with efficiency and grace. Egg creams flew along the counter as well as all types of cordials, juices, and fancy sodas. Hot food rolled out from the commissary next door, and the patrons left full and satisfied. </p><p>“Rio, I’m out of sugar syrup. Can you run to the back and grab a few more bottles? Just go through the back door to the storage basement in the back alley. Quick!” Billy rang out with urgency. </p><p>She finished writing down the latest order and hurried out the back with haste. As she flung open the door out the back, it collided with something or someone. “Oh god damn it! Ouch!”</p><p>Standing in the alleyway, grasping her shoulder, was a woman. Her hair was old-fashioned and should have looked unfashionable on someone her age. Not the trendy bob cut but an older, Victorian era high bun that somehow seemed to fit. Her dress was casual, clearly just meant for working around the house yet it had a hem line dangerously close to her knees. Rio felt heat rise to her cheeks as she tried to quickly raise her gaze. As her eyes moved up, she caught exposed shoulders and beautiful toned arms, finally settling on the stunning blue eyes squinting in pain. </p><p>“I’m sorry!” She squealed out quickly. Stunned at both her own carelessness and at the sight of this gorgeous woman before her. </p><p>“Now who the hell are you and what are you doing in my alley?” The words rolled off her tongue in a mocking tone, with just enough bite to make Rio stutter. </p><p>“I didn’t know anyone was out here. I was just trying to get to the storeroom, we’re out of sugar syrup and,” Rio paused, finding herself stumbling over her words in the presence of this intimidating figure.</p><p>The blue eyes searched her face, pausing on the ghost of Tony’s anger that still haunted her cheek, before giving her the old up-and-down to take in her full figure. She felt stripped bare by that look in a way that made her chest feel tight. A pleasant embarrassment she hadn’t felt since Tony first asked her to dance all those years ago. </p><p>Rio finally finished her thought, “I’m so sorry, umm, what’s your name?”</p><p>“They call me Agatha, bunny. Agatha “Mother” Harkness.”</p>

  <p>Rio hurried down the alley and down the stairwell into the basement storage room to grab the supplies for Billy. As she re-emerged into the light, she only saw the whisper of Agatha’s purple dress disappear into a nondescript side door in the alley. She hadn’t even noticed the door at first, but she took in the tiny panel at eye height and the way it seemed to almost disappear into the brick wall unless you were looking for it. </p><p>“What took you so long?” Billy griped when Rio finally made it back inside. There was a large group of patrons crowding the counter. </p><p>“I’m so sorry, I ran into Agatha as I was running out and might have hurt her. I hope she doesn’t think I’m a total fool.” </p><p>“Oh, you met Mother! Don’t sweat it, she’s harmless…well, if you’re on her good side anyway.” He laughed at his own inside joke. </p><p>“What does she do here?”</p><p>“What doesn’t she do here?” He quipped back. “I’ve been obsessed since I first stumbled into this shop three years ago. I was trying to steal some cans of soup for my brother and I when she caught me. Thought I was a goner, but she offered me a job instead. Haven’t left her side ever since.”</p><p>Billy finished putting the bottles away and was back on the soda fountain pouring drinks. “Sorry, doll, can’t say anymore! The people need me.” </p><p>Rio went back to taking down orders quickly. When she finally checked the wall clock again, she could not believe that it was nearly 4pm. Having previously spent her days at home, running errands, or with friends, she was shocked at how quickly work made time disappear. </p><p>She finished the day at the cash register, and Lilia came by to check on her. “How was your first day?”</p><p>“I’m surprised that it’s already almost over! That lunch rush is no joke. I don’t know how Billy handled that on his own before.” Rio suddenly became aware of the ache in her legs from standing all day. It was going to take a while to adjust to being on her feet for such a long time. </p><p>“Oh don’t let him hear that, he’ll get a big head! We’re just glad you’re here now. I’m very impressed with your work ethic, young lady.” She smiled at Rio and noticed the subtle blush forming on her pale cheeks.</p><p>“Thanks Lillia, I’m so grateful to you for giving me this chance.” Rio was starting to feel like she belonged for the first time since she set foot in the US. </p><p>When she made it back to her apartment at 5:30pm, she shed her work clothes which smelled vaguely of the sweet drinks prepared by Billy all afternoon, and started to cook dinner before Tony’s imminent arrival. </p><p>He made it back about an hour after her and practically fell through the door. With a lunch pail in hand, he walked in like there were concrete blocks on his feet before falling onto the couch. “I don’t think my body is going to survive this.” </p><p>“Come on, tough guy.” Rio stepped away from the oven to playfully jab his sides. “Where’s that fighting spirit like Jack Dempsey? Weren’t you the top featherweight boxer at Paradiso College?”</p><p>“That boy is long gone. I am just an old man, and nobody told me the docks were going to grind me to a pulp.”</p><p>“Old man? You’re 25, Tony, get a grip.” Rio couldn’t help but chuckle at his dramatics. </p><p>He rolled off the couch and struggled to his feet. “Not all of us enjoy a life of luxury at home, my dear.” He approached and kissed her softly. </p><p>She tensed, feeling guilt blanket her thoughts at the way he looked at her. He believed she was tending to the home, taking care of her plants, cooking their meals. Being the good housewife that everyone expected. How could she lie? </p><p>But then she would remember the feeling of his hand on her face and the lack of acknowledgement of it since, and the lie seemed to simply roll off the tongue, “Hey, I was out with Claudia today. That was hard work too! On top of that, someone has to take care of this household, and it surely isn’t going to be you!” She turned back to stir the soup on the stovetop, tamping down the cry of ache from her own sore legs. </p><p>She has never had a better night sleep than that dreamless slumber after her first day of work. The next morning, she got up early, hearing Tony leave around 6am. She quickly powered through her chores for the day before she needed to leave herself. She mopped the bathroom, scrubbed the bathtub, hand washed a bucket of laundry, and hung it out on the balcony line. Satisfied with the state of the place, she grabbed her bag and headed out to the pharmacy. </p><p>Instead of Lilia at the counter, she was taken aback when she saw Agatha rearranging the cigarette cartons. </p><p>“Hello, Mrs. Harkness” She watched her turn slowly and admired the scarlet lipstick that adorned her lips and the prominent brooch that sat over the top button of her collared dress. </p><p>“Oh don’t go calling me that now, sweets. I’ll think you’re talking about the devil herself who gave birth to me. Mrs. Harkness is a hard old bag that unfortunately shares my name. I prefer Agatha, but some just stick to Mother, dealer’s choice.” She turned to face Rio and spread her hands on the counter in front of her. </p><p>“You here to tend to my arm? I say, it’s still a bit sore from our little kerfuffle yesterday. You could kiss it better?” Agatha threw her a wink and a pout, showing off her bruised elbow. </p><p>Rio couldn’t keep up with the pace or the guile of this new person in her presence. There was something so disarming, so unabashedly confident, so…intriguing about Agatha. “I’m sorry?”</p><p>“Just razzing you, bunny. Lilia told me you’re the new assistant. Welcome to the coven.”</p><p>“Thanks Mrs…Agatha.” Rio stopped herself before speaking out of turn again. She felt electric, like Agatha was lighting up her every nerve. </p><p>Agatha’s lips turned into a signature smirk, “Just can’t help yourself, huh? Well, I’m just finishing up in here, then back to it. Tell Billy to come see me when he gets in.” She turned to head out the back door. Rio studied her outfit carefully, impressed at the cut and style. Agatha was a vision in a spring suit with a shepherd check pattern. Its fancy overcollar and belted waist accentuated her curves, while the long matching skirt hit at the mid-calf and Rio felt herself lick her lips subconsciously. </p><p>“Wait,” Rio’s curiosity was overwhelming. “Can I ask you something?” </p><p>“Depends what you want to know.” Agatha turned and caught the way Rio smiled shyly at her response, as if she had said some dirty joke. </p><p>“What’s in that door in the alley? The one along the wall?”</p><p>“Hmmm,” Agatha tapped her lips with her fingers. Rio noticed the large diamond ring adorning her middle finger. “That’s for me to know,” She strolled down the shop to the back, “and you to find out.” She yelled out as the door shut behind her. </p><p>Rio huffed in response. She went to hang up her coat and hat, then heard Lillia enter from the alley. “Alright there, Rio?”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am. Just had a little chat with Agatha when I arrived.” Lilia saw the attempt to veil her frustration. <em> Oh no, what has Agatha done this time, </em>Lilia thought.</p><p>“Don’t fret about her. She loves to beat her gums, but try not to take anything to heart. She loves to play with people as if they were toys. It’s all about control - just show her she can’t walk all over you, and you’ll be sorted.”  </p><p>“But, I just want to know what she does here.” Rio replied.</p><p>“Trust me when I say to let this one go, dear. Just for now. I know you’re curious, but let her get to know you, and I’m sure you’ll find out soon. Some things require a little…discretion, if you catch my drift.”</p><p>Rio did not catch anything but could take the hint to drop it. “Alright, where should I start today?”</p><p>“Got a new shipment of candy this morning, can you stock it on the shelves near the end of the soda counter?”</p><p>Billy arrived as she was finishing up her last box. “Hi Billy, Agatha told me that she wanted to speak to you when you got in.” </p><p>“Thanks, Rio. I’ll head out back now - catch ya in a few!” He bounded out the door like a zooming puppy. His enthusiasm felt contagious. </p><p>She watched him slip back in half an hour later and carry on as usual. “So - what did the boss want?” She questioned him as innocently as possibly. </p><p>“Nothing much, just asking if I could stay late today to help her move some boxes.” He kept it short, and Rio felt him itching to say more. He wasn’t making eye contact and was wiping out the same glass that was sparkling clean. </p><p>“Is that all?” She put on her best pleading eyes, but he was still staring intently at his task as if it was the most entertaining thing in the world. </p><p>“Yup!” He set down the glasses. “I’ve gotta go grab some extra straws from the store room before service really kicks in, be right back.” Billy rushed out before Rio could press any further. She scrunched her face as he avoided any more questioning. </p><p>When he got back, they fell into the same rhythm as yesterday, and Rio felt herself lost again to the quickly spinning minute hand. As she walked to the back room to grab her things to go, she saw two new coats hung up along her own. </p><p>One was the lightest baby pink, wool, more cape than coat. The other was leather, a masculine cut though too small to fit Billy, with bold pockets on the front. <em> Who were all these people? </em>She couldn’t fathom where Agatha stashed them all away, and what they could all possibly be doing for this tiny pharmacy.</p><p>“Vidal!” Lillia called from the front at the cash register and beckoned Rio over as she was preparing to head home. “Friday is payday. It’s not a full week as you only worked two days, but hope this helps.” She deposited 8 dollars into an envelope and handed it over. </p><p>Rio looked down at the cash - her first ever earnings. She felt not just relief but pride. She could buy meat from the butcher, actual cuts, not just the off scraps that she had to barter for. She could afford vegetables for the week and maybe even a few apples if she got lucky at the corner market. In just a few more weeks, she would be able to cover their month’s rent if something happened with Tony’s job. She wouldn’t be entirely dependent on him anymore. At that thought, a tear threatened to fall. </p><p>Lilia watched her reaction and felt such sympathetic compassion for the young woman. It was barely enough yet to her it was clearly a lifeline to her. “Don’t go spending it all in one place now.” She tried to jest with her as she saw Rio’s emotions begin to spill over. </p><p>“Don’t worry, I ain’t a total sap.” She laughed in response and wiped her eyes quickly. She gave Lilia a quick look of thanks before stuffing the envelope quickly into her purse and heading home. </p><p>The wizened woman walked to turn the sign on the door to ‘closed’ and heard movement behind her. “Are you getting soft on me, ya old broad?” Agatha had been lingering in the backroom. </p><p>“What are you doing hiding out back there like some rascally ragamuffin?” Lillia continued closing out the register and counting the day’s take. </p><p>“What do you see in that girl?” Agatha came into the shop and helped stack the counter stools. </p><p>“What do you?” She answered in retort, eyebrow raised curiously.</p><p>“I didn’t even know you hired her! She practically bumped me off yesterday when she flew out the door without looking. She’s clearly in over her head, and I’d be shocked if she’s ever worked a day in her life.” </p><p>“Oh please, I saw the way you looked at her this morning. You see it too. She’s lost, looking for somewhere to belong, somewhere to feel wanted. Not unlike some other lost girl I took in not so long ago.”</p><p>“Hey, don’t even compare us! I was never that clueless.” Agatha laughed. She wasn’t ready to admit that there was something about Rio that made her want to know more. “Well, I had some spunk at least. Rio seems as timid as a baby deer. She can barely take a joke.”</p><p>Lilia remembered fondly when she first saw a young Agatha almost twenty years ago. She had just moved to town from Boston and came into the pharmacy every week to pick up odds and ends and occasionally indulge in a strawberry milkshake. Lilia’s father was absolutely charmed by the woman and looked forward to her visits. He would fawn over her every word, just like every other man (or woman) who happened to cross her path.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lilia thought her to be a bit too chummy for her own good but something in her eyes gave her pause. Agatha put on an unbreakable front with humor and banter, yet Lilia noted the lingering sadness under the surface and unrelenting need for attention, for acceptance. </p><p>“Have a little heart, Agatha. I think she’s fighting a battle we know nothing about. This isn’t just any old job to her. I saw that she didn’t want this, she could barely gather the courage to walk into the store. I saw her standing on the corner for ages before she finally came in. But she did, I think she’s meant to be here.”</p><p>Agatha played with her nails thoughtlessly as she mulled over Lilia’s summation on her newest employee. “Fine, but she’s not to know what we really do here until I say so. I know your gut is always right, but she needs time and so do I. I need to know we’re not tooting the wrong ringer, that we can trust her completely.”</p><p>Lilia shut the register with a satisfying ding and handed the cash to the boss before clocking out herself. “Mother knows best.”</p>

  <p>The routine of the pharmacy provided a stability in Rio’s life that she didn’t know was missing before. Although she had never felt more exhausted at day’s end, she also never felt more alive. The regular customers greeted her like an old friend each day, and she felt a sense of self-worth that she never garnered from housework alone. </p><p>Tony was none the wiser as his work kept him completely occupied from dawn to dusk and wiped him out mentally when he finally made it home. The pay was a bit less than the cigar factory, the hours definitely worse, but the stability was worth the trade in his eyes. </p><p>Rio no longer worried about making rent or affording groceries. His wages covered most of their needs, although she usually had to supplement the rising cost of food most weeks, but she was still able to stash a good portion of her cash away. </p><p>She tenderly placed the bills in an old wooden cigar box that she brought from PR. It used to store a few necklaces and bracelets that she had collected over the years, but now she looked at it as her emergency plan. </p><p>It had been over a month since Tony had a drink of the hard stuff, and he was back to his usual jovial self, albeit a lot more tired. The anger was gone from his demeanor, and yet Rio could not forget. It wasn't an elephant in the room, it was a ghost. No matter how she tried to push past it and see the man in front of her now, sober, hard-working, trying his best to provide for them both, she was stubborn - always had been. </p><p>“Mija, if you keep sticking your tongue out at your sister, one day it’s going to stick like that!”</p><p>Her mother had pestered her with that threat when she was 8, and of course, being Rio she needed to prove her mom wrong. She kept her tongue out for almost two days straight in protest, </p><p>“Theee mamá! Look, it’sss not duck!” Each word barely intelligible. </p><p>She slurred out the words as best she could to make her point, satisfied that she had won. </p><p>All her mother could do was roll her eyes, “What am I going to do with you? God bless the man who even attempts to win your hand.”</p><p>“Hah! No man can win anything from me!” Rio ran off at the thought. </p><p>She was the fastest kid in her class, even beating the boys who stood several inches taller. She could jump higher, swim farther, and was the top pick for the neighborhood baseball games played every afternoon after school. She was the only girl they would let play, mostly because every boy knew she would shove them in the dirt if they tried to stop her. </p><p>“One day, I’m going to see a real baseball game!”</p><p>She would declare to her father at the dinner table, nearly shaking with excitement as she kicked her feet under the table.</p><p>“I know you will, mija.” </p><p>And he wasn’t lying. In her short life, everything his daughter set her mind to, she accomplished. </p><p>She was headstrong to a fault, but he loved her determination and drive. He didn’t know where she would end up, but he never worried that she would make something of herself. He only worried about what kind husband would be able to accept her completely.</p><p>Rio knew Tony was a good man. She saw it in the way he held her hand when they walked down the sidewalk together. How he held the door open for her every single time, how he sacrificed his time and his body to provide. But she also now knew that a monster lurked under his skin. An angry, violent beast that could crush her without a second thought.</p><p>And she hated how much that made her afraid and timid despite herself. She felt the way <b>she</b> was changing around him. She despised hearing the way her voice pitched up when speaking to him, how she hesitated before speaking where she would normally jest and joke, how she gave in to his wandering hands at night despite the exhaustion that was threatening to bump her off. </p><p>“Please, mi vida, I need you.” He would roughly whisper in her ear, and what could she say in reply?</p><p>
  <em> I don’t want this, I don’t want you.  </em>
</p><p>That wasn’t what a woman was meant to say, and she didn’t want to know what might happen if she did. So, she lay there silently, pretending she was the same, that she still felt the same fire for him that once existed. She would feel him move on top of her, enter her, sweat on her, and she would feel - nothing. </p><p>Every payday, when she opened the bottom drawer of her wooden dressing table, lifted the spare fabric that obscured her hidden cigar box and added to her growing savings, she finally felt something - she felt strong and powerful. </p><p>Like each dollar was another chain of armor that she was molding into place, like together the dollars could form into a hot air balloon and carry her away like the Wizard of Oz, her favorite book as child. She would smile at the thought and allow herself a moment to daydream, before snapping the lid closed and getting back to reality. </p><p>At the pharmacy, Billy was training her on how to run the soda fountain. He showed her how to make each drink, where to find all the ingredients, which customers to look out for, how to prepare the simple menu, and how to clean as you go. </p><p>No stranger to the kitchen, Rio found it surprisingly easy.</p><p>“One rootbeer phosphate for Mr. Jones, a hot butterscotch sundae for Jimmy, and a frosted coffee for Ms. Henderson.” She slid each order down the counter to great effect. </p><p>“Wow Rio, you’re a natural!” Billy was impressed by her calm confidence. “No wonder Lilia hired you on the spot, you’ve got a real gift for service.” </p><p>“Enough chummy talk, mac. Let’s get these people their orders!” Rio blushed at the compliment and got them back to work quickly to avoid further embarrassment. </p><p>At the end of the day, as she was wiping down the fountain, she overheard Billy. </p><p>“Lilia, I promised I would go with Tommy to the movie palace to see Robin Hood tomorrow. Can I please have the afternoon off? I’ll work late instead, I swear!”</p><p>“I can cover for him” Rio piped up quickly. </p><p>“Hot dog! That would be amazing Rio, thank you thank you.” Billy was almost jumping for joy. </p><p>“Now wait just a minute young man,” Lilia looked at him sternly, “you can’t just expect Rio to handle the day alone, she’s only been here for a month, and she’s only just learned how to run the fountain.”</p><p>“She’s amazing, Lilia, come on. I’ve already seen her handle the lunch crowd like it’s a walk in the park.” He threw out his arms. “It’s just one afternoon!”</p><p>Lilia considered the argument carefully.</p><p>“Fine, but you’re going to have to go speak to Agatha about how you’re going to make it up. You know she’s not in the business of giving things away for free.” </p><p>Billy was out the back door before she could even finish that sentence. Lilia walked over from the register, “Are you sure you can handle it, Rio?”</p><p>“The boy’s a good teacher. I think I’ll be fine.” Rio folded up her apron and placed it under the counter. </p><p>“If you say so, but don't come grovelling to me if things get too hectic.” </p><p>“Never!” Rio laughed casually and bid farewell to Lilia before heading home.</p><p>
  <em> What’s the worst that could happen? </em>
</p><p>That was her last thought before drifting to sleep that night. </p><p>Everything seemed fine at first, she started her shift as usual by helping Lilia open the store and re-stocking the shelves. As she began preparing the soda fountain for lunch service, Lilia received a phone call. </p><p>“I can’t. No, you’ll need to sort it out…Jen, you have to handle this, please.”</p><p>Rio could just hear the soft conversation as she cleaned the glassware. “Okay, I’m coming, but we need to be fast. I’ll drive the flivver and pick you up.” </p><p>Lilia donned her coat and hat and approached Rio quickly.</p><p>“Doll, I need to run out to grab some supplies for the store. I would never normally leave you alone, but unfortunately this can’t wait. I trust you. If you need any help, just knock on the alley door and Agatha will come help. I’ll be back in jiffy.”</p><p>She was alone.<em>Take a breath.</em></p><p>She tried to focus her thoughts on the moment rather than the panic that was ready to pounce. <em> Lilia’s counting on you, you can do this. </em> She prepped her station like Billy had shown her and prepared for the incoming onslaught. <em> Maybe it won’t be so bad today. </em></p><p>“Where’s Billy?”</p><p>“What’s the hold up?”</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>“Rio, over here I was first!”</p><p>“No, I was first!”</p><p>“You forgot my parfait!” </p><p>"I need a fork!”</p><p>"Where's my order?" </p><p>"Rio, I need a refill!”</p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>“<strong>Rio!!</strong>” </p><p>The voices reverberated around the tiny shop and seemed to coalesce right around Rio’s ears. She stared at the impatient customers crowding her workspace. Every order she pushed out seemed to be replaced by ten more, like a hydra with hundreds of heads threatening to squeeze her to death.</p><p>“Egg cream, up!” She did her best to shout above the chaos. </p><p>
  <em> I wish Lilia was here. </em>
</p><p>Rio stared longingly at the door in hopes that her saviour may magically appear at any moment and save her. The bell dinged and she looked expectedly but was let down by the sight of even more customers looking for their soda fix. <em> I don’t know how I’m going to make it.  </em></p><p>She wiped her brow as the pressure continued to build, her hands started to shake from the nerves. She was mixing a frosted coffee when her grip slipped and the glass shattered on the tiled floor. The sudden noise finally cut through the cacophony and caused the customers to quiet for a moment.</p><p>The sound of clicking heels was thus able to rise above the din of impatience in front of her.</p><p>“What in the <strong>devil</strong> is going on in here?” Agatha’s raised voice completely silenced the entire establishment. </p><p>“Well?" She looked at the stunned faces with expectation. "What’s all this racket then?”</p><p>The crowd parted and revealed the disheveled Rio at the centre of the hurricane, doing her best to write down orders, pour drinks, and deliver food. </p><p>“Agatha! What are you doing here?" Rio stumbled to appear competent though the obvious bedlam was a bit of a giveaway. “I’m fine, I’m handling it.”</p><p>“Step aside, pet.”</p><p>She rolled up the sleeves of her blouse and slotted in beside Rio behind the counter.</p><p>She leaned close and Rio could feel the heat of her breath against her as Agatha whispered, “Take the orders, and let me handle the rest.” Goosebumps prickled across Rio’s arm. </p><p>They steadily knocked out each order with a speed and efficiency that she didn’t even experience when working with Billy. Rio would write down each order and pass it to Agatha who would somehow conjure the order in no time flat, as if it were magic. Rio felt the need to remind herself to close her mouth while staring in awe at this woman’s skill. </p><p>The way Agatha commanded the crowd like they were under a spell, the way she seemed to float along the bartop handing out orders at record speed, the way she would throw a smile to Rio whenever she handed off a ticket. It was intoxicating being in her presence. </p><p>When she finally closed out the last customer and slipped them the final receipt for the day, Agatha turned to her, saying each word with a delicate command, “Next time, just ask for help.”</p><p>“I didn't want to bother you.”Rio took a rag and started wiping down the counter. “I thought I could handle it alone.” She couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity. </p><p>“Yeah? And I thought Mrs. Reynolds was one second away from ripping you limb from limb if you didn’t get her chocolate malt out soon!” Agatha let out a small snort of laughter while remembering the scene she had walked into. </p><p><em> That was adorable. </em>Rio’s mind was quickly trying to think of other ways she could hear the little snort again. </p><p>“If you had just given me another minute, I could have gotten them under control.” Rio tried to argue.</p><p>“Those animals? Ha! You’d have better luck trying to wrangle the animals of the Central Park Zoo!” Agatha shook her head, a few locks of her brunette hair falling from her bun. </p><p>“Ah fine, I was out of my depth. Thank you, you saved me.” </p><p>“Hey, I was just trying to save my business!” Agatha smiled softly. Even though Rio had nearly started a riot in her shop, she just couldn’t bring herself to reprimand her or tell her off. Even now, looking sheepish and remorseful, Rio still looked utterly charming. </p><p>“Well, I’m glad you were here, whatever the reason. I was so behind the eight ball.”</p><p>“And how! You can say that again. I was working out back and could hear the cacophony through however many layers of brick. I came in expecting a stick up or something, not just a bunch of hungry fools.”</p><p>Agatha moved towards Rio and put a gentle hand on her arm, “Don’t beat yourself up too much. The first time Billy ran the shop by himself, we had to call the fire department to put out a small blaze that started when he attempted to flambé a banana.”</p><p>Rio bowled over laughter but immediately missed the warmth of Agatha's touch. “You’re joking!”</p><p>Her laughs filled the room, a welcome change from the noise in here just a few hours ago. </p><p>“Whose bright idea was it to leave you alone anyway? Where’s that old broad?” Agatha searched around for Lilia.</p><p>“She got a phone call around 11 from someone, I think named Jen? She took off in a hurry and said it would be quick.” Rio remembered the hasty departure. </p><p>“I’ll have to see about that.”</p><p>Agatha went to the telephone and started to dial a number before the front door opened and Lilia strolled in with another woman. Rio took in the gorgeous gold earrings and short bob haircut on this new lady. She was wearing an intricately beaded dress and mary janes, and carrying two large briefcases in her hands. </p><p>“Lilia, Jen, where have you been?” Agatha stared them down with her hands on her hips. “You can’t just leave Rio alone to manage the shop.”</p><p>“We had a problem with…” Jen glanced at Rio, who quietly went back to mopping the floors, “one of our suppliers.” She finished and gave Agatha a knowing look. </p><p>“Okay, let's discuss. I’ll be there in a second.” Lilia and Jen headed out to the alley and Agatha lingered for a moment. </p><p>“Good work in the end, Rio.” She grabbed a pen and scrawled down a note. “You’ve got something about you, bunny.” </p><p>Agatha reached her hand out and Rio grasped it. She felt her slip the note into her palm without acknowledgement.</p><p>“See you around.” And with a wink, she was gone. </p><p>Rio took a second to calm her nerves. She couldn’t understand what it was about Agatha that flustered her so. Every time she spoke to her, it was like her lungs forgot how to function properly, every breath felt labored and manual. Her skin seemed sensitive to every stimuli and her blood seemed to pump at a rapid rate through her veins. <em> Is it hot in here all of a sudden? </em></p><p>She glanced down at the note in her hand. Agatha’s looping script matched her personality perfectly - composed, elegant, yet slightly on edge.</p><p>“Saturday night, 10pm. Knock twice on the alley door, at the prompt - reply with ‘a door appears.’ Wear your best dancing shoes.”</p><p>Rio read it twice, confused at the contents but knew it must be important.</p><p>Whatever went on through that alley door, she was about to find out. </p>

  <p>After work on Friday, Rio went home and waited for Claudia. She knew Tony was going to be out late as was his normal knock off tradition of poker with the other men from the neighborhood. She knew he would be back around 9pm at the latest, so she had a few hours at least to prepare for her own night out. </p><p>Claudia finally arrived at 5:45pm. “How was work?” Rio asked. </p><p>“Just forty more years to go.” Claudia deadpanned back, hanging her coat on the coat rack.</p><p>“You could say that again,” Rio smiled then continued, “On a lighter note, I could use your ever helpful advice.” </p><p>Claudia’s eyes lit a little despite the dim from a day of hard labor, “Oh yeah? Tell me more!” </p><p>“I have an invite to a night out on Saturday, but I don’t have a clue what to wear.” </p><p>“What kind of night out?” Claudia eyed her inquisitively. “Are we talking about the theatre, dinner, dancing, or…something else?”</p><p>“That’s the thing - I’m not really sure…” Rio fussed with a loose thread on her sleeve. “All I know is that I’m meant to wear dancing shoes, and I’m going to need a hell of an excuse to explain to Tony why I’m going out at 10pm.” </p><p>“And who, may I ask, extended this invitation to you?” </p><p>“My boss,” Rio began, “but I don’t think it’s for work. I think she wants to show me something.” She tried to keep it vague as even she didn’t really know why Agatha had offered her this fascinating invite. </p><p>“Grab your things, we’re not going to solve this here!” Claudia picked her coat and purse back up, glad that she hadn’t kicked off her heels just yet. </p><p>“Where are we going?” Rio quickly ran to her room to grab some of her money and a more appropriate coat for the chill of a night out in March. </p><p>“The place that has everything, darling - Macy’s.” Claudia pulled Rio out the door and over to the nearby subway station. They rode downtown, and she led them to the pinnacle of department store shopping. </p><p>“Where should we begin?” Claudia twiddled her fingers together as if plotting a heist. “Let’s start with the dress and build around that.” She headed towards the women’s department on the second floor. </p><p>They browsed the racks and racks of dresses but none seemed quite right for Rio. She only had a few casual dresses that she cycled through each day and had never had the money to afford something from a store like this. The amount of choices was overwhelming. </p><p>“Check this out, Rio!” She held up an emerald green shift dress with a hanky hem that would probably hit just below Rio’s knees. It was sleeveless, which would be a first for her wardrobe, and had elegant beading on the side gathered design. </p><p>“How lovely, I’ll try it on at least.” </p><p>She took the dress to the fitting room nearby and changed. Her white slip was visible underneath the evening gown, and her stockings were the wrong colour entirely, but she admired herself in the mirror with surprise. </p><p>“Let’s see then!” Claudia called from outside. </p><p>Rio strutted out to show off, and Claudia had a small gasp when she took in the dress. “Just call you a tomato, because you’re ripe for the picking!” </p><p>At that, she almost did resemble the red fruit with how deeply colored her cheeks turned. “You’re terrible!” She said covering her face with her hands. </p><p>“You’re going to need to carry around a bat to swat away all the men who are going to be whistling your name. That dress is a killer! You’re buying it - no arguing.” Claudia clapped in finality. </p><p>“Now we just need some more appropriate undergarments, proper dancing shoes, and a matching coat.”</p><p>They settled on some sturdy black T-strap heels and a jade shawl to cover her exposed shoulders. Rio chose to forgo a corset, “There’s not much to strap down anyway.” </p><p>Instead, she picked out one of the new bandeau bras and a step-in silk chemise that would not be visible under the dress that was much shorter than her others. Black stockings and accompanying garter belt were the final touches. Plus Rio didn’t want to blow too much dough all in one trip. </p><p>“I hope you know what you’re getting into,” Claudia warned as they left the store, “because you’re going to turn some heads in this get up.” </p><p><em> Am I making a mistake? </em> Rio wondered to herself. She was going out alone, no Tony. She had never been out on the town without him, but after a month of working and gaining independence she didn’t feel as nervous as she expected. <em> There’s a first time for everything. </em></p><p>As they rode the subway back, Claudia asked, “Where are you going to say you’re going anyway?” </p><p>Rio held tightly to her Macy’s bags and contemplated the answer. She still wasn’t sure what excuse would make sense. “Open to suggestions.” </p><p>“How about I tell Miguel to take Tony to the Central Park Casino? He knows a guy who works the door there and can get them in.” </p><p>“Gambling? He just got over one vice, I would rather he didn’t pick up another.”</p><p>“Be real, doll. You aren’t going to find many places open that late that aren’t speakeasies, gambling houses, brothels, or other seedy hubs.” Claudia certainly kept her honest.</p><p>Rio sighed, “I suppose it beats the alternative.” She paused then, “okay, see if Miguel can convince him.”</p><p>“Something tells me it won’t take much convincing!” </p><p>They made it home before the men, and Rio put away her new purchases in her dresser, which Tony never looked in anyway. Claudia walked into her bedroom with a long, green bakelite necklace and beautiful dangling gold earrings. </p><p>“Are these real?” Rio ran her fingers over the earrings. </p><p>“You can pretend they are. Pretty good, huh? Miguel got them from a pawn shop for just a buck, but they look like the real thing. I think they’ll go great with your look, and the necklace is the icing on top.”</p><p>“Thanks Claudia, I couldn’t have done any of this without your help.” Rio hugged her roommate. The excitement for the upcoming night was already building within her. </p><p>“Don’t mention it,” Claudia pulled away from the hug, “The only thing I ask is you give me all the juicy details when you get back!” </p><p>“Deal.” Rio shook her hand. </p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>Saturday night approached with fervent anticipation. Rio took care of some grocery shopping in the morning, did a few buckets of laundry, and had some time to read the latest mystery novel she had picked up at the bookstore. </p><p>Tony approached around lunchtime, “Guess what?” He came to sit beside her on the couch, “Miguel is going to take me out to the casino tonight.” </p><p>“Oh really?” Rio feigned surprise and tried to hide her smirk as Claudia’s plan unfolded before her. </p><p>“It’s probably going to be a late night, so don’t wait up.” He kissed her cheek. “I promise not to get up to too much mischief.” </p><p>“You better not!” Rio warned. “Don’t go gambling away our savings either.”</p><p>“Eh, I’m not much of a gambler, you know me. I’m more just interested in what goes on in there. I’ve heard some fellas talk about it at work, but it's all very hush hush.”</p><p>“Okay but Antonio” She said his full name for emphasis. “Please don’t drink.” </p><p>“Yes, of course. Don’t worry.” He tried to soothe her fears. “We’re heading out around 8pm, not sure what time we’ll be back.”</p><p>“Alright, be careful,” she said, “I may be heading to early morning service at 8am, so try not to wake me when you get in.” </p><p>Rio hoped the lie of church service would be enough cover but hoped she wouldn’t have to actually make good on it. </p><p>After dinner and listening to the Yankees game on the radio, the men took off on their big night out, and Rio started prepping. She dressed quietly in her room, luxuriating over the feel of the nice fabrics that were so different from her normal clothing. She rolled the rayon stockings up each leg and clipped them onto her garter belt. She let the new dress fall down her body like water - smoothing out each wrinkle with her hands. </p><p>The new shoes fit like a dream and Claudia’s jewellery matched like they had planned it ahead of time. She used combs to wave her hair, which shortened it from its normal length right above her shoulder, and parted it on her left side to create an elegant curly bob. </p><p>To complete the look, she applied a dab of pink rouge to her cheeks, a smoky dark eye shadow, and a heavier-than-usual eyeliner. She searched for her trusty red lipstick but couldn’t find the tub in her dressing table anywhere. <em> Guess, I’ll skip that for tonight.  </em></p><p>She decided to leave early to give herself time to get there, having never walked it at night before. “I’m off, Claudia! Wish me luck.” She grabbed her leather envelope bag and made for the door.</p><p>Claudia came out of her room, and her eyes bulged at the sight of Rio. </p><p>She whistled slowly, “You look incredible. That dress is the berries! Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.” </p><p>The streets of Washington Heights and Upper Manhattan felt sinister at this time of night, but Rio knew the route like the back of her hand. She passed a few unsavory characters along the way and was thankful for the electric street lamps that exposed anything that may have frightened her in the pitch black of night. </p><p>When she arrived at the familiar street of Westview Pharmacy, she looked around for a sign of where to go next. She only saw a few people milling about. Men returning home from late shifts, young couples off to the clubs in the main strip of Harlem, and groups of women searching for some place to show off their dance moves. </p><p>Rio rounded the building and approached from the back street, straight into the back alley behind the shop. She didn’t see anyone else back here and it was very dimly lit, only getting light from the upper windows reflecting the streetlamps. She approached the alley door and remembered Agatha’s note clearly in her mind. </p><p>
  <b>Knock, knock</b>
</p><p>She rapped twice and heard nothing. She waited a moment and was ready to give it up, upset that Agatha had fooled her, when the small hatch on the door slid open with a sudden flourish. </p><p>“Tame your fears” A female voice whispered quietly but clearly out the slit. </p><p>Rio gulped. It felt like a directive specifically for her. </p><p>“A door appears.” She replied calmly just as the note had said. </p><p>“Welcome” The voice replied as the door swung open towards Rio. She stepped through. </p><p>“You must be Rio,” An Asian woman extended her hand. “Names Alice.” </p><p>She was wearing wool tweed knee-length knickers paired with knee high socks, like a male golfer, a khaki shirt and that striking leather jacket Rio had spotted a few days ago. She had never seen a woman dressed in such a manner outside of a sporting context, but it seemed to suit her personality and the nature of what appeared to be her job. </p><p>Rio shook her hand firmly, impressed at her grip. “Nice to finally meet you Alice.” </p><p>She took in the small landing room they were in. It was tiny, exposed brick on all the walls with a single lightbulb overhead. Nothing but a chair for Alice, a cabinet on one wall, and a large staircase leading straight down.</p><p>“Agatha told me you were coming tonight. Just head down the stairs and you’ll see.” Alice motioned her forward. </p><p>“Thanks, hopefully I’ll see you later.” Rio replied before carefully walking the wooden steps down, down, down. </p><p>She tried to imagine where she was in relation to the alley. This was clearly a basement below the shops next door to the pharmacy. She wondered how Agatha had commandeered the land from them, or did she own other buildings too? </p><p>At the base of the stairs were three doors, one for each wall. She hesitated, unsure which way to go, when she heard noises coming from straight ahead. She opened the door in front of her and froze at the sight. She had expected a small storage room, and instead found herself in a grand room about the size of her community gymnasium. It could probably hold at least 200 people comfortably and must be underneath the width of the pharmacy plus three or four neighboring buildings.</p><p>Immediately to her left, a long, curving wooden bar with chromium accents extended the length of the south wall. The back bar was completely mirrored, which made the space feel even larger than it was, and it was covered in arched shelves with glassware of all shapes and sizes and empty bottles lining the wall. The ceiling felt low but elegant crystal chandeliers hung throughout the space and provided a warm light. </p><p>Deep, dark wood paneling covered the walls while silk curtains hung as decoration and green palms flourished along the edges. Sconces lit the room, providing just enough light to see but not overexpose it. The lack of windows also gave the feeling of perpetual night, like anything could happen within these walls. </p><p>Built-in booths with leather seating lined the sides, along with small cocktail tables and chairs. In the center of it all was a brilliant dance floor with intricate parquet flooring - the wood clearly worn from years of usage. It all led to a modest stage at the opposing wall, with a large piano and bandstands standing stage left, all framed by two large columns. Various paintings seemed to cover the remaining space on the walls, adding to the charm and cozy feeling within. Rio took in every detail in shock and awe. This wasn’t just some dingy basement, this was a swanky dance hall.</p><p>
  <em> How was all of this just sitting under her nose the whole time? Agatha ran an illegal speakeasy?? How did she not know? </em>
</p><p>The questions piled up in her mind at a rapid rate. </p><p>“Didn’t know if you’d have the guts to make it, bunny.” Agatha sauntered out from behind the bar to meet Rio, her hips swinging like the pendulum of a grandfather clock. </p><p>“Surprise, my lady.” </p><p>Agatha stopped for a moment when she finally took in the full sight of her. Her eyes tracking every detail of Rio’s body. </p><p>“Wow, somebody got all dolled up - check you out!” She grinned mischievously and Rio beamed back, arms outstretched. </p><p>She did a little twirl, loving the way her new dress fanned out around her, “They say dress to impress.” </p><p>“And you certainly have.” Agatha couldn’t seem to stop staring at her legs. Rio normally wore more modest dresses and skirts to work, and this sudden flash of skin made her forget herself. </p><p>When her gaze finally crept back up to Rio’s face, she narrowed her eyes, “I think there’s just one thing you forgot.” </p><p>Agatha walked back behind the bar, rummaged in a small bag, and returned holding a gold tube of lipstick. “May I?” </p><p>“Of course” Rio pushed her lips out in anticipation as Agatha twisted the deep red lipstick until it was just visible. </p><p>Then, she reached her right hand and gently touched the young woman’s jaw, holding Rio’s head steady while her left hand slowly applied the colour first to her top lip then along her bottom with equal precision. </p><p>Each agonising slow motion sent a rush of adrenaline through Rio’s bloodstream and caused her throat to dry up, making each attempt to swallow almost painful. She didn’t realize she was holding her breath until Agatha pulled away. She had been mesmerized by the quiet concentration in those blue eyes as they stared at her own lips. </p><p>“Perfect,” Agatha said as she stepped back and admired her handiwork.</p><p>“Here, you can blot it on this handkerchief.” She handed over the white fabric square. </p><p>“Thanks for that.” Rio put her lips around the handkerchief, her thoughts abruptly wishing that she was putting her lips somewhere else instead.</p><p>
  <em> What the hell? </em>
</p><p>“I have so many questions about this place.” She pushed out those intruding feelings and re-focused on her current setting, she didn’t know where to begin. </p><p>“I’m sure. But tonight, I just want to show you a good time. You work too hard, Rio. Everybody needs a break once in a while. When’s the last time you had careless fun?”</p><p>Rio tried to remember and couldn’t. She thought of her time in America since arriving - anxiety, stress, fear, Tony, the list went on. “Oh wow…I’m a total loser.” She laughed to hide her embarrassment. </p><p>“Total loser? I think you’re totally lying.” Agatha swatted her playfully. “You’ve been busy. Life can hold you down sometimes.” She sympathized and touched her shoulder tenderly now. </p><p>“Tonight will be a bit of work and play. I’ll show you how we run things, but we can also let loose.” </p><p>She nodded, “I can only imagine what goes on down here.” </p><p>“Honey, just wait and see. Doors open in an hour, let me show you around before things really get hopping.” She grabbed her hand and led the way. </p><p>They walked around the club, and Rio’s neck couldn’t keep up with her eyes, her head swinging this way and that to take it all in. Agatha led them to the imposing bar first. </p><p>“The stage might be the main draw, but this is the real star of the show.” She ran her fingers along the bartop delicately, as if it were a jumpy house cat. </p><p>It was a brilliant walnut color with intricate carvings beneath the high counter. Rio studied the woodwork and noticed the shapes of birds throughout the paneling. Recessed woodland birds appeared to fly across carved trees on the front of the bar. She leaned down to touch the shape of a large crow with wings outstretched and head cawing up, and she traced along the shapes of a flock of small birds flying across the top of the forest landscape. </p><p>Chrome lined the railing and drew the eye immediately, reflecting the chandelier light like subtle stars. The bartop was a lighter color as it had been worn down by faithful customers over the span of decades. The drag of an arm as it reached for a glass, the wear of hands rubbing the wood while waiting for a bartender's attention, the indents of elbows braced down to hold the weight of an incoming mistake. </p><p>It was as if she was reading an epic novel just by looking at this singular piece of furniture - the stories were pouring out like the drinks that normally flowed from its recesses. </p><p>There seemed to be a key component missing. </p><p>“I know it's a bar, so…where’s all the booze?” Rio had scanned the length of it and peered behind the counter, yet she could not see any sign of alcohol. </p><p>“You do remember the laws, right?”</p><p>Agatha walked behind the bar. “The reason we’ve lasted this long is because we are careful.”</p><p>She reached for the mirror at the back wall and it dropped forward slowly to reveal a hidden alcove of deep shelves set into the brick. Large bottles of liquor took up every available space inside. Rio caught the sly smile as Agatha turned around to show off. </p><p>“Wow, no kidding.” </p><p>Agatha motioned her around to stand next to her and banged twice on a very specific corner of the bar. One of the side panels fell open to uncover even more full bottles that were stacked within the inner structure of the bar itself. </p><p>“Let’s just say, we keep things as well-stocked as possible.” </p><p>“But, where does it come from?” Rio had to ask the most obvious question. </p><p>The sale of liquor had been banned for two years in the states, and the amount of bottles here suggested Agatha must have a decent supplier somehow. </p><p>“I have my ways.” Agatha grabbed a bottle of amber liquid and brought it up to show Rio. “Have you ever had a shot before?”</p><p>“I’ve only ever tried wine and that was in church.” Rio admitted quietly, feeling shy.</p><p>She was nervous and trying to hide it. The thought of drinking felt wrong, bad, scary. Seeing its effects on Tony had put her off the drink permanently in her mind. What if she became angry too? What if it made her mean? What if…she liked it?</p><p>“I’m not going to force you, but I hope you’ll try it. This is the best whiskey that money can buy - straight from Kentucky.” Agatha poured two shots into the tiniest glasses Rio had ever seen. </p><p>She pushed one over. Rio looked at the little glass curiously and held it lightly with her right hand. <em> Just one couldn’t hurt. </em></p><p>“On three, throw it back quickly. Ready?” Agatha grabbed her own glass and focused on Rio’s eyes. Her stare was intense and Rio felt the room fall away. All she could see was those piercing blues staring her down. </p><p>“One” </p><p>Rio felt her pulse start to race. </p><p>“Two” </p><p>She took a quick breath in.</p><p>“Three” </p><p>They both downed the shots in a single gulp. Rio felt the liquid burn her throat instantly and felt her eyes bulge. </p><p>“Ay dios mío!”</p><p>She leaned her head back and stared up at the ceiling grabbing her neck. “Are you sure that wasn’t gasoline?” She coughed while trying to laugh.</p><p>Agatha scoffed, grabbing her chest in faux upset. “How dare you? This whiskey is the cat’s pajamas! You don’t want to know the trouble it took to secure just this single bottle.”</p><p>“Whatever you had to do - it wasn’t worth it.” Rio threw back some sass.</p><p>“Well, well, well, it certainly woke you up. What have you done with the timid little bunny I’ve come to know?” Agatha appraised her with glee. </p><p>“Ah, can it. That was the worst thing I’ve ever tasted.”</p><p>“You get used to it.” Agatha winked. “Come on, let me show you the rest of the place before the crowds get here or before you get properly splifficated.”</p><p>She pushed Rio lightly out from behind the bar. “This way.” </p><p>They walked back towards the door that Rio came through from the stairs. </p><p>“See that light?” She pointed to a triangular wall sconce next to the exit door. It was distinctly different from every other in the space. It was larger, red in hue, and the light pointed down instead of up. </p><p>“If Alice spots any trouble coming our way, she flashes it three times on and off. It gives us at least a minute or two to put it into high gear and clear any trace of alcohol as best we can.”</p><p>“Does that happen often?” Rio looked at her with worry.</p><p>“Thankfully no. Just once or twice in the past year, but nothing came of it. A slap on the wrist is all. It might surprise you to know that I’m very good at talking my way out of a bad situation.”</p><p>“No! You?” Rio’s sarcastic streak continued. </p><p>Agatha let out her little snort again to Rio’s delight. “Yes, anyway, we also have a few loyal customers who happen to serve the boys in blue and give us the heads up when raids are scheduled.”</p><p>“Convenient” </p><p>“Very” </p><p>She opened the main entry door, and they were back in the landing zone at the bottom of the stairs. She took them into the door to her left.</p><p>“This is the coat and corset check.” She motioned to the booth and adjoining closet space which must be under the length of the stairs. </p><p>“Corset check?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Have you ever tried dancing the Charleston in a corset?” Agatha tilted her head down with a quizzical look. Rio shook her head quickly.</p><p>“And on the other wall there are the powder rooms. Nothing fancy but a necessity. Come on.” She pulled her back out to the landing room. They went through the last door on the other wall.</p><p>They were now in a dark hallway, only one small ceiling light provided any relief. Rio thought they must be directly behind the bar now. </p><p>“This is a spare storage hall and an escape route for bar staff if things go sideways. This place used to be a saloon back in the day and was owned by the Italian mafia. There are at least 5 exits out of the club to the street, and those are just the ones we’ve found. It comes in handy given my line of work now.”</p><p>“The mafia? How did you get your hands on this place then?” Rio ran her hands along the bricks of the wall and moved to sit on the many large crates lining the hall. </p><p>“I don’t think we have the time for the whole story, but it’s mostly Lilia’s neverending network of connections in this city that secured the space. I was just working upstairs and had a certain knack for pouring drinks that she thought I might be better suited pouring something besides milkshakes and soda pop. </p><p>Plus, I had just lost my husband, barely had two pennies to rub together, and was desperate for some cash to keep afloat.”</p><p>“I’m sorry - about your husband. I didn’t know you were married.” Rio looked over at Agatha who was looking down at the ground, kicking some dust bunnies along the hardwood. </p><p>“Old news at this point. Went to war, didn’t come back. Not much more to report.” She set her jaw as she pushed the memories aside. “Want to see something really amazing?”</p><p>Rio felt like there was more to address. She had no idea that Agatha was a widow. Every moment she spent with her felt like turning another page. She hoped she would never reach the end of this story. </p><p>“Show the way” She decided against pushing further on the husband story, for now. </p><p>Agatha pulled a ring of keys from her pocket. Knocked once and had to use two separate keys to open a door at the end of the hallway. </p><p>“Jen, it’s me!” She announced as they entered the backroom. </p><p>“Gosh, you frightened me for a second there. I wasn’t expecting any guests.” </p><p>Rio took in the striking woman she first saw the other day with Lilia. As opposed to her polished appearance, she was now clad in shabby denim overalls over a white long-sleeve shirt. She had a sturdy headband on to keep the hair from her eyes and was wearing a pair of work gloves. </p><p>The room was about the size of two small bedrooms put together but felt even smaller due to the low ceiling. There were two big vents on one wall that must have emptied up to the alley. There was also a stack of suitcases and briefcases stacked in one corner, which Rio recalled Jen carrying on the day she first saw her.</p><p>What she noticed first though were the two large copper contraptions that took up the majority of the space. They seemed identical and each was connected to smaller pots by spiraling coils of shining metal. There were large kegs collecting something that dripped from the spouts of the coils. </p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said her name like it was a warning, “what is the new girl doing here?”</p><p>“We need more help, and her name is Rio.” Agatha said. </p><p>Jen sucked her teeth, holding back a retort. She turned to Rio and removed her glove to extend a hand, “Pleasure to meet you officially.” </p><p>Rio shook her hand and said, “Likewise, Jen.” </p><p>“Since you’re here already, might as well show you what goes on. These are moonshine stills.” She patted one of the copper pots with a soft whack. </p><p>“I’m a 5th generation moonshiner. My family has been brewing this recipe for over two hundred years, and it never fails. It will knock you on your ass, but that’s where Agatha comes in with her fancy cocktails to cut the strength. One of the perks of working under a soda fountain loaded with sugary mix-ins, I suppose.”</p><p>Agatha added, “Jen’s shine is the best town. Not many clubs would buy from her - the racist bastards - but the first time I tasted a drop of this stuff, I asked her to come work for me.” </p><p>“Can I try some?” Rio was intrigued. </p><p>“Pump the breaks, hot stuff. If you thought that whisky earlier was strong, this will blow your brains out.” Agatha’s laugh echoed in the small room. “We’ll work up to it, don’t worry.” </p><p>“Okay, Mother” She relented with a roll of the eyes. </p><p>“Thanks Jen, we’ll let you get back to work. Doors open in about half an hour, are you staying for service tonight?” Agatha asked as she backed towards the door.</p><p>“Don’t I always?” Jen put her glove back on and waved. “See you out there, boss.”</p><p>The two walked out of the still room into the hallway then through a side door which took them straight back behind the bar. </p><p>“This place is a maze!” Rio was losing track of direction with all the doors. </p><p>“That’s the point. The harder it is to navigate, the harder time the fuzz will have trying to catch us. I just have one more place to show you, come along.”</p><p>They now walked over the large dance floor and towards the stage. Agatha led them up the steps on the right, onto the raised platform, and then backstage. It was dark behind the velvet curtains but Agatha seemed like she could navigate every inch of this club with her eyes closed. </p><p>She grabbed Rio’s hand without a second thought. “Watch your step.”</p><p>She pulled her into one of two doors back there and flipped a light switch. </p><p>“These are the performer dressing rooms. We try to have singers, bands, or dancers every weekend evening. People come for the booze, don’t get me wrong, but they stay for the entertainment.” </p><p>“What sort of people come here?” Rio’s imagination drifted to the news stories she had seen in the paper of derelicts, gangsters, and all sorts of unsavory characters that frequented the thousands of speakeasies in town. </p><p>“Probably not the sort you’re thinking of.” Agatha caught the surprise on Rio’s face as she seemed to read her mind. </p><p>“We cater to a…special crowd, to put it lightly. It’s invite-only, and I take security very seriously. I wanted this to be a place where folks could - “ She paused, searching for the right words. </p><p>“Be themselves. People who might not feel safe in most places.” Agatha explored Rio’s face for any hint of understanding. </p><p>“Like Jen?” Rio offered innocently, looking towards Agatha for clarity.</p><p>“Yes, that’s part of it.” The boss was contemplating something, but Rio didn’t know what. </p><p>She saw her glance at her watch. </p><p>“Oh drat, time slipped away from us. I’ve gotta get changed quickly, can you wait out by the bar for me? I’ll be out in a jiffy.” </p><p>Rio wandered back out to the main hall and sat on one of the lonely barstools. </p><p>Agatha closed the door as Rio walked out. She rifled through the spare gowns she kept in here as backup when she didn’t have time to run home and settled on one of her favorites. A moss-green cotton number, heavily decorated in dazzling glass beads. The beads created a tiered effect across the skirt to mirror the scalloped hem, and a decorated band sat at her natural waistline to draw attention to the center of her body. </p><p>She pinned her hair back and added a green jewelled hair comb. As she looked in the mirror to touch up her make-up, she thought about how much more to say to Rio. She didn’t want to scare the poor girl, but something in the way she looked at her, Agatha felt that she wasn’t as innocent as she seemed. <em> She’s going to find out soon anyway. I’ll have to watch her closely.  </em></p><p>With a final swipe of her lipstick and a spray of perfume, Agatha walked back out. </p><p>Rio heard her coming down from the stage and spun around on the barstool. Whatever she was about to say didn’t come out. She didn’t know if it was the heat of the whisky shot or something else entirely that was making her face feel like she was burning up. </p><p>Agatha, normally a bastion of confidence, felt flustered under Rio’s shameless gaze. <em> Does she even know what she’s doing to me? She can’t think that’s a normal way to stare at another woman’s legs, for Christ’s sake. </em>She fanned herself with her hand as best she could.</p><p>“Cat got your tongue? You’re not the only one who cleans up nice.”</p><p>“You look amazing.” Rio’s voice was low, dangerous. </p><p><em> She’s trying to kill me. </em> Agatha thought. <em> And she doesn't have a clue. </em></p><p>“I know. Now get ready, once the doors open, this place gets crowded very fast. I’ll be behind the bar or mingling with the folks on the floor. Jen will be helping serve drinks to the tables and Alice mans the door. You’ll see Herb who manages security down here and handles anyone who gets too plastered, and Billy’s off tonight so Darcy is running the coat check and helping me pour drinks. Finally, there’s Sharon, the stage manager, who manages all the talent.”</p><p>“What do you want me to do?” Rio still wasn’t sure why Agatha had brought her into the fold. </p><p>“You proved your skill upstairs, and I need another bartender down here. Eventually.” She rounded the bar and started pulling the bottles out.</p><p>“Sit back, kick your dogs up, and just watch Mother work.” Each word hit Rio in the chest with unexpected force.</p><p>Rio turned as a stream of people started to flow through the door like a dam had opened. She rubbed her hands together in anticipation.</p><p>
  <em> Here we go. </em>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>“Hello Suckers!” Agatha’s voice cut through the room without the need for a microphone. “Come on in and leave your wallet at the bar!” </p><p>She threw her head back in a delicious cackle as the room erupted in cheers and laughter from the crowd of adoring customers. They clapped, they raised their glasses, and Rio watched every person vie for the attention of their glorious host. </p><p>And Agatha lapped it up. It was like watching a dying seedling get its first taste of water after a drought. Rio watched her suck the energy from the crowd and feed on their adoration like it was the most delicious meal on earth, like their love was the medicine she needed to stay alive. </p><p>She then scanned the room for the first time and did a double, then triple take. Men adorned in evening gowns, women wearing ties and suit jackets, people off all types wearing wigs and the most beautiful costumes she had ever seen. Up was down, down was up. Her eyes felt like they were going to bounce out of her head, she couldn’t take in all the sights and sounds in front of her. </p><p>
  <em> Where am I? </em>
</p><p>Rio’s mind was racing. <em> Maybe this was a bad idea. </em></p><p>
  <em> Should I leave? I should leave, right?  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> But what would I say? What excuse could I give? Should I say that my boyfriend is waiting for me? </em>
</p><p>
  <em> No, no, that sounds like a lie. Maybe, I can say I don’t feel well - that that shot isn’t sitting well in my stomach. Yeah, maybe she would buy that.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Ugh, she might just think I really am a total loser.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> No, I can be relaxed. Yup, completely fine with guys in gowns and dames in tuxes. They aren’t doing anything bad, right? It’s just…different. </em>
</p><p>She locked onto Agatha to ground herself. The big boss was working the room like she owned it - because she did. <em> And god, they love her. </em> She greeted each person with warmth and knowing. Regardless of what they were wearing or who they were with, she didn’t pay it any mind. </p><p>“First time?” </p><p>A voice brought her out of her fixation, and Rio spun back around to face the bar. “Sorry?”</p><p>“I don’t recognise you. Is this your first night at <em> The Hidden Gate </em>?” The woman pouring drinks leaned close to be heard. </p><p>“Yes, I’m Rio.” She took in the beautiful woman with prominent circular glasses on and bright, red lipstick. “I work upstairs with Lilia.”</p><p>“Ohhhh, you’re that new girl that Agatha prattled on about. Welcome to the show, I’m Darcy. I can only work a few weekends a month as I’m currently studying political science at NYU, so I wasn’t sure if I was going to get the chance to meet you.”</p><p>Rio whistled, impressed, “Why do you work here then with brains like that?”</p><p>“It’s her, obviously.” She nodded towards the center of the room and Rio didn’t even have to look to know who she was referring to. “Agatha is magnetic. She makes you feel like you belong, which can be challenging for a lot of us.”</p><p>“Us?” Rio furrowed her brow.</p><p>Darcy tilted her head and motioned around her, “Look around, doll. You must have noticed. This isn’t your normal bar crowd.”</p><p>Rio looked over her shoulder just as the horns of the big band rang out and couples took to the floor to foxtrot. She saw two handsome men in black tuxedos walk together, hold each other, and dance as a pair.</p><p>She had heard about these sorts of people before but only in passing.</p><p>“Watch where you’re going, you pansy!” Tony yelled out as a slim, young man once accidently bumped him as they walked down the street. </p><p>“Tony, was that necessary?” Rio had dropped his hand and questioned.</p><p>“Guys like that need to learn a thing or two.” He replied. </p><p>She hadn’t known how he had identified the stranger as a “pansy” but she could tell from his tone that it was not a good thing. </p><p>She recalled her uncle, Sal, calling one of her cousins a “sissy” when he had pranced around in their auntie’s high heels as a joke to make all the other kids laugh. Her cousin’s face fell as he kicked off the shoes and ran off in anger. </p><p>“I’m not having any of those <em> freaks </em> in my house.” Sal had emphasized and all the men grunted in agreement as if they all knew what he meant, and maybe they did. Rio didn’t. </p><p>“But…” She started to ask but wasn’t sure what she even wanted to know. “How do they find this place?”</p><p>“Agatha has her ways, and word tends to spread pretty quickly. There are pockets of Harlem, Greenwich Village, and spots uptown that attract a group of people who live a lifestyle that’s outside the norm. These folks are just looking to party like everyone else, but it’s less…accepted at your everyday club. So, where do these folks go?” She left it open-ended and Rio filled in the blanks as much as she could. </p><p>“Here, Rio,” Darcy said, “You look a bit thirsty.” </p><p>She pushed a small glass of bright yellow liquid with a garnish of lemon peel across the counter. </p><p>Rio raised the glass to her lips and delighted in the taste. “Wow, this lemonade tastes so unique. It’s so sweet.” She had another large sip.</p><p>Darcy laughed and decided to bite her tongue. Every newbie needed a little razzing, “Yeah, lemonade! Let me know when you want another - on the house!”</p><p>“Thanks Darcy.” Rio happily drank the glass and enjoyed the music from the talented band and the buzz of the crowd around her. </p><p>She had never been to a bar before. It wasn’t allowed in Puerto Rico when she was growing up, and by the time she landed in America, Prohibition was in full swing. Alcohol had never appealed to her, especially not after seeing how it could change someone, and she had never had the desire to seek out the many speakeasies that dotted the city. </p><p>A young flapper fell into the barstool next to Rio. “Hey, doll face. What’s a girl like you doing drinking all alone?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m not drinking any more booze tonight, and I’m not alone. I’m with Agatha.” She finished off her drink, none the wiser.</p><p>“You’re with Mother? How’d you score the High Pillow herself? I’ve been trying for months to catch her eye. She never gives anyone the time of day.” The girl leaned back against the bar and motioned to Darcy who threw up a one second sign as she was busy with a rush of new arrivals. </p><p>“I’m not - Agatha and I aren’t -” Rio stuttered her words, feeling a bit light headed.</p><p>The girl smiled and flashed her perfectly straight teeth. “Will you do one shot with me? Pretty please.” She pouted her lips. </p><p>“Why?” Rio couldn’t tell what this girl wanted from her. She was erratic with a scary beauty but obvious recklessness. </p><p>“It’ll loosen you up a bit. You seem tense and that just won’t do here.” </p><p>Rio figured she was already out late, in an illegal bar, and surrounded by what appeared to be hundreds of homosexuals. “Fine! Why not?” </p><p>Darcy eyed the new girl, “Careful, Florence. This one works upstairs, so she’s property of Mother. You don’t want to go there.”</p><p>“Don’t get sore at me! I’m just trying to show her a good time is all. Two shots of Jen’s finest, please.”</p><p>The bartender poured two shots of moonshine, and Florence passed one to Rio, careful not to spill a single drop. “Bottoms up!”</p><p>They downed the shots and Florence slammed her glass into the bar. “Woooo! I bet that stuff could power a car engine.” </p><p>“Am I still alive?” Rio croaked out. She felt like she had swallowed a firework - the burn down her esophagus felt all consuming. </p><p>“Get her another lemonade, quick!” She pointed at Rio’s empty glass. </p><p>She giggled and passed the refilled glass to Rio before heading off to one of the nearby booths. “Enjoy the night, sweetie.” She blew her a kiss and was gone as quick as she came. </p><p>Rio shrugged her shoulders and she watched her walk away, “Thanks, I’ll try.”</p><p>As she finished off her second glass in a record time, she placed it on the counter, “Is it getting hot in here, Darcy? I feel like I’m burning up.”</p><p>She was having trouble focusing her eyes. All the lights and moving people kept catching her attention, and the sound of music was overwhelming.</p><p>“It tends to warm up as the space fills up…are you alright?” Darcy asked, feeling wary. She should probably cut her off now. That amount of liquor in that amount of time was asking for trouble. </p><p>Rio stood from the bar suddenly. She faltered on her feet for a second before steadying herself on the stool and proclaiming loudly, “I want to dance!” </p><p>She felt a warmth spread across her chest like a hug, her limbs felt restless, her anxiety now overshadowed by the immense desire to move her feet. <em> Agatha told me to wear dancing shoes, after all. </em> The jazz music was flowing through her, and the dance floor called to her irresistibly. </p><p>She was up and off before she could even hear Darcy’s panicked voice call out, “Rio, wait!”</p><p>She was floating towards the center of the room as if the music was summoning her. The trumpets blared out the melody of an uptempo jazz number that brought the crowd out to Charleston on the floor. </p><p>Rio got right in the middle of the action and showed off her moves solo. She was no stranger to the dance, being a frequent guest at the local community dance hall every few weeks with Tony. But, she had never danced alone. He had never let her, always the lead, always spinning her around the room like she was his puppet. </p><p>He was a fine dancer, much better than the American boys that Rio saw attempting to swing their partners around. But, he held her a bit too tight and lacked any creativity or flow. </p><p>Normally, she would be too self-conscious or worried about what people might say, but tonight, for some reason, she didn't care. As her arms moved in time with the intricate twisting steps and rhythm of the music, she felt the crowd parting in a circle around her. </p><p>People were clapping the beat and cheering her on as she cranked up the intensity and the musicians built to a crescendo. Suddenly, there was nobody else near her. She was channeling the music through every movement, and everybody stopped to watch. </p><p>The drums felt like a heartbeat, and she hit every beat in perfect time. Her new dress was the perfect dance partner as it swayed and flared with each turn, allowing her legs to kick out and impress the growing crowd. </p><p>Her heels twisted and toes turned inwards and outwards as she exaggerated the motions and closed her eyes. She had never felt such freedom before. The pulse of the song wove through her every move like she was feeling every note as a command. There were no sweaty hands to hold, no man leading her in whatever direction he wanted to go. She completely surrendered to her own whims and the direction of the music. </p><p>She threw in a small salsa break to the hollers and whistles of onlookers - her hips rolling like waves and her arms painting arcs in the air. The salsa was like home in her body, the moves so familiar and ingrained that she didn’t even need to think. It was the first dance she had learned as a child and one she knew she would love forever. </p><p>The crowd was mesmerized by this newcomer. Every man and woman was watching Rio move across the dancefloor with jealous envy, predatory desire, or both. And as the song approached its conclusion, Rio’s vision finally unblurred to sounds of applause, and she caught one pair of eyes completely locked in on her, a familiar pair of blue eyes, and they looked hungry. </p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>Agatha always imagined that death would come for her in a blaze of glory. She would have dreams as a child that she would go out in a gunfight or horse chase or be burned at the stake in front of a crowd. Probably the product of her voracious appetite for adventure books. </p><p>She <b>never</b> thought it would come for her in own club. Certainly not in the form of a red-hot, brunette bombshell with moves to rival Fred Astaire or Josephine Baker and the legs of a goddess. </p><p>She hadn’t seen Rio leave the bar. Agatha had been schmoozing with a couple of regulars in the popular corner booth near the stage. The dance floor was packed as usual whenever Chick Webb’s band came to play. What was unusual was the circle that was forming around a single dancer. </p><p>She rarely paid mind to the dance floor antics, but her curiosity got the better of her. </p><p>Agatha excused herself from the conversation to check out what was happening. She had never seen a dance circle in the club. Most of her guests were too absorbed in their own little worlds to take notice of who else was dancing around them. <em> Who could they possibly be watching? </em></p><p>Crowds normally parted when she approached, but this time they were all too busy enraptured with this mystery dancer to see Agatha coming. She gently pushed her way through the layers of people until she arrived at the edge of the circle, and her heart stopped. </p><p>She had to put two fingers to her neck to check that she still had a pulse because she swore that her life had ended right then and there. This wasn’t some random stranger - it was Rio. Her eyes were glued to Rio’s body, and she couldn’t even perceive the music that echoed throughout the room. </p><p>All she could see was Rio’s legs, Rio’s arms, Rio’s smile, Rio’s knees, Rio’s eyes. Every fluid step, every sway, every kick threatened to consume Agatha, and she welcomed her demise. </p><p><em> What the actual fuck? </em> </p><p>That was the only thought that could even fight to exist in Agatha’ mind. Everything else was pushed out by the singular experience of Rio.</p><p>She couldn’t even pick her jaw up off the floor and felt like some ridiculous broken nutcracker with her mouth hanging open. It was spellbinding. </p><p>She was not used to someone else dominating a space the way she normally did. Everyone’s eyes trained on somebody else - she was a part of the crowd this time.  </p><p>And then, of course, Rio just had to throw some salsa dancing because she obviously must have wanted to punish Agatha. And if this was punishment, then Agatha was ready to get on her knees and beg for more because it was the most divine ache she had ever experienced. She watched her hips roll, and Agatha forgot how to breathe.</p><p>When everyone else was clapping as the song ended, Agatha was a statue. </p><p>
  <em> Clap, god damn it, move your hands.  </em>
</p><p>She tried to will herself to move, but her eyes were engrossed in one thing, and one thing alone. No other part of her body was allowed to function yet. She was ready to devour Rio if given the opportunity but her own limbs refused to move. </p><p>Luckily (or unluckily) for her, Rio was the one who bounded over, high on adrenaline. </p><p>“I’m so thirsty!” She panted and put her arms behind her head to stretch, unaware of the way people were now staring and appraising her. Every man and woman was sizing her up.</p><p>“What have you been drinking?” Agatha leaned in and could smell the heavy scent of booze on Rio’s breath.<em> I’m going to kill Darcy. </em></p><p>“Just lemonade. Oh and some pretty-, uhh, some girl bought me a shot of moonshine.” She was starting to slur her words. </p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. The feeling of jealousy rising at the thought of someone buying Rio a drink. “What girl?”</p><p>“Ummmmmmmm…I forget. Fanny? Nooo. Flora? Ummm, let’s ask Darcy, she would know.” Rio skipped over to the bar like a jolly child. </p><p>Agatha put her hands on her head and tried not to die of embarrassment. She followed her to the bar in a brisk walk. </p><p>“Darcy” Her voice cut like a knife. She crooked her finger and beckoned the bartender with a no-nonsense gaze. </p><p>“DARCY! Did you see me dance?” Rio had thrown her top half onto the bartop. “I loveeee dancing.”</p><p>“Yes, Agatha?” Darcy arrived and tried not to smile, her eyes flicking to the inebriated form spreading out her arms on the bar. </p><p>“Do you want to tell me how this…” She motioned her hand in a spinning circle over Rio, “happened?”</p><p>“Well, it started with one drink and then one became two and -” </p><p>Agatha cut in sharply, “She wasn’t meant to be drinking at all!” </p><p>“Agatha, Agatha, watch this!” Rio jumped up and did a little spin in the air. </p><p>“Why is she tanked, Darcy?” </p><p>“Sorry boss, she just looked like she could loosen up. Then, Florence bought her a shot of Jen’s stuff and it all went off the rails.” </p><p>“You know how strong that is! What else were you giving her?”</p><p>“Just some Bee’s Knee’s cocktails. She said they tasted like lemonade.” Darcy shrugged.</p><p>“Yeah, lemonade and 80 proof gin!” Agatha slumped onto the stool. This was meant to be a casual introduction to the bar, and now Rio was knee deep in it. </p><p>
  <em> Relax, Agatha. People get drunk every night here, no big deal. Nothing bad’s going to happen.  </em>
</p><p>She felt an arm wrap around her shoulder and a voice whisper in her ear, “Dance with me, mami”</p><p>
  <em> Okay something bad might happen.  </em>
</p><p>And she felt Rio trace her hand down Agatha’s shoulder and along her arm before grasping her hand and pulling her to stand. “Por favor, Agatha. Pleaseeee”</p><p>
  <em> How could I say no? </em>
</p><p>“One dance, and count your lucky stars. I never normally dance with the customers.”</p><p>“You know I’m not just another customer.” Rio piped back and led them to the floor. </p><p>The band was playing a gentle, lilting waltz. Couples were spinning around the room in perfect harmony.</p><p>“I don’t think you’re in a state to lead.” Agatha held her right hand high awaiting Rio’s. </p><p>“I love it when you take control.”</p><p>Rio placed her hand and moved her other to Agatha’s shoulder as she caught her boss rolling her eyes. </p><p>Their bodies were close. Agatha could feel the excessive warmth of Rio through her dress and bit her lip and closed her eyes for a second to settle her nerves. They were about the same height, but Agatha had on slightly higher heels as she had not expected to dance. So she looked down at Rio who was studying her with glassy, beautiful eyes. </p><p>“Try to keep up.”</p><p>Agatha used her left hand, which was sitting along Rio’s waist, to guide them through the practiced steps of a casual waltz. </p><p>They glided across the dance floor, swaying and rotating in perfect step with each other and the band. Their faces were so close, and Agatha could feel the slightest brush of Rio’s cheek each time they spun. </p><p>“You’re so pretty” Rio muttered the words quietly as if she hadn’t meant to speak them aloud, but Agatha could hear every word as if she had shouted it to the room. </p><p>“You’re drunk, bunny.” Agatha whispered back, smiling.</p><p>“That doesn’t make it less true.” Rio had the audacity to smirk. </p><p>“Tell me that in the morning and maybe I’ll believe you,” Agatha responded, “if you even remember this.” </p><p>She didn’t want to get her hopes up. It wouldn’t be the first time that a gorgeous woman had whispered sweet nothings in her ear at the club, only to go home to her husband and her normal life, forgetting it ever happened. </p><p>“I could never forget you.” Rio hummed along to the tune and showed off a genuine smile. Agatha melted at the sight. </p><p>The musicians played the final note of the song, and Agatha let go of Rio to her disappointment. </p><p>“I’m starvingggg.” Rio grabbed her stomach comically. “All this dancing - *<em> hiccup* </em> - has worked up my appetite.” </p><p>“Dancing, ha! I think it’s your stomach screaming for food to tame the liquor.” Agatha laughed. </p><p>She checked her watch, it was just past 1am. “Come on, I know a spot that will taste like heaven to you right now.”</p><p>They walked off the dance floor and stopped at the bar quickly. Agatha waved at Darcy, “I’m going to get her something to eat to try to sober her up. Hold down the fort for me, I’ll be back soon.”</p><p>She grabbed their coats and all but dragged Rio from the basement club and up the stairs.</p><p>“See you Alice!!” Rio waved enthusiastically at the door woman, who waved back and then looked at Agatha’s blushing face. </p><p>“Bye, Rio” She held in the laugh and waved at her boss. “Be safe you two!” </p><p>And they were out in the world again. The safe bubble of the speakeasy now below them and the cold night hit Agatha quickly. Rio was unphased, stumbling down the alley with a silly grin on her face. </p><p>“Where - you - going with me?” She got out her words with some effort. </p><p>“You’ll see.” Agatha grabbed her elbow and steadied Rio, leading her out to the main street. They walked a few blocks in comfortable silence. Rio was in her own drunken world, staring up at the sky in wonder. </p><p>Agatha pulled her into another back alley, and they approached a line of people, similarly dressed in their best glad rags. Other New Yorkers either just starting their own nights of debauchery or ending them. It didn’t take long and soon they were at the front of the line at a hole-in-the-wall shop. </p><p>“Two cheese slices, Frank. And a bottle of cola.” Agatha slid a quarter onto the counter. </p><p>“No problem, Mother. What are you doing out so early? Isn’t your place open tonight?” He started serving up the extra large slices of pizza.</p><p>“Yeah, just taking care of one of my rookies who had one too many.” She nodded at Rio who was pressed against the glass case, staring at the pizzas on display like they were precious diamonds.</p><p>“We’ve all been there!” He passed their slices over. “Don’t be a stranger, Agatha.” </p><p>“Thanks, Frank. See you!” </p><p>Agatha handed the pizza slice to Rio. “Eat!”</p><p>“Feed me.” She begged. </p><p>
  <em> I wish. </em>
</p><p>“Haha, very funny. Feed yourself.” Agatha took her own slice, lifted it up and attacked it from below as they walked back out to the street. </p><p>“MmmMMmmmM.” Rio took her first bite. </p><p>
  <em> Oh god, she’s moaning. Why did I think this was a good idea?  </em>
</p><p>“You like it?” Agatha looked over to see the look of ecstasy on Rio’s face. </p><p>“This is incredible. I want to eat this every day for the rest of my life.” Rio was already halfway through her pizza. She was relishing each bite like it was her first.</p><p>“Ohhhh, this cheese is unbelieveableeeee. MMMMMMmmmmmmmMMM” </p><p>
  <em> She needs to stop moaning. Right. Now. </em>
</p><p>“Frank makes the best slice in the neighborhood. Now finish up and drink your soda, I’ve got to get you home.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened like she had just woken up from a dream. “Oh no. Oh noooo.”</p><p>“What? What’s wrong??” Agatha’s mind raced, hoping Rio wasn’t hurt or about to spew. </p><p>“I can’t go home like, like, like this. My boyfriend will go nuts if I show up, uh - drunk! What am I going to do?” She quickly finished the pizza in hopes it might sober her up faster. </p><p>Agatha stopped walking for a second and took in the look of fear on Rio’s face. The way the joy of the night seemed to drain from her face at the cold sting of reality. </p><p><em> This might be a bad idea but… </em> </p><p>“Why don’t you sleep it off at my place? I have a very comfortable couch.” She posed the question before she could think of the consequences. </p><p>“You sure? I don’t wanna be uhhh…bother.” </p><p>“It’s no bother at all. Alice and even Jen have spent many a night on my couch. I live just around the corner.” She headed toward her apartment. </p><p>She couldn’t sense her companion near her and turned around to see Rio fidgeting alone, stuck in place. “Are you coming?” </p><p>Rio couldn’t think straight. Between the copious amounts of alcohol flowing through her bloodstream, the huge slice of pizza now weighing down her stomach, and the intoxicatingly confusing feeling of Agatha’s presence, she felt like she was in a washing bucket being cranked around like laundry.   </p><p>She threw her hands up in defeat, simply unable to think it through coherently. </p><p>“Wait for me!” She ran ahead to catch up. </p><p>Wherever Agatha would go, she would be sure to follow.</p>

  <span>Rio trailed behind Agatha down the dark street until they approached a large, all-white, seven-story stone building.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good evening Ms. Agatha.” A doorman tipped his hat as they approached and held the front door open.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Evening, Carl. Thank you.” Agatha breezed by and motioned Rio inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ohhh, so you’re rich rich.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced back at the doorman and marveled at the lobby area of the building. The ceiling was arched throughout and white to match the exterior. Subtle hexagonal black tiles dotted the floor and cozy seating areas occupied the corners of the sizable room. This was another world from the run-down tenements where Rio lived. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shhh, lower your voice.” Agatha blushed and kept them moving quickly towards a hallway to the left. She guided Rio with a light touch on her lower back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who else lives here?? Charlie Chaplin? Greta Garbo?” Rio’s eyes were wide at the opulence in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pushed the elevator button and stared blankly at Rio, “Really? Do you live under a rock? They wouldn’t be caught dead living in just an apartment.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“WOW! You have an elevator inside your building?” Rio’s mouth nearly fell open, she thought back to the five flights of stairs she had to climb every single day to get home.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The doors opened and the elevator attendant opened the metal grate. “Good evening, Ms. Harkness and…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio!” She exclaimed without a care in the world. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, Raymond. Excuse her…enthusiasm. It’s been a night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Understood.” He nodded as the elevator kicked into gear. “Floor 3, madam. Have a good one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They exited to a large hallway, and Agatha walked immediately to the left to a small set of steps in the corner. She approached the door with a large #4 on the front and unlocked it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This way, my tiny dancer.” She motioned for her to enter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio walked up the stairs into a small foyer that opened into a large parlor. The floor was immaculate with dark-stained herringbone hardwood, which matched the tone of the wainscotting that lined every wall and reached halfway up to the ceiling. The upper walls were covered in an elegant white wallpaper with delicate buttercup yellow flowers in geometric patterns. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A large, ornate red oriental rug took up the majority of the space, and a stunning set of light pink velvet armchairs and sofa were arranged in front of a tiled fireplace with an imposing wood mantle. A large radio stood along the far wall by the window that was framed with draping velvet red curtains. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha kept walking into the room and passed through dark french doors into the dining room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Keep those legs moving, I’ll give you a spare pair of pajamas from my bedroom.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>From the dining room and through a small archway, they entered a tight hallway. Rio could see the small kitchen at the end, a bathroom on her left and a door to her right, which Agatha opened to reveal what looked to be the sole bedroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take a seat, let me just find these for you.” She opened one of two closet doors and opened some of the drawers beneath the hanging clothes. There were at least a dozen elegant gowns and several coats and jackets. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sat down gently on the double bed and tried to absorb the details of Agatha’s private space. She felt like she had been let in on a secret and wanted to know everything. The furniture matched the dark wood aesthetic of the rest of the apartment. It all looked well crafted and expensive from Rio’s point of view. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a dressing table with a large mirror opposite the bed, and Rio noticed the make up arranged along the top in precise rows. A jewelry box also occupied the table and had a dainty painting of a bouquet on top of it. Warm light emanated from the matching lamps on the bedside tables. Rio flicked her finger along the tassels hanging from the lampshade nearest to her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, finally, here they are.” Agatha grabbed something from her drawers and turned around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio jumped up from the bed and took the clothing with a hearty, “Thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She started to pull her arm out of her dress without thinking, and Agatha rushed over, “Whoa there eager beaver, you can change in the bathroom over there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, one second.” She stumbled across the hall to the bathroom and closed the door clumsily. The room started to spin as she faced the mirror. She tried to look at her reflection but it was like her vision wouldn’t cooperate anymore. The night’s transgressions were finally coming for their revenge. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What’s happening? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s mind was swirling, and she grabbed the sink to steady her balance.</span>
  <em>
    <span> I don’t…feel…good. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt her stomach lurch and dropped to her knees in front of the toilet next to her. She vomited and retched as she felt the sting in her throat from the toxic mix of strong liquor and stomach bile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, are you okay?” Agatha knocked on the door and opened before Rio could respond. “Oh my gosh.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her eyes widened as she took in the hunched figure on her bathroom floor. She moved immediately to kneel next to her and grabbed a towel to help wipe her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s okay, honey.” She rubbed her back gently. “It will pass.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have I been poisoned?” She heaved again, and Agatha stood quickly and ran to the kitchen. She returned with a glass of water. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here, drink this. It will help.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio downed the glass and slumped onto the floor. “Let me die here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hush now, you’ll be fine. Come on, let’s get you up. You just need to sleep it off.” Agatha reached for Rio’s arm and helped lift her to standing, despite Rio’s groans. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walked her to the living room and sat her down on the couch. She left to go grab a pillow and some spare blankets, and Rio was all but passed out when she returned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio?” She whispered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmmm?” Rio sleepily responded but didn’t open her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Better now that you’re here.” Rio’s words were barely a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips curved up and she helped lay her down gently on the couch and tucked her in with a blanket. She hoped she would be warm enough since she hadn’t even changed into the pajamas, but at this point, she wasn’t going to strip her down. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>In my dreams</span>
  </em>
  <span>. She smiled at the thought and looked at the sleeping figure in her home. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What am I going to do with you?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was already in a deep sleep, the alcohol acting like a dose of morphine that quickly knocked her out. Agatha stared at her for a moment and took in the gentle demeanor of her sleeping face. She was trying to reconcile the Rio she knew from the pharmacy - diligent, reserved, with a hint of bite to her humor, and the Rio who emerged with some coaxing from a bit of giggle water - fiery, sarcastic, uninhibited. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alcohol tends to enhance characteristics that lie dormant in a person, so Agatha pondered how the two sides of Rio worked together. </span>
  <em>
    <span>A puzzle for another day. </span>
  </em>
  <span>She thought while yawning. The clock above the fireplace read 2:45 am - time to turn in. </span>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>
  <span>The morning sun hit Rio in the face like a cold splash of water. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh?” She sat up and looked around. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This isn’t my room. Wait, this isn’t my house…</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She threw back the blankets and looked down. She was still wearing the dress from last night, and as she went to stand she flopped back down on the couch. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Arrrghhh, why does my head feel like it’s full of cement??</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The pounding in her head reminded her of the booming bass drum from last night. Dancing, twirling, Agatha’s eyes on her, Agatha’s arms around her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grasped her temples and tried to soothe the tension. Her mouth tasted something awful, yet even in the misery of her current state, she remembered the joy and freedom she had felt for the first time in a long time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good morning, sunshine.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha entered the parlor wearing a two-piece silk pajama set and a black quilted coolie coat with intricate green and purple floral designs on the front and back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do you look so chipper?” Rio rubbed her eyes and smeared the makeup that still sat on them. She groaned as she looked down on the black mess on her hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m an early riser, and I know how to hold my booze.” Agatha replied. She placed a glass of water and two aspirin in front of Rio. “Here, this might help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks,” Rio took the pills and fell back against the couch. “What time is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just after 8am. So you really haven’t slept long.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“8am! Oh no, I need to get back now.” Rio rose and faltered on her feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha grabbed her elbow to keep from keeling over. “I don’t know if that’s such a good idea. I hate to say it, but you look worse for wear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, my boyfriend is probably going crazy wondering where I am. I may have failed to mention where I was going last night.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio walked to the bathroom briskly and started to wash her face as best as she could. She hoped that Tony was still sleeping and had also had a late night last night. Maybe he wouldn’t have even noticed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you need to borrow a dress? I probably have a spare that would fit.” Agatha offered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s okay. You’ve done so much for me already. I just need to get going. Thanks for the night, it was amazing. Really. You’re amazing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry.” Agatha leaned against the bathroom door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For what?” Rio wiped her face with a towel and rinsed her mouth out with water. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should have kept a closer eye on you. I shouldn’t have let Darcy give you those drinks, none of this would have happened.” She stared at the floor, unable to look Rio in the eye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t start with those horsefeathers. I don’t regret a single second.” Rio stood next to her boss and placed a hand on her shoulder. “Well, I could have done without the vomit, but everything else…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed, “Go on then. Will I see you at the shop on Monday?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unless this headache bumps me off!” Rio grabbed her purse, shrugged on her coat, and exited the apartment. When she reached the street, she had to get her bearings, she wasn’t really sure where she was or how she got here.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She started walking west for a while until she reached an intersection and saw a familiar corner store and realised she was just around the corner from work. She set off quickly back to her apartment and made it back in record time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she climbed the steps, she heard the yelling by the time she reached the second floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh no. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She steeled herself as she trekked towards the rising aggression. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where the </span>
  <b>fuck</b>
  <span> is she, Claudia?” Rio heard his voice as she unlocked the front door. “She ain’t here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walked in and saw Tony pacing in the kitchen and Claudia seated in the dining room. Miguel must have gone to work a weekend shift. They both turned as the door opened. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look, there she is. Now you can finally calm down.” Claudia gestured to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Calm down? Don’t start that. How could I be calm when mi novia is out all night and comes strolling in dressed like some…some streetwalker?!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s head was still banging. She closed her eyes to try to transport herself back to the quiet of Agatha’s apartment. The warm feeling of her presence and space enveloping her in protection. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“RIO! Where were you?” Tony stomped over to her and grabbed her bag and threw it to the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tony, give me a second.” She took a moment and opened her eyes to see the man she once loved so dangerously close that she took a small step back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been waiting all morning. I woke up, and you weren’t there. No note, no nothing, so I think I’m due an explanation.” His breath was shaggy, his frustration pouring out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I…I went out with…” All of her lies were getting tangled. He still didn’t even know she had a job. She couldn’t say she was with her boss. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She was out with Dorothy and Marie from downstairs. They asked me and Rio if we wanted to go to a new ballroom in the Bronx, but I wasn’t feeling well yesterday, so I pushed Rio to go alone.” Claudia cut in trying to cut the tension. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I just went out dancing. And then one of the other girls we were with got really sick. I went to her apartment in Harlem to take care of her because everyone else had to leave. And I certainly have enough experience caring for a drunk.” Rio moved to step around him towards the living room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He caught her around the upper arm and dug his nails in hard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ow, Tony! What are you doing?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re lying.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He increased the pressure and saw the look of fear flash across her face. “Where did you get that dress? I’ve never seen it before.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Claudia moved to stand and pushed the dining chair back. “Let her go!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you using my money to buy frivolous shit for yourself? I’m slaving away every single day, busting my balls to earn money for us, and you waste it to look like a common tramp!” He pulled her close, hand still firmly wrapped around her arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took a deep inhale through his nose. “Have you been drinking, too? Are you fucking kidding?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No! I swear.” Tears started to pour from Rio’s eyes. Her stomach churned from both hunger and sickness, and she tried hard to remain present despite the haziness in her brain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“STOP LYING! You think I don’t know the scent of hooch on someone’s breath?” He spun her and pushed her body with his full strength. All his anger exploded into a final thrust.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio remembered reading about Amelia Earhart a few years ago in the paper and being so taken by the idea of a woman aviator. The thought that humans could really fly through the sky was mind boggling. She would imagine what it felt like to soar through the clouds and leave the Earth behind. It must feel so freeing, so heavenly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t think the first time that she flew, it would be in her own living room, propelled by the enraged hands of her partner. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her body hurled through the air with a sickening grace, arms and legs shockingly still. It was like her limbs hadn’t caught up to what was happening. Her left arm cracked on the corner of their wooden coffee table and her face collided with the solid oak arm of their sofa. It was such a small space that contact was inevitable. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio!” Claudia ran towards her in a flash - the sound of the dining chair falling behind her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony stared at the scene like he hadn't just caused it. His eyes were wide and crazed, still pumping with anger. As Rio failed to move, the weight of his action finally dropped on him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio?” He sputtered, voice shaky, lungs heaving. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hadn’t lost consciousness, but the pain was pushing her to the very limit. She tried to spin her body but her arm wasn’t working properly, and she tasted blood in her mouth. She must have bit down on her lip at the collision. Her headache was now a full migraine, a relentless pressure expanding from within her skull. She tried opening her eyes and saw Tony make a small move towards her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get out of here, you nonstop sociopath! Leave us, cabrón!” Claudia screamed at him, her throat raw as she tried to tend to the moaning figure on the ground. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He exited with nothing but the sound of a slamming door, and they could hear the heavy steps pounding down the stairwell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio thought of the way Agatha had rubbed her back when she was on the bathroom floor last night. How she had soothed her softly, the feel of her hands, the scent of her perfume. It brought her momentary comfort. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, doll. Can I get you onto the couch?” Claudia softly spoke to her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I think so.” She eased her legs up slowly. Luckily they seemed mostly unharmed, her arm seemed to take most of the impact. It was already swollen, and she clenched her teeth as she eased onto the sofa. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh no, your face.” Claudia reached out and traced her cheek with a whisper of her fingers. Rio could feel her cheek and eye radiating warmth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I never thought I’d regret the wood-framed furniture…until now.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Claudia swatted her shoulder, “How could you joke at a time like this?” She sniffled and wiped her tears on the back of her sleeve. She pulled out a handkerchief and wiped the tears and blood from Rio’s face also. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry for dragging you into this, Clauds. You didn’t need to see this.” Rio started. “I…shouldn’t have lied to him, I shouldn’t have gone out last night.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, don’t blame yourself. Never blame yourself for this. He is responsible and that’s that. You don’t deserve to be a punching bag to some man who gets sore the second you have an independent thought.” She fretted over Rio’s arm, unsure how to help. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me see if any of the neighbors have ice in their icebox. I think we need to put something on this. It’s not looking so hot. Wait here.” She stood and ran out the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned her head back and regretted the motion. Her head was an all-consuming cacophony of pain. She tried to lift her left arm, but immediately yelped as she saw her fingers tremble and felt the flare of ache shoot through her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In less than 5 minutes, Claudia swung the door open holding a dish towel wrapped around ice. “Here, hold this to your arm.” She handed it over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The relief was welcome but only dulled the pain. Rio hissed when it made contact with her skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I need to take you to the doctor. That arm looks bad, Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No! What would I tell them?” Rio always hated the doctor. She hated feeling poked and prodded, and they never listened to what she had to say. She didn’t want to deal with the way they would pretend to care when she explained what happened. “I’ll rest today, and I’m sure it’ll be fine by this evening.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know…” Claudia nervously eyed the injury but didn’t want to push. “If it’s not better by tomorrow, we’re going, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine.” Rio nodded. “Thank you, amiga. I mean it, I don’t know what I would have done if you hadn’t been here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t mention it.” Claudia turned on the radio and flipped through a magazine that had fallen on the floor. They sat in silence and listened to the weekend programming to zone out. Soon, Rio’s eyes drooped and the tiredness from the past 24 hours finally settled her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She woke up a few hours later in a daze to the smell of soup cooking on the stove. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hungry for lunch?” I’m just heating up some Campbell’s chicken noodle.” Claudia called over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Starving.” Rio tried to pipe up, though her voice felt a bit rough and still burned from last night. She wasn’t sure when she had fallen asleep again. The entire morning had been a shit show. The angle of the shadows in the room told her it was mid-day, lunch time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She stood and shuffled to the dining table and sat down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ay bendito, your eye!” Claudia’s eyes went wide when she approached with the two bowls of soup. She saw the burgeoning, extensive purple bruise that had made a home across Rio’s left eye and cheek. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How bad?” Rio winced at the thought. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know how you’re going to go out for a while.” Claudia passed a bowl over and started tucking in to her own. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio lowered her head to the table next to her bowl. “How am I going to go to work like this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No way, you can’t!” She scoffed at the idea, pointing her spoon in Rio’s direction. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re going to have to take tomorrow off at minimum. They’re going to ask a lot of questions that I don’t think you want to answer.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed and raised her head again as her stomach rumbled. She ate the soup slowly while trying to think of yet another lie to explain this latest drama</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sooooo….” Claudia stared down into her bowl like she was trying to read tea leaves. “What are we going to do when that man of yours comes back?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio raised her bowl with her good arm and drank the last of her soup. She hadn’t realized how hungry she was and remembered with a smile that her last meal was that incredible slice of pizza at 1am. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know…” She looked down at the angry swelling on her arm and tears formed in her eyes. </span>
  <em>
    <span>How did I let this happen again?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve got a friend at work - she lives in a women’s boarding house. They might have a spare room..” Claudia approached the topic carefully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But - I came to America to be with Tony. I can’t just - I can’t just leave him. I don't have anyone else.” Rio felt the tears fall and watched them splash in the remnants of the bowl. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio.” Claudia stared at her with soft eyes. She reached over and took her hand. “He’s not safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I hadn’t -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Claudia jumped in to cut her off, “No, don’t do that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But, I shouldn’t ha-” She tried again, desperate. She wiped her running nose and went to wipe her tears then winced at the pain on the side of her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t matter what you lied about. He threw you across the room like it was nothing, like </span>
  <b>you</b>
  <span> were nothing. Nobody deserves that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tenderly stroked her swollen arm, deep in thought. “I have some money that I’ve stashed away, but it’s not nearly enough to support myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can loan you some. Whatever you need to secure a place, I know you’ll pay me back.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I couldn’t take your dough. I’ll ask the boss if I can work nights or more shifts.” Rio thought back to Agatha’s offer to help in the club. If her apartment was anything to go by, the money from the speakeasy was better than good. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Offer stands anyway. You know I’m here for you.” She clasped her hand and then rose to wash the dishes. Rio nodded and passed over her bowl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She went to lay down in bed and take another nap. It felt like she was deep in sleep debt and was trying to make up the deficit. As she drifted in and out of dreams, she would recall bits and pieces of her night out with Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The way she had looked at her when she was dancing. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh gosh, that look. </span>
  </em>
  <span>She felt herself flush but wasn’t sure if that was from the memory or the heat of the swelling. She thought of Agatha’s warm apartment - impeccably decorated and effortlessly put together just like her. How she had welcomed her in like she was an old friend. How she had cared for her when she had no obligation to. It made Rio’s insides feel soft and she smiled to herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I need to make it up to her somehow</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She must have drifted off again because when she woke up it was dark. The bed was empty next to her, thankfully. Tony must have found somewhere else to go for the night. She pulled the blankets up and felt at peace enough to go back to sleep again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the morning, she woke to shooting pain in her arm. At first she thought she had just slept on it and made it numb, but she looked down at the dark blue coloring now splotching across the surface of her forearm and cringed. She entered the bathroom off the living room and almost jumped at the sight of her reflection. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The red swelling on her face had given birth to a similar color scheme to her arm. The purple and blue painted a canvas of pain across her cheek, under and over her eye, and down her jaw. She looked like she had been walloped by a champion boxer or barrelled over by a Model T.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She heard Claudia outside the bathroom, “How are you doing, Rio? I’ve got to head off to work, are you alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew if she opened the door that Claudia would take one look at her face and force her to go to the doctor, so she turned on the bath faucet and called out, “I’m okay! I feel better than yesterday anyway. I’m not going to work, don’t worry. I’ll see you when you get back tonight!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sure?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio could feel Claudia debating whether to open the door or not. There was a long pause. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, claro que sí. Go on before you’re late.” She kept her voice calm and even. Then heard her roommate walk out the door, and she was alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She lowered herself into the bath and relished in the water. It was a welcome reprieve from the pain, but she worried about what to do about work. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I can’t go to the shop like this, they’ll never understand. What would Lilia say? What would Agatha think? Should I call to tell them I’m not coming? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wait, I don’t know the shop phone number! </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m sure it's fine, they’ll probably think I’m sick or something. Agatha was there when I threw up. </span>
  </em>

  <p>After Rio had left her home, Agatha made herself some toast and slathered on a bit of Lilia’s homemade raspberry jam. She flipped through the paper carelessly skimming the daily news. </p><blockquote>
  <p>

  </p>
</blockquote><p>“Oh, now you come out?” She mused and lifted her eyes from the paper. </p><p>A small black cat stepped into the dining room and leaped onto the dining table. Its brilliant yellow eyes were trained on the leftover crust on the plate.</p><p>“Where were you hiding, kitty? How come you didn’t want to meet mama’s new friend?” She scratched the cat’s head playfully.</p><p>“Were you under the bed?” Agatha picked up her cat, Ebony, and stroked her in her lap, enjoying the comfort of her beloved pet. </p><p>“You missed out. Rio is…” <em> What is Rio? Or more importantly, what is Rio to me?  </em></p><p>She contemplated her connection to this woman who brought out something new in Agatha. There had been others, sure. Other women who caught her eye from behind the bar or on her nights out at other joints around town. Even one or two that had made their way back to this very apartment for something more. </p><p>She was no spring chicken in this department, but Rio was different. </p><p>“Rio is special.” She settled on the descriptor though it lacked the magic she hoped to convey. </p><p>The way she struggled to breathe around her, and how she lived indefinitely in her thoughts was different. She had loved her husband but it had been a love of obligation. As she stroked Ebony, her mind wandered back in time. </p><p>When she was young, there were no other options. Back home in Boston, there was no other road to take. So Ralph had been fine, good even. A nice, gentle young man who had pursued her endlessly at church. Her mother had approved, pushed her to be with him and that was that. It was an escape from the far-reaching grasp of her mother’s home, and she thought she could imagine a life with him.</p><p>They were married before she even turned 20, just before the turn of the century, and a few years later they moved to New York as Ralph got a job constructing what would become the subway. He worked long hours, which left Agatha to her own devices to explore her new city. For all that she felt she lacked in love for her husband, she felt in spades for the hustle and bustle of the urban metropolis that surrounded her. </p><p>She loved Ralph like she loved fresh laundry or a home-cooked meal. It was pleasing, nice, familiar. But the streets of New York were passionate, dangerous, unpredictable. It fed the part of her soul that yearned for more. The escape from her miserable childhood and monotonous everyday life. </p><p>They had tried for children, as was expected, but nature’s cruelty afflicted them and no child was to be. The doctor’s couldn’t pinpoint a reason, just a callous, “sometimes it doesn’t happen.” </p><p>Lilia had been another saving grace. The pharmacy attendant who saw her every other week and spoke to her with kindness and interest. When she offered a job to Agatha in 1909, she jumped at the chance - a new distraction from her mundane home life. And she was good at it, exceptional really. She found that she could charm even the most ornery customer with a wink and grin, could manipulate cruel men with her gaze, could conjure delicious creations from any ingredients.</p><p>And so her life went. She built a community at the pharmacy and had a friendly circle with her neighbors and the wives of Ralph’s coworkers. She was content and enjoyed nights out at the dance hall, catching shows on Broadway, and indulging in restaurants in Manhattan. It wasn’t electrifying or dramatic, but it was stable and agreeable.</p><p>Everything was fine until President Wilson declared war on Germany and threw the US into the Great War in 1917. Agatha thought it wouldn’t affect her, Ralph was already 38 by this point and the draft age topped out at 30. She watched the young men around her disappear quickly, the city losing its vitality with every draft card that went out. Then, a year later, the age range expanded to 45. By the end of the summer of 1918, he was shipped off across the sea to aid the Allied forces. </p><p>“We regret to inform you that your husband, Private Ralph Boehner, died on September 21, 1918 of pneumonia complications from the influenza pandemic.”</p><p>Roughly half of the US soldiers who served in Europe died from the flu, not from combat, and when Agatha received the blunt telegram outlining Ralph’s death, she was both grateful that he did not die in agony and maddened that it all could have been avoided if he hadn’t been drafted in the first place. She was alone; she was free. </p><p>Three months later Congress would ratify the 18th amendment, prohibiting the production, transportation, and sale of alcohol, and her life would change once more. Lilia had been cleaning up the basement space for years, so when she proposed they revitalise it into a fully operational bar and club, Agatha saw it as the perfect distraction and opportunity. They spent a year renovating the space with the help of a handy team of neighborhood kids like Billy who had nothing better to do and retired pharmacy customers who would do anything Agatha asked just to spend more time with her. </p><p>When the hammer fell in January 1920 and Prohibition went into full effect, The Hidden Gate was open and waiting for the thirsty customers who needed their fix, and Agatha was behind the bar, ready to give it to them. </p><p>Looking down at Ebony’s purring face, she wished for a second that she could experience the pure empty bliss of her cat’s life instead of the complicated web of her own. </p><p>She set the cat on the floor and walked to the kitchen to clean up her breakfast. She walked into the living room and folded up the blanket from the couch. She could smell the subtle hint of Rio’s perfume still lingering on the fabric, spicy-sweet with notes of bergamot and soft floral bouquets. She lifted the blanket up to her nose and inhaled deeply. </p><p>It reminded her of their waltz together on the dance floor and the close proximity they shared. The feel of Rio’s body so close, her face just a slight turn away. She hoped Rio still remembered the good moments they had and not just the sickness and inevitable hangover. </p><p>After taking care of the house, she headed out to run a few errands before another night at the bar. When she arrived at 9pm and descended the stairs, she heard Jen already hard at work in the back room. She walked over and entered the room.</p><p>“Well, hello there stranger. Where did you disappear to last night?” Jen asked as she poured the buckets of corn into the mash pot. </p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched but she held back the smile, “Oh you know, just looking out for my fabulous staff.” </p><p>Jen laughed loudly, “Ha! Yeah, it seemed like you were very intently looking after one employee in particular.” </p><p>“Careful, Jen.” Agatha warned and watched her turn on the boiler to heat the pot. </p><p>“I call it like I see it, boss.” She raised her hands to the sky. “You’re dizzy with that dame, aren’t you?”</p><p>“I’m hot. Is it hot in here?” Agatha grabbed the collar of her dress and pulled to try to get some air. </p><p>“Don’t try to claw your way out of this one, come on tell me everything.” Jen cranked the heat as the water boiled, and she stirred the corn mash mixture. </p><p>“What? Rio interests me, that’s all. She’s interesting!” Agatha fanned herself, unsure if it was the heat of the room or the heat from thoughts of Rio. </p><p>“Yeah, I’m interesting but you don’t look at me like I’m a slice of fresh, decadent cheesecake. Like you want to eat me and lick up every single crumb with your tongue.” </p><p>Agatha blushed a deep red at that, “Oh my god! Jen!” </p><p>“I don’t judge! Given the proclivities of our customers, how could I? But, be careful with Rio, Agatha. She’s got a boyfriend from what I hear from Lilia, and I don’t know if she’s part of ‘the scene’, you know?” She flicked off the flame and started cooling down the product before adding in the malted barley. </p><p>The temperature in the room finally started to drop and Agatha welcomed the change. “I haven’t even done anything yet!”</p><p>Jen looked at Agatha with a no-bullshit glance. “Mother, we all saw you two traipsing around the hall yesterday. You two were waltzing like you had been dance partners for decades. That wasn’t just an innocent pair of acquaintances. You looked happy, really happy. You both did.” </p><p>Agatha flashed all her teeth in a wide and contagious smile, her eyes crinkling, “Really, you think?”</p><p>“You’d have to blind to miss the fireworks sparking when you look at each other, it’s almost sickening.” Jen finished stirring the mix and added the yeast. She got up to get the fermentation barrel and started readying the mixture for its next stage. </p><p>“Alright, alright. I’ll let you finish here. I’ve got to get the front set up anyway.” Agatha made for the exit, eager to escape the heat, both from the room and her nosy friend. </p><p>“Is Rio coming tonight?” Jen asked before she could leave. </p><p>“You didn’t hear? Darcy was slipping her cocktails all night, and she even did a shot of your special elixir! So she was well corked. I’d be shocked if she could even get up this morning.” She decided to keep it close to the chest that Rio had stayed at her place last night. </p><p>“Hot damn! Hope she’s alright, poor doll. What a first night. Guess I won’t have to worry about accidently walking in on you two necking in some back room tonight then.” </p><p>“You’re evil.” Agatha muttered before walking out finally.</p><p>“You love it!” Jen called behind her. </p><p>The club opened at the usual time and the guests arrived looking for their hit of booze and good times. Agatha worked the bar and kept the drinks coming quick and strong. A local jazz quartet with an up-and-coming star trumpeter was scheduled to go on at midnight.</p><p>“I heard that I missed out on quite the show last night.” Billy rounded the bar and donned his apron. </p><p>Agatha barely paused from shaking the cocktail in her hand, “And where did you hear that?”</p><p>“Everyone’s talking about it! People keep coming up to me and asking if I know who the mystery dancer is. A brunette, new, total knockout, legs for days, queen of the dance floor.”</p><p>Billy looked to the boss for answers and saw her avert her eyes and grin. “Agatha?” He asked cautiously. “Who was it?”</p><p>“Well - you know how I invited Rio to the club last night…” She shrugged bashfully. </p><p>“No way!” </p><p>“Blame Darcy. She had the grand idea to pour her one too many cocktails, and how was I meant to know that Rio was a dancing dynamo once she got a bit of liquid courage?”</p><p>“I can’t believe I missed it!” Billy pounded his fist on the bartop.</p><p>Agatha finished off the drink she was making when two regulars sat down at the bar. “Hey Dottie, Hi Beth. What can I get you two?</p><p>Dottie leaned onto the bar, “You can get me the phone number of that lady dancer from yesterday!”</p><p>Agatha tried to keep her face neutral, “Couldn’t tell you, doll.”</p><p>“Don’t play coy with me! I saw you dance with her, and <b>everyone </b>knows that Mother never dances with no one.” Dottie wagged a finger.</p><p>Agatha bit her tongue but relented slightly, “Nobody has ever stopped the entire dance floor with their moves before. How could I resist?” </p><p>“What’s her name? At least give us that.” </p><p>“Sorry, my lips are sealed. I’m sure she’ll be back another night, ask her yourself.” Agatha turned around to grab another bottle of booze. </p><p>“You’re no fun! Well, I’m patient. I’ll be first in line to shake a leg with her the next time she shows her face here.” Dottie got up and pulled her friend away. </p><p>Billy looked up from concentrating on his task, “See, I told you. She is the talk of the town.” </p><p>Agatha groaned. Of course, the one woman who finally held her attention was also the hottest commodity uptown. It was still early in the night, she braced for the incoming questions and tried to tap down her growing jealousy. </p><p>“Mother, what’s the low down on that dancer?”</p><p>“Agatha! You must tell me where to find that brunette flapper. I’ll show her a night out that she won’t soon forget.”</p><p>“Is she single?”</p><p>“She’s one of us, right? Would she give me a shout?”</p><p>“Mother, mother! Can you give my phone number to that new girl? Pleaseeeee.”</p><p>She was reminded of Rio on her first day manning the soda fountain alone, but there was nobody coming to save her. The questions and pestering continued up until last call when Agatha finally shooed the stragglers back up the stairs. </p><p>“I can’t wait to ask Rio about this tomorrow.” Billy was brimming with excitement. “She’s famous!”</p><p>The next day at 10am, Agatha finally rolled into the pharmacy. She walked in from the back and hung up her coat and bag. She opened the door to the main shop and looked around expectantly. She saw Lilia at the register near the front door and Billy was prepping the soda fountain. </p><p>“Lilia, where’s Rio?” Her heels clicked as she crossed the floor in her confident stride. </p><p>“No show. Very unlike her.” Lilia replied. </p><p>Agatha furrowed her brow, “Did she call or send a telegram?”</p><p>“Nothing. You didn’t scare her off, did you? She was a great worker.”</p><p>Agatha thought back and remembered how sick she was, “She wasn’t feeling too good after her night out. Maybe she is still under the weather.”</p><p>“Hope the poor dear is okay.” </p><p>“Do you have her number? I can give her a ring on the blower.” Agatha was trying not to sound too eager. </p><p>“She never gave us one. Not sure her address either. I only know she lives in Washington Heights with her boyfriend. Emphasis on the word boyfriend.” Lilia eyed her boss carefully. </p><p>“I know. Can’t I worry about my employee? I just wanted to check on her.” Agatha tapped her fingers on the counter while deep in thought, but short of knocking on every door in the neighborhood (which was crazy, right?), she would just have to wait. </p><p>Lilia shook her head, “Be careful. I’ll let you know if she shows up.” </p><p>Agatha waved to Billy and went out back to the club. They were closed Mondays and Tuesdays to give the staff a break and to allow Jen time to prep and make enough moonshine. They supplemented their homebrew with a network of suppliers from Lilia’s contacts. Whiskey flowed up from the South, while rum poured in from the North. Despite the laws, the people demanded their liquor and there were still plenty of ways to get it.</p><p>Supply chains were constantly under threat, so they had to be on high alert and ready to change suppliers on a dime. In times of dire need, their designation as a pharmacy allowed them to exploit a handy loophole and get an exemption for medical-grade whiskey, but the taste was something awful. </p><p>The mob controlled most of the smuggling into and out of the city, so Agatha had to be extra careful about who she trusted. Most speakeasy owners were men, specifically men of a certain upper class who catered to the wealthy of Gotham, so she was also at a disadvantage there. While the police might look the other way for the aristocrats and high rollers, they wouldn’t hesitate to bust and arrest a single woman and her loyal gang of degenerate homosexuals. </p><p>She helped Jen prepare the latest batch to get her mind off Rio, but the worry was growing with every minute. She hoped that Rio wasn’t mad at her, that she hadn’t scared her off like Lilia had suggested. Hopefully it was just a lingering hangover and not something worse like rot gut or alcohol poisoning. </p><p>
  <em> She didn’t have that much, did she? No, it was just a few drinks. She hadn’t been drunk before. She’ll sleep it off. She’ll be back as good as new tomorrow. Calm down! </em>
</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you this quiet…ever?” Jen looked at Agatha with a curious gaze. </p><p>“Huh?” She turned, snapped out of her anxiety spiral. </p><p>“Wow, something has got your all turned about. I’ve known you for how many years? And you’ve never been so flummoxed. I think you should go home before you hurt yourself or more importantly, the alcohol. This process isn’t forgiving for the distracted.” </p><p>Agatha paused and realized she hadn’t been paying much attention. “Yeah, maybe you’re right.”</p><p>Jen gasped, “Now I know something is off. You would never admit that I’m right about anything!”</p><p>“Very funny, Jen. I think I’m just distracted. I’ll see you tomorrow.” She shook her head and took off. She grabbed her coat from the shop and peeked in quickly as they were busy with customers. No sign of Rio still. </p><p><em> It’s fine. She’s fine. </em>She tried to reassure herself and headed home to relax. </p><hr /><p>Rio was restless at home all day. Where she used to be perfectly happy at home, now she felt bored and useless. She busied herself with chores as best she could but her bum arm burned when she tried to use it. She tried reading some of the forgotten novels that she had purchased months ago but her mind drifted to the pharmacy. <em> What were they doing now? How was Billy handling things? Did they miss her? How was Agatha? </em></p><p>Her anxiety jumped every time she heard someone climbing the stairs in the building. Tony still hadn’t come home, and she knew it was only a matter of time. He was meant to be at work today also but all his clothes were here. </p><p>The sun started to set and the front door opened. Miguel and Claudia walked in together and greeted Rio, who was laying on the couch. </p><p>“Evening, Rio - oh my gosh!” Claudia dropped her bag straight on the floor and scrambled to kneel next to the couch. She reached out to swipe Rio’s hair from her face. </p><p>“Rio…this looks bad. How’s your arm?” She slowly pulled away the blanket covering her and gasped, covering her mouth. </p><p>She turned quickly to Miguel, “Papi, go next door and get a pail of ice from the Rivera’s. Ándale!” </p><p>He took off out the door and Rio started, “Claudia, it’s okay. Don’t fuss over me.”</p><p>“No, Rio, this isn’t just some scratch…” </p><p>“I know.” She flopped her head back on the throw pillow she had been laying on. </p><p>Miguel flew through the door holding the bucket of ice. He passed it to Claudia and tried not to stare at the broken figure before him. </p><p>“Gracias,” She said. “Now go get the stuff you’re meant to.” She nodded to Rio’s room. </p><p>“What stuff?” Rio questioned, trying to sit up straight but Claudia’s hand stopped her.</p><p>“He spoke with his friend Melvin, who works at the docks. Tony needs some clothes and his wallet. He’s staying with a friend for a few days, so Miguel said he could grab whatever he needed.”</p><p>Rio sighed in relief. At least she wouldn’t have to face that demon tonight. </p><p>“You need to go to the doctor tomorrow. No fighting me on this, I’m serious.” Claudia looked at her with stern glare. </p><p>“Okay, I will.” Rio relented. “Thanks, Claudia. Even if you’re a pain in the ass sometimes.” </p><p>“Just for you.” She laughed. “Put this ice on your arm, and go to bed!”</p><p>The next morning Rio was up with the sun and got dressed quickly before her roommates woke up. She was out the door by 6:30am to avoid any further questioning and prying. She walked the familiar pathway to the pharmacy. </p><p>Rio needed a doctor but didn’t know where to go. She hadn’t been to see one since moving to this country and figured Lilia would know what to do. She knew several doctors swung by the shop to pick up various medicines, surely one of them was trustworthy and affordable. </p><p>The door was locked when she tried it. Glancing at her watch it was still 30 minutes until opening at 7:30am, but Lilia normally got in early. She put her hands on the glass and looked into the dark store. She knocked and saw a head of grey curls pop around from the back room. Lilia walked over and unlocked the door. </p><p>“We’re closed, come back in -” Her next words were cut off as she took in the sight of Rio. Her eyes swept over the bruises that splattered her face and Rio could hear her sharp intake of breath.</p><p>“Rio.” Her voice betrayed her shock. “What happened?” She put an arm around her and shuffled her inside and shut the door. </p><p>“It was an accident. I think it looks worse than it is.” Rio was quiet as Lilia put both hands on the sides of her jaw and inspected her face. Her quiet gaze made Rio rock on her heels uncomfortably.</p><p>“Why are you here?” She hurried behind the counter to the tinctures and pulled out a small jar from the cabinet. </p><p>“I need to see a doctor, but I don’t know any. I thought - I thought you might know one.” She watched Lilia pull over one of the counter stools and gesture for her to sit. She sat down and glanced at the jar labeled “arnica treatment” in Lilia’s hands. </p><p>“Yes, I can take you to my own doctor. He is usually free in the morning. Just sit still for a second.” She applied a bit of the arnica to Rio’s face. “This will help reduce the bruising.”</p><p>“What will I tell the doctor exactly?” Lilia capped the jar and gave her knowing look to Rio, trying to broach the topic with ease.</p><p>“I fell down the stairs.” Rio said softly, her voice tinged with tears. </p><p>“And did these stairs have two fists?”</p><p>“No, it wasn’t like that.” She tried to hide the panic. “It was - It was a mistake.”</p><p>“Rio -” She started, “this is a fiction you told yourself and tell yourself still. Is this the first time?”</p><p>Rio remembered the slap, the very thing that drove her to this job. She shook her head. </p><p>“Are you hurt anywhere else?” Lilia looked her up and down, searching for clues. </p><p>“My arm.”</p><p>“Can I see?” </p><p>Rio painfully removed her coat and lifted her arm with effort. Lilia’s eyes widened, and she touched the bruising carefully, taking in the damage with her perceptive look. </p><p>“This isn’t good. Have you put any salves or ointments on it?”</p><p>“Just some ice.”</p><p>“Let’s go.” She helped Rio back into her coat and grabbed her own purse, then locked the door. She walked at a brisk pace, and Rio had to hustle to keep up. </p><p>They made it a few blocks then stopped outside a brick building with a health symbol on the door. Inside was a small waiting room with just a few chairs. There was nobody else seated. Lilia took a chair by the office door and Rio sat next to her. The office door opened and a tall, bald man wearing a head mirror and white coat walked out. </p><p>“Dr. Yensin” Lilia stood to greet him. </p><p>“Lilia? I wasn’t expecting you today. Was I?” He shook her hand. </p><p>“No, thankfully not this time. I have a friend, Rio, who needs some help.” She gestured to Rio, then whispered “Some domestic discord.” </p><p>He nodded and waved Rio to come into his office. She took a seat on the large leather chair in the center of the room. He sat on a small stool nearby. Lilia waited outside. </p><p>“Hello, Rio. Nice to meet you. How can I help?” He asked attentively. His kind eyes assessed her face with interest.</p><p>“I fell on my arm and face, and my arm is still extremely painful.” </p><p>“Let’s have a look.” </p><p>She showed him the injury, and he gently examined the arm. He rotated it slowly and tested her pain. He had her bend and move it in various ways, while writing down his observations in a small notebook. </p><p>“It doesn’t appear broken, but the bone is damaged. It is sprained. I’m going to put it in a splint to help it heal, so your arm will be immobile for at least two weeks.”</p><p>Rio huffed, <em> How am I going to keep up at work with just one arm? </em></p><p>She sat still while the doctor fitted wooden splints along her forearm and wrapped it in bandages and cloth strips to keep it steady. </p><p>“Try to keep it elevated while at rest, and come back in a week so that I can check on it. Okay?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“Okay, I’m sure Lilia can give you something for any pain you have. She is a magician with herbal medicine. And I’ll see you soon.” </p><p>Back at the pharmacy, Agatha was pacing again. She had arrived early expecting Lilia as usual but found the shop locked and the lights out. Luckily, she had her spare key in her bag. She saw that the register drawer was open and empty and one of the stools was out of place, so someone had been here this morning.</p><p>She got to work stocking some of the shelves until she heard the ding of the front door. She turned and her heart stopped. </p><p>
  <em> Rio. </em>
</p><p>She couldn’t see anything else. Her vision zoomed into one thing alone - the bruised and battered face coming through the door. </p><p>“What - What the hell?” She tore across the room like a tornado.</p><p>Her hands grabbed Rio’s shoulders for refuge, her eyes scouring every broken capillary, noting every swollen patch of skin. </p><p>Purple was always her favorite color, but seeing it dye the beautiful tanned skin on Rio’s face, she wanted to hurl or scream or both. Rio could hardly look her in the eye, the blank expression broke her heart even further. </p><p>She snapped at Lilia when Rio failed to respond, “How did this happen? Who is responsible?” Her tone exuded venom mixed with fear. </p><p>“Agatha, don’t forget yourself.” Lilia moved further inside and pulled Agatha away from clutching Rio. “Come with me. Rio, take a seat at the counter. We’ll just be a moment.”</p><p>She led them to the back room and closed the door. “She doesn’t need a mother right now. Don’t look at her like a broken baby bird.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop walking circles around the small room. “I just saw her the other night, Lilia. She was okay and now she walks in looking like - like that - and I…what…” She ran her hands through her long hair that was down today.</p><p>“She hasn’t told me, but I can guess.” Lilia offered. </p><p>“Is she in trouble?” </p><p>“Trouble in the home, from the looks of things.” </p><p>“I’ll kill him.” Agatha all but growled. Her anger was a volcano on the verge of eruption. “I swear to god, if I see that man…”</p><p>“Steady there, killer. I know I have a lot of sway with the fuzz, but I think a murder charge might be pushing it.” Lilia put a hand on her shoulder to stop her pacing.</p><p>“That’s not just a little slap. Look at her face!” She gestured wildly in exasperation. She was having trouble breathing normally or focusing on anything but the pain Rio must have felt. “She looks like she took on an entire gang and lost.” Agatha felt her voice start to tremble. </p><p>“I took her to the doc. He’s going to take care of her. There’s not much more we can do, you know the police don’t give two shits about ‘family problems.’”</p><p>Agatha sighed, feeling helpless. “Do you still have a spare bedroom?” </p><p>“Yes, my sister moved in with her husband three months ago.”</p><p>“Please, can you offer it to her? You know I would ask her to stay with me but I only have the one bed. Please.” She tried not to sound as desperate as she felt. She kneaded her hands to keep the tension at bay.</p><p>Lilia contemplated the request and saw the distress on her boss’ face. Agatha never asked for help, even when she was drowning in stress. She was fiercely independent to a fault. </p><p>“I’ll offer it, but I have a feeling Rio is as stubborn as you.”</p><p>“Thank you. Truly, thank you.” She felt her panic start to subside but the anger remained in her veins. She vowed to make this man pay, whatever the cost.</p><p>As Lilia reached for the door handle, Agatha spoke flatly, “Do you still have contact with Wanda?”</p><p>The older woman froze, “Agatha, no.”</p><p>“Just where I can find her. I’ll do the rest, you don’t have to be involved.”</p><p>Lilia turned slowly. “Are you sure you want to go down this road?” </p><p>They stood in silence, a quiet duel before Agatha spoke up, “Please.” </p><p>“It’s been a few years, but last I heard you could find her in Hell’s Kitchen. They own a hall across from Pier 88 - that’s all I know.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and Lilia lingered for a moment as if she were about to say more but decided against it. </p><p>She stayed seated for a moment at the table in the back and eavesdropped on the conversation out front. She heard Rio decline the offer to stay at Lilia’s (of course) with an excuse that she was fine, that she could handle it, that she just wanted to work. </p><p>Agatha rested her head down on the table. She kept seeing Rio’s broken face in her mind every time she closed her eyes. She needed to get the image from her brain. She needed to protect her. </p><p>Rio was trapped in a twisted spell by a raging man, now Agatha just needed to figure out how to break her out of it.</p>

  <p>
  <span>Rio got home from work at her usual time. She walked the usual way home, went up the stairs as usual, opened the door the usual way. What was unusual was the potent smell that smacked her in the face when she entered the apartment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>One of her favorite words for alcohol that Agatha had taught her was “devil’s candy” and it smelled like the devil had opened an entire confectionery in her home that day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She covered her nose with her good hand and stumbled backwards for a second. She scanned the room and saw Tony sitting at the dining table, glass in hand and six dark brown bottles on the table next to him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought you were staying with a friend.” Rio eyed him, keeping her voice flat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wherrrrre, have..where you have- you even been?” His words muddled out in a string of nonsense. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was out with some friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have no friends…no way. I kno-I know you not friends with no one.” He was pointing at her with his glass. The liquid sloshing as he moved it this way and that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re drunk….again” She stayed by the door, ready to make a quick exit. “It’s time to leave.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t tell me. You don’t get to…you can’t tell me what to do!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m done arguing with you. Just leave, por favor.” Rio was too tired for this. She tried to convey her request in her eyes, but he wasn’t even seeing anything right now - too lost in the bottle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This issss my house too. I was here </span>
  <b>first</b>
  <span>.” He spit the last word out like a slur. He got up and swayed his way to the bedroom. Rio watched with hesitation before following him at a distance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She entered the room and saw her cigar box on the bed, empty of its contents. She stared at it in disbelief. The room was trashed. Her clothes strewn everywhere, her drawers all pulled out and dumped. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where’s my money?” Her voice was raw, all sense of decorum gone. “Tony, what have you done?!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ohhhh, your whore money? I knew." He shook a finger at her. "I knew you must have been working the…the streets. I knew you was getting cash somewhere. I just had to do some, uh, digging to find it.” He spun around and sat on the bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hadn’t counted it in a while but she knew there was close to $100 cash in that box. It was everything she had earned so far, her safety net, her way out. Gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t fight the tears forming in her eyes. She had abandoned her life in Puerto Rico for this man, given up everything she had known, arrived in an unknown city by herself, and this was the outcome? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How could you?” It was all she could muster. Where Tony defaulted to rage, Rio fell into sorrow just as easily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She couldn’t even listen for his attempt at a response. She got down on her knees and pulled her hard suitcase out from under the bed. It had been her sole companion on the long boat journey here, and it felt like greeting an old friend. With silent ferocity, she threw her clothing, her jewelry, her other pair of shoes, and her books into the case. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where you going? You can’t just…leave.” He stood and moved to grab her things. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t even dare.” She spat back at him and yanked the suitcase away, slamming it shut once his hand pulled back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, baby. We’re meant to be married! You’re gonna be my, my wife - mi esposa.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought that was going to be my life once. We’re done. You’ve ruined us.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This ain’t over ‘till I say it is!” Tony’s voice rose, cutting through his slurring timbre. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She swept her eyes over the bedroom with a final glance, ignoring the pathetic protestations coming her way. In the living room, she eased into her coat, careful of her splint, thankful that she hadn’t accumulated much, or any other belongings. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t look for me.” She hissed the words out like bullets, hoping they might penetrate his consciousness</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She faced Tony and uttered her last request. Before he could reply, she shut the door, literally, on this sad chapter of her story. She heard the shattering of glass as he must have thrown an empty bottle at the door, but it was no longer her mess to clean up. His yell echoed in the stairwell.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sun was setting, and she stood on the sidewalk outside the only home she had known in New York feeling both empowered and terrified. She considered heading back to the shop, but it would be closed by now. She knew the club was closed on Tuesdays as well. There was only one other address she considered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She desperately tried to remember the way to Agatha’s building. She had walked the route so quickly in the morning after her one stay there, so the details were hazy. She knew it was near work, but all the buildings blended together. She could remember the lobby well but the exterior was a mystery besides its stark white coloring. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her right arm ached from the weight of her suitcase as she rounded another block. Surely, she should have passed the building by now. She looked left and right down the tree-lined street, everything was unfamiliar. Finally, she turned the corner on the next block and saw the stone building that seemed right. She approached slowly, trying to think of what to say to the doorman to let her in. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh hi, remember me? I was that sloppy drunk girl from the other night who showed up with Agatha. Can you let me in to see her?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She shook her head and contemplated going back. She turned and started walking away, but she didn’t have a dollar to her name. She couldn’t even afford a night at a dodgy motel, so she turned around again and summoned her courage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me?” She approached the man standing outside the building. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, ma’am?” He nodded with a friendly smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am here to see my friend. I think she lives in this building. Agatha, Agatha Harkness?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is she expecting you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well…” She hesitated. “I was just in the neighborhood and wanted to drop by.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He glanced down at her suitcase and her discolored face, “Let me give her a ring, one moment.” He entered the lobby and used the telephone on the wall. After a few agonizing minutes, Rio saw him coming back out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’ll be down in no time, please sit inside.” He held the door open for her and gestured her in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio placed her case on the floor beside the elegant wingback chair and took a seat. She marveled again at the scale of the lobby room and admired the artwork adorning the white walls. It looked like an upscale hotel, not just some apartment building. There were fresh flowers in several vases on the wooden display table along the wall. It was so far away from the life she knew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The elevator dinged, and she heard the metal grate open and frenzied steps echoing toward her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned at her name and saw Agatha rushing across the room. Even in her cotton gingham house dress, she looked like a movie star. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing here? Did something happen? Did that bastard -” Agatha’s word spilled out as her eyes crawled across every inch of Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no. I…” Rio didn’t know what to say. She didn’t know what had brought her here of all places. “He drank away all my cash. Everything. And I - I didn’t have anywhere else to go.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her lip trembled and her eyes welled up. The weight of the actions finally settled on her. Everything that she had built so far in America had been hit by the wrecking ball of Tony and destroyed. She started to cry, soft gentle sobs coursed through her body as she tried to wipe her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, oh doll. It’s okay. Come on, let me help.” Agatha lifted Rio’s suitcase with one hand and tenderly helped Rio stand. She wrapped an arm around her and led her to the elevator. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shhhh, I’ve got you.” She whispered to her softly, and Rio felt herself relax slightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They got off on the third floor and Agatha led them into her apartment. She put Rio’s things by the door and maneuvered them both to the couch. As soon as they sat down, Rio’s quiet sobs transformed into heaving cries. She turned into Agatha’s embrace and let all her emotions finally go. All the anger, fear, hatred, embarrassment, self-loathing, despair. She released it into the protective arms around her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t say anything. She murmured wordlessly and hummed a soothing melody, while rubbing Rio’s arm and back. Her presence alone was all that was needed for Rio to feel heard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had spent so many months walking on eggshells with a man she planned to marry, and now with this woman she had only known for a few weeks, she felt more at peace than ever. There was something different about Agatha; she was so unlike anyone else. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was drawn to her like a moth to a flame, and she was willing to risk a fiery end if it meant a second more in her company. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” She sniffled and rubbed her eyes as she sat up straight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes?” Agatha pushed the hair off her face, trying to avoid the bruising with her fingertips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I - do you mind if I stay with you? Just for tonight?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I’m going to throw you out on the street.” She looked at Rio with her killer smile. “Of course you can stay, however long you like.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha released her hold around Rio’s shoulder, and the younger woman immediately missed the feeling. “Are you sure?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, obviously. You can sleep in my bed, I’ll take the couch this time.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No! You’re doing me a huge favor, I’m not going to steal your bed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, your arm is in a stiff wooden splint. It’s a comfy couch but it's a tight squeeze. You won’t be comfortable, and then you’ll probably keep me up all night whining.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t whine!” Rio pushed her playfully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure, whatever you need to tell yourself.” Agatha got up from the couch and picked up the suitcase. She walked it to her bedroom so Rio couldn’t argue any further. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio followed her and leaned against the doorframe. “It’s too much, really. At least share the bed with me. You shouldn’t have to suffer on the couch alone.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha dropped the suitcase to the floor like it had shocked her. It made a loud bang as it hit the hardwood, and Agatha fumbled to set it right. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, she rarely saw Agatha look so flustered, “Alright there?” </span>
  <em>
    <span>Should I not have suggested that?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, just peachy. It slipped out of my hand.” The older woman chuckled nervously, pushing her hair back. “Are you hungry? I was just preparing dinner when you rang.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Starved, what are you making?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Spaghetti and meatballs. I got the recipe from one of the customers at the shop years ago.” Agatha walked across the hall to her small kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never had it.” Rio followed behind and watched her dishing up the long noodles into bowls. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How have you lived in New York for a year and never had this?” Agatha was aghast. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, “Not all of us can afford to visit restaurants regularly or ever, Ms. Moneybags.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s so easy to make and cheap, excuse you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure.” Rio fired back as they made their way to the dining room and she heard Agatha’s charming snort behind her. She sat at the rounded wooden table and admired the crown molding and intricate ceiling medallion that held the imposing circular alabaster pendant light. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two dug into the pasta. Rio had yet to learn the delicate technique of twirling the long strands around her fork, so Agatha cackled as she watched the spaghetti slap red sauce all over Rio’s face and mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re creating quite the masterpiece, Picasso.” She motioned to her own face to give her the hint. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked up from her bowl with a silly grin, “This is so good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” Agatha watched as Rio kept diving back in for more, completely ignoring the mess around and on her. It was a welcome change to the sadness that had been present just moments before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio…can I ask what happened?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked towards Agatha and wiped her face with the thick (probably very expensive) napkin on the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tonight or…?” Rio didn’t know how much she wanted to share. She was so embarrassed that this was her life, that she had let it get this bad. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Everything. What happened to your face, your arm? What made you leave? Who did this to you? I want to know it all.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned back in the dining chair and let her arms fall to her side, sighing. “I don’t know where to start. I had dreamed of America for so long and what it would be like, what I would be like here, and none of it was true. Everything that he promised me was a lie.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sat quietly, her elbow on the table, holding her head up as she stared at the woman across from her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tony was my first boyfriend, first love. Sounds so ridiculous now to say it, but I thought we were going to be together forever. He cared for me so deeply. When we were younger, we would daydream about leaving the island and starting our life in Nueva York - a place where anything could happen. He would tell me how he was going to buy us a place in Brooklyn, how we would get to see the greatest jazz singers in the world, how he would take me to a Yankees game. I was naive.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t mistake youthful optimism for naivety. Nobody can predict the future, trust me.” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should have known it wasn’t going to be a fairy tale. Tony was sweet but not especially hard-working. He doesn’t handle rejection well at all and has the shortest fuse. When we would go to dances back home, he would yank me away from other boys who would come try to talk to me. I actually liked that he was possessive, I felt wanted and protected, but the other side of that coin is… this.” She twirled her finger around the bruising on her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s lips contracted into a thin line. Rio watched her jaw twitch with pressure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was the morning that I came back from staying here. He smelled the alcohol on me and accused me of being a ‘lady of the night.’ His anger took over and propelled me across the room. I hit the furniture and was left looking like this, but I think it’s my pride that hurts the most. I watched so many women in my life capitulate to hot-tempered men, and I always promised myself I would pick better. Yet, here I am.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked down at her table and replied “It happens to the best of us. I’ve worked the bar for two years now, and the stories I hear would make your skin crawl. We have no protection in the law, in the courts. It’s no wonder why women protested across this country for temperance and prohibition.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did your husband - I mean, before he died, did he..?” Rio questioned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ralph? No, he didn’t have a violent bone in him, plus I could probably take him down if he ever tried.” Rio laughed at the little quip, glad for the distraction from her own sob story. “When he got drafted, I steeled myself for the inevitable because there was no way he was going to fire a gun and survive. Ended up being the pandemic that got him anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I loved him, in a way. It hurt for a while, but the freedom of the title ‘widow’ is shockingly incredible. I get to live alone. I get to work late hours without someone policing my schedule. I get to see who I want, do what I want. And nobody can say boo.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmmm, when you put it like that…I just need to marry Tony and then bump him off.” They both devolved into contagious laughter. Rio was struggling to breathe, she was laughing so hard and now a different brand of tears were spilling down her cheeks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Agatha. For letting me stay, for dinner, for everything. You’re the best.” She stood and lifted her plate to take it to the sink. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s no trouble, and let me get that.” She grabbed the plate and cleared the rest of the table in a sweep. “You can use the bathroom first, I’ll clean up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded and went to grab her pajamas, a simple peach cotton nightgown with flowers of Puerto Rico embroidered along the neckline. She crossed the hall into the bathroom and turned on the tub faucet. It was a large porcelain, free-standing bath. She undressed carefully and stepped into the warm water. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took inordinate effort to wash her shoulder-length hair with one hand</span>
  <em>
    <span>. </span>
  </em>
  <span>She felt exhausted from attempting it.</span>
  <span> After exiting and dressing for bed, she walked out to find Agatha lounging on the sofa. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I ask you another favor?” She stood in the doorway between the dining and parlor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you, ummmm, cut my hair?” She felt nervous suddenly at the vulnerable request. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure? I’m no barber.” Agatha put her hands up like she was accused of a crime. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can barely wash it with my arm like this. Tony never liked the bob cut. He called it ‘unnatural’ but I see it on all the girls at the club and think how nice it must feel.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me get the scissors.” She grabbed a dining chair on her way to the bathroom and set it in the center of the tiled floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sat down and faced the sink. She couldn’t see herself in the mirror as she was too low. Agatha stood behind her and ran her hair through her hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Last chance to back out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wish.” Rio glanced over her shoulder and smiled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, don’t cry to me if you hate it.” Agatha combed the dark brown hair in front of her and held the scissors in her left hand. She used to trim Ralph’s hair and knew the basics, but it was still intimidating. She finally took a deep breath and made the first snip. The locks fell slowly to the ground, and Rio tried her best to stay still. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt the weight of her thick hair start to lighten on the back of her head as Agatha chopped and chopped. She saw the hair start to pile up around her. Eventually, Agatha rounded the chair and stood right in front of her. The older woman bent forward to shape her bangs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio had an uninterrupted view straight down Agatha’s dress, and she only had a loose slip under it. Her eyes widened at the sight of the cleavage on full display, and she tried in vain to keep her breathing steady, afraid Agatha would notice the change given her proximity. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took in the delicious curves in her eye line. The skin that looked sinfully soft. She licked her lips and let out an involuntary sound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I hurting you, bunny?” Rio saw the smirk form on Agatha’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, I’m just fine.” She blurted out and averted her eyes quickly. She gripped the edge of the chair with her good hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Almost done, hold still.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s mind was in a tizzy. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Why was I staring at her breasts? God, they are nice though. Wait, what?? I don’t like breasts, do I like breasts?!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Penny for your thoughts?” Agatha could sense the panic but wasn’t sure the reason. Hopefully Rio wasn’t regretting the decision already. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I looked at your chest and liked it. Nooooooo. Nope. Can’t say that. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing interesting, just curious how it’s looking.” Rio lied through her teeth, biting back the rising heat inside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stand up, see for yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio rose from the chair and looked in the mirror. She brought her hand up and ran her fingers through the short strands. She had straight across bangs and her hair ended right above her jaw line. It felt so light and liberating. She felt a smile form and reach her eyes. “It’s perfect.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I missed my true calling.” Agatha admired her handiwork and was impressed with the look. Rio looked simultaneously more youthful and more dangerous. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walked out to grab her hand broom and swept the evidence quickly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know it’s boring, but I might turn in early if that’s alright.” It was just past 8pm but Rio was depleted after the day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to ask for permission here, you know?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodnight, Agatha.” She stepped into the bedroom and walked around to the other side of the bed. “Are you joining me?” She asked without expectation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll see. I was going to stay up and read for a while. Goodnight, Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled the bedroom door closed as she walked out and settled into her couch in the parlor. Barely a few minutes passed before she heard a yelp.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “Agatha!!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She flew off the couch down the hall to the bedroom and threw the door open. Rio was sitting up in bed, the covers pulled tight up to her face, and little Ebony was crawling towards her from the end of the bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really?” Agatha tilted her head and went to pick up the cat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t know you had a pet! I thought it was a gigantic rat jumping on the bed.” Rio tried to defend her fear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shhh, don’t listen to the scary lady. She doesn’t think you look like a rat, Ebony. You’re my beautiful little kitty.” She scratched the cat’s head playfully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not scary! I was scared!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you need me in here to protect you?” Agatha pretended to show off the muscles in her left arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laid back down and settled herself on the pillow. “I’m fine. Sorry for calling you a rat, Ebony.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She accepts your apology.” Agatha waved the cat’s little paw and exited again. She closed the door and carried her pet back to the parlor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing scaring our guest? Did you just want to make an entrance? I do like your style.” Agatha whispered to the cat and went back to her novel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tried to focus on the words but her thoughts were still wrapped around Rio. </span>
  <em>
    <span>The haircut really suits her, and she looks so good</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
  <em>
    <span>She only asked for it because of her injuries. I need to make sure this never happens again.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio seemed to think it was over, that she had left him for good. But Agatha knew how these situations went. The man would come grovelling back, he would seem like his old self and remind his girl of all the amazing times together, and the cycle would repeat, especially since Rio was no penniless. Tale as old as time. Given Tony’s propensity towards violence, Agatha didn’t want to think how this might end if Rio refused him again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She steeled herself to visit Hell’s Kitchen tomorrow morning after Rio left for the pharmacy. She knew someone who could help but it was going to cost her. Hopefully, it would be worth the risk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Speaking of risks, she weighed up whether or not to sleep in her bed or tough it out on the couch. She had shipped this sofa all the way from Paris so it was luxuriously comfortable but the thought of her own bed and the tantalizing proximity to Rio was too much to resist. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She finished the chapter she was on and saved her spot with a bookmark, then quietly stepped into her room and grabbed the pajamas she had set on top of her drawers. She eased back out as Rio was already fast asleep and took a quick bath. After finishing her nighttime routine, she slipped under the covers and laid back gently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was facing towards her on the other side of the bed. Her face was completely relaxed and her mouth was open just slightly. Her new haircut fell across her forehead and framed her features like a work of art. Agatha stared at her with abandon, feeling free to observe every inch of her beautiful face. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She is so gorgeous. I don’t even think she realizes it.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She clicked off the bedside lamp and settled down into the sheets. The moonlight lit the room with a haunting blue glow, and Agatha loved the way the shadows played across the sleeping figure beside her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been months since anyone else had shared her bed. She tried to remember the fling from last autumn. Blonde, petite, but mouthy. The name escaped her but the memory was visceral. That dame’s tongue was a phenomenon. She could teach a masterclass to the men of this town who could hardly please a woman if given all the time in the world. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The way she had made Agatha moan and beg for more. The way her fingers had traced every inch of her skin, outside and in. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I need to think of something else, anything else.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The thoughts alone were making her sweat and a familiar heat was building between her legs. She shifted her hips to ease the pressure of her tight pajama bottoms, trying not to shake the mattress at all. She glanced at Rio who was still in a deep sleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I wonder what she feels like. God, I wonder what she tastes like. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha regretted the train of thought, which only heightened her growing need. She knew sharing a bed was a risky idea. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Just one touch couldn’t hurt - not sure if I’ll ever get another chance.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She reached out slowly and tucked some loose strands behind Rio’s ear. The bruising was already starting to fade just slightly. The deep purple transitioning to a blue toned smattering. She closed the small distance between them and placed the lightest kiss on the soft cheek. She tried to transfer her protection, her defenses, her adoration through her lips and hoped Rio could feel it, subconsciously at least. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha drifted off to sleep and felt completely content. She relished the warmth from Rio’s nearby body and the comfort that she was able to provide a safe haven. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The alarm clock rang out at 8am sharp and the two women stirred out of their peaceful haze. Agatha threw the covers back and slid out of bed, stretching to the sky to wake her body.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even your pajamas look designer!” Rio rubbed her eyes and took in her bed mate’s outfit. The two-piece silk set had a wide candy stripe pattern in light blue and looked way too fashionable to be for sleeping alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha giggled, “Are you off to work this morning?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yup, will I see you there?” Rio ran her hand through her messy hair, revelling in the feeling of the short length. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have to run an errand but will be in later.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, see you then!” She went to her suitcase to find a dress to wear and got ready quickly. She threw her boss a wave and exited the apartment feeling the most well rested she had felt in months.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha also dressed in a hurry, eager to get her task over with. She picked a navy, extra-long drop waist dress with a wide sash belt and opted for the mink coat she rarely wore but knew that it commanded attention and power. She chose a burgundy red lipstick and pearl necklace to finish off the look and stepped into her leather strap pumps. She needed to exude confidence today. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she walked down the street to the subway station, she felt strong. People passing by followed her with their gaze as she walked. She got on the C train to Manhattan and rode the 15 minutes downtown. It was a short walk to Hell’s Kitchen, and she was soon standing outside Sparky’s, a popular dance hall and event space. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walked down the side alley and knocked on the door. It opened and a large, suited man stood in the opening. “We’re closed.” He moved to pull the door shut, but Agatha held her hand out to stop it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need to speak to Wanda.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man looked her up and down. “Who’s asking?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell her Mother’s calling.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He disappeared inside, and Agatha waited against the brick wall. She pulled out her pack of Lucky Strikes and her polished silver cigarette holder. She lit a match and took a few puffs to relax while waiting, hoping that Wanda wouldn’t stand her up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve got 10 minutes.” A gruff voice called out. She quickly threw down her cigarette and followed the man inside. He stopped abruptly at the door and held his arms out in demonstration.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you serious?” Agatha sighed and lifted her arms to copy him. The large bouncer patted her down roughly, checking her thoroughly for any hidden weapons. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t think about this while getting yourself off tonight, mac.” She jabbed at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t offer any reply or acknowledgement of her taunt. The man simply stepped aside and walked into the building.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They entered a dark hallway and he led them into the wide open grand hall. It was empty except for a woman sitting at a small cocktail table near the middle of the floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha approached with purpose. She took in the curly red hair in a fashionable short style and the long-sleeved red polka-dotted afternoon style dress, glamorous as always. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t think I’d see you on our turf again, Mother. I thought I made that clear last time.” Wanda stood and gestured for Agatha to sit with her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not here on business this time, dear. I need a favor.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Interesting, what could we possibly do for you? Or more importantly, what could you need from us?” Wanda intertwined her hands in front of her on the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need to scare a fella. Not the Big Sleep or anything. Just a warning, send him a message, and I know that nobody does that like you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re not here to take out your competition. Vision and I have better things to do.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not like that. Not business, remember? This one is strictly personal. A drunkard who won’t leave his girl alone. It’s gone too far.” Agatha kept the tone professional. She eyed up her comrade and admired her beauty. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmmm, why should I tell my husband to get involved? Seems pretty pedestrian - beneath us. Why can’t you handle it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t have the manpower. I have security but it’s run of the mill, club protection. I need real power. This fella is bad news and needs to learn a lesson. I don’t trust any of the other gangs not to bump him off by accident. Vision is the only one who keeps his men in line.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda nodded in agreement, clearly flattered. “I’ll talk to him but can’t promise anything. What are you offering?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There it was. Agatha had been waiting for the payment talk - Wanda never did anything for free. “I can offer three barrels of Jen’s finest. That’s over 10 gallons.” Agatha remained stoic, hoping this would be satisfactory. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda remained silent, thinking it over. “Four barrels minimum and five bottles of the best whiskey that you serve at the club.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha calculated the inventory in her head. There was enough, but they would be running dangerously low going into the weekend. She might need to call on her suppliers. “Four and four is my best offer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, four of each. Done. Call this number with the target’s location and description. We’ll handle the rest.” Wanda went over and shook Agatha’s hand hard, squeezing her fingers with authority - a warning, the memory flooding Agatha’s mind. “And next time, it’ll cost you double. Stay on your side of the city, and we won’t have any problems.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell the big boss I said hello. See you around, dollface.” Agatha threw a smooch to Wanda, unable to resist the temptation and hurried to the exit, shocked that she had just pulled that off.</span>

  <p>Lilia was the only one in the shop when Rio arrived on Wednesday morning for her shift. She was stacking a new shipment of lotions as she walked in. </p><p>“Morning, Lilia.”</p><p>The woman looked up and smiled at the new arrival, “You look happy this morning. Love the hair. Have a good sleep?”</p><p>“You could say that. I stayed with Agatha last night.” Rio grinned and played with her new locks. </p><p>“Oh really?” Lilia hoped Agatha knew what she was doing.</p><p>“I mean, she let me stay over. I packed my bags and left Tony. The last straw broke when I got home yesterday, and I didn’t know where else to go so I ended up at Agatha’s.” </p><p>“Well you know you can stay with me, right? I still have a spare bedroom in my apartment. Rent will be very affordable as I have a nice arrangement with the building owner.”</p><p>“That would be great. Let me think about it. I don’t want you to get sick of me!” </p><p>“If you start picking up shifts downstairs, I probably won’t even see you very often to be honest. Plus I’m easy to live with. I’ll hardly bother you.” Lilia finished opening the boxes and started sorting the merchandise. </p><p>“Okay, sounds amazing. I’ll let you know.” Rio started to help sort the goods and the two fell into easy conversation. </p><p>Before long, the ball of energy named Billy arrived. </p><p>“Rioooo!” He sang her name and held the note with attempted vibrato. The two women rolled their eyes in unison. </p><p>He jumped behind the counter where Rio was arranging the glasses. “Watch it!” She fired at him. </p><p>“You never told me you could dance.” He shot back with a smile. </p><p>Rio sighed heavily, shaking her head, “Who told you?” </p><p>“Who didn’t? The entire club was buzzing with gossip on Sunday night. You’re the talk of the town! Everyone is lining up to cut a rug with you.” His excitement was overwhelming, and the thought that hundreds of people knew about her was frightening. </p><p>“How am I meant to show my face there again, especially with this hideous bruise?” She rubbed her face with anxiety. </p><p>“Umm, if you walk in with this new hairdo and move like you did last weekend, you’re going to be just fine. You’re gonna need a personal bodyguard to keep all your fans off you. Let me know if you’re hiring.” He laughed at the mental image. </p><p>He saw her retreating into herself, “Hey, seriously. Agatha can help with face powder and rouge. She’s even shown me how to use them before.”</p><p>Rio curled an eyebrow with interest and Billy defended his statement, “What? Can’t a man look pretty sometimes?”</p><p>She laughed and got back to work. It was challenging to move about lunch service one armed, but she managed okay and was grateful she could still write the orders with her uninjured hand. She did her best to ignore the stares from customers on her face and splint. </p><p>When pressed, she would throw out an “I’m so clumsy!” or “You should see the other guy” to cut the tension and ease the questioning. The look of relief on their sincere faces was always immediate as if the threat of the truth was just too much to handle. </p><p>By quitting time, Rio was ready for a break. She was cleaning the counters when Agatha walked in. </p><p>“Hey Rio, are you up for a shift at the club tonight? I’m sure Billy would love the help with service - I need to help Jen with production.”</p><p>She was feeling tired already but desperately needed the cash, “Yup, of course. What time?”</p><p>“Come by at 10pm. Pay is double what you make up here plus the tips are generous. No need to dress to the nines this time, just a nice dress and shoes you can stand in.” </p><p>“See you at 10.” Rio gave a quick nod then walked to the back room and motioned for Agatha to follow. As the door closed, she said, “Lilia offered me her spare bedroom again, and I think I’m going to take it. If you don’t mind…”</p><p>“No stress, I want you to do whatever you think is best. And I only have one room, it’s not - practical.” Agatha was glad that Lilia was so generous, though a part (a very large part) wished that Rio would stay.  </p><p>“Can I stay tonight? I’ll gather my stuff tomorrow. If I’m working tonight, I’d rather have a familiar place to sleep."</p><p>“Yup, not a problem. Here’s my spare key, you can head to the apartment now to rest and get ready. I’ll see you later.” </p><p>Rio thanked her and left. Lilia walked into the back room before the door could even swing shut. </p><p>“Did she tell you about staying with me?” She asked. </p><p>“Thank you for offering it again.” Agatha nodded. </p><p>“It’ll be nice to have company. Did she really show up at your place last night?”</p><p>“Yeah, she was a wreck. This guy has done a real number on her. I can’t wait until he gets what's coming.” </p><p>“So I take it you went to see Wanda then?” Agatha could sense the disapproval in Lilia’s question. </p><p>“Don’t worry ya pretty grey hairs. I can take her.” </p><p>“I’m sure you can, but those two never work for free. What are they getting from this?” Lilia crossed her arms. </p><p>“Just booze. Four barrels, four bottles. That’s it.” </p><p>“It’s never that simple. Wanda’s on a power trip to gain control of the city, why wouldn’t she ask for something more?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged in an exaggerated fashion with her arms. “How should I know what goes on in that redhead’s sick mind?”</p><p>Wanda and Vision commanded the Sokovian gang that controlled Midtown Manhattan. As opposed to gambling and bootlegging, they specialized in the political machine to gather power and exert control, though they ran a network of speakeasies and clubs to bring in the cash. They paled in comparison to the Five Families and Irish Mob in scope and size, but Vision ran his operation with exacting direction and authority. </p><p>However, Wanda was the real master behind the curtain. Though she fronted as just another mob wife, or moll, all direction came from or through her. Vision may appear as the mob boss, but Wanda was the actual puppet master.</p><p>Agatha had first encountered the couple only a year ago. She and Jen had visited a new bar, the Cabinet of Mysteries, to meet up with a new contact that Lilia had arranged. A bootlegger from Minnesota that had a fleet of delivery vans rigged up to smuggle copious amounts of whiskey from Canada. </p><p>They had only been sitting at the table with him for 15 minutes when rough hands had grabbed both Jen and Agatha, hauled them into the building's kitchen, and tied them to some chairs in the enclosed pantry. </p><p>“We don’t tolerate these sorts of meetings on our premises.” A woman’s voice rang out behind them as they were facing the wall of produce. </p><p>“We didn’t mean to offend, ma’am.” Jen uttered, glancing sideways at her companion, who was seething. </p><p>“You don’t just get to tie us up like pigs, toots.” Agatha snapped. </p><p>“You’ll find I can do pretty much whatever I want, dear. This is my house.” The redhead rounded the chairs and stood tapping her foot in front of them, arms crossed. Agatha could feel two large figures looming behind them as well - extra muscle. </p><p>“Oh, nice to finally meet you, Glamour. I see how you got your nickname.” Agatha took in the appearance of the redhead. She had heard rumors around town about her and her husband for months now. They were intimidating all the club owners, marking their territory. Her perfectly styled scarlet locks, the jewelled headband, the black beaded chiffon evening dress. She was picture perfect, stunning. </p><p>“Nice to see Mother outside her hen house as well. Now, tell me. Why you were attempting to woo one of our best suppliers from right under our nose?”</p><p>“This is a free country, isn’t it? I didn’t know you had a chokehold on every bootlegger in town.” Agatha couldn't conceal her temper. </p><p>“Just this side of Manhattan. If you stay up in Harlem, we won’t have any problems, see?” Wanda stepped closer to Agatha and fiddled with her hair. Agatha strained against the ties on her wrists and ankles. </p><p>“I don’t appreciate being played with like a toy, Wanda.” </p><p>“We’re sorry. Really. If you let us go, we’ll go back uptown. This was just a big misunderstanding.” Jen tried her best to talk some sense into the situation. There was some game going on between her boss and this new woman that she couldn’t quite understand. </p><p>“Is that right, Agatha? Just a misunderstanding?” Wanda ran her finger along Agatha’s jaw and held her by the chin - not with malice but hard enough to make her point. </p><p>Agatha stared her down, unwilling to budge, but she felt the fear in Jen and didn’t want to drag this out. “Yes.” She spoke the word as if it pained her to do so. </p><p>“Yes…and?” Wanda was testing her. She had let go of her face and was now leaning against the shelving, staring her down.</p><p>“What the fuck do you want from me?” Agatha knew the Sokovians craved power and loathed competition, but this felt personal. </p><p>“I want you to say you’re sorry, like your good little friend here.” The condescension poured out of Wanda’s mouth so easily. </p><p>“I’m not.” Agatha didn’t break her gaze with the woman in front of her. She wasn’t going to let her win. </p><p>“Pietro, Carl, untie Jen, and let her go. Leave the two of us. I need to have a private word with this one.” She watched her men lift Jen and take her away, then it was silent as the door shut them in. </p><p>“You want to have your way with me now, buttercup?” Agatha quipped with a laugh.</p><p>Wanda was caught off guard for just a moment. “Wh-what? No, I..you’re pretty bold for someone tied to a chair.” </p><p>“Some call me charming.” Agatha pushed out her lips in a delicious pout. She felt like Wanda was trying to exercise control to prove a point.  </p><p>“I’m sure. Now just tell me you’re sorry for trying to snake my bootlegger, and we’ll let bygones be bygones. You can go back to your place and forget you ever messed with the Maximoffs.” </p><p>“And if I don’t?”</p><p>Wanda walked to the corner of the pantry space and knelt down to the bottom shelf. She pulled up a heavy metal device with a hand crank. She took the chair Jen was sitting on and affixed the twisting clamp to the seat. Agatha now realised it was a meat grinder. Her heart stopped. </p><p>“Hey!” She tried in vain to pull against the restraints. “I was just razzing. I thought we were playing!” She couldn’t keep the quiver of genuine fear from emerging in her voice. Her eyes kept flicking between the grinder and the redhead.</p><p>She watched Wanda kneel and test the crank. She heard the metal gears turning slowly. </p><p>“Glamour…Wanda, please. I’m sorry, okay. I’m sorry! We didn’t know this was your club, I promise.”</p><p>“Oh, now you’re sorry. Interesting.” Wanda lifted the chair with its new sinister upgrade and placed it right next to Agatha. </p><p>“Please, hon. Please. What do you want? I’ll do anything. I-I need my hands. Don’t-” She was desperate now. The cold hard stare from her captor was scaring her. </p><p>Wanda slowly untied one of Agatha’s bound wrists and held it with surprising strength. She guided it to the meat grinder and held it at the top of the hopper. </p><p>“Tell me that I won.” Wanda started turning the crank again. </p><p>Agatha bared her teeth like an angry pitbull. “You won.” She snarled. </p><p>Wanda’s grip on her wrist did not ease. She started moving it down towards the chewing metal of the grinder. </p><p>“YOU WON!” Her voice strained and filled the small room. </p><p>The grinder halted. Wanda let Agatha’s hand fall back to her side, a wicked smile covering her face as she glanced down at the sweating, frightened woman below her. She paused and soaked in the feeling of control.</p><p>She leaned close to Agatha’s face, “This isn’t a game. This city’s at war, and you’re not ready. Either stay in your cute little lane or tough up, buttercup. And if you ever need a <em>hand</em> from us, it’s going to cost you.”</p><p>Agatha walked away from her first real run in with a gang in shock. She vowed to never let it happen again. </p><p>Since then, she built up the wall around her operations and herself. She made inroads with the fuzz to keep them off her back. She hired Alice for protection after seeing her take on three men in a bar brawl. Her and Lilia kept their suppliers happy and loyal, they kept their customers coming back for more, and they carefully avoided the power struggle between the warring gangs in New York. </p><p>She wasn’t interested in power, not like Wanda. She wanted power in the form of money, independence, freedom. She wanted to carve out a niche for people like her to feel safe and welcome. It wasn’t about domination. </p><p>“How are we going to make up for that lost supply of alcohol?” Lilia snapped her fingers and pulled Agatha from her memory.</p><p>“Yeah, umm, I’m going to help Jen tonight make a double batch. But we might need to see if the Lee brothers have any extra bottles from their last run. I don’t know if we’ll make it to Friday night.”</p><p>Lilia sighed heavily, “I’ll make some calls. This better be worth it.”</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>Rio walked the short journey to Agatha’s apartment and let herself in with the spare key. It felt familiar coming into the space now, and she felt a tug of sadness that this was her last night here. </p><p>She shed her work outfit and threw on her house dress to relax. Alone in Agatha’s domain, she wandered the space with curiosity. In the parlor, she studied the painting above the fireplace. A dark and moody landscape on a cloudy evening. She recognised the scene from Macbeth, when he meets the three witches who announce that he will be king. </p><p>Her eyes swept along to the bookcase near the windows, and she ran her finger along the spines of novels - several by Jules Verne, Edith Wharton, Arthur Conan Doyle. She was impressed by the range and the collection. There were a few small framed photographs on top of the shelf. One of Agatha on her wedding day with who she assumed must be Ralph. One of Ralph in his military garb, looking stoically at the camera. One of the younger Agatha and Lilia outside the front of the pharmacy together. </p><p>She smiled at the memories and wished she could hear the stories behind each photo. Undoubtedly, Agatha would have endless tales to regale about each one. She shuffled over to the radio and turned it on. Al Jolson’s <em> April Showers </em>flowed from the speakers a fitting number as spring was quickly approaching in the city. </p><p>“Though April showers may come your way,</p><p>They bring the flowers that bloom in May…”</p><p>She swayed softly to his crooning voice and relaxed on the couch to just listen to the music. Her eyes closed as the music washed over her, and she drifted off for a quick nap. When she woke up a few hours later, little Ebony was curled along her side. </p><p>“Hi there” She whispered and petted the cat carefully, trying not to wake her. “Thanks for keeping me company, little one.”</p><p>The clock read 8:45pm. “Gotta get ready, sorry sleepyhead.” She eased up and walked to the bedroom. Going through her suitcase, she only had two dancing dresses, and she had already worn one on her first night at the club. </p><p>She looked towards Agatha’s closets. <em> Hmmm, would she mind if I borrow one? I doubt they would even look good on me. Maybe just a look. </em> She opened the door on the right and took in the numerous colored gowns on hangers. <em> Wow </em>.</p><p>She rifled through the dresses and stopped on a gold number with an open back and oval neckline. There was a prominent bow along the waist and multiple points on the bottom hem. She turned to the door as Ebony strolled in, “What do you think?” She held up the gorgeous gown. “Do I dare?”</p><p>The cat meowed. </p><p>“I’ll take that as a yes.” Rio laughed to herself and tried on the dress. She wasn’t expecting it to fit perfectly but it slid against her body like it was made for her. She looked in the dressing table mirror and admired the view.</p><p>She had decided to forgo her step-in slip and opted for a brassiere and bloomers instead. Her new hair was easy to style. She just used a bit of gel to add subtle finger waves around her face, then applied a light amount of eyeliner and lipstick, hoping Agatha would assist with covering the bruise before the night began.</p><p>“Do you think your mama will like this?” She showed off her look to the cat who was stretched out on the bed. </p><p>Ebony glanced her way with her yellow eyes before shutting them once more, giving away nothing. Rio rolled her eyes. <em> Why am I talking to a feline? </em></p><p>She spritzed herself with her signature scent L’heure Bleue that her cousin had gifted her as a goodbye present and decided to head out early. “Bye kitty!” She called as she walked out the door. </p><p>It was dark now and had to be at least past 9pm. She knocked twice on the door and Alice greeted her warmly. </p><p>“Hey Rio, welcome back. Didn’t know if we’d see you again after that first night.” </p><p>“I think I learned my lesson about booze. I’ll take it much easier from now on.” She held the bannister and made her way down the stairs. </p><p>“Love the haircut by the way! Very stylish.” Alice called down after her. </p><p>Rio walked through the club door and saw Billy behind the bar chopping limes. </p><p>“Ummmm…stop everything. Who’s that stunning vision that just walked in?” Billy dropped his knife and his jaw as he took in Rio’s outfit. </p><p>“Close your mouth, kid. Are you sure it looks alright?”</p><p>“Are you kidding? Agatha’s going to go goofy when she sees you. I would kill to pull off a dress like that.” He admired all the details in the gown. </p><p>“Where is our fine boss this evening?” Rio tried to change the subject. </p><p>“She just walked backstage to go grab something.”</p><p>“I’ll go see where she wants me.” Rio walked across the hall. </p><p><em> Probably horizontal, </em> Billy thought to himself and held in a laugh. </p><p>She walked up the stage stairs and behind the curtain. It was dark backstage, but she was easily able to see the glow of light under the door to the first green room. Without thinking, she opened the door and caught Agatha in a state of undress. </p><p>Her boss was in a white corselette, which helped obliterate her curves to fit the silhouette of the day, over a light yellow silk chemise. The light waist girdle had two garter clips on each leg to keep up her sheer stockings. She was already in her heels, and the sight of the whole getup made Rio’s mouth run dry. She fumbled to close the door. </p><p>“Sorry! I should have knocked!” She tried to back out of the room and moved to cover her eyes. </p><p>“Come in, it’s fine. I was just worried it was Billy for a second.” Agatha waved her in and felt her heart jump into her throat. She took in the sight of her own dress now draped around Rio’s body. The gold dress was one of her old favorites, but it was a touch too snug. It seemed to fit Rio’s form like it was tailored for her figure, even the wooden splint on her arm couldn’t detract from her beauty. She held back from fanning herself. </p><p>“I can come back.” Rio muttered as she tried to hide her flushed cheeks. </p><p>“Since you clearly have good taste in fashion. Help me pick a dress, I’m at a loss!” </p><p>She took in a deep breath and walked back into the room. She tried to keep her attention on the clothing but couldn’t resist the temptation standing beside her. Agatha was like the forbidden fruit, and Rio was fighting the urge to grab a bite. She let her eyes slide down the exposed legs on display and admired the supple skin of Agatha’s thighs, the curve of her knee, the muscles in her calf. </p><p>The boss flicked a glance at Rio and saw the way her eyes were travelling down her body. She caught the way her tongue subtly licked her lips. <em> Maybe I’m not the only one feeling a bit frustrated. </em>She considered the thought. </p><p>“Sorry I didn’t ask about borrowing your dress. I just…didn’t have anything nice to wear.” Rio apologised. </p><p>“Keep it, honestly. I usually always just wear something from here anyway. Speaking of, which one would you pick for me?”</p><p>“What about this one?” Rio had composed herself and held up a sky blue Grecian-style dress.</p><p>“It’s been a while. Can you button me in?” Agatha stepped into the number. It had a stylish draped cape back, and she moved her hair to the side to allow Rio to help close the clasp at the top. </p><p>Rio steadied her hands and affixed the dress easily. She could feel the warmth of Agatha’s skin on the tips of her fingers but quickly pulled away. </p><p>“Wow, that dress looks incredible on you.”</p><p>“Honey, everything looks good on me.” Agatha twirled in a flourish and sat in front of the brightly lit mirror to tie up her hair. </p><p>“So, should I just shadow Billy tonight?” Rio asked.</p><p>“If that’s alright. If you feel too tired at any point, you can head home. Otherwise, we close at 3am.” Agatha started applying her makeup. </p><p>“I actually want to ask…could you help me cover this bruise? I’m tired of the questions, it makes me feel stupid.” She dropped her head.</p><p>Agatha twisted in her chair and lifted Rio’s chin, “Don’t talk about my friend like that. She doesn’t deserve it.”</p><p>Rio smiled bashfully. “Why are you so nice to me?”</p><p>“I told you - you deserve it. Now come sit, I think there is some great face powder back here that the performers use.” She shuffled through the dressing table drawers and found a large round container. </p><p>“It’s not magic but will probably cover it enough.” She applied the powder as gently as possible. </p><p>Rio watched the blue bruise slowly disappear. She could still see the shadow of the painful memory, but it was good enough to fool the average passerby. </p><p>“Thanks, I feel like a new woman. You’ve really given me a total makeover - face, hair, clothing. How can I repay you?”</p><p>“I’m sure I’ll think of something.” Agatha said with a smile. “I was curious, what was your old address?”</p><p>“What? Why?” Rio got nervous at the thought. </p><p>“No, nothing bad. I was just going to have Alice check in and make sure Tony is still going to work, not planning anything suspicious against you.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“You’d be surprised what a freshly dumped, drunk man is capable of.”</p><p>Rio thought it was over. She hadn’t considered that Tony might do anything further. She had planned to never see or speak to the man again. “Uh, it's apartment 25, 370 Fort Washington Blvd.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. I just like to make sure my people are protected.” Agatha put a hand at the small of Rio’s back and led her out. She catalogued the address in her head for later. </p><p>They strolled back out to the main hall, and Rio went to help Billy with the prep while Agatha disappeared into the back to help Jen. </p><p>“Can you prepare the garnishes? Or would you rather clean the glasses?” Billy asked.</p><p>“I can do the garnishes. My good hand still works.” Rio took the paring knife from him and kept slicing the citrus. </p><p>“Mother did a good job with the powder. You can hardly tell anymore.” He said as he started pulling the liquor from the hidden cabinets. </p><p>“Yeah, I’m so grateful for her help, for everything she’s done for me.”</p><p>“Get in line. I would probably be caught up in a gang or dead if she hadn’t brought me into her fold. Tommy and I were living in a boy’s home. Our parents abandoned us at birth - I guess two babies was just too much to ask. Anyway, we ran away at 13 and were sleeping on the street. We stole food to stay alive and one day, I tried stealing from the pharmacy. </p><p>She took me into the back and asked where I was staying, where my family was. She set us up with a family she knew, the Kaplans, and they’ve taken both Tommy and I in. They’re like our parents now. She hired me, let’s me work down here, and I can save money to go to college like Darcy. I owe Agatha everything.”</p><p>The more she learned about her boss, the more she was surprised. Agatha was endlessly interesting. She was like an intricate tapestry woven from the finest thread, complex and beautiful. </p><p>The two of them finished the prep as they heard the loud cascade of people descending into the club. The bar was quickly surrounded with thirsty patrons, vying for attention. </p><p>Rio watched Billy handle the never-ending line without difficulty. She would pass him limes, olives, mint, straws, glasses - anything he asked for, and take note of the steps to prepare each request. Gin rickey, sidecar, martini, Mary Pickford, old fashioned, highball. It was like a whole new language she needed to learn. </p><p>As the crowd moved from the bar to the dance floor, she tried to keep the area clean and tidy. As she was washing a few glasses, she heard someone tapping on the bar behind her. She turned and saw a platinum blonde sitting on one of the stools. She was casually tapping her nails on the bartop, a subtle and suggestive invitation, and her eyes glinted at Rio. </p><p>“The mystery dancer returns. I see you’re not too busy, can I steal you for a little twirl?” The woman was straight to the point. Rio admired her winged eyeliner and perfectly curled hair. </p><p>“And who is asking?” Rio was now facing her, intrigued at the boldness of the request. </p><p>“Friends call me Dottie, but you can call me whatever you want, doll.” </p><p>She wasn’t used to such shameless flirtation, especially not from a woman. Men had asked her to dance many times in the past, but Tony was always around, always quick to shut them down. She felt unsettled but couldn’t say she disliked the exchange. </p><p>“Do you use that line on all the bartenders?” She decided to join the game. A little flirting never hurt nobody. </p><p>“They could be so lucky. I saw your moves the other night. I bet you can keep up with that pace off the floor as well.” Dottie was clearly enjoying herself. She reached out across the bar and touched the splint on Rio’s arm. “Will this slow you down?”</p><p>Rio heard the challenge in the question. She knew she was being played but couldn’t let this woman question her abilities. “Billy, I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Her fellow bartender overheard the whole conversation. He was giddy at the prospect of finally seeing Rio dance. It was all he had heard about for days now. He wondered if she could possibly live up to the hype. </p><p>Rio stepped out from behind the bar. She was stone cold sober this time, but dancing was a part of her DNA. The band tonight was rocking - an eight-piece jazz band with a full repertoire of the latest hits. She walked with a purpose to the dance floor, confident Dottie was trailing behind her. She could feel the blonde’s eyes raking across her body as she led the way. The other customers took notice of her as well as they recognised her from her previous turn on the floor. </p><p>The band finished the foxtrot rhythm and immediately picked up a hot jazz number. The drummer hammered out the beat with impressive speed as the rest of the instruments joined. She extended her good hand out to Dottie who leaned down and gave it a quick kiss before grabbing it with ease. </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow at the action but pulled her partner in and led her through quick synchronized steps before spinning her out again, so they were side by side. The two moved through the classic Charleston motions, their arms swinging and legs twisting in perfect time. Dottie was surprisingly nimble on her feet. She kept up with Rio’s syncopated movements and had her own special flair. </p><p>They were a delightful contrast to observe - one dark haired, moving with sensual sparkle and playful creativity, and one light haired, dripping with sexuality and vibrant exuberance. Rio smiled at her partner and twirled her around the floor. </p><p>Meanwhile, Billy was in awe of Rio. He watched from behind the bar at the way she kicked out her legs, how she moved her body with such practiced mastery, even with an injured arm. He suddenly thought of Agatha and the protectiveness she seemed to have over Rio, and he darted out the door behind him into the hall and knocked on the distillery door. </p><p>“Mother! You’re going to want to see this.” He called out loudly to be heard over the music. It took a second before he heard steps coming toward him.</p><p>“There better be some serious trouble out there.” Agatha opened the door with a huff. </p><p>“It’s Rio. She’s dancing again.” </p><p>“With who?” Agatha had already pushed past Billy and was entering the hall. <em> I hope she’s not drunk again.  </em></p><p>“Dottie. You should have seen it - she was laying it on so thick. I think Rio fell right into her trap, she’s not used to a vamp like that.”</p><p>“Vamp is right. Dottie will suck the blood from any pretty lady who crosses her path.” They walked together towards the floor. Billy was struggling to keep up with Agatha, who was practically running. </p><p>The dance floor wasn’t circled around anyone this time, but Agatha could easily pick out her gold dress in the crowd and its one-armed new owner who was cutting a rug with a talented blonde dame. Her jealousy flared at the sight. Rio was smiling from ear to ear, impressed with herself and with her partner’s moves. She was so at home on the dance floor. </p><p>Agatha ripped off the work gloves she was still wearing and shoved them at Billy. “Hold these.”</p><p>She started counting herself in and waited for the perfect moment. As Rio spun Dottie out with a flourish, she spun in and took the blonde’s place. </p><p>“Hey!” Dottie stumbled backwards on her heels as her flow was interrupted by the cut in. </p><p>“Sorry, babe. She owes me one.” Agatha shrugged over her shoulder as Rio caught her and held her hand. </p><p>“That’s low, Harkness, even for you!” Dottie backed off the floor in anger, pointing a finger in her direction. </p><p>“She’ll get over it.” Agatha said to the brunette and tried to keep up with Rio’s moves. </p><p>The pace was quick and energetic. Rio spun her halfway so they were facing the same direction, and they kicked out in sync with each other then spun 180 degrees and did the same the other way. Agatha pulled Rio’s body close so Rio was pressed against her front and she put her hands on her waist. She led them both in matching movements, as her right foot went forward so did Rio’s. </p><p>Her face was right behind Rio’s head and she spoke, “I don’t remember saying you could dance on your shift.”</p><p>Rio turned slightly, the two still moving with the music, “She made me! I had to prove her wrong. She said I couldn’t dance with my arm like this.”</p><p>“She goaded you. Are you going to fall for any beautiful woman who asks you to dance?” </p><p>“Maybe just one.” Rio did a spin and was now facing Agatha. She took the lead and pulled her close. “I think I like it when you’re jealous.” </p><p>“I’m not - No I was just…” She narrowed her eyes with playful anger. </p><p>Rio winked and grinned, “Thanks for the dance, boss.” She walked off the floor and left Agatha solo. </p><p>“What the hell? Where are you going?” Agatha followed her.</p><p>“I’m not meant to dance on company time, remember? Back to work!” </p><p>A laugh escaped out of Agatha’s mouth. <em> God, she’s funny sometimes. </em> </p><p>Rio walked back behind the bar to join Billy who was still serving a few customers searching for refills. He gave a little round of applause to her as she joined him. </p><p>“I was going to talk to you two soon anyway. Jen and I were talking and thought of a way we can all get a big payday.” She knew Rio desperately needed an influx of cash and the bar could also use a little boost after this situation with Wanda. </p><p>“I’m listening.” Rio said. </p><p>“Me too!” Billy piped up. </p><p>“Well, you know the annual Masquerade and Civic Ball at Hamilton Lodge? The competition has grown so quickly that the firemen have to barricade the doors to prevent overcrowding. The owners asked me if we could host a preliminary elimination to help thin the herd, so to speak. We can expect a full house and will have to judge the contest. The real ball had over 200 competitors last year, so they want us to narrow it down to a top 50.”</p><p>“Oh my god, no way! I’ve been trying to get in to see The Fairies Ball for years, and it’s always sold out. This is going to be the cat’s pajamas!” Billy was shaking with excitement. </p><p>“I’ve never heard of it.” Rio said with confusion. </p><p>“It takes place at Rockland Palace at the very top of Harlem, near Washington Heights. They’ve been hosting this drag ball for over 50 years! The best female and male masqueraders show up to try to win the top prize.” Billy explained. </p><p>“And now we get to be part of their history. We have about a month to prepare. They want us to host the prelims on the third weekend of April, the night of the 22nd. We’re going to need wayyyy more booze.”</p><p>“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” Billy questioned. </p><p>Rio watched the mischievous look pass between the two of them. “What? What are you thinking?” She looked back and forth quickly. </p><p>A huge smile broke out across Agatha’s face. “Pack a bag. It’s time to skip the middleman. We’re going on a rum run.”</p>

I'm mostly writing this because I want to read it, but I'm very grateful to everyone else along for the ride.</p><p>I reference a real drag contest that was a huge annual event in Harlem. The Hamilton Lodge Ball is recognised as the first drag ball in US history - it began in 1869 (!!!) and reached peak popularity during the roaring '20s. At its height up to 8,000 people would attend this cross-dressing contest, and it was racially integrated, which was rare at the time. It ended in 1937 when culture began to turn dramatically against the visibility and acceptance of LGBT people. A great reminder that queer people have always been here and have always existed despite efforts to erase us.</p><p>Very excited for the next chapter.

  <p>
  <span>Rio collected $10 in tips on her first night working The Hidden Gate, half of her usual weekly wages. At that rate, she could easily afford rent and bills at Lilia’s place and start saving for something more. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walked back with Agatha to her apartment after the bar closed. The city was still buzzing with energy even at the late hour. Cars and carriages tore up and down the streets, couples lingered on street corners delaying their mutual goodbyes, groups of friends laughed and joked with each other on their way home. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they arrived at Agatha’s place, they both crashed onto the couch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So what should I pack for our adventure?” Rio turned her head to face her companion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It will just be two nights. We’ll leave on Friday at midday. It’s about a 7 hour drive to Montreal. We’ll stay there on Saturday to resupply and rest, then leave Sunday morning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve never been to Canada. I mean, I’ve never even left the city to be honest.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think you’ll turn into a pumpkin that far afield?” She laughed at her own joke. “The scenery is beautiful, but we won’t get to see much. Do you know how to drive?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, I used to drive back home in Puerto Rico. My uncle had an old Ford that he would let me drive into town. It’s been a while though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s like riding a bike. I trust you.” She flashed a smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Should I be nervous?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About driving?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“About breaking the law…” Rio fidgeted nervously and looked down at her lap. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t let anything happen to you. I promise. Billy and I have done this five times before and never had any problems. It’s mostly just a long, boring car ride, so we’ll love your company. My friend Jean-Paul owns a popular whisky distillery in LaSalle, just outside the city, and he always has plenty to share.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay well, if I get arrested, you better pay my bail!” Rio joked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your wish is my command.” They laughed together at the absurdity of the idea. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio rocked herself up to stand and stretch. “I’m beat. I’m going to turn in.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stayed seated, “I’ll join you shortly. And Lilia told me you can come in late to the shop tomorrow. She doesn’t expect you until noon.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phew, thanks for that. I could use a sleep in. Goodnight.” She walked the now familiar path through the dining room to the bedroom, but as she entered the hallway, she turned around quickly and poked her head back into the parlor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And thanks for the dance tonight. You’re not half bad, you know?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked back at Rio, “Is that the best compliment you got?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean…that Dottie was a real hot stepper-” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt the pillow hit her face before even registering it was coming her way. “Hey!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re on thin ice, Vidal. One more sassy remark, and you’re out of the road trip crew. I’m sure Jen would like a little getaway.” Agatha flashed her tongue out in jest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio held in the teasing comment and muttered out a “Goodnight, Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both slept like the dead that night as exhaustion knocked them right out. Agatha’s internal alarm clock woke her up at 9am, and she dressed for the day. Rio was still passed out in bed, and she allowed herself to admire her sleeping form. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Will I ever tire of looking at her? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>To avoid waking her bedmate, she took the elevator down to the lobby to use the communal telephone. She pulled out the small slip of paper that Wanda had given her with the number to call. She rotated the dial to enter the numbers and lifted the earpiece to her ear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who’s calling?” A deep voice with an Eastern European accent answered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha Harkness.” She spoke slowly and quietly into the microphone. She heard muffled voices in the background of the call and a minute passed in silence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Name and address?” The voice returned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Antonio, goes by Tony. Apartment 25, 370 Fort Washington Blvd.” She had recited the address on a loop in her head after Rio had shared it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Time?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha froze for a moment. She had forgotten to ask about Tony’s schedule. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck.</span>
  </em>
  <span> She knew he was a dockworker and that he worked long hours. She was going to have to guess.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“6pm, weekdays.” She figured he would probably be home around supper time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll be in touch.” The line clicked off, and it was done. She let out a long sigh and swiped her hand through her hair. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It’s almost over. </span>
  </em>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Tony had spent the two days since Rio’s departure in bed, wallowing in misery. He sent word to his boss that he had a stomach bug to keep them off his back and replayed the last few weeks in his mind. Where had everything gone so wrong?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tipped the bottle of gin into his mouth and savored the bitter burn as it passed his lips. </span>
  <em>
    <span>She doesn’t know what she’s done. She’s going to come crawling back any moment. Where could she possibly go? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He stared at the door in anticipation, expecting the brunette to walk through it like she had a thousand times before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The alcohol distorted his memories and hijacked his emotions. He was suddenly crying. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I miss Rio! Where is my girl? </span>
  </em>
  <span>The tears streaked his sweating face, and his sadness twisted and morphed quickly into anger. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How could she leave me? Me!? I paid for her to come here. She can’t just disappear. She owes me. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He seethed at the thought and squeezed her pillow like he was juicing an orange - squeezing the life from it. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m going to find her. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked around the room. Rio had taken all her things. It was still an absolute disaster from when he had disassembled the place looking for her hidden cash. He kicked the dresser drawers around and rifled through the papers and trash on the floor but couldn’t see any hints as to where Rio might be. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He entered the kitchen and saw the trash can. It hadn’t been emptied for a few days. In his drunken desperation, he stuck his hands in and started pulling out everything. Through the disgusting slop and foul odor, he landed on a crumpled piece of paper that looked unfamiliar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a small rectangular paper and when he smoothed it out, it had “Westview Pharmacy” written at the top in elegant cursive. There were orders written down on the lines for two sodas and a sandwich. He recognised Rio’s scrawl instantly from all the letters they used to send each other. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Gotcha.</span>
  </em>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The pharmacy was busy for a Thursday. It seemed like every nearby office had poured in during their lunch breaks to get their sugar fix and meal. Rio and Billy were rushing back and forth along the counter trying to take and serve all the orders. She was still one-armed, which slowed them down slightly, but the injury seemed to give the customers a bit more patience. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take your time, dearie. You’re doing great.” The regulars had come to love Rio. She was efficient, charming, and always got their orders right. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha came in around 3pm when things died down. She sat at one of the stools. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have the night off to get settled at Lilia’s. I need you well rested for when we leave tomorrow around 11. The old broad arranged the vehicle for us - a four-seater Studebaker. I can’t wait to give it a spin. I heard it can hit 80 miles per hour!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t say! That’s really something.” Rio was impressed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy overheard and jumped in, “Can I have a turn driving this time? I’ve been practicing with Tommy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll see. Depends how gracious I feel.” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The front door bell dinged but none of them paid it any mind, thinking it was just another customer. The trio remained lost in their excitement as they discussed the upcoming trip. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m looking for Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hoarse voice carried through the shop. Lilia was looking at the man standing in front her. He was well over 6 feet tall, built like a brick shithouse, all hardened muscle and youthful arrogance. His slick black hair was plastered down and parted to the side. He had dark stubble covering his face and was wearing a sloppy, grey tweed suit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned quickly and stood from the stool. She glanced at Rio who looked like an icicle - completely frozen in place, and then at the man, who must be Tony. She walked over to him before he could say another word. “Rio is busy. She doesn’t want to see you right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He looked down at this unknown woman and spat out, “Who the fuck are you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone’s eyebrows shot up at the language and the audacity. Clearly this guy had no idea who he was speaking to. Rio was still stuck in place, looking like she had seen a ghost. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed the anger she felt and stood her ground, “Do you know why people call me Mother?" A silence fell in the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"It’s not because I have a strong maternal instinct or caring attitude. It’s because I’m the first thing many people </span>
  <em>
    <span>fear</span>
  </em>
  <span> from the moment they’re born.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I call the shots.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I run this house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>You better leave now before I wash that foul mouth out with soap.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tony shrank slightly at the lecture, but he was being boistored by his little liquid helper. His eyes fluttered around the store searching for reprieve. They landed on Rio at the counter, and he all but ran towards her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, mi vida. I’m taking you home!” He reached across to grab her hand, but she didn’t move. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her worlds colliding like a train crash. She looked at the towering figure of her past, Tony, reaching for her. He was all the memories of her youth, her dreams, her expectations in one. The life she had planned, the life her parents expected of her. She should feel grief at the loss of it all, but looking at him now she just felt pity. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then she looked at Agatha. The complete opposite in every imaginable way. She was the promise of something more, the hope for a life of freedom and autonomy. Her heart swelled at the look of fierce protection coming from the older woman. How could she miss her old life when this was the one waiting for her?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told you not to look for me.” Her voice finally arrived as Tony looked at her, his hand extended, waiting for her to take it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t belong here. You belong with me.” He waved her over - his impatience growing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy pulled Rio back gently and put himself in front of her. Tony probably had a good five inches on him and at least 50 pounds, but the teen didn’t like the way he was leering at Rio. He needed to protect his friend. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s not going with you.” His voice held authority despite his young age. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Move, pipsqueak.” Tony took a step to get behind the counter, but Agatha was there before he could get far. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tapped his shoulder, and he turned on her. “You’ve got ten seconds to leave before we call the cops.” She nodded toward the back room door where Lilia was standing with her finger on the rotary dial. “We have a fair few friends on the force who will be here at the drop of the hat, so unless you want to exit this joint in a pair of bracelets, I suggest you scram.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched him hesitate. She could tell he was at least a little drunk but not fully plastered, so he still had some cognitive skills. He tried to catch her eye, but she turned away. She had no interest in his empty words. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve got a lot of nerve for a dame.” He grumbled at Agatha as he passed her on his way out. “I’ll be waiting for you at home...our home!” He yelled out behind him.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio caught herself with her good arm as she almost collapsed onto the countertop. The encounter left her feeling raw and exposed. She was embarrassed that he had brought their issues here, to the place where she had felt the most safe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Billy? Can you take Rio down to the club?” Agatha tossed him the keys to the alley door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took Rio’s arm and led her out the back to the club while rubbing her back to keep her breathing steady. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia approached Agatha, “Did you contact Wanda already?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” Agatha was also trying to get her breathing under control. The adrenaline was rushing through her veins. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good. If you didn’t, I was going to offer. That man is dangerous.The way he looked at her…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They should be sending the message either today or tomorrow.” Agatha said. “I’ve got to go check on Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go.” Lilia stepped aside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha went down the stairs to the bar. She looked around and saw Rio and Billy sitting in a booth near the coat check. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll go back and help Lilia.” Billy scooted out of the booth and left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took his place beside Rio who was just staring down at her hands on the table. “Are you okay, bunny?” Her voice was soft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked up and her eyes met the brilliant blue ones looking at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re always there for me. You…you’ve done so much.” She thought she felt vulnerable when she was upstairs but down here, it felt magnified. This was a different sort of vulnerability. It felt like she was pulling her heart out and laying it out for Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I care very deeply for you, Rio. You make me feel…alive. I was happy before, or I thought I was. I felt like the Titanic - unsinkable, powerful, flying through the ocean like I owned it. But then you came along, an unassuming beautiful iceberg, and my whole sense of self is suddenly sinking. Everything I thought I wanted no longer makes sense. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I thought I was fine being alone. Ever since Ralph died, I was fine with little flings - nothing serious, nothing complicated. I thought I was happy keeping everyone at arm’s length, building up a protective barrier from the world. I wanted to keep things simple, easy. But now…now I want something different.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She slowly put her own hands over Rio’s and moved closer until their hips were touching in the booth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked at their hands together and then moved her gaze to meet Agatha’s adoring stare. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what do you want now?” She forced a swallow as her eyes flicked down to the beautiful red lips that were just inches away from hers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned over, and she heard the sharp intake of breath from Rio. She moved slowly, allowing her companion the chance to back out, but the younger woman stayed steady. The anticipation crackled in the air. The tension stretched like a rubber band. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When their lips finally met, Rio felt like her heart might give out entirely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had never understood the big deal about kissing. Her previous kisses were all fine, enjoyable at times, but she saw them as obligations or occasional pit stops on the way to something more. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kissing Agatha rewrote the definition of kissing in her mind’s dictionary. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could now understand why people did this over and over again, why people wrote songs about this. </span>
  <em>
    <span>This is what it’s meant to feel like?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She tilted her head and deepened the kiss. Their lips slid against each other in harmony, reminiscent of their shared dances together in this very space. Agatha brought her hands up to Rio’s face and tried to pour every unspoken feeling into her - all the lusting looks, the unresolved longing that had swirled around them for weeks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt the hands along the sides of her face, and she reached up to grip Agatha’s wrist to ground herself. She felt like at any moment she might float away. Like the pure ecstasy might lift her from the ground. The softness, the shameless want, the final tumble together into the unknown. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened her mouth and let her tongue begin to wander. Rio felt the ask without a word spoken between them, and she let her own tongue meet Agatha’s in a hot, wet embrace. It was messy in the best way -  complete raw passion in a singular moment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt Agatha moan into her mouth and the delicious vibration shot through her nervous system like lightning. Rio pulled back for a moment with a shudder to catch her breath. Her lungs felt completely empty, like Agatha had sucked her very soul out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was panting as well. The arousal was coursing through every single blood vessel and pooling between her thighs. Her hands were still on Rio’s face. She stroked the fading bruise with her thumb and leaned her forehead in until they were resting against each other, breathing in each other’s warm breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her heart pulsing and was certain Agatha must be able to feel it through her neck. She sat back and couldn’t wipe the smile from her face. She looked out the corner of her eye and saw that Agatha was also grinning like a fool. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you kidding me?” The boss finally broke the steamy silence between them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? Was that not-” Rio was suddenly worried. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop -” Agatha held up a hand to silence her. “I can’t believe we could have been doing this for weeks, and instead we were pussyfooting around each other like awkward teens with their first crushes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned a deep red and laughed at the bluntness, “I didn’t even know this was an option a few weeks ago, so blame yourself, doll.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why did I agree to let you move into Lilia’s place today?” Agatha cursed herself for that decision now and dropped her head into her hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Moving rather quickly now, aren’t you?” Rio beamed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I suppose you’re right. If we were to share a bed tonight...” Agatha licked her lips at the thought and felt Rio stiffen beside her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She continued, “But I guess we have our trip to look forward to. I’ll just have to try to behave myself in front of the innocent teen.” She ran a finger up and down Rio’s arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does he have to come?” Rio’s mind raced at the vulgar imagery that popped into her brain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh ho! Now who’s moving quickly?” Agatha laughed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shoved her shoulder over to knock her booth mate. Agatha bumped her back then couldn’t resist the opportunity to capture her lips once more as they connected again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their first kiss had been all passion and intensity - the culmination of extended yearning. This one was slow and tender. Rio moved her lips gently and tried to savor every taste of the incredible woman sitting beside her. She was as soft as silk and tasted like the mystery of a foggy night. Her perfume (Chanel no.5. She remembered seeing the elegant bottle in Agatha’s room) overwhelmed her and swept her into a landscape of roses and jasmine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every time she smelled this scent in the future it would jolt her back to this moment. The exact snapshot in time when she had her real first kiss. The first kiss to make her question her sanity because how had she lived this long without experiencing this level of bliss. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This time Agatha pulled away first, “I don’t want to pop this bubble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do we do now?” Rio’s chest was still heaving. Her desire was on full display across her features. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can name many things I want to do. But, we should probably go back upstairs. Don’t want to worry everyone.” Agatha couldn’t bring herself to let go of Rio’s hand. She didn’t want to break contact with her again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I mean, what do we do about..us?” Rio asked innocently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think it’s pretty clear. I’m stuck on you, Rio.” Agatha laid it out plainly. “Just one rule - no more dancing with hot blondes.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smile stretched from ear to ear. She didn’t want to think of the logistics, of how this would work, of what it all meant. She simply nodded enthusiastically and threw her arms around Agatha in a deep embrace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nothing else mattered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not yet. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Lilia’s apartment was just four blocks away from Agatha’s, so it didn’t take much effort for Rio to lug her stuff over. She was still riding the high of the kiss earlier that she didn’t even register the weight of her suitcase. </p><p>It was an eight-story building near the corner. The lower floors were a light stone and the upper floors were made of a faded red brick. The windows on the front had striking black Juliet balconies and a large glass awning stood over the front doors. While it lacked the luxury of Agatha’s place, it was just as impressive.</p><p>There was no doorman or elevator attendant, but the lobby was clearly well cared for. Lilia met her at the entrance and showed her the way up. She lived on the second floor, and they took the stairs up to a small U-shaped landing. There were four doors surrounding the space, and they entered the one with a #3. </p><p>Inside the door was a tight private hallway and directly across from the entrance was a small bedroom. </p><p>“You can put your things in there.” Lilia pointed to the room. </p><p>It was fairly spartan in decor. There was a single bed on one wall with a white metal bed frame. A large wooden dresser in one corner. An open closet space to the right of the door and a metal radiator under the window. The room was painted a warm cream and a dark wood picture rail lined each wall. </p><p>Rio placed her case in the closet and kept following Lilia down the hall. On the left was a short walkway to the bathroom and the door to what must be the main bedroom. At the end of the hall, there was an arched opening into the parlor. </p><p>It was covered in an extremely intricate, light green floral wallpaper. There was a precise, wood, tiered crown molding along the ceiling and lacquered wooden hardwoods on the floor, though it was hard to tell because there were several large rugs overlapping each other and covering most of the room. A white Queen Anne sofa dominated the center of the space with mismatched armchairs facing each other on either side. </p><p>A pair of mahogany bookshelves stood near the pocket doors into the dining room. Candles covered almost every visible surface from the shelves to the coffee table to the window sill. Circular wall sconces provided a very subtle light, and Rio felt like she was wrapped in a perfect, warm hug. </p><p>“I love it.” She remarked while trying to take in all the details. It was cluttered but not dirty - messy but not off-putting.  </p><p>“Thanks, dear. I’ve been here for over 25 years. It’s my home.” Lilia walked into the dining room. </p><p>There was a large circular oak table surrounded by six chairs of various styles and woods. Some high backed, some with arms, some fabric covered. It shouldn’t work yet…</p><p>There was a grand fireplace on the wall opposite the pocket door. An unexpected guest but Rio imagined all the dinner parties, night caps, or celebrations that must have happened in this room, warmed and lit by this tall, magnificent addition. Large spirling wood columns were built into its sides and twirled up to an intricate top frame that held a mirror. The mantle was also dotted with different candles and a beautiful clock. The hearth was black cast iron and surrounded by an arching green tile. </p><p>Out through the side door in the room and they were back in the main hallway. To the right was the practical kitchen. There was grey checkered tile and detailed cabinetry. There was a white gas range and an icebox in the corner. The walls had been painted a pleasing yellow, and it looked like homemade paintings were fighting for space against the array of hanging pots, pans, and utensils. </p><p>“Anything in the kitchen is up for grabs. I tend to cook every night, so I just ask that you contribute to the grocery fund. Let me know if you want to make anything, otherwise I’m happy to do so. That’s the tour. Your share of rent is $50 a month. Here’s your key.” She handed the spare over to Rio. </p><p>“I can’t thank you enough, Lilia. This means so much. I’ve never lived on my own before.” Rio fiddled with the little silver key and held in the tears. </p><p>“Don’t mention it. You’ve done so much for me, the shop, for Agatha. We’re all so grateful.” Lilia said and waved her off. </p><p>“Thanks. I’m going to go unpack my stuff.” Rio turned and walked back down the hall, feeling at peace in her new home. She sat on the bed and fell backwards. Her thoughts were still swirling from the feeling of Agatha’s hands on her face, her lips, her tongue. <em> God, that tongue. </em> </p><p>She shifted her body so her head was on the pillow and replayed the moment in her mind. One moment Tony was there, a sorry reminder of her past, an embarrassing testament to her mistakes. Then somehow, she was sitting down in the speakeasy with Billy, and just as suddenly Agatha was there by her side, showering her with adoration and care. </p><p>She remembered how Agatha had grasped her hand, how she had leaned in slowly, and Rio had panicked for a split second before deciding that nothing had ever felt more perfect than this. She had thrown all caution to the wind because if kissing Agatha was wrong, she never wanted to be right again. </p><p>Fuck every scripture, every rule, every taboo or cultural norm. </p><p>She would rather burn a thousand times over for the joy of Agatha’s company than live a traditional married life full of fear and regret with Tony.</p><hr /><p>It was Thursday evening, and Pietro, Clinton, and Wanda stood on the street outside Rio’s old apartment building. The two siblings were smoking and carefully watching the door. They saw all sorts of people walk in and out - children returning with parents, grandmothers off to the shops, couples heading out on the town. </p><p>Wanda rarely attended jobs anymore, but she was intrigued. Agatha never got involved with gang business. She kept her operation as clean as possible and never tangled with the enticing underworld, despite the power and profit it offered. It was baffling to her. Then this request out of the blue, Mother must be wrapped up in something, and she needed to know what. </p><p>“Do we know what this fella looks like?” Pietro asked between drags. </p><p>“Just a name and the apartment number. What time is it?” Wanda replied. </p><p>Her brother checked his watch, “5:50. Can we go? I’m bored.” </p><p>“Let’s go.” Wanda dropped her cig and snuffed it out with her heel. She picked up the leather bag beside her, and they all crossed the road. </p><p>Clinton examined the doors visible inside, “It must be upstairs. Come on.” He led the way up the stairwell. They kept climbing, searching for #25. </p><p>Wanda was huffing by the time they reached the fifth floor landing, “I wouldn’t have bothered if I knew there were going to be stairs.” She leaned against the wall to catch her breath. </p><p>“Here.” Pietro pointed to the door and leaned close to listen. “There are voices. I thought it was just one target?”</p><p>“It is.” Wanda furrowed her brow. <em> Was this a setup? Was this some sort of long awaited payback? </em></p><p>She opened the bag and pulled out the .38 caliber pistol and passed it to Pietro. She passed the pocket knife to Clinton and took the hunting knife for herself. The rosewood handle felt familiar in her hands, worn down from her father before her and now at home in her grip.</p><p>She counted them in.</p><p>“Three”</p><p>“Two”</p><p>“One”</p><p>Pietro kicked the door with the full force of his boot, and the flimsy wood splintered and flew open. A woman screamed. </p><p>They stormed inside and saw three people sitting at a dining table set for dinner. The smell of roast beef wafted through the compact apartment. </p><p>Wanda looked at the shocked faces in front of her. Everybody was too stunned at the sudden intrusion to move. Then, the woman yelled out, “Intruders!” and the two men jumped from their chairs, fists at the ready. </p><p>“Which one is Tony?” Wanda shouted.</p><p>“Huh?” The taller, built one looked at her with confusion. </p><p>She made eye contact with her brother and enforcer and pointed to him with authority. They nodded in understanding and surrounded him. </p><p>Pietro wrapped his arms around Tony to subdue him but underestimated his strength and was thrown off. Tony swung hard and connected with the gangster’s jaw causing him to fall to the floor in a daze. He shot up, yet Tony bashed him in the nose, causing blood to gush down his face dramatically. The gun fell just outside his reach. </p><p>The other man in the room had a fork in his hand and jabbed it hard into Clinton’s leg as Clinton was distracted upon seeing Pietro hit the floor. He groaned and pulled it out and felt the blood dripping down his pants. The man socked Clinton in the guts, and he keeled over in agony. He got kicked in the head and didn’t get up. </p><p>“Do I have to do everything?” Wanda mumbled to herself and stepped around the chaos. She grabbed the dark haired woman by the hair and held the knife to her throat. </p><p>“Nobody move or this one’s a goner.” She pulled the hair in her hand and the woman yelped. The man who was not Tony cried out, “Claudia! No!” but Wanda pressed the knife harder until a drop of blood formed, and he stopped. </p><p>The two men both put their hands up, glancing at each other. </p><p>“We just want Tony. So I’m going to let you and your little boyfriend go. You,” She pointed to the big man, their target. “You stay.”</p><p>She released her hold on Claudia and her man rushed to her side. They looked back in horror as they ran from their apartment. “You saw nothing!” Wanda yelled after them. </p><p>Clinton was still motionless on the floor. Tony was still standing in the middle of the room, arms raised. Pietro was rubbing his jaw and leaning against the table.</p><p>“Check on the man down.” She spoke to Pietro and watched him shake Clinton’s body. He slowly rose to sitting but was clearly injured. His eyes were glassy and unfocused.  </p><p>“What-What do you want from me?” Tony spoke finally.</p><p>“Sit.” Wanda replied. She kicked the bag over to Pietro, who pulled out the rope and began tying their victim to the dining chair. </p><p>“A little birdie told us that you get a little too handsy with your girl. The police may not care about these sorts of things, but we don’t think kindly of men who resort to violence like that.” Wanda’s voice was hauntingly calm.</p><p>“Who told you that?” Tony asked.</p><p>Wanda looked at Pietro and nodded once. He lifted his arm and delivered a loud backhand smack against Tony’s face. </p><p>“We ask the questions here.” Wanda replied. </p><p>“I didn’t mean to hurt Rio. I…I got mad. I shouldn’t have-It was an accident!” He blubbered in the chair. </p><p><em> Rio, now that’s an interesting name. </em> Wanda saved that nugget for later. She nodded to her twin again. </p><p>This time Pietro wound up for a swift punch to the stomach. All the air left Tony’s lungs as he folded in on himself. </p><p>“So, was that an accident? Is he just accidently punching you?” Wanda’s sarcasm knew no limits.</p><p>Pietro pulled Tony’s hair so he was sitting back again. “I’m sorry.” He sputtered out the words slowly. </p><p>“You have no idea how many times I’ve heard that before.” Wanda walked over to the bag on the floor and dropped the knife in. She swapped it for a large metal pipe wrench.</p><p>“Why are you doing this?” Tony couldn’t stop himself.</p><p>Wanda smiled and held a hand up to stop Pietro who was preparing to deal another blow. “You’ve pissed off the wrong person, mac.”</p><p>She held the wrench in both hands, “Now then, Tony. How can we be sure that this doesn’t happen again? How can I trust you to keep your hands off of this…Rio?”</p><p>“She left. It’s done. I’ll - I promise that…I promise not to go looking for her again.” His eyes kept flickering to the wrench and back up to the intimidating woman bearing down on him. </p><p>“Do you believe him, Pietro?” She asked in a sickly sweet tone.</p><p>Her brother had blood caked down his face from the bloody nose, courtesy of the man in the chair. “Hmmm, I don’t know. I think he needs something to remind him.” He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and stuffed it into Tony’s mouth. </p><p>“You know what? You’re right. Let’s remind him to keep his hands to himself.” </p><p>She lifted the wrench in a graceful arc above her head and let it fall with punishing speed straight down across the top of Tony’s right hand that was tied to the arm of the chair. </p><p>She felt the bones crunch beneath the hardened metal and heard the muffled screams of the man in front of her. His eyes looked at risk of popping out of his head with strain. </p><p>“Do you think he gets the message?” She looked to her twin for approval. Pietro was a frightening sight at that moment and considered the request. </p><p>“One more?” He asked with a terrifying gleam in his eyes.</p><p>“Hmmm.” Wanda tapped a finger against her cheek, the wrench dangling from her other hand with nonchalance. “What do you think, Tony?”</p><p>“Mmmhpphhmmh!” His yells were captured by the hankie in his mouth. The cries were unintelligible. Uncontrolled tears and sweat were dripping down his face. </p><p>“I can’t tell, Pietro. Do you think he’s saying he wants another?” Wanda loved the thrill of the game. </p><p>“You know what? I’m feeling generous.” She ran her perfectly painted red nails through his damp locks - the juxtaposition of the sensual motion with her unhinged violence was throwing Tony’s head for a loop. </p><p>“If you ever touch a single hair on your girl’s head, we’ll be back...” She leaned in slowly, and for a second he thought she was about to kiss him, but she dodged his lips and whispered into his ear, “with a meat cleaver instead.” </p><p>She felt Tony holding his breath and turned to her brother, “Give Clinton a hand, let’s go.” She dropped the wrench into the bag and zipped it up. </p><p>As the trio was exiting the apartment, she heard Tony attempt to call out. “Did you think we were going to untie you?” She spoke over her shoulder. “Have a good long think about your actions. Goodnight, darling.” </p><p>Watching Clinton struggle down the stairs and the damage to her twin’s face, Wanda sighed heavily and gripped the bannister tightly. Agatha owed her so much more than a few gallons of hooch.</p><hr /><p>It was Friday morning and Rio was just finishing off packing the essentials in a smaller suitcase on loan from her roommate. She was itching to see Agatha again and was nervously excited at their upcoming trip. She had no clue what awaited them on the road. </p><p>That morning Lilia had already taken her back to the doctor to check up on her arm. He said it was progressing well and reset the splint. Just one more week and it should be free again. </p><p>The doorbell rang out. </p><p>“Please, Agatha, can I drive the first leg? I promise I can handle it.” Rio heard Billy’s pleas as soon as they entered the apartment. </p><p>“No way, teen. I’ll get us out of the city. You can take the long middle and switch off with Rio.” Agatha’s patience was already wearing thin. Maybe she should have ditched the kid, but he was hard to deny.</p><p>“What’s the drive time again?” Rio popped out of her room and joined the chat. She relished the look of joy that lit up Agatha’s face upon seeing her again.</p><p>“Usually takes a little over 6 hours if the road is clear.” Billy responded. They all walked into the living room together where Lilia was drinking a cup of tea. </p><p>“Where did you park the buggy?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Down the side alley, across the street. Key’s there.” She pointed at the coffee table, and Agatha pocketed it. “Same setup as usual, you know what to do. I’ve also sent a telegram to Jean-Paul so he’s expecting you.” </p><p>“Thanks, boss. Don’t worry, the kid and I are masters of the road now.” She cracked her knuckles and smiled at Rio. </p><p>“Nonetheless, be careful. Don’t get careless, and most importantly, don’t get caught.” Lilia warned them with a serious tone. </p><p>“Aye, Aye Captain.” Agatha saluted the older woman. “Come on, kids. Let’s hit the road!” </p><p>They said their goodbyes and took the stairs down to the street. They found the car easily and piled their light cases in the back. It was a slick, black four-door model with an enclosed passenger compartment, and the interior was incredibly roomy. Agatha took the driver’s seat, Rio also sat in the front, and Billy took the second row. </p><p>“Ready? Last chance to run.” Agatha looked at her two partners in crime, then started the car. The engine roared, and they could feel the power vibrating beneath them. </p><p>“Wow.” Rio remarked.</p><p>“Yeah, this baby’s got juice. Can’t wait to really let it fly.” Agatha pulled out, and they were on their way. </p><p>Rio looked over and studied Agatha’s focused profile as she drove them out of the city. She was a thing of beauty. Her jawline was as sharp as glass, it might as well have been sculpted from the finest marble by the Italian masters. Her lips were delicate and painted her signature red shade. Rio admired her prominent cheekbones and imperfect line of her nose. She adored her wild brown hair that she kept long, even as every other woman (including herself) was opting for the bob. </p><p>“Did I smudge my eyeliner or something?” Agatha glanced sideways, feeling Rio’s obvious stare on her. </p><p>“No, no. I was just - taking in the view.” Rio tried to look out the window instead and admire the city passing them by. Agatha dropped one of her hands from the wheel and grabbed Rio’s tightly. </p><p>“I love riding in a car, seeing all the buildings and people blur as we pass them - so amazing!” Billy was engrossed in the backseat. </p><p>Agatha was stroking Rio’s hand with her thumb as they sat in silence. Such a simple gesture, but Rio felt like electricity was sparking between them, like she could touch a lightbulb and it would illuminate. She smiled like an idiot as she watched the road unfold in front of the car. </p><p>Billy suddenly turned forward and leaned both his arms over the front seat, “Soooo, what should we-” His voice cut off in a gasp as he brought a hand to his mouth in dramatic fashion.</p><p>“Oh. My. God!!!” </p><p>He pointed a finger at their clasped hands and then at both of them in quick succession. “Why didn’t anyone tell me!? When did this happen? Give me every detail!”</p><p>Agatha groaned, “Take a deep breath before you hyperventilate, teen.” </p><p>“Who made the first move?” Billy had laid his head on his hands along the top of the front row backrest. He was grinning like a little school girl. </p><p>Rio let out an exasperated laugh, “I think it’s been coming for a while.”</p><p>“Yeah duh, a blind man could have seen this coming. Who kissed who?” </p><p>“This isn’t gossip hour with Agatha and Rio.” Agatha pointed out. </p><p>“Um, I would pay good money to listen to that radio show. Come on, we have so many hours to kill. What else is there to talk about? This is the best news I’ve heard in…my life!” Billy pleaded with the women. </p><p>“Will you shut up about it?” Agatha asked. </p><p>Billy sat back finally and pretended to hold his lips closed. </p><p>“Fine, we don’t have much else to do. Do you want to start, doll?” She looked to Rio. </p><p>“Where do I start?” She was still holding Agatha’s hands. The feeling was too intoxicating to release. </p><p>“What did you think when you first saw each other?” Billy piped up quickly then fell back again. </p><p>“Well, I hit her with the door the first time we met, so it wasn’t exactly love at first sight. I was taken aback by her beauty, but I was also so intimidated and scared that I can’t remember if I even said anything intelligible at the time.” Rio recalled the memory. </p><p>“I think I was too angry to register much - it wasn’t my best day. I thought she was some lost, careless customer, but I remembered those doe eyes so distinctly. There was something about her though. It made me want to learn more.” </p><p>“When did you know you were a goner?” Billy was in heaven. </p><p>“Easy for me. That first night in the club. When I saw your hips roll on the dance floor, I was done for. Cause of death - the salsa.” Agatha watched as Rio seemed to melt into the seat.</p><p>“It wasn’t one moment for me. It was a thousand little steps down until I was tumbling. The way she called me ‘bunny,’ the way her eyes always locked on to me, how she was always protecting me. I never thought…never knew that women could…I mean - I just didn’t know someone could make me feel like this.” Rio didn’t know if she captured all she wanted to say but she saw the huge grin on Agatha’s face and felt like she had won something. </p><p>Billy was bouncing in his seat and kicking his feet. “I’m obsessed.” </p><p>“Get in line.” Agatha fired back. </p><p>“So are you two…a couple now?” He continued with his line of questioning. </p><p>Rio looked at Agatha sweetly. They hadn’t discussed their relationship in depth yet. The kiss had clearly kicked things up a notch, but she didn’t know what Agatha’s expectations were or how these things worked. She had only had one boyfriend back in school, and then she had been in her last relationship for over 5 years. </p><p>“We’re taking things slow.” Agatha said. “It’s still brand new, let us figure it out first.”</p>

  <p>
  <span>“Are we there yet?” Rio asked aloud to no one. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want to keep poking the bear?” Agatha replied with exasperation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The car ride had been uneventful so far. Billy had finally given up the interrogation of their relationship and fell asleep. They were about two hours in and feeling restless. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m hungry.” Rio whined back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine, we’re just pulling into Saratoga Springs now. I know there’s a good lunch counter downtown.” She took a detour off the main road and pulled into the quaint town. She knew the city was a hotspot for horse racing and rejuvenating mineral springs, but it also had one of her favorite sandwiches in the state. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio leaned back and jostled the sleeping teen, “Wake up, we’re getting lunch!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh? Are we already there?” Billy groggily asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t ask me that.” Agatha rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They rolled down the main street and parked outside a bustling restaurant, The Comfort Kitchen. They were seated at a table near the center of the packed space. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The chicken salad sandwich here is to die for.” Agatha pointed it out on the menu. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What can I get everyone to drink?” An older gentleman in a bowtie stood waiting for their orders. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy was still blinking his eyes, waking up, “A chocolate phosphate, please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed at his sweet tooth then looked at the server, “Black coffee.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A grape lemonade, thank you.” Rio would hardly admit it, but she loved a fruity drink. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did I miss anything during my nap?” Billy looked between them with accusation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like what?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I dunno. Any heartfelts love confessions, declarations of adoration, steamy kisses?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two women looked at each other and dissolved with giggles, grabbing the other’s arms for something to hold on to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t a moving picture, mac. We’re not some Hollywood romance story.” The boss knew how Billy loved going to the cinema. He had seen almost every picture that came out this year. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are to me! I’m invested now. It’s not like I’ve got much going on this front…” He looked forlorn but brightened quickly as the waiter brought out their drinks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happened with Eddie?” Agatha asked. She thought she had seen him flirting with the young lad who visited the pharmacy for lunch most days.   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? Eddie? He’s just a customer.” He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha could see the subtle blush on his cheeks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even Rio jumped in now, “Billy, you can’t be that oblivious. He fawns over you! Every time you serve him a soda, he can barely make eye contact, then as soon as you turn away, all he does is stare. He always gets there early to get a seat next to the fountain, which is conveniently where you stand most of the time. He stays way past when he finishes his drink. Come on!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy sipped his sweet drink and the bright pink was now very visible as his cheeks caved in around the straw. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know we don’t normally allow teens downstairs, but if you want to give him the password, I could perhaps let it slide.” Agatha offered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really? Do you think he would actually come?” Billy asked nervously. He loved his parents and his twin with his whole heart, but he couldn’t discuss anything like this with them. They just wouldn’t get it. They thought he worked at a late-night restaurant, not a secret speakeasy that catered towards ‘deviants’ and ‘freaks’ as many would call them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He had always felt different from the other boys around him. While they couldn’t shut up about the Yankees, the war, and pilots, he was much more interested in the budding actresses of cinema, the latest dance crazes, and the ever-changing fashion trends. His family just didn’t understand, but his work family was his safe haven. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’d be a fool to turn you down. It couldn’t hurt to ask.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When we get back, maybe. I’ll think about it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They ordered a selection of sandwiches and chatted casually between bites. Agatha covered the bill before they headed out again. She threw the keys to the kid as they walked along the sidewalk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No way! Are you sure?” Billy was bouncing already. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get in before I change my mind.” Agatha smiled and took the passenger seat while Rio hopped in the back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He managed to get back on the road without incident. It was only when merging onto the main road that Agatha had to grab the wheel to prevent them from colliding with a speeding cop car. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy’s chest was heaving, and he was gripping the steering wheel like it was a lifesaver and he was on the brink of drowning. The other two in the car were also shaken, and they all sat in silence for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, if you’re going to hit something, let’s try to avoid the police next time. We’re driving a car that’s illegally rigged for bootlegging, so…” Agatha broke the tension. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I’ve aged ten years.” Rio was clinging to the top of the front seat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Trying to catch up to me, darling?” Agatha reached behind and caressed Rio’s hand softly. They shared a smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t see them coming. Do you want to take over, Rio?” Billy’s voice was unsteady and panicked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Relax, teen. You’re doing fine. That cop was definitely speeding. Rules for thee but not for me. Keep going.” Agatha reassured him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The time passed quickly thanks to the easy conversation that flowed between them all. They swapped drivers after another few hours around Plattsburgh when they filled up on gas. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt nervous behind the roaring power of this unfamiliar vehicle, but it really was like muscle memory and she settled quickly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Soooo…” Billy always had something to say. “Anyone got any fun scars? I’ve got a couple on my back. I tried stealing some bread from a bakery when Tommy and I were staying in the Bronx. The old bastard owner caught me, tackled me to the ground as I ran for it, and then beat me with a wooden spoon. Left some nasty marks. What about you Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ever heard of the Daughters of Liberty?” Agatha asked to a silent response. She rolled up one of her sleeves and showed off a deep scar. “Knitting needle to the elbow.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gasped as she took in the old injury. “Do I dare ask how?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bunch of teetotaling puritans. It was right after we opened the bar. A group of 40 of these women came with their protest signs, praying and standing in the alley. They were blocking the door so nobody could get in. Carrying on about ‘the devil’s drink’, yadda yadda. I wasn’t about to let a gaggle of grannies stop me from getting into my own club. How was I meant to know they were armed with sharp pointy things?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I pushed and shoved as many as I could out of the way until one lunatic ran at me with her knitting needles. I put my arm up and one sunk right in. The rest panicked and dispersed. Luckily Lilia was there to stop the bleeding because it was a nasty sight.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, that’s iconic.” Billy was hanging onto every word. “Did they ever come back?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After that debacle, nope. I think they decided to pick a different mark, and there are plenty of others in the city.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio? Any scar stories?” Billy turned to the driver. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Besides my emotional damage?” She quipped and Agatha chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmmm…nothing too exciting. I tend to heal pretty quickly. I do have one on the back of my thigh. I was playing baseball as a kid in a lot in the neighborhood. They always stuck me in the outfield because I was the only girl, but one day, this kid Gabriel crushed a fastball, and it looked like it was a goner. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I sprinted for the fence, determined to steal his thunder. I was looking over my shoulder and jumped for the ball. Unfortunately the chain link fence was higher than I thought, and one of my legs came straight down on top of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other two in the car groaned aloud at the painful thought. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, not my best work. I didn’t even catch the ball, so I had to watch that smug fool rounding the bases and celebrating while I was yelling for help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Awwwww, my poor little ballplayer.” Agatha wished she could have seen the younger version of her crush. She wanted to know every story of her childhood, every memory that would help fill in the narrative of her life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They only had an hour left when they played musical chairs again and swapped seats. Agatha took up the anchor spot and drove them over the border and into Montreal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The car slowed to a stop finally outside an impressive brick warehouse just as the sun was beginning to set. Northstar Distilling was painted in gigantic letters across the front of the building. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A beautiful, tall man walked out of the front door. He had black medium length hair, parted down the middle and loosely hanging by his face. He looked dapper in a three-piece, navy suit with a fancy patterned vest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Salut, ma chérie!” He immediately hugged Agatha as she exited the vehicle and gave her a kiss on each cheek. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jean-Paul! How are you, darling?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Très bien - so well. How are you? Who are your friends?” He replied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah yes.” They moved to the front door and gathered around. “This is Rio, and you remember Billy from last time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enchanté.” He grasped each of their hands warmly. “Come, come. Let’s get inside. Kyle is preparing dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was dark inside, but he led them up a flight of metal stairs. They entered a nondescript door and were in a homey, converted apartment. The smell of frying meat made Rio’s stomach rumble loudly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Glad you brought your appetites from America too. We’re having poulet chasseur, or ‘hunter’s chicken’, a classic in my household growing up.” They followed Jean-Paul into the quaint dining space and took their seats around the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio and Agatha sat next to each other. Billy sat next to Jean-Paul across from them, and there was an empty seat at the head of the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another man stuck his head into the room from what must be the kitchen. His dark brown skin and curly black hair was a beautiful contrast to the casual, cream wool sweater he had on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bonjour, dinner will be ready in just a tick!” He popped back to work. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How was the drive?” Jean-Paul asked as he poured water for everyone, looking at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Same old. Nothing new to report. How’s business up here?” She asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Booming. We can barely keep up with the demand these days. The factory is churning out bottles, and they are sold before they even screw on the top. All you bloody Americans can’t get enough. I swear, this ban has turned you all into raging alcoholics.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The table laughed. He wasn’t wrong. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you blame us? People always want what they can’t have.” She put a hand on Rio’s leg and squeezed gently. She watched the smile spread across her face out of the corner of her eye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dinner is served!” Kyle entered the room with a large cast iron cooking pot. He opened the lid and the steam billowed out with a flourish. The smell was intoxicating. He then brought out a serving dish of creamy mashed potatoes and a large baguette.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s mouth was watering. It all looked so rich and delicious. Upon first bite of the chicken with the sumptuous tomato sauce, she held back the moan that threatened to escape her lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is incredible, Kyle! Are you sure you’re not a chef?” Billy was tearing into the bread and soaking up the decadent sauce on his plate. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe someday, though I’m quite happy working with Jean-Paul on the business operations here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This place would crumble without Kyle at the helm. He helps steer this ship and keep us on course. I may know a thing or two about production, but he handles all the sales, advertising, accounting. What don’t you know, darling?” He looked longingly over at the man seated at the head of the table. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh, so they’re- Ohhhh. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio finally realized. She felt Agatha’s hand still resting on her leg and dropped her own hand so she could hold it. They intertwined their fingers between their chairs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just a few months ago, if someone had asked Rio about homosexuality, she wouldn’t have known what to think. She had heard her family refer to it as the work of the devil. She had read in the paper about arrests of perverts and ‘bohemians’ or charges of ‘gross indecency’ or ‘corrupt morals.’ Men were locked away for it or even put to death. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everything seemed to point that this was wrong, illegal, but sitting here with these two lovers, with this incredible woman, with this young man, how could it be wrong?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long have you two been…um, I mean…” Rio’s curiosity won out as she attempted to ask a question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A pair?” Kyle tried to finish her sentence, and she nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He turned to his partner, “Do you want to take this one, mon beau? I know how you love to tell it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jean-Paul cleared his throat comically and grinned, “Well,” he clapped his hands, “I was skiing with some friends on Mont Sainte-Anne about five years ago. I was cutting down the slope and was near the lodge at the bottom when I thought I heard someone yell. I stop and clip out of my skis and try to listen. I hear it again and run as fast as I can into the treeline. I see one of the kitchen workers against a tree and a lone grey wolf staring him down, licking its chops.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The whole table was enraptured. Billy’s jaw dropped and Rio covered her mouth. Agatha had clearly heard the tale before, but she loved it every time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was afraid to call out in case the wolf targeted me instead. I took in the man and despite the impending doom, I was captivated by his beauty. His well-defined goatee, his build, his tight curly mop of hair.” Jean-Paul continued. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only a man could ignore a hungry wolf to ogle a stranger.” Agatha chimed in to laughs all around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look at him!” He gestured both hands at Kyle in reverence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anyway, I still had my ski poles around my wrists, so I held both of them out like swords and approached cautiously. Kyle saw me before the wolf did and made a slight movement to keep it distracted. I ran at it like a madman to try to scare it, and I caught it by surprise. It must have jumped a meter in the air when it saw me appear, and it quickly retreated back into the woods. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I turned to introduce myself and made it just in time to catch the falling man in my arms. You could say I knocked him off his feet.” Jean-Paul winked at his lover. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or…you could more accurately say that I fainted from the rush of adrenaline and fear that I was about to die, but sure, whatever you want to tell yourself.” Kyle added his side of the story, and everyone laughed again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I carried him into the lodge, and the other kitchen staff told me his name and called in a doctor. I waited around for him to wake up, then invited him to my cabin for a meal. I didn’t know if he would be interested, if he was single, or anything about him, but after that experience, it felt like we were bonded, like we had experienced a singular event together that nobody would ever understand.” He was staring at Kyle with pure adoration and they were holding hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was in awe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Long story short, the dinner went well, and we’ve been inseparable ever since. Every year has been better than the last together.” Kyle broke eye contact and wrapped it all up with a bow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow, that’s the dream.” Billy sighed with longing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would have skipped the wolf part, that was a nightmare! But then again, if that never happened, maybe we never would have met at all.” Kyle said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt Agatha caressing her hand with her thumb and wondered if this life could happen for them. A life of partnership and love, living together, working together. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Is this why she brought me along? Did she want to show me what’s possible?</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The thoughts revolved around her head. It was all so new. She didn’t know what she wanted yet but knowing that just maybe it was an option made her heart swell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enough sappiness for now.” Jean-Paul wiped his mouth with a napkin and pushed his plate away. “How much are you planning to take with you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How much do you reckon we can fit?” Agatha trusted his extensive knowledge of both cars and whisky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That was a Studebaker, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, a Big Six.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very nice. We’ve had a few runners in that rig. What’s the setup? Same as before?” He asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Similar. False bottom, false trunk. There’s also false door panels on this one.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He thought for a while and conferred with Kyle while the others sat waiting. “Based on past runs, we can probably fit 100 gallons, but we won’t know exactly until we start loading it. Could probably do a bit more but don’t want to weigh you down too much. I know the cops aren’t likely to pull over ladies, but it’s best not to risk it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked impressed and nodded, “Works for us. We’ll bring the car around tomorrow morning. How long will it take?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kyle answered this time, “We’ve got about twelve others in front of you. You know you’re our favorite, but we’re just going in order of arrival, sorry doll. So if all goes well it should be done by 4pm at the latest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No worries, we hadn’t planned to leave until Sunday anyway. I can show these two around town.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We booked you into the hotel along the Lachine Canal. Just a few minutes drive away. I thought it was just going to be you and Billy, so I booked two rooms. Je regrette.” Jean-Paul grimaced slightly at the mistake, but he caught the teasing look that the two women shared upon hearing the news. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or…maybe I should be saying, ‘de rien’ or ‘you’re welcome’?” He crossed his hands in front of him and leaned his chin on them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha blushed, “Watch yourself, monsieur.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oooooooo, Mother’s got a crush! You’ve been holding out on us.” Jean-Paul reminded Rio of Billy when he found out about them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And how! This is too cute.” Kyle swooned as well. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh shush you two. You’re gonna scare my girl.” Agatha pretended to swat them away with her hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt electric at the words ‘my girl’ when they left Agatha’s mouth. She had always resented when Tony staked a claim to her and described her like he owned her. Now, it felt special. Like she was a prize, and Agatha was so proud to be holding the trophy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Before you go, here’s a little welcome gift. You might have to miss out, Billy, but these two will surely enjoy this.” Jean-Paul got up and grabbed the bag that was sitting on the side table in the room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A taster of what you’re getting.” He added. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened the bag and pulled out two medium bottles of whisky.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The red label is something new. We’re trying out a rye whisky. It’s slightly lighter, a perfect mixer for cocktails. And the black label is the classic Northstar, but that batch has been aging for a decade now. It’s more complex in flavor yet mellow. Would love your thoughts.” Jean-Paul leaned in to kiss her farewell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The crew said their goodbyes and thanked the pair for a delicious dinner before driving off to the nearby hotel. In the lobby, the elderly woman at the counter passed over two metal keys and pointed them to the rooms on the ground floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll drop the car off at 9, Billy. Goodnight!” Agatha watched him enter his room next door as Rio opened up their room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a good size with a queen bed in the center and an en suite. Rio placed her bag on the floor and immediately flopped onto the bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m beat. Who knew sitting for so long could be this exhausting?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha fell down beside her and laid her head on her own outstretched arm. “Too tired to do…anything?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled widely and turned her body to face the woman beside her. </span>
  <em>
    <span>How is this my life? </span>
  </em>
  <span>She thought with glee.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well don’t go putting words in my mouth.” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha scooted her body forward on the bed, so they were almost touching. “All I’ve been thinking about for the past day is putting something else in your mouth.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She closed the distance between them slowly. She knew Rio might still be hesitant about her, about this, so she tried to temper herself. As much as she wanted to jump on top of Rio and straddle her hips, she also knew that they were taking it slow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to kiss me again or keep me waiting all night?” The question broke her out of her slow approach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened her eyes and saw Rio smirking at her. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh, so that’s how she wanted to play it? Okay, two can play that game.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She surged forward, and their lips connected like magnets. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha kissed in the same way she moved through the world - with purpose. Every flick of her tongue, every turn of the head, every little nip with her teeth. Everything was done with searing confidence and conviction. She took control because that’s just what she did. It’s who she was. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>However, Rio wasn’t her usual prey. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Where most of the women she took to bed were happy, willing even, to submit to her every whim. Rio pushed back. She seemed to run on instinct and impulse.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha never ceded control in the bedroom. Even with Ralph, she would normally have to ride herself to conclusion in the moments before he finished. And with her regular flings, she was the driver. Always. Forever the one dictating the other where to move, where to lick, where to suck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Rio hated being told what to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My neck, please. Kiss my neck.” Agatha’s breathy moans called out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here?” Rio bent down and left a searing kiss right below her ear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, lower.” Agatha was desperate for it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here?” Rio dropped down to the meeting point between neck and shoulder and left a tiny bite on the soft skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha grimaced. Rio was purposefully disobeying her now and relishing in it. She leaned back and her tone changed to one of power. “Rio, if you don’t suck my neck right now…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They locked eyes, and it was like an Old Western duel. Who would be the one to draw first? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then out of nowhere, a cough echoed in the room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both quickly sat up like they had been shocked and looked around. It sounded like someone was in the room with them. They shot out of bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha ran to the window to check behind the curtains, and Rio looked curiously in the bathroom. A minute passed in silence. Neither of them moving. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ummm, just so you know. These walls are…very thin! Sorry!!!” Billy’s voice burst through the sexual tension like dynamite. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh my god.” Rio mouthed to Agatha, mortified. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, pet.” Agatha yelled back at the wall connecting their rooms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stared at each other - chests still heaving, hair all askew, lips red with want - then broke down into giggles. The absurdity was suddenly hilarious. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How am I going to look at that poor innocent teen in the face again?” Rio whispered when they finally caught their breaths again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’ll be fine. We barely did anything. There was certainly a lot more he could have heard if he hadn’t interrupted.” Agatha whispered back. She ran a hand across Rio’s shoulders as she walked across the room to her bag. She grabbed her night clothes and went to take a bath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, that’s it? No more fun?” Rio called after her as quietly as she could manage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Unless you want to give the kid a naughty show, we’re better off just going to bed. Don’t worry, we have time. All the time in the world.” Agatha closed the bathroom door and tried to cool off from the unsatisfied heat that ran through her body. This was going to be more challenging than she thought. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>They dropped the car off in the morning, and Jean-Paul insisted they take his breezer around town, to which Agatha wasn’t about to complain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let’s go see Old Montreal. I hear it’s the cat’s pajamas.” Billy threw his idea out there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re driving.” Agatha responded. She was happy to pass the responsibility off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You trust me?” Billy looked like a child on Christmas day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t make me regret it.” She took shotgun and Rio jumped in the back. The spring breeze felt incredibly refreshing on her face as they drove through the city. The new convertible was a dream to drive. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was only a short while until they reached the old part of the city. The historic buildings were a stark contrast to the skyscrapers and style they were used to in New York. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jean-Paul told us before that this part of the city was built in the 1600s. It’s unlike any other place on this continent. It looks like the photographs I’ve seen of Paris. Pull over here, Billy.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They got out along a nondescript street and started walking. Agatha led the pack, as usual. She seemed to know exactly where to go. They arrived in a large square with a prominent statue in the center and an imposing church at the other end. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s the Notre-Dame Basilica - one of the most beautiful buildings I’ve ever seen. Come on!” Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand and pulled her across the square. Billy ran after them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was glad she hadn’t brought gloves because the feel of Agatha’s hand in hers was exhilarating. She had held hands with many girl friends in the past, as was common at the time, but the secret she shared with the woman next to her made this regular gesture feel scandalous. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They approached the staggering, Gothic church from the front, and Rio took in the towering, twin spires, the trio of pointed arches, and the delicately carved statues along the facade. It was not unlike many of the historic churches in the city, so she wasn’t sure why Agatha had brought them here. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was until they entered the building, and her breath stopped. The ceiling sang to her as if it were a chorus from heaven itself. The soaring, vaulted interior was painted a deep, rich blue and dotted with golden stars, all coalescing to three wide rose windows that flooded the space with reverent light. The floor mirrored the bright blue and gold design, and the stained glass windows bounced colors throughout the space. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt tears forming in her eyes at the sheer beauty of it all. The intricately carved wooden pews, the twisting, hand-painted columns, the towering statues behind the pulpit. She tried to absorb every beautiful detail, and as she spun in place, she noticed one person wasn’t taking in the view like everybody else. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was staring at </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> the way she was staring at the ceiling. Like she was the work of architectural brilliance. Like she had been hand-sculpted over a hundred years ago by the hands of master artists. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And perhaps it was the stunning blues that encompassed the room or maybe the work of the divine, but Agatha’s steely blue eyes were glowing the most blazing sapphire in color. Rio had to fight every urge inside her to run over and kiss those lips with the full force of her veneration and outpouring of awe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, she strolled over, and Agatha gently caressed the side of her face and wrapped her other hand around the back of her head before pulling her into an intimate hug. She closed her eyes at the feeling, which somehow rivaled the intensity of the visionary masterwork that surrounded them. Agatha sighed into the embrace, and she felt the arms around her like a warm blanket - protective, comforting, safe. She pulled away gently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s so beautiful.” She whispered quietly. Her eyes tracing the arcs of the ceiling again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you are.” Agatha replied. Her gaze never leaving the beauty of the woman in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The group spent the rest of the morning sight-seeing in the historic part of Montreal and had a light lunch of sandwiches by the docks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How do we kill the afternoon?” Rio asked between bites of her ham sandwich. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can we see a movie?” Billy looked to Agatha expectantly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think there is a brand new picture house that is supposed to be a real stunner. I read about it in the paper this morning.” She explained. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy took the wheel again and drove them towards the Little Italy neighborhood. They found the Théâtre Plaza easily as the large sign on the roof was visible from streets away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ahhhh!!!” Billy screamed when he saw the marquee of pictures. “They have Nosferatu! Oh my gosh, Tommy was able to catch a one-off screening in Brooklyn, but I missed out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What in god's name is a nosferatu?” Agatha watched the boy jumping in place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gasped audibly, “Have you read Dracula?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha said ‘no’ while Rio simultaneously said ‘yes.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s a German adaptation of the novel. Tommy had to sleep with the lamp on for a week straight after watching it! I can’t believe it’s showing here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t come crying to us at night if you get too scared.” Agatha warned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They passed their coins over for three tickets and settled into the velvet seats of the picture palace. The room darkened as the movie began. A pianist sat on the side of the stage to provide music accents, and there was a live narrator to translate the German text on screen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was slow at the start, but as the main character entered the castle of Count Orlak, Rio felt Agatha reach over and grip her hand tightly. As night fell in the film and the vampire appeared for the first time, she leaned into Agatha, and they grasped at each other for comfort. She glanced over and saw Billy covering his eyes with his sleeve. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She relished the feeling of Agatha’s arm around her. Despite the horrors unfolding on screen, she loved that she could openly hold Agatha in public like this. Billy was cowering in his seat as the vampire went to attack the wife and drink her blood. She reached out and offered a hand, which he grabbed desperately. The two women shared a quiet laugh at their sweet companion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the curtains closed and they exited the cinema, the sun hit them with full force. Luckily it didn’t cause them to disappear in a puff of smoke like Count Orlak, but it felt just as violent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I may have made a mistake.” Billy admitted as they walked to the car. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think? I thought you were going to have a heart attack in there when the monster appeared.” Agatha’s laugh rang out on the street. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy held his hand up in defeat, “You gotta admit that was pretty scary though, right? Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I liked it.” Rio said. “You were right - I’ve never seen anything like that before. The company wasn’t half bad either.” She playfully elbowed Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They drove back at around 3:30 pm to check on the progress of their car and its new cargo. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha, mon chaton! What timing. The team just secured the last case in your vehicle. It should be all set.” Jean-Paul was overseeing the meticulous operation on the warehouse floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perfect!” Agatha clapped her hands. “And how much were they able to fit?” She casually walked around the car, inspecting every detail. Jean-Paul’s team was the best in the business. She couldn’t see any of the alterations or hints that anything had changed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“100 gallons, which should yield at least 500 bottles. A mix of our top selling whisky and rum, so it should more than satisfy a crowd. Each case is nailed shut and secured tightly, so you shouldn’t need to worry about driving extra carefully.” He slapped the hood with gusto. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what’re you asking?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“$400 even, for the drink and the service.” He said. Agatha knew she was getting a discounted mate’s rate but wasn’t about to complain. She was a reliable customer and repeat buyer, plus she was damn good company. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could make more than double that by selling this at the club either straight or in cocktails. She opened her bag and pulled out the bills, passing them over quickly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Merci, merci. I always appreciate your prompt payment. Will you be back soon?” He pocketed the money.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Undoubtedly.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They all shared one last dinner together. This time Jean-Paul donned the chef’s hat and presented a hearty cassoulet. For Rio it was reminiscent of her abuela’s asopao de pollo, a similar rich, meaty stew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked around the table and was once again struck with gratitude that her life had taken a new, unforeseen detour to this present. She could have never predicted that she would be sitting in Canada (of all places) with a woman as stunning as Agatha (who actually liked her) and three homosexuals (who are not strange or evil). Life was truly unpredictable. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>They left at the crack of dawn as soon as the sun crested the horizon. Agatha took the first shift like last time to get them going, and this time Rio sat in the back as she wanted to lay across the seats to rest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Studebaker was holding the weight shockingly well. It sat a tick lower than normal, but its six-cylinder engine gave it the juice to maintain high speeds despite the added pounds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I work the drag ball night, Agatha? I can stay as late as you need me. I can even help with setup - whatever you need.” Billy had clearly been thinking about this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was counting on your help. We’re going need all hands on deck to be fair. I think it might have to take place over two nights to be able to accommodate all the contestants plus all the onlookers. I’m going to need to help Jen make even more batches. We’ll have to call in some favors.” She was thinking through all the details to pull this off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If all went well, the payoff was going to be massive. They were going to set a cover charge to get in, plus a few extra dimes on top of all drink prices, plus the expected tips. This would certainly help Rio get back on her feet and help the rest of them top up their piggy banks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were about an hour and a half on their journey when a loud bang reverberated throughout the cab of the car, and everything tilted. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh fuck. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had popped a tire before, but never while illegally transporting excessive amounts of smuggled liquor from over the border. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio jolted awake at the sound and leaned over the front seat, “What happened? Is everything alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve blown a tire. I’m going to pull over.” Agatha slowed the car and pulled off to the grassy edge. Luckily there was almost nobody else on the road at this time of morning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She got out and inspected the damage. The back left tire had popped and was completely flat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have a spare, right?” Rio was standing beside her looking at the pathetic remains. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha brought a hand to her hair and grasped at the strands while letting out a sigh, “No, unfortunately not. We strip the car to make room for as much alcohol as possible. Looks like that’s one calculated risk that did not pay off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t busy on the road yet, but Agatha didn’t want to gamble. The police frequented every route in and out of their northern neighbor, doubly so since the Prohibition laws went into effect. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do we do, Mother?” Billy looked anxious. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched Agatha and saw her mind ticking along at a million miles per hour. Her fingers were moving in the air like they were playing invisible saxophones - the nervous energy literally flowing out of her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We passed a mechanic about a mile back in Keeseville. It was right off this road, you can’t miss it. Do you think you can make it there, Billy? They should have a spare. Ask for 30 inches for a Studebaker 6. Got it? Take this.” She passed him a $10 note. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded then took off at a jog in the direction which they had come. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is he gonna be alright?” Rio watched his retreating body fade into the distance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s got a good head on his shoulders. I trust him. Let’s get back in the car, it’s dangerous standing on the side of the road.” Agatha opened the passenger door, and they both slid in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A silence fell over them, only intermittently interrupted by the zoom of a passing car or truck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha?” Rio looked tentatively over to the other woman, who seemed lost in her own thoughts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, honey. Are you okay?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it’s just…I’m scared when we get back.” She paused for a second. “What if Tony comes to the shop again? What if he tries to find me and…and hurt me?” She felt so small as she uttered her fears aloud. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look at me.” Agatha put both hands on either side of Rio’s face. “That man - no, that boy - is never going to hurt you again. Ya hear me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt Agatha’s fingers caressing her scalp. “Nope, no but’s. I promise you; you won’t have to worry about him again. He is gone from your life.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How?” Rio couldn’t understand. Tony was relentless when he set his mind to something. She just never imagined she would be that something. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt Agatha’s gradual pull on her neck and the soft joy of a subtle kiss on her lips. The older woman whispered between pecks, “Trust me. It’s taken care of.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And she knew she should ask what that meant or press for more details, but every time Agatha kissed her it was like every train of thought left the station at once. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She leaned forward to press against the awaiting lips with fervor, but just as soon as it began a siren wailed behind them, and her heart dropped like a brick. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They looked at each other as if time had stopped and heard the police car pull up behind their broken down hayburner. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stay calm.” Agatha squeezed her hand and opened the door. “I’ve got this.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She all but ran towards the cop car. “Oh officer, thank the lord you stumbled upon us! We’ve had some dreadful luck this morning.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was still in the car but covered her mouth to hold in the laughter at the exaggerated southern accent that Agatha was putting on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see that, ma’am. Is your husband in the car?” The police man was in his 40s, bland, forgettable. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My dear husband.” She pretended to dab her eyes with her sleeve. “He passed in the war and we miss him somethin’ awful. My friend, Rosemary, and my son, Beauford, were just visitin’ my Auntie Dolores in Canada. She is a real fine lady. Anyway, we were headin’ back down to Georgia this morning when this dadgum tire went and blew its lid!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where’s your spare?” The officer looked at her curiously. Rio hoped he was buying the act. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My poor Beauford is about as useful as a steerin’ wheel on a mule, the sweet summer child. He left it at home thinking it was just for decoration! Luckily that boy can run faster than a hot knife through butter, so he’s off to buy one from the fuel stop. Shouldn’t be long now, sorry for taking up your time, sir.” Agatha was laying it on thick. Rio was impressed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure? I can take a look for you.” The man started to crouch and examine the busted tire, completely unaware that he was mere inches from copious amounts of hooch hidden in the base of the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh no! I’m sure you’re busier than a moth in a mitten, officer. We’ll be on our way in no time. I’m fixin’ to get moving as soon as Beauford runs his little hide back here.” She tried to usher him away from the car as quickly as possible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks so much for stopping, sir. You’re a real doll.” Agatha flashed her smile and turned up the charm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The policeman smiled back, oblivious to the way she was working him like a baker works a piece of dough into submission. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was about to walk away when he turned again. “Let me just have a quick check in your trunk. Did you look in every compartment?” He put a hand on the trunk handle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As he started to open it, Rio stared through the back window in fear. He was a moment away from potentially busting them. Any practiced man of the law would notice the curiously high false bottom to the trunk space. She looked to Agatha who was staring wide eyed, her normal dominance and control faltering.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hands were shaking, but her body was moving before her mind could protest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She collapsed out of the door and threw herself on the ground. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whoaaaaa!” She tried her best to sell it, taking a note from Agatha’s acting book. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The police officer immediately ran over to check on her, “Miss, Miss, are you okay? What happened?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ri-Rosemary!” Agatha yelled out, catching herself as she remembered the fake name she had picked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was not confident enough to even attempt any accent work, “Where am I?” She rasped out the question as she turned her head slowly to look up and check that the cop had come over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You just fell out of your car, miss.” He helped her sit up on the grass on the side of the road. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, I was feeling light-headed and then the next thing I knew I was lying on the ground!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you eaten anything this morning?” He took her elbow and eased her up to stand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We got straight on the road, officer. I was so keen to leave early. My mistake.” Agatha answered as she tried to hide her impressed smirk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s a rest stop just a few miles ahead. I suggest you stop there as soon as possible. Women have much more delicate constitutions, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had to fight every urge to roll her eyes straight back into her head at the condescension. “Bless your heart, thank you for the advice, sir.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He straightened up and pushed his shoulders back, very pleased with himself, then tipped his cap. “You both be safe now and get some food for that girl as soon as you can. Have a nice trip.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio and Agatha slid back into the car, holding their giggles until the copper was well on his way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were you an actress in another life? That was amazing!” Rio was grinning, the adrenaline of the encounter still pumping through her.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That performance? That was nothing! I think I was a bat of the eyelashes away from getting us a police escort all the way down to the city.” She laughed easily. “What about you? You saved us with your fainting spell. That was genius!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was all I could think of to stop him!” Rio shrugged her shoulders. “I have nothing on you. I’m just glad you use your powers for good because wow, you’d be a force to be reckoned with if you ever decided to go to the dark side.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What makes you think I haven’t already joined the underbelly?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You care too much. I haven’t known you for long, but the way you look out for me, for Billy, for Lilia, for everyone at the club. I don’t think you could be evil.” Rio extended an arm out to touch Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You always see the best in me.” Agatha smiled back. It was only about another 10 minutes before they heard the sounds of shoes hitting the gravel and looked behind them to see Billy approaching with a large tire rolling alongside. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even with the cool temperature, sweat was dripping from his brow and down the sides of his face. He was panting and held onto the side of the car to steady himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don’t have anything to drink besides booze…” Rio grimaced. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s gonna have to do.” Agatha unscrewed one of the bottles that Jean-Paul had gifted them. “Take a few sips, kid. You need the fluids.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aaack, I don’t think that’s helping!” Billy was no stranger to alcohol, but he rarely partook - only an occasional cocktail if Agatha made it for him - never straight whisky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’ll perk you up.” Agatha laughed then rolled the sleeves up on her sweater. “Help me change this, and we can get moving again.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched the two of them change the tire with speed and precision. Luckily, they still had a jack and a wrench in the car. In no time, they were back on the road. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, note to self, next time don’t forget the spare!” Agatha announced to nobody, and they all laughed. At least they had a memorable story to tell. </span>

  <p>
  <span>They made it back just after 1pm on Sunday, and the city felt frenetic compared to the quiet of the open road. Agatha pulled up to the street behind the club alley and parked the car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Head home and get some rest. Meet me back here at 9 tonight so that we can unload this under some cover of darkness.” She explained. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“See you!” Billy took off down the street to his house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where does he store all that energy?” Rio wondered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who knows? Are you okay to work tonight also? Sundays are usually pretty busy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be here. Don’t miss me too much.” She hugged Agatha and went back to Lilia’s. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha locked the Studebaker, checked and then double-checked to make sure it was secure and walked to her apartment. The last thing they needed was someone stealing the outcome of all their efforts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She got off the elevator and opened the door. It was dark inside, the curtains were all drawn. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ebony, I’m home.” She called her cat as she placed her bag down. She had asked her neighbor, Iris, to check in and feed her while they were away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She flicked the light switch in the dining room and must have jumped three feet off the ground.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jesus fucking christ!” Agatha put her hands on her knees to catch her breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome back, Mother.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sitting at the dining table was the dangerous, beautiful redhead that tormented her nightmares, stroking Agatha’s black cat with her velvet-gloved hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wanda, what the </span>
  <b>fuck </b>
  <span>are you doing in my house?” Agatha searched the room for any other surprises, but it appeared the intruder was alone. She also glanced for anything that could be used as a weapon but came up short. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that how you greet all your friends?” Wanda asked. Her voice was soft but cutting.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re not friends.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ouch. And here I thought we were getting along so well, especially after this job I just completed for you.” Ebony jumped off the foreign lap and wandered over to her owner. Wanda swiped the cat hair from her black wool serge frock. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s done?” Agatha hoped the Tony problem was finally a thing of the past. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You conveniently </span>
  <em>
    <span>failed </span>
  </em>
  <span>to mention that he lived with two other people, and that they would put up a fight…” Wanda leaned back in the dining chair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Agatha held onto the top rail of the chair in front of her as if it could provide any stabilization. “I swear I had no idea.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda quietly observed her prey. Her eyes seemed to see through Agatha like she was made of glass. She loved to watch her victims sweat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure?” She pressed sweetly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Honestly, I thought he would be alone. Please.” Agatha’s gaze fell on the leather bag sitting beneath the table - that wasn’t hers. She felt increasingly tense. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda rocked her head side-to-side in contemplation. “You know…I think I believe you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha released a heavy sigh, “Thank you, truly. I’m sorry for any trouble he caused. I will-”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The mob boss held a hand up, silencing the next words that were about to come. “Save it. We need to discuss what you owe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll have my team deliver the hooch tonight. Just name a time and place.” Agatha hated the power Wanda yielded over her. She resented the fear that still sat in her chest when speaking with this woman. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Price has changed.” She spoke flatly, no room for argument. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But…” Agatha stopped herself this time before continuing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your small favor ended with my brother fracturing his nose and one of my other men is now a few screws loose in the head after he was knocked unconscious. Liquor just ain’t gonna cover that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>God, things really didn’t go to plan.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Agatha braced herself for what she was going to have to give up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda thought for a moment, “I know.” She pointed to the woman across from her. “You are going to host me, my husband, and all of our organisation at your club. No other guests - completely private event. Drinks on the house and the best singers and dancers you can book on the stage.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha grimaced. There went her big pay day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“When?” She tried to keep her cool. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, doll. Vision’s out of town for a month. He’s making some new connections in Chicago.  And then we’ll have some business to sort out when he gets back. So, let’s say mid-May. I want to make sure you have enough time to really go all out. This better be the greatest shindig The Hidden Gate has ever seen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I never leave a lady disappointed.” Agatha was going to have to pull off something spectacular to impress Wanda. The drag ball in a few weeks would be a perfect test run.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda licked her lips, “I expect not. I know where you live, where you work. I just have one nagging question.” She stood from her chair and approached the tense woman across from her. “There’s one thing I can’t understand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched the redhead walk over and steadied her breathing. Her nerves felt like they were tap dancing, bouncing around restlessly and distracting her mind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda stood in front of her and raised her hand to move some stray hairs off Agatha’s face. The familiar gesture was an unwelcome surprise. She then leaned in toward her ear and of every question, taunt, or insult that Agatha had expected to hear, this one floored her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who is Rio?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand shot up and caught Wanda’s wrist that was still stroking her hair. She gripped it as tight as she could. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She spit out the next words with all the vitriol she could manage, “Keep her name…out of your mouth.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The anxiety in her body had morphed like a tormented butterfly and emerged as pure rage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda blinked rapidly, clearly caught off guard. But as she processed the response, a twisted smile expanded across her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well...I think that answers that.” She yanked her arm out of Agatha’s grip with some effort and rubbed at her wrist. “If I knew you liked them young, I would have tried a little harder a few years ago.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda winked and wiggled her hips just enough to catch the older woman’s angry gaze. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s something wrong with you.” Agatha shook her head. One second Wanda was threatening Rio and now she was…flirting with her? This was a very dangerous game, and now she had dragged her lover into it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I not broken enough for you?” Wanda pouted. “Do you only want projects you can fix? Is that it? This girl was getting walloped by her man, so then you get to swoop in and play hero.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re </span>
  <b>not </b>
  <span>discussing her.” A flash of hatred flickered across Agatha’s face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda bent to pick up her bag and put her coat on, “Everyone says you’re fun, but I’m not seeing it. Hopefully, this isn’t indicative of the type of party you throw.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha led the way out, “I promise you’ll be more than satisfied.” She swallowed her resentment as she opened the front door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now there’s something I don’t doubt.” She quickly landed a hearty peck on Agatha’s cheek, who bared her teeth like a wild animal at the intrusion. “You’ll be hearing from me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door shut, and Agatha let out an exhilarating growl into her empty home, her hands curled into tights fists, her arms holding her rage. She went into the bathroom to get a glass of water and caught her reflection. The bold red print of Wanda’s lips marked her cheek like a brand. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That fucking bitch. </span>
  </em>
  <span>She pawed aggressively at the imprint with wet hands and tried to swipe away every trace of the interaction.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the lipstick disappeared, she was left with only the raw reality of the situation. She now had to host the entire Sokovian gang for a night at the club, so she would both lose all potential profit from a typical operating night and compensate for all the alcohol they were bound to consume, plus the entertainment costs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She splashed water on her face to cool down. On top of all that, Wanda somehow knew about Rio and knew that Rio was someone she cared about. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda was infamous for her torture methods. Hell, that was why Agatha had hired her to take care of Tony in the first place. Everyone in town thought it was Vision who harbored the cruelty and pain that propelled their gang to power, but Agatha knew that all these men were blind to the capabilities of Wanda. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was the one who could break down any goodfella, and her usual method involved exploiting their emotional vulnerabilities or romantic connections. She wasn’t above beating a man’s girl to get him to squeal. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I need to be smarter. I need to keep Rio safe. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha looked at herself in the mirror and repeated the phrases like a mantra. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>First step, change my locks.</span>
  </em>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Rio arrived back at Lilia's apartment and dropped her bag. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey kiddo, how was your trip?” Lilia was sitting in the lounge, reading a book. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio walked over and took a seat in one of the armchairs. “Amazing, I loved it. Jean-Paul and Kyle were so welcoming and nice. Montreal was stunning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t been in decades now. I’d love to see it now. Any trouble on the road?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A flat tire, which almost turned into a whole debacle. Luckily, Agatha could charm the pants off anyone.” Rio softly smiled at the thought.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why am I not surprised?” Lilia closed her book and looked up. “Also, someone came to the shop on Friday morning looking for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her shoulders stiffen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It wasn’t that man from before.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She relaxed slightly, “Who was it? I don’t know many other people.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A young woman, close to your age, looked Puerto Rican as well. She seemed pretty distressed at the time, but she ran off when I said you wouldn’t be back until next week.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Claudia…” Rio’s leg was bouncing nervously. “My old roommate. I should go check on her, make sure she’s alright.” </span>
  <em>
    <span>If Tony laid a hand on her, so help me.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She grabbed her cloche hat and took off to her old neighborhood. Before long, she was outside the building and climbing the long walk up to the apartment. Immediately, she noticed the new door - a temporary bit of plywood, holding the space for what used to stand in its place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knocked carefully, afraid it might fall over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who is it?” She heard a small voice call out but the tinge of fear was audible.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Claudia? Qué pasó? What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio! Ay bendito, I thought you were…” She opened the door and looked out cautiously. “Come in, rápidamente.” Rio quickly stepped in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked at her old living space and took in the damage. There were large, horrifying bloodstains on the hardwoods, one of the photo frames on the wall was smashed, one of the dining chairs was missing. She looked at her friend who had a sizable bandage across her neck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What happened…” Rio was at a loss for words. She couldn’t imagine what had caused all this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Claudia moved to the couch, and they both sat. “It was last Thursday. We were all here eating dinner and out of nowhere someone kicked the door off its hinges. Two men and a woman stormed in, and I screamed. They were holding weapons, but Tony and Miguel were fearless. Tony socked one and Miguel stabbed the other with a fork and kicked him down to the ground.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was in shock. Who would want to attack them like this?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought we had a chance, but the evil puta with the red hair grabbed me and held a knife to my throat.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” Rio gasped.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She told the men to stop or she would kill me. I felt the blade on my skin, and she started to dig it in. I was so surprised. I couldn’t even feel the pain.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ay dios mío, what happened next?” Rio was gripping Claudia’s hand tightly, holding on to every word. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was a pause as she watched Claudia struggle with something, “Rio, they were here for Tony…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The woman said Miguel and I could leave because they only wanted Tony. They had a gun - we should have stayed, but we were so scared. I thought they were going to kill us all.” Claudia was trembling at the recollection. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, I understand. What did they do with him?” She was afraid of the answer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We went down the street and hid in the Brown’s place. Mrs. Brown patched me up, and we waited a few hours. Then, Miguel ran back first to check if it was safe and called down to me.” She let out a long breath. “Tony wasn’t here. He must have been tied to one of the chairs because it was smashed to pieces, so he must have broken out of it. There was…blood. It was everywhere. I’ve tried cleaning it up but…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so sorry. Have you seen him since?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He hasn’t come back. Most of his stuff is gone. We don’t know if he took it or those people took it. He’s just…gone.” Claudia said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio wasn’t sure how to feel. It was a weird cocktail of relief, shock, joy, pain, and confusion. Blessings and burdens alike. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did the intruders look like? Were they cops?” She asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Definitely not la policia. They were White and had accents from overseas but I couldn't even guess where. The woman was petite, scarlet hair, very glamorous attire - must be well-off. One man was short, stocky build, dirty blonde hair. The other looked quite similar to the woman, but with hair almost snow white in color, very large muscles, athletic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll ask around. I know someone who knows everyone.” Rio hoped Agatha might know who could have committed this crime. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Be careful, amiga. These were very experienced, very violent people. Keep an eye out…” Claudia wrapped her in a hug, “…in case they come for you.” </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>As night fell, the road trip gang reunited in the alley as planned. Agatha and Rio immediately embraced upon seeing each other again. Neither aware of the intense experiences they had both endured that afternoon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I missed you.” Agatha whispered in her ear, and Rio melted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Billy, can you go get Alice? We need some help carrying all this.” Agatha asked, and he ran and knocked on the door to get her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay?” Rio was studying her carefully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, of course. Why?” Agatha’s mind was still replaying her run-in with Wanda. She had breathed a sigh of relief when Rio had made it here tonight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You just seem quiet. Very unlike you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A lot on my mind, I guess. Don’t worry. Are you okay? You seem - off.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll talk later.” Rio assured her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice walked up with Billy, and Agatha opened the car. They started carrying the cases down into the club as carefully as possible. Every single drop was precious. Jen stayed downstairs and helped carry them from the bottom of the stairs into the storage hall behind the bar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow, you weren’t kidding when you said you were going to bring back enough to drown a baby whale.” Jen joked with Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re going to need it.” She replied with a serious look. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After they finished, Billy and Rio went to work setting up the front of the house. Agatha and Jen retreated to the distilling room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was that look about?” Jen asked as she donned her gloves and apron. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha suited up as well, “I may have promised a certain deranged redhead that we would host her and her organization for a private party…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t be serious.” Jen’s mouth had fallen open in shock. “The crazy bitch that tied us to chairs the one time we accidently tried to work with her bootlegger? That lady??” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha closed her eyes in embarrassment, “Ummm - yes.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what, may I ask, compelled you to promise this?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I asked her for a small favor, and the payment ended up being…higher than expected.” Agatha wished she could shrink away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think? What favor could possibly be worth the trouble of tangling with the Sokovians?” Jen was gobsmacked. Mother was always careful, always by the book. It was how she kept them all safe, how she kept the business safe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio -” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ohhhhhhhhh, of course.” Jen was shaking her head smiling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Agatha’s hands were gesturing all over the place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You would go to the ends of the Earth to protect the people you love.” Jen said as if it were gospel truth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Love? Who said anything about love?” Agatha was the one laughing now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen deadpan stared at the other woman. No words necessary. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anyway…I know you’ve already increased production. Any way we can push it further?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, I think I’m already pushing the equipment to the brink. I don’t think it can take much more to be honest. If we could get another boiler, maybe.” Jen was looking over the copper pieces which were showing some signs of wear and tear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was challenging to get new equipment at this size given the laws. Their current setup had been acquired through extreme bribery and sweet-talking by Lilia with an old Kentucky family that was getting out of the trade.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll see what I can do.” Agatha made a mental note. Another thing on her endless list of to-do’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She finished helping Jen start a new batch of moonshine, then entered the hall to catch up with Billy and Rio. They were prepping the bar, and Agatha sidled up next to Rio and threw her arm around her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How’s it going out here, hot stuff?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio pointed a finger to herself with a questioning look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you.” Agatha laughed and pulled her closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing to report. Billy almost chopped the top of his finger off but other than that…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey! What happens behind the bar stays behind the bar, remember?” He nudged his co-worker. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to steal your partner in crime here for a minute, teen.” Agatha started walking with her arm still around Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t spend too much time necking in the green room. We still have work to do!” He called as they headed backstage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened the green room door and pulled together two of the chairs. She let out a big sigh as she collapsed into one of them. Her thoughts had been solely consumed with Wanda since this afternoon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s bothering you?” Rio broke the tension. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know where to begin.” Agatha had an almost pained expression on her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I ask you something first then?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My old apartment was…attacked last week.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had been staring at the floor but quickly looked up to meet Rio’s eyes. She hadn’t expected this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And now Tony is missing. He was beaten, and Claudia and Miguel tried to fight off the intruders, but they were overpowered. From the sounds of things, it was gang-related. I know you know everything there is to know about the seedy side of this city, I was just wondering if you’ve heard anything or know who to ask.” Rio watched the other woman carefully. She was biting her lip, sitting on her hands, now avoiding eye contact entirely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A long, uncomfortable pause followed. “Agatha?” Rio prompted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just want you to know that I care about you…deeply. I didn’t expect to ever feel this way about someone, least of all someone I worked with, but alas. I feel this intense draw towards you and a compulsion to protect you. I don’t know why.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know I feel just as strongly about you too, Agatha.” Rio was unsure where this was going. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s why what I’m going to say next is so hard.” Agatha struggled internally. How do you tell the girl you’re stuck on that you called in a hit on her abusive ex?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, I…how can I put this?” She took in a deep breath and let it all out, “I hated the way your piece of shit boyfriend treated you. The way he hurt you and continued to torment you and force you to live in constant fear. I hated that you ever felt less than or worthless. I hated that you felt so scared living in your own home. So I…I asked for a favor.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was both touched at the sincerity but nervous at the lingering question, “What kind of favor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s face scrunched up in discomfort as she said, “I just wanted to send him a message. A warning to leave you alone. They weren’t meant to hurt anyone else. That was a mistake. I was trying to keep you safe.” She braced for Rio’s reaction - braced for yelling or anger or disappointment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What she didn’t expect was to be straddled in the chair and Rio’s mouth to crash into her like she held the last gasp of oxygen on the planet. Their lips connected in a fiery exchange and Agatha struggled to breathe, struggled to grasp what was happening, but her body moved on its own accord. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her hands came up to grasp Rio’s waist and pulled up her dress so she could settle more firmly against her lap. She moaned into the kiss as Rio’s tongue seemed to lick and explore every surface of her mouth like it was Howard Carter excavating King Tut’s tomb. And Rio’s hands were threaded in her hair, moving and tugging and pulling her pleasure through every twist and turn. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hands moved down and encircled the glorious behind that was rocking on top of her. She gripped it tightly and felt the waves of pleasure course through her. She was intoxicated by the smell of Rio surrounding her like she was in a cloud of pheromones. Her tongue was lost in its own journey of discovery in Rio’s mouth, and her hips were starting to twitch up in search of pressure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her mind had been stuck in quicksand at the sudden onslaught of desire, but it finally caught up to the party. “Wait.” She softly pushed Rio back. “You’re not…mad?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s chest was heaving and her eyes were blazing as she looked down at the woman below her, “Agatha, you sicced the mafia on my abuser?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shrugged and nodded slowly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s the most beautifully fucked up thing anyone has ever done for me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio used both hands to hold Agatha’s face in place and dropped down for another hot and heavy kiss. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Slight correction…” Agatha stammered out against her lips between kisses, “It wasn’t the mafia. It was an Eastern European gang.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, smiling, “You’re unbelievable.” </span>

  <p>
  <span>Agatha sat on a barstool and grabbed a clipboard from a shelf beneath the bar. It had a stack of lined paper on it and a pencil. She started writing a list.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do we need for the drag night? We have four weeks.” She looked at Billy and Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think we’re good on booze for now. What about extra security?” Billy said. “We might attract some rowdy people looking to start trouble.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good idea.” She scribbled it down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re going to need a top-tier big band.” Rio added. She wasn’t really sure what a drag ball entailed but every party needed good music. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha added it to the list. “Okay, keep thinking and let me know. We have enough whisky and rum now, as well as moonshine. I’m going to try to up the assortment and see what else I can find around the city.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For the next two weeks, Agatha met with people in every one of the five boroughs. She travelled to the Upper East Side to meet with some Germans and secured several cartons of Bavarian beer. She crossed the water into Brooklyn to confer with the Irish who had their own high-production gin operation. She did shots with the Dominicans in the Bronx and traded some moonshine for their Caribbean rum. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Variety is the spice of life, but Agatha found it is also the key to extra dough. For every new alcohol she added to the bar menu, she increased her nightly profit by 10%. People got drunker, bought more, danced more, tried more, and repeated again and again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was able to book the Salem Seven as the entertainment for the weekend. They were a well-regarded big band and all women, which was incredibly rare for any music act. Mary Crow on saxophone could rival any of her male counterparts.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was all coming together, yet in her mind the lingering threat from Wanda still loomed. She hadn’t heard another peep from the mob boss since her surprise visit, but the memory stayed. Agatha had been keeping an extra close eye on Rio since then. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were now working most nights at the club together, which was surprisingly easy. Darcy was focussing on her studies, so she only came in on Friday and Saturday nights for extra support. Billy was the extra pair of hands on the other nights when needed. Rio cut back her pharmacy hours to Tuesday, Wednesday, and Fridays. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>On those days, Agatha would peek into the shop when she got in and leave small, handwritten notes in Rio’s coat for her to find later. </span>
</p><blockquote>

  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>I cherish the nights that we spend together. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>You have spurred in me the delights of love.</span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>And Rio saved every single one. She didn’t have many possessions, but she stored them in her cigar box with her growing savings. On nights when she felt lonely after saying goodbye to Agatha after work, she would re-read the notes and feel revitalized with passion again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ever since Agatha’s confession about Tony, her love for the other woman had only increased. She probably should have felt frightened or horrified at the revelation, but she just wasn’t. It was like Agatha had cut the constricting binds that had wound their way around her body over time. The suffocation of Tony was lifted; she could finally inhale again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her arm splint was removed, her bruises had healed, her body felt like her own. She was determined to experience every single thing that life offered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was the week before the drag ball, and Agatha had been running all over town finalizing all the details. Rio could see the stress on her face and decided that a distraction was in order. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the Wednesday before the big event, she finally gathered up all the courage within herself and took a leap. “Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, honey?” She didn’t look up from polishing glasses as they prepared for another busy night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to ask you something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She heard the earnestness in her tone, and Agatha lifted her eyes and smiled at the nervous ball of energy in front of her. “Ask away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I take you out on the town?” The words blurted out of her mouth. She wasn’t sure why she was so nervous. They had already slept in the same bed multiple times, kissed more times than she could count, and travelled to another country together, for god's sake. But Agatha had been the instigator of most of it, Rio wanted to take the lead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like…on a date?” Agatha was grinning widely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’ll have me.” Rio blushed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And where will we be going?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll see. I’ll swing by your place at 6pm on Friday. Wear your best glad rags.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was intrigued. She wasn’t used to someone else taking care of the planning. “What about the club?” She asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry. Billy and Darcy said they will cover us, and Jen said she will assist if it gets really busy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled, “Have you already thought of everything?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next day Rio had the morning off, so she took the train to Midtown and headed to Gimbels. She wanted to really impress Agatha with a brand-new outfit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The department store was near Herald Square, and she headed straight for the women’s fashion section. It reminded her of the last time she was in a department store, searching for a dress for her first night at the speakeasy. That one night that changed the entire course of her life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she searched the frocks for something special, she saw a glimmer of metallic on a nearby rack. She approached the dress and pulled it out carefully. It was the most brilliant deep bronze in color and almost as shiny as a fresh penny. She tried it on. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wow.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>That was the only thought she could muster upon seeing her own reflection. The small, intricate straps led down to a standard square cut neckline and the hem dusted her ankles. There was a beautiful hip sash, but the real kicker was the plunging low back of the dress. She was going to have to go sans brassiere or slip. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She picked up some new silk bloomers and nude stockings, then chose blonde leather pumps to round it out. She was headed to the cashier when she passed the jewelry case and stopped. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the row of brooches, one caught her eye. It was a small, dainty iris, and the flower petals were a pale violet. Perfect. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll take it.” She pointed it out to the woman behind the counter. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It felt nice to finally have something and </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone </span>
  </em>
  <span>to spend her hard-earned wages on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By Friday, she was overflowing with excitement at her upcoming date. The entire workday dragged by at a snail’s pace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s only been five minutes since you last looked at the clock.” Billy joked with her as they cleaned up from lunch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How is that possible?” Rio whined. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The flow of time is an illusion.” Lilia piped into the conversation from behind the cash register. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not helping, Lilia!” Rio was counting the seconds until she could clock off and go pick up Agatha. She hadn’t seen her all day since she was busy downstairs preparing for the big weekend ahead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where are you going for your hot date?” Billy was eager for all the details. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t you like to know?” Rio picked up the broom and started sweeping to try to pass the minutes faster. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes! Obviously!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dinner first, of course. Alice recommended a place. Then I bought two tickets to the Ziegfeld Follies at the New Amsterdam Theatre at 8pm.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hot dog! That’s one of the best shows in town. I’ve heard it’s a riot!” Billy was impressed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, given Agatha’s…flair for the dramatic, I thought she might like it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s going to love it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Speaking of love.” She hinted, “How are things going with that boy, Eddie?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just hotsy-totsy.” The sarcasm tumbled from his mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That bad?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know what to say when he’s around. It’s like I forget how to speak!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not ask him to catch a flick with you? It’s benign enough for two friends but could lead to more if he’s interested.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Say, that’s not a bad plan. Now I just need to remember how to make sounds come out of my mouth in his presence and maybe we’ll get somewhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome.” Rio chuckled and continued cleaning, willing Father Time to hurry things along. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When quitting time hit, she all but flew from the shop and ran to the apartment to get ready. She took a quick bath and styled her hair simply. For make-up, she went with a dark smoky eye shadow and prominent eye liner. She dotted her cheeks in red rouge and painted cherry lipstick in a Cupid’s Bow shape. The dress fit like a dream, and she headed off to collect her date after grabbing her coat and purse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was slightly early, so the doorman called up to Agatha, who told him to send Rio up to meet her. She knocked on the door and waited with growing anticipation. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Was this too much? Did she overdress? What if this was a mistake? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened the door in her floral robe and nearly fell to her knees as she took in the sight before her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She swallowed heavily, “Rio…you look like a dream.” Her eyes wandered up and down the figure standing in her doorway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just for you.” She smiled and followed Agatha inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just need to get dressed. Take a seat, there’s some wine on the table.” She went off to the bedroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shed her coat and pulled out the little jewelry box. She set it down and poured herself a glass of wine. The sweet flavor helped calm her nerves as she waited. It wasn’t long at all before Agatha strutted out looking like she had just jumped out of a magazine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was a vision in black. Black sleeveless dress, black heels, black elbow length gloves. Rio stood as soon as she appeared and could only gape. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I got you something.” She reached down to grab the box and passed it to Agatha shyly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? You didn’t have to do that.” Agatha was genuinely surprised. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s nothing big. Just something that made me think of you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha opened the box with care and let out a small gasp when she saw the beautiful brooch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s gorgeous.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Irises symbolize hope. They can also be an expression of gratitude and a symbol of a new beginning. It felt like the exact description for how I feel about you…about us.” Rio had never thought of herself as a romantic, but with Agatha it felt natural. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, I love it.” Agatha attached the iris to her dress, and the purple flower was the perfect accent to her ensemble. She grabbed Rio’s hand and pulled her in for a kiss. It was unhurried, subtle. A kiss that said ‘thank you’, ‘you see me’, ‘I’m so grateful to have you.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She moved her hands to wrap around Rio and felt her heart skip a beat as she discovered the low cut of the dress. She ran her fingers up and down her exposed spine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As much as I would love to stay and do </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Rio said, “we should probably get going.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Awwwww, but I’m just getting acquainted with the exquisite muscles of your back.” Agatha groaned, her fingers still tracing the lines of her date’s shoulder blades. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure you’re going to love my company just as much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Debatable.” Agatha jokingly replied and caught Rio’s eye roll as they headed out the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio flagged down a cab, and they made their way down to Broadway. They got out at 48th Street and Rio led them to Mamma Leone’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have I converted you to the religion of Italian food?” Agatha asked as she noticed the sign. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I would eat just about anything you put in front of me.” Rio held the door open for her lady. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that a promise?” She smirked. Rio was oblivious to the suggestion, yet she couldn’t help but toy with her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The meal was as good as promised. They shared a bottle of ginger ale, a plate of lasagne, and Mamma’s chicken cacciatora. Every bite beckoned you to take another and another.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What were you like as a kid?” Agatha asked as sipped her drink. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes went up to the ceiling as she searched her memory and she unconsciously smiled. “A handful.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really? I would have guessed goody two-shoes. Were you a little rebel?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just wasn’t like the other girls. My sister was so prim and proper. All the boys fell over themselves to be around her, and I was the opposite. I was more often covered in dirt, running with the boys through the neighborhood, causing trouble. My madre was always scolding me or telling me off.’”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow, I see why you’re so stubborn now.” Agatha smiled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re one to talk. What about you? What were you like?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a big drink from her glass, “I was quiet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gasped dramatically to the unimpressed look from the woman across from her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not by choice, excuse you. My mother was…not a nice lady. My father was a deadbeat, never met him. And my mother was deeply indoctrinated in the church. She would pray over me every night, willing God to find me a husband - a man to take me away from her. You know why she named me Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The name means ‘good’. She wanted a good girl so badly, and unfortunately…she got me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re the best person I know.” Rio’s heart broke at the sadness she saw on Agatha’s face. The memory was breaking across her features. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, I’m in my 40’s, and she still has her claws in me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You aren’t a bad person, Agatha. She was wrong about you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m certainly not a good person though, am I?” The pained look in her eyes hurt Rio to see. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does ‘good’ even mean? I feel good whenever I see you smile. Your lips are so so good at kissing. I’m good at dancing. This lasagne is damn good. This city is a pretty amazingly good place to live. And you </span>
  <em>
    <span>are </span>
  </em>
  <span>a good person - the goodest, I would say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was laughing now. “Goodest? Where’d you pull that one from?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can be creative” Rio shrugged and dove back into her plate of food. “Tell me a happy memory.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha finished chewing her bite of chicken as she went through her memory bank. “It’s not your typical sunshine and roses, but it was the first time I felt unbridled happiness.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell me.” Rio was intrigued. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On my wedding day, as I walked down the aisle with Ralph after the ceremony, I wasn’t thinking about my new husband or about love or any of that sap. I looked at my mother’s face as I passed and thought, ‘I never have to go home with her ever again’ and it was like a thousand pound boulder had been lifted from my back. I started to cry tears of joy, which everyone thought was because of the wedding, but I was just so relieved.” Agatha’s eyes crinkled as the smile reached them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why did you take the nickname Mother, if she is such a source of pain?” Rio had been wondering that for a while. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s helped heal so much of the wound, actually. It started as a joke. Lilia would say it around the shop because I was so bossy, then the customers started to pick it up. Now people call me Mother as a sign of respect, mostly, and I get to use the power of the name to build my own family.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who do I get to be in the family?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And how could Agatha resist. “Well…I’ve always wanted a daddy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio choked on the pasta and nearly spat it across the room as she tried and failed to cough it up. Agatha rushed over and patted her back hard. Eventually, Rio was able to swallow, though she was completely red from the effort and the embarrassment of the entire restaurant staring. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you trying to kill me?” She muttered between long drinks of water. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not my fault you forgot how to chew.” Agatha stuck out her tongue playfully and Rio shot her a filthy look. They grinned at each other and finished their meals amongst silly small talk.   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re going to have to carry me out of here.” Agatha patted her stomach comically. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m stuffed.” Rio laughed. “I’ll be lucky to lift myself off this chair.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m certainly regretting the corset at this moment.” Agatha twisted her body and strained against the tense fabric. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can help get you out of it later.” Rio winked, then checked the clock on the wall. “We’ve gotta go soon.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, there’s more?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m no flat tire. What kind of date would it be without some entertainment?” Rio paid the cheque and was once again felt grateful for the independence of an income. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked the six blocks down to the theater, arm in arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What did I do to deserve you?” Agatha asked. She was lightly kidding but also wondered what had brought this on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ve done so much for me. More than I even know probably. This is a drop in the bucket to what I want to give back to you. You’ve changed my life.” Rio meant every word as she spoke it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you. This is wonderful. You surprise me constantly with your thoughtfulness and how deeply you seem to know me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I watch you, Agatha. Just as closely as you watch everyone else.” Rio caught the twinkle of tears just barely starting to form in her partner’s eyes, but they were quickly replaced by surprise as they arrived in front of the New Amsterdam.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re seeing The Follies?” Agatha’s mouth was open. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After you.” Rio gestured into the open theater doors. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The show was an elaborate theater revue with a mix of singing, dancing, and comedy acts. The sets were fabulous and the performers were even better. On the subway ride home, the two discussed their favorite moments. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That Mary Eaton. Damn can that dame sing.” Agatha had loved every single act in the production but of course, she couldn’t take her eyes off the beautiful starlet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What about those Ziegfeld Girls?” Rio had been hypnotized by the chorus girls in their extravagant feathered costumes, parading across the stage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Does that do it for? Would you like me in a feather boa?” Agatha pulled down her coat and showed off her bare shoulder in jest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio could only nod enthusiastically at just the sheer suggestion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Noted.” Agatha laughed heartily and tried not to draw too much attention in the train car. Rio licked her lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“In all seriousness, thank you for the date. I had the best time. You really know how to treat a girl right.” Agatha put a soft hand on Rio’s leg. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love spending time with you. Outside of work.” Rio added. They reached their stop and walked up the street together.   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As much as I want to invite you up, we have so much to do tomorrow. We need to be hitting on all sixes, and if I let you up, I’m not going to want to sleep a wink.” Agatha shook her head as if battling herself to give in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you…positive?” Rio swayed on her heels, pushing her luck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bunny.” Agatha warned, pulling out the nickname. “You could knock me over with a feather right now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So…” Rio raised an eyebrow. She was still wary about the subject of sex but knew she wanted to experience it with Agatha. They hadn’t discussed it specifically, and Rio felt like a fish out of water but figured it couldn’t be </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> different. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“After this weekend, I promise. You’re all mine.” She pointed her finger at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to hold you to it.” Rio hugged her date tightly. She wished they could kiss here on the street like any other couple but took what she could get.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“See you tomorrow. Make sure to sleep well. It’s going to be a long night.” Agatha turned and waved. The countdown was on. </span>

  <p>
  <span>“Team meeting near coat check in five.” Agatha called out to the room in her loudest voice. The club was decked out from floor to ceiling in elegant curtains, ribbons, and lights. It looked like a million bucks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had splurged on the perfect host outfit for this event. A men’s black tuxedo jacket, vest, tie, and top hat to match a knee-length silk black skirt and her finest patent leather pumps. She even added a monocle for a touch of fun. The iris pin from Rio was attached to her lapel, and she wore her signature brooch on the center of her tie. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Rio first walked in and saw her, Agatha had to go over and whisper in the younger woman’s ear, “Wipe the drool off your mouth, doll.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every which way she moved throughout the space, she felt Rio’s eyes tracking her like a cat stalks a mouse. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Okay, this outfit is really doing something to her.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She clapped twice loudly and everyone gathered around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The entire team was present as they were expecting a packed house. Rio and Darcy were going to manage the bar at first, while Billy ran the coat and corset check. Jen would help with service on the floor and keeping the inventory up for the bar. Alice would man the door as usual with additional help from Lilia who would be collecting the cover charge. Herb was security downstairs and Agatha had hired three additional men for extra muscle. Sharon was wrangling the performers and entertainment. Finally, Agatha was the host, the boss, the final say on any calls for the event. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve had busy nights over the past two years, but I expect this will be a whole different beast. Stay calm, keep the drinks flowing, and squash any disturbances quickly and quietly. Our most important job is keeping the performers safe.” Agatha looked at them all and tried to keep their spirits up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve ‘donated’ a hefty sum to the pocket of Chief Jones with the NYPD, so we should be covered from any disturbances from the boys in blue. But these events tend to attract some negative onlookers. Hopefully the cover charge will deter that, and Alice will be keeping a keen eye out for any suspicious characters. Yes, teen?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy had been raising his hand, “Sorry, what do we do if someone is acting up or causing trouble?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Same as usual, get security over as soon as possible, and they’ll be escorted out one of the many exits. Doors open in 15 minutes. The contestants are getting ready backstage. After about an hour, the band will start playing a waltz. We’ll clear the dance floor and the competition begins. I’ve been asked to judge along with Bruce Locke and Blanche Simmons from the Hamilton Lodge. After it ends, we keep the party pumping until 3, and I’ll announce last call. Questions?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She scanned the room but nobody spoke up. “Okay then. I trust you all. Let’s have a fun night and squeeze these suckers for all their worth.” She threw her head back in a wicked cackle as everyone took their positions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sound of hundreds of shoes pounding down the stairs echoed in the empty hall, and within moments the crowd burst through the door. The band was already playing a soft jazz number, and everyone surrounded either the bar or the coat check. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was thankful to have both arms free again as she shook cocktails, poured drinks, and tried to handle all the coins and bills that were all but flying at her from across the counter. She was surprised at all the seemingly heterosexual folks in attendance, but then again Agatha did say that lots of people came to these events out of curiosity. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I buy you a shot of shine?” A tall man leaned over amidst the chaos and spoke to her directly. He was wearing a grey flat cap and a slim double-breasted navy suit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, mac. Not tonight.” Rio passed him his drink and kept working. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio! Pass me the rum.” Darcy called out as she was juggling three glasses in her hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a unique name.” The man commented, still lingering at the bar despite the push of the crowd behind him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank my parents.” She saw him disappear into the throngs of people and went back to work trying to knock out orders. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy finally jumped into the mix after a while and helped them get on top of things. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mother wasn’t kidding. These people know how to drink!” He had just finished off yet another bottle of whisky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank god we have so many cases back there. The night has only just begun!” Rio was shocked at the number of drinks they must have sold. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room was buzzing as the band switched from a fast jazz number to an austere waltz. The signal that the competition was about to begin. Jen and Darcy shuffled people off the floor while Billy set up the judge’s table near the edge, opposite the stage. Agatha in her tux took a seat, then a stunning black man in full drag sat next to her, and a beautiful austere asian woman in an equally impressive gown sat in the final chair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood and projected her voice, “Let the first round begin! Best dressed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The band leader counted in a jazz number, and the contestants filed out from behind the curtain. Rio was standing behind the bar but could see the stage clearly. She could hardly believe her eyes. It was impossible to distinguish the sexes as they walked out onto the floor - there was no way to tell the roosters from the hens. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Men of all races, sizes, and ages stepped out with grace and poise as they strutted along in their best outfits. Some of the gowns would have caused the Ziegfeld Follies girls to grow green with envy. There were elaborate headpieces, risque burlesque dresses, sparkling jewels, ostrich plumes, ermine coats, and precariously high heels. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were burly men with full beards wearing fashionable, long flowing wigs as their hairy chests protruded out of their low cut dresses. There were petite soprano men with perfectly powered faces and rouged cheeks. There were men that Rio would have sworn up and down were women based on their smooth exposed legs, contortions of the hips, and feminine gestures, wearing just enough to be within the law.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Amongst all the beautiful birds were also male impersonators - women rigged up in male attire. Though far fewer in number, they swaggered across the stage with just as much finesse and authority. Some had high and tight haircuts, others had drawn on facial hair, all had on fanciful suits and tuxedos of various colors. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a mesmerizing sight and she wasn’t sure how the judges were ever going to narrow down the choices. They had to pick the top 25 out of 50 for this first round, then the same for the second round tomorrow to get a final 50 to send to the big contest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Each of the contestants had a number written in ink on their hand to distinguish them. As they walked by the table several times, the judges would deliberate. Rio watched Agatha in heated discussion with the other two. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“3, 12, 19.” Agatha called out the eliminated numbers loudly to be heard above the music and the crowd. People cheered for their favorites and commiserated when they got knocked out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When number 34 kicked up a stink and threatened to burn the place down, Bruce got in their face and calmed them down with, “Don’t get bitter, just get better.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was partial to number 78, a Puerto Rican looking fella with a pencil mustache and a floor-length, jeweled ruby red dress with matching red heels.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bet ya a dollar number 52 makes it through.” Billy was also eagerly watching all the drama unfold. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll take that action all day. 52’s dress looks like they sewed it in the dark, please!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was only moments later when Billy slid a dollar into Rio’s hand. “Told you.” She laughed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The numbers slowly decreased as more and more were cut from the line up. When the last one was dismissed, the band broke out in a raucous up-tempo number and the winners celebrated with a Charleston on the dance floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She watched Agatha hug her fellow judges and applaud all the contestants. Rio had never seen a woman look so good in menswear before. Agatha looked like a sexy Mr. Peanut, which shouldn’t have turned her on and yet…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“These pansies sure know how to fool a man.” A slurred voice cut through her daydream from the end of the bar. An older gentleman was downing a drink and looking on at the festivities with disdain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me?” Rio wasn’t sure if she had misheard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is unnatural. It’s..uhh-it’s an insult to God. It should be illegal!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What you’re drinking is illegal.” Rio made eye contact with Herb and pointed to the drunken man. The imposing security man quickly made his way over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Time to go, chump.” He grabbed his arm and escorted him back up the stairs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would someone pay for a ticket to come down here and insult us?” Rio asked Billy who was standing beside her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish I knew.” He replied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The crowd was now filling the dance floor as well as the party was really kicking into full swing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I steal you for a dance?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked up and saw the pretty man from earlier. His stubble goatee framed his perfectly cut jaw, and there was a certain confidence about him - like he had never been intimidated by anyone in his life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m spoken for, and I’m working, sorry.” Rio remembered Agatha’s warning after their first kiss, although that had only banned her from dancing with any hot blondes. She couldn’t see the gentleman’s hair but his beard looked dark from what she could tell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, I bet you’re a real hoofer. You look like you could really move those gams.” He was pushing now. Batting his long eyelashes, giving her the eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wouldn’t you like to know.” Rio didn’t mind some harmless flirtation. Agatha always said it helped sell more drinks.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The man bit his lower lip, “Let the kid run the bar. You deserve a break. Don’t miss out on all the fun.” He seemed to speak deliberately slowly, like he was making sure to get every word out evenly. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What a sweet talker. </span>
  </em>
  <span>“I’ve already got a dance partner. You might have two left feet for all I know, and some of us have a reputation to keep around here.” She leaned against the bar top, resting her forearms on the surface. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy was meanwhile frantically motioning Agatha over. There was something about this man that didn’t sit right with him. He looked vaguely familiar but Billy wasn’t sure why. He was practically jumping and waving his arms to get the boss’s attention. When she finally caught his eye, he pointed both hands at Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She furrowed her brow and walked over to the man who was trying to put the charms on her girl. “Is there a problem here?” She questioned. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why did Rio have to be irresistibly good-looking?</span>
  </em>
  <span> It seemed like she couldn’t go a day without someone putting the moves on her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stood up straight and eyed her lover. It was a common occurance to flirt with the clientele, she didn’t understand what the commotion was all about. The man pushed off the bar and turned like he was ready to fight, “Who’s asking?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha immediately recognized his face and faltered for half a second as she took in his presence here…with Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grabbed him by the lapels of his expensive jacket and jerked him forward so they were breathing the same air. His cap fell off his head, revealing the bright silver locks beneath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What does she want?” Agatha’s voice was commanding, rough, desperate. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pietro stared down at the woman holding him. He had enough power to throw her over the bar easily but his mission wasn’t to cause harm (this time). </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She was upset that she didn’t get an invitation from you. The who’s who is here.” He glanced around at all the guests. He finally let his accent loose, and Rio realized why he had sounded so stilted before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tell your sister she can just ask next time. She doesn’t need to send her guard dogs to harass my staff.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this the kind of hospitality we can expect at our party?” He snarled back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let him go and smoothed out his lapels, breathing in deeply to calm her adrenaline. “Look around. I put on a very good show.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He begrudgingly nodded, “I’ll see myself out. No need to call your security - I’m sure I could dispatch them in a second anyway.” He turned again to face the bar, “Oh, and it was </span>
  <em>
    <span>so</span>
  </em>
  <span> nice meeting you, Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio heard the growl from Agatha over all the other noise, and they watched Pietro retreat out of the club with his hat in hand. Billy went back to serving the line. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was he one of the ones that attacked Tony?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“His name is Pietro. He is the brother of the top bitch, Wanda. I should probably describe them all to you so you know who to look for.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are they…coming for me?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“They’re coming for me. But I may have accidentally given away just how much you mean to me.” Agatha sighed heavily. “I don’t want you to worry, though. I’ll keep you safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do they want?” Rio worried about all the burdens that Agatha seemed to be carrying. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I owe them a private party here, then we should be all settled. Done. Wanda is unfortunately very much like a cat. She likes to play with her food before finishing it off.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, can you grab two more bottles of moonshine?” Billy called over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll let you go. I’m just glad you’re alright. If you see any red heads, come get me immediately. Refrain from flirting with them.” Agatha threw her a grin as she went to mingle with the guests, welcoming the distraction. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The jamboree continued through the night until the boss finally announced last call. The plastered drunks stumbled up the stairs and out into the cold night, leaving the staff alone to clean up and reset. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice came down with a small metal box in hand, “Lilia took off hours ago once the crowd died down, but she collected $342 in cover tickets!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone was shocked. At a dollar a head, this place was packed tonight. Jen was counting the bar register, “I’m up to $600 already and still counting.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Considering that a typical good night yielded around $400, this was unheard of. Agatha was more than impressed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Holy shit.” She remarked. “How many tips did you get?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy pulled out the jar of coins and bills, “Over a hundred!” He shook it in glee. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God bless these beautiful, generous, alcoholic freaks.” Agatha was already excited for one more night of profit like this. They had already surpassed the previous club record. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>For Sunday night, Rio and Billy had planned something special. He stopped by Lilia’s place that evening with a paper bag in hand. They entered Rio’s room, and she opened the bag on her bed. It was one of his suits, a crisp white cotton shirt, tie, and dress shoes. She smiled wide. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio had always preferred pants and shorts as a child, but there was some point around 12 when she must have worn them for the last time. From then on it was skirts, dresses, stockings, and the like. Now, staring down at the dark brown suit, she felt excited. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In return, Billy wanted to borrow one of Rio’s dresses. She picked one of her older dancing gowns - long sleeve but short hem, garland green in color with a belted waist. He grabbed a pair of Lilia’s pumps that surprisingly fit him and went into the bathroom to change. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stepped into the wool pants, put on the white shirt, and slowly buttoned the matching double breasted vest. She roped the necktie around her neck and fastened it securely. She stepped into the leather shoes and opted to leave off the jacket. She tended to run hot while working.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked into the floor-length mirror and admired the silhouette. She looked damn good.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door opened, “You are wearing the hell out of that suit, Rio!” Billy was fanning himself playfully.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He came over and twirled in front of the mirror. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You seem pleased with your look.” She joked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if the cheekbones fit…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s just not fair. How can you pull my own dress off better than me?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, don’t hate the player!” Billy was still admiring his own reflection.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio helped him style his curly locks into a finger wave bob. She assisted with his make-up and could hardly believe the transformation. He helped her slick her hair back and gave her his bowler hat to complete the look. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lilia! Can I borrow your tweed coat? It would be perfect.” He called out down the hall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you lose it or spill a drop of alcohol on it, you’ll wish you had never asked.” She walked into the room with the beautiful wool coat in hand. Billy donned it as carefully as if it was made of spider’s silk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You two are a shockingly beautiful couple in reverse.” Lilia looked at them both in their gender-bending attire. “Be careful on the walk over.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, we will!” Billy stumbled a bit as he started to walk in the low heels. Lilia could only laugh as they exited. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice let them in and whistled excitedly upon opening the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry we’re not open to the public yet, no matter how hot they look.” She razzed them as she stepped aside. Rio held Billy’s arm to help him down the stairs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was rearranging some chairs as they walked in. Rio watched her do an exaggerated double take. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, well, well. Looking good, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mr.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Vidal.” She walked over and the train of her violet dress trailed behind. She walked a slow circle around Rio, trying to absorb every detail. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ahem” Billy coughed loudly and had his arms out, awaiting his praise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, yeah. You too, Miss Kaplan.” Agatha gave him a tiny applause as he spun for her as well. “Now get to work, sweetcheeks.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He laughed and went behind the bar to get ready. Rio started to follow but felt Agatha’s hand pull her back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was spun into a tight hug and she felt hot breath hit her ear, “I hope Billy doesn’t expect to get this suit back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?” Rio’s voice shook as she felt Agatha’s body pressed against her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because I’m planning on ripping it off of you tonight.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was speechless. Her mouth searched for words but none came. She heard a low chuckle from Agatha as she released her and left her standing there, daydreaming about the images that she put in her head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get moving, Vidal. Plenty of work to do!” Agatha goaded her as if she wasn’t the one responsible for her daze. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She finally snapped out of it and moved to the bar to set up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It felt like she blinked and suddenly the place was crawling with people. She was cutting limes like her life depended on it. The regulars teased her vivaciously with flirtatious lines and suggestions.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio! You’ve gotta be the most handsome dame in this joint.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why aren’t you entering the contest, Rio? You’d get my vote!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d date men again if they looked like you!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She brushed them off with a smile and kept herself focussed on her work.    </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the music died down, she heard Agatha call out, “Give it up for our contestants! Second round: most convincing masquerader!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The crowd broke out in applause and everyone craned to get the best view. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fifty more beauties strolled through the hall in their finest garb. This group focused less on the outfit and more on the overall impression. The wigs were better, the make-up was impeccable, the bodies were to die for. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were several celebrity and historical impersonators, which Rio especially enjoyed. She saw one broad in a spot-on Charlie Chaplin get-up. She looked just like his character from </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Kid</span>
  </em>
  <span>. There was one contestant in a biblical virgin costume that would have made a priest blush. Another was dressed in Josephine Baker’s iconic outfit of just a beaded necklace, no top, and skirt made of artificial bananas. It was a hoot!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The band kicked off the song, “Bugle Call Rag” and the contestants showed off their best moves. They danced for 16 bars in groups of ten, and it was a joy to see their uncontainable satisfaction burst from the dance floor. Some wigs went flying, some dresses ripped, and some heels snapped to the horror of their owners. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But for others, everything went perfectly. Their gowns twirled and held together with every kick of the leg, their wigs stayed secure, their dance moves fooled everybody. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha called out the eliminated numbers each round. It was hard to watch the disappointment on their faces, but it was equally enjoyable to watch the excitement on the ones who made it through. Rio watched the Virgin Mary jump for joy as she progressed to the drag finals and wondered if that sentence had ever been thought of before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were down to 30 contestants and needed to cut 5 more but were struggling to narrow it down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha signalled the band leader to cut the music, and the judges discussed the remaining few. They picked the bottom ten and called out each number. The men and women stood on the dance floor in anticipation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood, “This is your last chance to impress us. It’s time…to dance - for your life!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pointed to the band who kicked off a rousing rendition of ‘Stumblin’ by Paul Whiteman and the group kicked it into high gear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched their moves with great interest, always keen to learn some new tricks. They all hit the dance routine in perfect rhythm. She watched their windmilling arms and synchronized twists. Number 22 performed a flawless jump into a split which made her gasp and almost drop her shaker, and number 40 could kick his foot above his head. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I’ve gotta give that a try, </span>
  </em>
  <span>she thought. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Number 5 was in a short fringed dress and at the final downbeat, he lifted the hem and flashed his pretty knickers to the crowd, which caused an outpouring of whoops and hollers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was giggling but re-composed herself and called out the final five numbers to be cut. The contest was over, and the winners rejoiced. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few of the eliminated gals gathered around the bar to drown out their sorrows. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Three high balls, honey.” One of the men spoke to Rio, who immediately got to work. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was cheering for you.” She offered. She had loved his Clara Bow costume, he had pencil-thin eyebrows like her and similar expressive wide eyes. “You had a bad day, that doesn’t mean you have bad drag.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks doll. There’s always next year.” He smiled at her and took the drinks she passed over. “You should consider entering - it should be a crime to look that good in a suit.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blushed and shook her head, “I don’t have nearly enough charisma.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Coulda fooled me.” The drag queen blew her a kiss, and she watched them down the cocktails then head back out to dance. She looked around and only saw Darcy next to her at the bar. Where was Billy?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her eyes darted around the room, though it was hard to see past the crowds. He never normally left without saying something. “Where’s the kid?” She asked Darcy, who shrugged. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She opened the door behind the bar to the storage hall but it was empty. She only saw Jen opening a new case of whisky. “Have you seen Billy?” She asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not back here. I saw him at the bar like 15 minutes ago.” Jen replied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio walked back out front and walked over to the coat check area. It looked empty but she thought she could hear rustling in the room under the stairs where they stored all the coats and corsets. Worried about potential theft, she barged in and saw two figures quickly break apart from their position against the wall. She thought it was just another young couple in the throes of passion, but then she recognised her dress. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Billy!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heyyyy, Rio.” He sheepishly waved. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to introduce your friend?” She felt the discomfort rising in the tight room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, yup. This is Eddie.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi, sir. I mean ma’am.” Eddie was like a young puppy, full of nervous energy. “I’ll meet you back out there, Billy.” He ran out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio let the silence linger.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally she relented, “Bully for you! But next time, tell me when you’re going to abandon your post, alright?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not in trouble?” He perked up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I ain’t your boss.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Rio. I didn’t even know Eddie was going to be here or how he knew this place existed. He just saw me and gave me this…look. Next thing I know his lips are on mine, and I’m in heaven.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckled and passed over a handkerchief from her vest pocket, “You might want to check yourself in the bathroom. Your lipstick looks a mess.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be back out there soon. Sorry for disappearing on you!” Billy zipped out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio walked back out quickly and saw Agatha at the bar looking desperately around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where were you?” She asked cooly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Looking for the kid. Found him in the coat closet…or maybe we should rename it the necking closet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed, “Ha! I knew if I invited Eddie that might happen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That was </span>
  <em>
    <span>your </span>
  </em>
  <span>doing?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The kid was never going to make a move. I thought a little encouragement might help.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I rarely am.” Agatha started pouring out two shots of moonshine. She offered one to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s this for?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To celebrate! The contest is done and went off without a hitch. No big troubles, no disruptions. And the money is flowing like the Nile. Bottoms up!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both downed the shot, and Rio felt the warm burn travel down her throat. She hastily poured herself a soda pop to chase the taste. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Care to join me on the dance floor?” Agatha extended her hand softly, which Rio obviously took. The violinist was leading the band in an exotic tango number. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand found its home on her partner’s waist, and she led them through the calculated steps with grace. The energy of the music pulsed between them as they moved across the floor. Agatha stood taller now in her heels, but Rio was leading the pair and guiding Agatha as she saw fit. She felt the implicit trust as she navigated them amongst the crowd of couples and the conversation in their movement spoke louder than any words. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She threw their locked hands out together and waltzed them in the same direction. Agatha’s eyes never left hers. With every spin, every turn, she always felt those deep blue eyes assessing her, devouring her every cell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe it was the moonshine or maybe just the merry gay atmosphere, but she dipped Agatha low and when she pulled her back up roughly, she wrenched her into a feverish kiss. She felt extra brave and nipped at Agatha’s bottom lip, who responded by shoving her tongue into Rio’s mouth. It was all heat, all frenzy, all consuming. Like the tango, it was both a battle for control and a complete surrender. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they finally released each other’s lips, Agatha yanked Rio’s arm up to look at her watch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck.” She muttered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s still two more hours before I can take you home.” Agatha was breathing hard and looked dangerous. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio smirked back, “Eager much?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have no idea.” She was looking at Rio like she was about to jump her right then and there. “Go - before I do something I regret.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you insist.” Rio walked away and looked over her shoulder. Agatha was standing in place, still staring. She watched her take a deep breath, close her eyes, and try to go back to playing host.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio went back to the bar and served the eager customers. The finalists were jubilant in their victory and downing drinks like it was going out of style. The losers were consoling themselves with just as much, if not more, booze. It really was a win-win for the club. Rio understood why Agatha had fought to secure the pleasure of hosting this illustrious event. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The night finally wound down and the guest slowly departed. The band played their final note, and Agatha called all the staff to the bar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to thank everyone here for your dedication and hard work. I couldn’t have done this without any of you. There were so many ways this could have gone wrong, but I’m so proud of how it turned out and that’s because of you.” She looked at everyone that was gathered around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lilia is going to count up the total take, and we’ll distribute your normal wages plus a bonus for the weekend next week. It’s late, so let’s share one last drink then call it a night. We can clean up properly tomorrow!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Darcy poured shots of Jean-Paul’s finest whisky, and they all clinked their glasses happily before downing the sweet elixir and saying their goodnights. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt a hand grasp hers and she turned to see Agatha with both their coats. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ready to come home with me?” The boss was looking at her with hungry eyes </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio had felt tired a moment ago, but now, she was wide awake. She stepped aside to usher Agatha up the stairs, “Ladies first.” </span>

  <p>
  <span>The pair walked the empty streets of the city, reeling from the high of the successful evening. Agatha felt on top of the world, and now she wanted her prize. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She held onto Rio’s hand as if it was the only thing keeping her tethered to the ground. The cool night air was a welcome relief from the heat building in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio followed her into her building. In the elevator, they stood in silence as the attendant pressed the button. In the years that she had lived in this building, this was the longest ride of Agatha’s life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She kept her eyes on Rio, who was buzzing with anticipation and wished she could take her right here against the wall of this tight space. She could feel the warmth of her body just standing beside her and the nervous energy reflecting out her every pore. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She watched the arrow inch past the first floor - Agatha’s palms were starting to sweat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The arrow crept past two - her heart was pounding so hard that she thought it was surely echoing in this tiny box.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The arrow settled on three - the butterflies in her stomach had grown to the size of bats and threatened to burst from her body. The air felt suffocating. She watched Rio pulling the collar of her dress shirt to try to cool herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The metal gate opened, and she sprung out of the elevator and took a gasping breath. She fumbled with her keys at the door. The impending event was overwhelming her fine motor skills. When she eventually unlocked it and let them inside, she threw all her belongings down haphazardly and turned to face Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you ready?” She purred the question, and Rio just nodded. She looked close to the edge already, and they hadn’t even touched yet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha approached and ripped the vest open with her hands. The buttons bounced across the hardwood floors. Rio gasped at the action, undeniably turned on. Agatha ran her hands down from Rio’s shoulders, ghosting her chest and across her stomach. Then, she grabbed her by the tie and started walking her like a dog to the bedroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At the doorway, Agatha released her grip on the accessory and pushed Rio inside. She kicked off her heels then dropped to her knees and started undoing the belt on Rio’s pants. Rio was staring down at her like she was trying to sear the image into her memory. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled the leather belt off and cast it aside, then carefully undid the buttons on the trousers. Her fingers deliberately took their time as she kept her eyes locked on Rio’s face. The arousal was evident, but she seemed unable to move. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can touch me too, you know?” Agatha smirked this time, and this spurred Rio to action. She felt her fingers thread into her long hair, and she relished the feeling as she gripped the waistband and slowly slid the pants down the sinfully long legs in front of her. She ran her fingers along the delicate skin on display and admired the short silk bloomers that hit Rio’s mid-thigh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rose from her knees and stared at the beautiful woman before her. She leaned in and captured her lips. The kiss began slowly but hurriedly increased with passion and longing as all of their feelings exploded like a car crash into each other. Agatha reached down and shed the vest from Rio’s body. She pushed Rio back onto the bed and pounced on her like she meant to swallow her whole. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled her down and kissed her hard. Agatha let her full weight drop onto the body below her and disappeared into her mouth. The only thing she could feel was the wet heat of Rio’s delicious tongue, and she wished she could drown in it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My dress.” She struggled to remember words. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt hands grappling with the numerous buttons on the back of her gown, then finally the sweet release as Rio pushed the fabric off her shoulders and down her body. She kicked it the rest of the way to the floor and wrapped her legs around the woman below her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They made out fiercely as they both got more acquainted with the other’s mouth. It was an intoxicating exploration of passion, and Agatha was fighting to keep control of her body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need to take these off.” Rio’s voice was rough and low - a new feeling of excitement was rousing inside her.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sat up and kept Agatha in her lap as she wrenched the shirt and tie over her head. She tossed them off the bed and Agatha admired the sudden new display of tan skin. Rio was now wearing only a white cotton brassiere and her green silk knickers as she lay back down on her back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned down and sucked at Rio’s neck, then kissed her way down her exposed shoulder and mouthed gently at the fabric on her breast to the most delightful moans and sounds above her before she made her way down the toned stomach and along the top of the elastic waistband around her hips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please.” Rio whispered out in sweet torment as Agatha made her way back up her body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, what?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me see you.” To which the older woman nodded, and Rio immediately moved to her knees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was clad in a full-length rayon garter brassiere, and Rio started unhooking the side clasps with urgency. She felt her breasts finally let loose from the tight restraints and breathed a sigh of relief. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio peeled away the soft fabric then unlatched the inner belt and released the stocking hooks one by one. Each undoing built the anticipation like a boiling kettle and the steam was on the verge of release. It was like each hook was holding the last of her resolve. She was utterly at Rio’s disposal now.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Agatha was in just her silk pink slip and stockings. Rio moved down Agatha’s body and rolled each stocking down her leg, leaving soft kisses on each bit of skin that came into view - first her upper thigh, then her knee, then her calf, and a final peck on her delicate feet. The slow descent was agonizing in its pace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re driving me crazy.” Agatha moaned out. Her thighs were all but shaking with nervous tension.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now you know how you make me feel constantly.” Rio fired back and finished removing the other stocking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she made her way back up, she grasped the lace edge of the slip and lifted it up and over Agatha’s head. She was as naked as the day she was born but didn’t feel exposed or embarrassed. Rio’s gaze was penetrating and made her skin feel like it was on fire. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Touch me.” She tried not to sound as exceedingly desperate as she felt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hands were as attentive as a gardener. She felt like every inch of her skin was a bed of precious flowers being taken care of, tended to, worshipped. Rio’s mouth found her breasts and sucked her nipples until they stood at a tight attention. She sighed heavily and used her hands to hold Rio’s head to her chest. She felt her tongue flicking against the now hard buds and savored the pleasure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, Rio. That’s so good.” She threw her head back and tried to focus on the feeling alone. She normally struggled to enjoy the moment with past lovers, who were always so inexperienced, hesitant and reliant on her direction. But Rio was somehow confident in every movement, as if this wasn’t her first time at all, as if she knew every button to push to make Agatha lose control. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled her hair up and guided her to her mouth for a sloppy kiss. She used the distraction to flip Rio, so she was now on top. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She grinned down at her. “Now strip.” She commanded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio unhooked her brassiere and exposed her breasts, then reached down and shimmied out of her bloomers as best she could beneath Agatha. She stared up at the goddess on top of her and wrapped her arms around her. The feeling of their nude bodies connecting for the first time was thrilling. It was like that first taste of moonshine - completely intoxicating. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha used her arms to push herself back and down Rio’s body, and she settled herself on her stomach between the muscular, toned dancer's legs on either side of her. She placed soft kisses on the hip bones and then licked a long streak down into Rio’s inner thigh where she sucked a tender red mark into the skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was hypnotized. She had never had a lover put their mouth on her before. Every time she had sex before it had been an exercise in patience. Occasionally enjoyable, though mostly an endurance challenge as a man writhed above her and reached his own conclusion without so much as caring to start one within her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she felt Agatha stroke her maiden-hair and push apart her thighs, she watched every move as if studying for the most important test of her life. Her legs were spread, and she saw Agatha approach the very core of her and place her mouth on the pink surfaces she had revealed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ay dios mío.” Rio breathed out, her Spanish rising to the surface as her facilities were overwhelmed at the sensory overload overtaking her body. She gripped the bed sheets tightly as Agatha devoured her. Her tongue was lapping at her folds like she was the sweetest dessert on the planet, and Agatha intended to savor every lick. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt intense pressure as Agatha surrounded her clit with the warm embrace of her mouth, and Rio held her in place as she climbed the mountain of desire within herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Right there. Yes, god yes. Agatha, what are you doing to me?” She was within the throes of it now. Inching closer and closer to the zenith.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She glanced down, and Agatha was staring up at her. Those brilliant blues were intensely monitoring her and cataloging her every reaction. It roused in her a wild compassion. Agatha wanted to know what made her tick, what made her feel good. She wanted to know how she responded to every single flick of the tongue or caress of her hand. To be seen so completely was both electrifying and frightening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then Agatha brought her hand up to join her mouth, and Rio would swear she saw the face of the eternal. She felt Agatha filling her, and her body writhed with ecstasy at the combination of sensations. The strokes were slow to start as Agatha listened and learned the soundtrack of her lover’s desire. She was like a conductor, orchestrating the world’s finest symphony. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ohhh…ohhh..mmmmm.” Each moan and cry helped guide her and teach her. She moved her two fingers faster and felt Rio’s body respond quickly - her hips pushing down to meet her pace. She sucked harder and was rewarded with a long moan, and Agatha could tell that Rio was getting very close.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha!” She heard her name sing out in the room - each syllable held like a song, like a hymn. She flicked her eyes up again to see Rio’s eyes tightly clamped shut as her body started to seize. Inarticulate cries rang out in the room as she rode out her rapturous crisis. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her limbs contract and a rush of inexplicable warmth exploded in her chest. She imagined this was how a match felt the moment it was struck and erupted into flame. Pure sudden heat. The molten flame carried her away in unspeakable waves of pleasure.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her brain felt like a melted candle, like it was no longer capable of coherent thought. She felt Agatha remove her hand slowly and delicately crawl up the bed beside her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck kind of witch are you?” Was what came out of her mouth when she regained the ability to speak. It felt like she was under a spell. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Enjoy yourself?” Agatha rested her head on her shoulder and traced lines across her chest that was still trying to get back to a normal breathing rhythm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glanced down at the self-satisfied look on her lover’s face. “Has anyone ever told you that you’re very good at that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Once or twice.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Rio gave her a light shove then leaned over and kissed her. She tasted herself on Agatha’s tongue, and her heart skipped a beat. The brain mush transformed into a snake. She felt completely alert, ready to strike, coiled and poised to attack. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt her room spin and her back hit the mattress as Rio flipped them. She was now looking up at the younger woman, who had just a second ago been in a dazed post-orgasm fog. Rio’s cheeks were flushed, and she was looking down at her with searing arousal. She caught her lower lip between her teeth in fear and excitement.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take me.” Agatha egged her on as she felt Rio’s confidence wane. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That was enough. Two words that relit the fire within her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio dove down and attacked Agatha’s neck, claiming the skin with aggressive bites and sinfully painful sucks. Agatha hummed with pleasure as she moved her hands along Rio’s smooth back and tried to refrain from scratching her nails too deeply into the skin at her fingertips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Their mouths met again in a mess of sopping, raw heat. Agatha felt Rio’s hand trail a fiery pathway along the curve of her hip and straight past her dark fleece into its throbbing, tender target. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck, Rio.” She was lost to the feeling now. There was nothing else in the world besides the fingers stroking her to salvation. In the quiet intimacy of the night, she yielded her body away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio had surrendered herself completely. She was moving as if possessed. There was no time for thought or worry or shame. She was chasing Agatha’s pleasure and was determined to catch and release it. To let it explode into the world at her beckoning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“More…please, please.” Agatha was moving up and down as Rio’s fingers moved within her but was desperate for even more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure?” Rio didn’t want to hurt her, but Agatha’s frenzied nodding relieved her of any hesitation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She added a third finger easily and resumed her devotions with renewed haste. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t stop…don’t…” Agatha stuttered as her foundation crumbled and the reckless passion overtook her. She thought she was dying - like death had finally come, and if this was death, she welcomed the beautiful, sensual all-consuming encounter with open arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt the walls clench around her fingers, and she almost came again right then as she watched the woman below her achieve her pinnacle. She watched the waves of pleasure crash across Agatha’s body and felt power surge through her bones. She had never felt so in control in her life. To be so trusted with another person’s body, their soul, their being. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was everything. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She held Agatha close as she came back to reality. She stroked her brilliant, wild hair with tender caresses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jesus christ.” Agatha’s eyes were still shut but the words fell from her lips. “I think you’ve ruined me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that…a good thing?” Rio asked innocently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That was so daringly close to perfection. I don’t think I could survive if it was taken away.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned, “I’ve never - and I mean </span>
  <b>never </b>
  <span>felt anything like that before. I think I’m the one who’s ruined.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are so beautiful, bunny.” Agatha’s eyes were open now, appraising the gorgeous body beside her. Her hands painted languid strokes across the secret skin of Rio’s waist and hips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re the most breathtaking beauty that I’ve ever seen.” Rio started, “And some of those masqueraders tonight were pretty damn stunning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted with laughter at the backhanded compliment, “Don’t push your luck.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or what?” Rio sucked her teeth, eyebrow raised in challenge.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha brought a hand down to Rio’s clit and teased the sensitive bud with careful ministrations. She leaned close to Rio’s ear, “One of the perks of female pleasure is the ability to go all…night…long.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mmmmm, that…doesn’t sound like a punishment.” Rio felt her head tilt back as she succumbed to Agatha’s power again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was riding the stimulus like a shameless cowgirl, yet as the keen pleasure began to coil in her loins, it was suddenly snatched away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes snapped open, and she watched her lover roll from the bed with gymnastic grace. “Where are you going?” She felt the loss between her legs desperately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was silent as she walked to her closet and opened the door. She rustled around for a moment then spun around with something behind her back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s a thin line between pleasure and pain. Loss of pleasure can be almost as devastating as the agony of pain.” She pulled out a long white feather boa and draped it around her neck. </span>
</p><p><span>Rio’s eyes went wide with desire. Her fantasy was standing before her in all her naked glory. <em>I</em></span><em> <span>think I’m in love with you.</span></em><span> The thought exploded in her mind like a firework. </span><em><span>No, nope, definitely not the right time to confess that one.</span></em> <em><span>Get it together, Vidal.</span></em></p><p>
  <span>“Ready to behave?” Agatha stepped towards the bed slowly, seductively pulling the boa back and forth along her neck. “Or am I going to have to make you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio fell back on her elbows as she watched this queen approach her. She wasn’t even sure if she was nodding or just imagining the motion. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Yeah, I’m completely ruined. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She was trembling with yearning, “Mother, if you want to be in control…you can be.” </span>
</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>When Rio finally came up for air from her marathon bedroom session with Agatha, she felt completely and utterly spent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Need food. Need water.” She croaked out dramatically to her bedmate. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was late afternoon on Monday. They had gone round after round like it was a championship boxing match, and Rio had watched the sun rise and start to fall again. There had been brief naps in between peaks of pure pleasure, but they hadn’t left the room in hours. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, I’ll make you some toast. I think that’s all I have in the house right now.” Agatha threw on her silk robe and went to the kitchen to scrounge up something to eat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She spread some jam on a few slices of toast and poured them both some water. She brought the plate in first then came back holding the glasses. Rio sat up in bed and devoured the toast greedily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You really know how to give a broad a workout.” She took a long drink of water to replenish herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t stayed up like this in…no I’ve never stayed up this long. I’m beat.” Agatha ate her toast while sitting on the edge of the bed. “Whoops.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> A bit of jam fell from the bread onto her hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched it happen and before Agatha could move, she shuffled behind her on the bed and snaked her hand around her body. Rio lifted Agatha’s arm up and over her shoulder and guided the hand to her mouth. She had the shameless audacity to lick the jam off her palm in one seductive swipe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sound from Agatha’s mouth could only be described as a lustful whimper. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just recovered, and then you go and do that?” She licked her lips as she felt Rio’s presence surrounding her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One more?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was never one to deny such a simple request. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was 6pm when the two lovers finally had the self-control to put on actual clothes for the day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re lucky I know my way around a sewing needle.” Rio quipped. “I can’t give Billy this vest back without a single button left.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t say I didn’t warn you.” Agatha shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They made the short walk to the club to help the team clean up from the weekend festivities.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice of you two to finally show up.” Jen scoffed when they strolled in together hand in hand. She took in their appearances and noted that Rio was wearing one of Agatha’s dresses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you even sleep last night?” She asked, eyeing them both with a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned a deep red and averted her gaze, while Agatha just grinned, “Jealous?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ew, I’d rather not know all the details…” She looked between the two of them and tilted her head, “Or on second thought…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nuh uh, not going there.” Agatha started to pull down the decorations on the walls, and Rio grabbed a broom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She started near the stage where Billy was tidying the tables. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is it true?” He looked at her expectantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Her lips turned up in a smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You and Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I never kiss and tell.” Rio hurriedly pushed the broom along the dance floor and away from the questioning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were only working for half an hour or so before Lilia came down the stairs with a note in hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha, a telegram came into the pharmacy this morning for you.” She passed the paper over and Agatha saw the Western Union lettering across the top. </span>
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>
      <span>Expect us on Saturday May 20, 10pm. Don’t let me down. </span>
    </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>
  <span>The message was short, but she had no doubt who it was from. They had a little less than a month before the gang would descend these stairs.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Our red headed friend?” Lilia asked and Agatha nodded solemnly. She waved Jen over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How is the alcohol stock looking?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A bit lower than we expected but we’ll be fine for the week. I’ve been increasing the batches of moonshine, and we should have a healthy supply within two weeks. I suggest re-upping on vodka, rum, and beer. There are still plenty of cases of gin thanks to those generous Irish lads you met.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Jen. Keep up on the shine production. Wanda’s coming in a month. I’ll take care of the rest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha, wait. One more thing.” Lilia pulled her over behind the bar. “I want you to have this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled out a Smith and Wesson revolver and tried to pass it over but Agatha refused to grab it. “No! You must be kidding right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take it. And hope to god you never have to use it, but Agatha, please take it. We’ve underestimated Wanda before, let’s not make that mistake again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She took the gun in her hand, holding it like it was made of glass. “What do you think is going to happen?” She looked to Lilia with concern. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t put anything past these people. They are power-hungry gangsters, don’t forget that for a second. Their goal is to gain as much control over the city as possible, and they’ll stop at nothing to make that happen. We’re just a distraction to them, and they won’t hesitate to exploit that if need be. I need you to be safe.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stashed the gun under the bar, on the top shelf. “Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next week was spent gallivanting across town again. Agatha was grateful for all the contacts she had made in the lead up to the drag ball. Suppliers were constantly changing as police continued to crackdown on bootleggers, runners, and sellers. Many of her older connections were now out of the business or sitting in the slammer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She knew that Wanda expected the top of the top for entertainment. She had to pay more than she had hoped, but she was able to secure a one-night only performance from a neighboring Harlem blues singer, Gladys Bentley and her chorus line of dancers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They were the hottest ticket in town at Harry Hansberry’s Clam House on 133rd Street - one of the few other speakeasies in the city that catered to the same unique clientele.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On Friday, Agatha called a meeting with all the staff who would be working the gang night. They gathered in the evening in the club and sat at one of the large booths. Rio scooted into the bench with Billy, Darcy, Jen, Alice, and Lilia. Herb stayed standing and Sharon was in one of the chairs. Agatha stood at the front of the table to address them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is going to be very different from any other event we’ve held here. I want to warn you all in advance. This is not going to be fun like the drag ball or our typical night of business. The guests are going to be some of the most dangerous men and women in the city, and they are not known for their manners, to say the least.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The number one pair to watch out for are the heads of the operation: Wanda and Vision. Wanda, otherwise known as Glamour, has very distinct red hair and the world's finest clothing. Do not let your guard down in her presence; she will jump on any vulnerability, and I suspect she’ll be looking for a fight. She may play coy, but she’s a bearcat. Proceed with caution.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Vision is an imposing force but mostly harmless. Tall, blonde, very calculating. He can seem robotic and emotionless, but stay alert. Anything he hears goes straight back to Wanda. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, there’s Pietro, Wanda’s twin brother / attack dog. Extremely volatile, charming, has very distinctive silver hair. He is the muscle and usually works with one or two other Brunos. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Avoid any situation that will put you alone with </span>
  <b>any</b>
  <span> member of the gang. Always have someone with you.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>I’ve hired five extra security men to work with you, Herb. They will be stationed at every exit to assist if things go south. Hopefully, that won’t be necessary. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If all goes to plan, they will arrive by 10pm and be out of our hair by 2am. We just have to make it through four hours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why are we doing this again?” Alice raised her hand and asked cautiously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I made a poor decision and now have to pay for it. I deeply apologize to everyone here - it was my mistake to tangle with Wanda, and this time I lost. I promise this won’t happen again.” Agatha still felt extremely guilty for throwing them all into this situation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You couldn’t have known.” Billy tried to console her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, she could have. She should have!” Jen blurted out. She had dealt with Wanda once and that was more than enough. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jennifer, have a little grace. We all make mistakes.” Lilia came to Agatha’s defense. She knew that the boss regretted it, even though it had seemed like the best option at the time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, truly. Only good news I have is that I’ve booked the best singer this side of Manhattan - Gladys Bentley.” Agatha hoped the entertainment would keep things lively.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow, she’s the bee’s knees! I heard she draws quite the crowd.” Billy was always hip to the best acts in town.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hopefully she can keep the party going without a hitch. We’ve also engaged our old friend with the NYPD to stay off our case. Thank you Lilia for handling that. I’ve ordered more beer and rum to help cover us, so expect a few shipments in the next few weeks. If you run into any issues, come find me. Thank you in advance for everything.” Agatha dismissed them but held Rio back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait, I’ve got something for you.” Agatha pulled something from the pocket of her coat. She handed it to Rio. The idea had been on her mind for ages now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio read the small paper and looked up with excitement in her eyes, “Are you kidding??”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, “It’s my turn to take you out. I owe you one, and it will be nice to forget about all this for a day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You got me Yankees tickets?!” Rio was jumping now, the joy was infectious and Agatha laughed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you ever been before?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only in my dreams! This is amazing.” She threw her arms around Agatha and kissed her with abandon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The game is on Monday at 5pm. I’ll come get you an hour before. Does that work for you?” Agatha asked after they broke apart. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be counting down the minutes.” Rio hugged her again, unable to believe she was really going to see her favorite team in person. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The weekend was uneventful, which caused it to move even slower in Rio’s mind. She was so excited for their date that everything else paled in comparison. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>On Monday, Rio chose a light spring outfit as the weather was now warming up. She had picked up a new knitted sport blouse the other day, and this felt like the perfect occasion to show it off. She paired the two-toned wool top with a fashionable long skirt and cloche hat. She wished she still had her baseball mitt in case a foul ball flew their way, but it was back in Puerto Rico and probably wouldn’t fit anymore anyway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha arrived at the apartment promptly at 4, looking stunning as always in a plaid velour dress. “Ready to go, sweetheart?” She kissed her date on the cheek </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been waiting my whole life for this.” Rio nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Polo Grounds stadium was only a short subway ride away, situated right next to the Harlem River. They could see the brand new Yankee Stadium currently under construction on the other side of the river, but for now the team shared this facility with the Giants. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Walking into the iconic horseshoe-shaped stadium was like walking hallowed ground for Rio. Agatha had bought prime seats on the second level of the double-decker grandstand, right behind home plate. They had an eagle eye view of the entire field. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pinch me, I must be dreaming.” She held out her arm as they took their seats. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her have it, “Ouch! I was just joking.” Rio laughed and rubbed her arm. The minor distraction only temporarily tore her away from analyzing every inch of the place. Her eyes were restless, there was so much to see. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My God…” Rio’s voice was trembling and Agatha heard the sharp intake of breath beside her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? What is it?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s him. It’s really him.” She pointed to the home team dugout where a large man had just walked out and was stretching with a bat in hand. “It’s the Great Bambino, The Sultan of Swat, The Colossus of Clout…it’s Babe Ruth!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had heard the name before like everyone else in the city, but she had never seen him before. Rio was star struck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s the big deal about him?” Agatha questioned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This caused a collective gasp to ring out from everyone within spitting distance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s the greatest ballplayer the world has ever seen!” One man turned and exclaimed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He can pitch, he can field, he can hit. The man can do it all!” The guy next to them chimed in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s smashed so many records, they are losing track.” A woman behind them got in on the conversation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay I get it, he’s good.” Agatha chuckled at everyone’s passion and held up her hands in defeat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first pitch was thrown out by “Schoolboy” Hoyt and the game was underway. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t care much for the balls and bats of it all, so she instead enjoyed the childlike joy erupting beside her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look, look! There’s “Home Run” Baker coming up to the plate. Gosh, I hope he slams one out of here.” Rio was pointing and rising from her chair, almost levitating from excitement. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Yanks were ahead in the 3rd inning, but the White Sox came back in the fourth by putting three runs on the board and taking the lead by one. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha subtly rubbed Rio’s leg to soothe her, “It’s okay. Surely they will come back and fly a dinger or whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed at her half-hearted attempt at the lingo and whispered, “You’re cute when you try to talk baseball.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha scrunched her nose in annoyance but couldn’t stay mad for long as the first baseman, Wally Pipp knocked one into left field for a double and Rio flew out of her seat with a solid holler. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Yankees batted in four more runs and were ahead 7 to 5 by the time the seventh inning stretch rolled along. The two women stood from their chairs, and Rio suggested they find some food. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you having a good time?” Agatha asked sarcastically, already knowing the response. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is the greatest! You’ve outdone yourself - I don’t know how any other date will compare.” Rio was skipping as they walked down the steps to find some concessions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get ya hot dogs here!” They heard the loud caller from the upper deck and followed his voice to the cart. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Two dogs and two Cokes.” Rio handed over a quarter and took the food and drinks from the man. “Toppings?” She asked Agatha as she handed over the glass bottles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mustard and ketchup.” Rio squirted the sauces on both the hot dogs and wrapped them both up in foil again. They walked back to their seats as the game was kicking off again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio unwrapped her hot dog and dove right in. She ate like she hadn’t been fed in days, and Agatha watched in horror and fascination. She admired the reckless freedom that Rio seemed to exude. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, Agatha had grown up with a mother who insisted that girls be prim and proper at all costs, no matter the pain or discomfort or impracticality. She had lessons in posture, in elocution, and in dining etiquette. All efforts to find her the best possible husband. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wished that Evanora could see her now - shoving a large sausage covered in messy sauce in her mouth at a ball game with her younger (sinfully attractive) date. She prayed that her mother was rolling in her grave and delighted at the thought. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You like it?” Rio spoke with her mouth full and a spot of mustard on her lower lip, which shouldn’t have been endearing, but Agatha almost melted at the sight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love it.” She replied, and of course she didn’t mean just the food. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Somehow Rio had burrowed her way into every one of her thoughts. Her walls weren’t crumbling - they were simply rubble at this point. She would happily cede control of her fortifications if this was the reward. With Rio, she felt so at ease, so safe and also so cared for. It was everything she had ever hoped her life could be.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt Rio grab her arm as if she had seen a ghost, “He’s coming up! They’re bringing him in!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They heard the announcer call out “Number 3, Babe Ruth” to the wild cheers of the crowd. The slugger was coming in as a designated hitter for the inning, and Rio rose to her feet to get a better view. He was a looming figure on the field, and his reputation preceded him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was like the crowd had taken a collective intake of breath and was holding it as the pitcher threw two balls in a row, both missing the strike zone. On the third wind up, the ball flew low and outside with serious heat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched him resting the bat on his shoulder and then the explosion of power as he stepped towards the ball and released. She would never forget the echoing crack of the bat as he belted one over the right field wall. It sent a wave of goosebumps down her arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Going, going, gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched Rio’s eyes grow wide, a huge smile spread across her face, and the amazement painted across her features upon watching this simple little ball soar through the air. It seemed so arbitrary but in that moment, it was the entire world.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone leapt from their seats and celebrated in the stands. Rio grabbed Agatha in a jumping hug as they spun in place, and the crowd cheered for the Babe as he rounded the bases.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t believe we just saw that! That was absolutely incredible!” Rio was buzzing. What more could she possibly ask for? Lucky for her the Yankees held the lead and closed things out at the top of the 9th. It was the perfect ending to the perfect date with the perfect woman. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“What was she like?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A forebody sort of beauty, like she could either give you a twist of the hips or a twist of a knife.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was Mother like with her?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Protective would be an understatement. Even before she realized it was me, she was ready to throw a punch.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda stretched out on her chaise lounge. She had been keeping a low profile lately since Vision was out of town. She had sent her brother to Agatha’s speakeasy for some recon and to get the low down on the woman at the center of all this drama. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any weaknesses?” She laid her head back as Pietro relaxed in the armchair in her lounge room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hard to say. She’s a flirt, yet it’s obvious that Agatha has a hold on her. Doesn’t look like much of a fighter but word around the club was that she can really dance. I didn’t get a chance to see it though.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I need to dust off the old dancing heels.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t doubt your charm but wouldn’t get your hopes up. Mother has all her staff on a short leash from the looks of things.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can be very persuasive.” Wanda hadn’t been challenged in years. She had sat atop this organisation for almost twenty years now, and there had been many obstacles along the way, many things she had given up and sacrificed to be where they are now. She had given her life up for Vision and her people. Though she pushed the pain away in the pursuit of power, it still reared its head at times. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She missed getting her hands dirty - it was something that always brought her out of the darkness. Agatha’s little favor was the most excitement she’d had in a decade. She wasn’t about to let it end just like this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you fetch the leather strop?” Wanda turned and asked her brother. “I think we need to sharpen our knives.” </span>

  <p>
  <span>Rio had received a note in her pocket that day at the shop from her not-so-secret admirer. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Meet me downstairs at 8pm. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It was straight to the point. Tonight was the night that they were hosting Wanda and her crew, and Rio had seen the stress building within Agatha. She was meticulously suffering over every detail to ensure everything went to plan. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had tried to relax her with long nights spent together tumbling in the sheets and calm evenings lounging in the bathtub, but it was like Agatha’s mind was not her own. She was completely occupied with the looming threat of Wanda. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s just one night, what’s the worst that can happen?” She had asked last week as they sat at the dining table eating a delicious roast that Agatha had prepared. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t put anything past Wanda. I’m still trying to work out her angle. She’s getting a huge party and excessive amounts of booze for free, but I just get the feeling she’s after something more.” Agatha could barely eat. She just batted her carrots around the plate absentmindedly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be there with you all night. If she tries anything, I’ll take her down.” Rio’s joke finally got a laugh out of Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s a sport I would actually be excited to go see - Rio vs. Wanda. Sudden death boxing match.” They both laughed at the thought. Rio was more of a lover than a fighter but seeing how out of sorts Agatha was, she felt a sudden need to protect her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After going back to the apartment to change for the night and grabbing a bite to eat, Rio walked back to the club. Alice was already there and let her in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you ready for tonight, Rio?” She asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m ready for it to be over, you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Same. Can’t wait until these troublemakers are out of here. I don’t think I’ll relax until then.” Alice confessed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stay safe.” Rio patted her shoulder as she passed and descended the stairs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The space was stunning when she took it all in. They had all been working hard for the past week to deck it out, and now it looked like it could rival the Cotton Club. Every table was covered in pristine white tablecloth, they had doubled the amount of plants and greenery, and they had brought back the curtains and lights from the drag night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was speaking with the singer for the night on the stage. Gladys Bentley was famous for her cross-dressing act. She was a beautiful, tall black woman and wore the most stunning white tuxedo with tails, including a top hat and walking cane. She could sing like a canary and play the piano as well as Jelly Roll Morton. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She also brought along her crew of dancers - men in sparkling showgirl getups with feathered headbands and dance moves that could land them on Broadway. The contrasting gender dynamics combined with undeniable talent made them one of the most sought after acts in Harlem.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha saw Rio approaching and came down to the floor, “Hey beautiful.” She kissed her on both cheeks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I missed you.” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I saw you last night.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I miss you the second you’re out of my sight.” Rio said without a hint of embarrassment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s part of the reason I called you down here early. I wanted to spend some time together before things get too crazy. I’m going to be next to you at the bar all night to keep an eye on things, but we probably won’t get to relax much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Billy and I can handle the drinks…if you need to take care of other stuff.” Rio loved that Agatha was going to be near but didn’t want her to feel obligated. There were going to be a lot of moving parts tonight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No way, you’re my top priority. Hopefully I’m enough of a deterrent for anyone thinking of starting something.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The band started rehearsing on the stage, checking their instruments and Gladys was warming up her voice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I asked Miss Bentley to sing us one of her tunes before the party kicked off. I wanted to share one more dance with you.” Agatha took the lead position this time and held onto her partner tightly as she moved them across the dance floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A slow blues number rang out from the stage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This one’s for you Mother.” Gladys sat at the piano and started singing the recognizable cover of Ma Rainey’s scandalous song. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Went out last night, had a great big fight </span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Everything seemed to go on wrong</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>I looked up, to my surprise</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>The gal I was with was gone.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let her hand rest on Rio’s waist and enjoyed the feeling of her body as they twirled in place. She let her worries subside for this moment as Rio leaned against her and let herself be led for a change. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Where she went, I don't know</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>I mean to follow everywhere she goes;</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Folks say I'm crooked. I didn't know where she took it</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>I want the whole world to know.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio moved to put both hands around Agatha’s neck and pulled her in closer. They were face to face, and she could feel Agatha’s warm breath mingling with her own. The beautiful, raspy voice surrounding them in a cocoon of safety. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>They say I do it, ain't nobody caught me</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Sure got to prove it on me</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She listened to the lyrics, surprised at their candid nature. It was not just rare to hear a woman singing about loving women, it was unheard of. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wish we were born 2000 years earlier or 2000 years later.” She whispered to her partner during the musical interlude. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know - it’s not fair. This time we live in feels so close to progress and yet so desperately far away. On the one hand, we have this place that we’ve built where I can dance with you like this and kiss you like this.” Agatha only had to lean forward an inch to plant a sensitive kiss on the awaiting lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On the other hand, if I did that just a few feet away, up on that street, we might get arrested or attacked and called a ‘bulldagger’ or worse. This country can band together to outlaw alcohol and give us the right to vote, but I can’t imagine when our love will ever be accepted or normalized. Certainly not in my lifetime.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio couldn’t imagine it either. It seemed as far-fetched as an HG Wells story, as unlikely as a woman in the White House or a visit to the moon. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Went out last night with a crowd of my friends,</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>They must've been women, 'cause I don't like no men.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>It's true I wear a collar and a tie,</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Makes the wind blow all the while</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="left">
  <span>Agatha spun Rio out and extended her arm. She caught her easily as she twirled back in. They moved in lock step with each other. It was seamless and easy. Rio wished she had worn a suit again. It really was much more comfortable dancing in pants and flat shoes, despite her familiarity with the alternative. </span>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Don't you say I do it, ain't nobody caught me</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>You sure got to prove it on me.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Say I do it, ain't nobody caught me</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <em>
    <span>Sure got to prove it on me.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The song finished with a perfect sustained note from Gladys, and Rio kissed Agatha softly before ending their private moment on the dance floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks for the dance, sweetheart.” Agatha lifted Rio’s hand and kissed the top of it like they were in an old fairy tale. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They heard Billy clapping behind the bar - their biggest fan. Rio rolled her eyes and went to join him to prepare. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You two set the bar too high. I want to have what you have.” He said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re still so young. You’ve got plenty of time.” Rio started pulling bottles of rum from the open cases. “What about Eddie?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy sighed, “We’ve met up a few more times since that night, but…I don’t know. He is so jumpy and hesitant when we’re out together. It’s not the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry kid. Maybe he just needs some time. It can be tough to come to terms with brand new feelings like this, take it from me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen came out the side door, “Hey you two, I’ve stacked the crates in the hall for easy access. Moonshine first, then whisky, then gin, rum, and beer. Everything is labelled and organized by value so always pull from the top of the stack first. Got it?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aye aye captain.” Billy saluted her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, matey. I’ll be trying to keep a low profile tonight in the back, I don’t know where the Sokovians stand on color mixing, and I don’t intend to find out. But if you need me, just do the double knock on the back room door.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, “Thank you, Jen. Hopefully we won’t need anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Darcy said she would cover the coat check for me, then she’ll handle service on the floor - cleaning up glasses and delivering drinks.” Billy let her know. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Great. Agatha said she was going to stay at the bar with us. That should keep us safe from any aggressive types.” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh thank god.” Billy let out a sigh of relief. “I’m worried, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll be fine. I trust Agatha with my life. She won’t let anything bad happen to us.” Rio reached out and gave him a comforting pat on the back. “Remember the road trip? She would lie to a cop to keep us out of trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy’s laugh broke the tension, “You’re right. I bet it will all be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They finished the final preparations, and the whole crew did one last sweep of the place to clean any rogue dust bunnies or spider webs still lingering in corners. There were just 20 minutes left before they expected the first arrivals. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave the last words, “Remember - stay alert, stay safe, look out for each other. We will get through this together.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They all clasped hands in a circle, “Let’s do this!” Billy called out and each person let out a cheer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m grateful to you all. You’re my family.” Rio added. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I never had kids of my own, but I see you all like my children.” Sharon almost broke them all with her confession. She was usually more of a quiet observer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I only come to work every day because of you freaks.” Alice shared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Y’all are alright.” Jen relented but everybody knew what she really meant. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This is our home. We have a duty to protect it. I love every one of you.” Agatha looked at them all with a smile but her gaze lingered exceptionally long on Rio. The two shared the look and their eyes said all the words they couldn’t speak aloud. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice left first to go monitor the door and the rest of the group went to their work stations. Herb and the security staff finished their briefing and positioned themselves around the hall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her heart beating in her chest. The first group started entering the club - a mix of young men with their dates. Nobody recognizable yet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The band started playing, and Agatha was grateful for the soothing melodies of Gladys’ voice.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey toots, get me a gin rickey.” A loudmouth called out to Rio, knocking annoyingly on the bartop. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched the grimace on Rio’s face and saw her holding back the biting response that was probably kicking to escape. Instead, she said nothing and made the drink quickly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“One gin rickey.” She slid the drink over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where’s the smile, dollface? You would look so pretty if you smiled.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hands curled into fists beneath the bar. Agatha wondered if she would draw blood from how tightly she was squeezing. She reached over and tried to get her to release the tension. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who’s next?” She called out and some other lad pushed to the front to get his order in. Billy took care of it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio knelt down to get another bottle and Agatha joined her down there. “Hey, it’s okay. Just breathe through it. Ignore these fools.” Rio nodded and gathered herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they stood up, Agatha spotted Wanda entering the club with Vision on her arm. The redhead turned heads in her knee-length fur trimmed coat. She passed it to her husband and revealed her light rose party dress beneath with a triple flounce tiered skirt. Her shimmering diamond necklace accented the dipping neckline. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The woman commanded attention and walked through the room like she owned it. The clicking of her heels was like a terrible countdown announcing her arrival to the bar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The place looks real spiffy, Mother. You did well.” She leaned against the counter and motioned about the space. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wanda, what can I get you?” Agatha replied, keeping it cordial. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want her to serve me.” She pointed to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes flicked to her lover who was looking back with hesitation. Before she could speak, Rio stepped up, “What would you like?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well that’s a broad question. There’s a lot that I would like.” Wanda stared at the young woman. Her eye contact was alluring. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To drink…” Rio prompted, shifting uncomfortably under the imposing gaze. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Surprise me.” Wanda ran her tongue slowly across her bottom lip. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turned around and tried to follow Agatha’s advice. She took a deep breath and centered herself again. She grabbed a shaker and mixed rum, pineapple juice, and grenadine. She set a cocktail glass in front of the redhead and watched the look of delight when the light pink drink flowed out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A Mary Pickford for you - to match your dress.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aren’t you thoughtful? Thanks dear.” She took the drink and sipped it slowly. “Ah, that’s the good stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Glad you like it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll certainly be back for more.” Wanda took the glass and took up residence at a nearby table where Vision was already holding court. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good work, you handled that well.” Billy nudged her, impressed at her cool demeanor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, she doesn’t seem </span>
  <em>
    <span>that </span>
  </em>
  <span>scary in person.” Rio confessed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s good at pretending.” Agatha said dryly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you see her eyes? I’ve never seen anyone else with green eyes like Tommy.” Billy had been captured by the color, which he had thought was unique to his twin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hadn’t noticed. I was too busy trying not to spill her drink.” Rio shrugged and went to serve the next needy customer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gladys was tearing it up on the piano and keeping the crowd busy. Her raunchy songs were laced with double-entendres, and the gang was eating it up. Her powerful voice rose above the drunken rowdiness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes, however, never left Wanda. She watched the woman, who in turn was watching her. The two were locked in a silent duel. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then someone threw a punch on the dance floor.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha waved to Herb and they both ran out to break it up. She helped him pull the attacker off the other guy, whose nose was now bleeding, and Herb pushed away the other instigators who had jumped in on the action. It seemed like more kept appearing out of nowhere though. She couldn’t even tell what they were fighting about. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get off!” She yelled as she finally yanked the last man off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pietro turned and smiled dangerously at her. She removed her hands like she had been burned. </span>
  <em>
    <span>No.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She twisted her neck violently to check the bar. Rio was nowhere to be seen. Her eyes tracked to the tables. Wanda was gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She went to move but Pietro’s arm shot out and grabbed her wrist. “Not so fast.” He declared. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off, you grey-headed prick.” Agatha pulled her arm to try to release his hold, but he wasn’t budging. She could feel his fingers pulling at her skin, digging in hard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She just wants to have a short chat. Let’s give them some privacy.” He moved them to a table, so it wasn’t so obvious that he was restraining her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If she lays a hand on Rio, I swear to god I’ll burn this place to the ground to get her.” Agatha protested and tried to signal any of her staff, but everyone was overwhelmed with other priorities.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy was pouring at least ten drinks at the same time, Darcy was mopping up a bunch of spilled glasses, Jen was nowhere to be seen, all the security guards were either escorting people out or keeping them from fighting again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pietro, let me go.” Agatha tugged again but his strength was keeping her in place. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No can do. Boss’ orders.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re going to regret this. I’ll scream.” She warned. The minutes were passing slowly, and she wished she could chew her arm off to get to Rio right now. The thought of Wanda alone in a room with her made her feel ill. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re outnumbered, and nobody is coming to save you down here in your own </span>
  <em>
    <span>illegal </span>
  </em>
  <span>establishment.” Pietro was lapping it up, enjoying the control - a sick smile shined at Agatha. “We’ve got you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Agatha had left to break up the fight, almost all the patrons had run to the dance floor to watch. They were like children, so eager to see violence. It left the bar empty so Rio had taken the short reprieve to run to the bathroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be right back Billy.” She had called before crossing the room to the facilities. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had been in one of the stalls when she heard the door open and then the lock click. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been waiting to get you alone, Rio.” The voice sent a shiver down her spine. She froze. “You can’t hide in there forever, sweetie.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She unlatched the stall and stepped out. Wanda was leaning back against the sink. “You really are beautiful, you know?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t know what to say to that, she just stayed silent and watched. She calculated the distance to the door but didn’t think she could make it in time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What has Agatha told you about me?” Wanda questioned.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio walked past her to the other sink and washed her hands. She watched the figure beside her out of the corner of her eye, “Not much. You head up the Sokovian gang. You’re married to Vision. You have expensive taste and a twin brother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s it? Damn, I thought I was much more memorable than that.” Wanda huffed. “Do you know why we’re here tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio dried her hands and turned to face her interrogator, “Agatha asked you to send a message to my ex and things went poorly. She owes you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Simply put, yes. But plenty of people owe me. I take a special interest in Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s the only worthy adversary I’ve ever met. There aren’t many women in positions of power in this city. It’s a bore. When Mother strolled in to ask for my help, I remembered what it was like to have fun again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s that got to do with me?” Rio couldn’t see where this was going. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you’re more akin to the worm on a fishing line.” Wanda reached down and lifted the hem of her dress. Rio’s eyes went wide. She watched her pull an impressive hunting knife from a hidden holster against her upper thigh.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio moved towards the door, trying to escape, but Wanda was faster. She threw her back against the door, trapping them both in the room. “Slow your roll, baby. We’re not done here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was running her finger along the blade - playing with the shining metal like it was a toy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please…I’m just - I’m nobody” Rio pleaded with the woman in front of her, but Wanda had a crazed look in her eye.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no. You’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>somebody</span>
  </em>
  <span> to Agatha. I see how she looks at you, how she fawns over you. Why does she get to be happy and I don’t…” Wanda stumbled for a second and remembered herself. “Hmmm, now where would you like a scar? Along your thigh? Across your ribs? Where will Agatha see it every time you make love? I want a lasting reminder for her to enjoy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio swallowed and felt it catch in her throat. Her pulse was pounding so hard in her neck, it felt like it was closing in around her. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Where is Agatha?</span>
  </em>
  <span> She stared at the blade in Wanda’s hands and felt the panic overtaking her brain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t have to do this.” She managed to stammer the plea. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know.” Wanda observed the other woman with a cold hard stare. “I </span>
  <em>
    <span>want </span>
  </em>
  <span>to do this.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She approached with the knife in front of her and was reaching out to grab Rio’s arm when they heard it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It sounded like a stampede coming down on top of them. A cacophony of yelling and commotion. Glasses smashing. The music stopping suddenly. Running bodies. Chairs hitting the floor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shouting. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Screaming. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then the unmistakable sound of gunfire.</span>
</p>

  <p>
  <span>“Officer Sullivan! Grab a firearm, we’re heading uptown.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix had been on the job for five months now with the NYPD. After getting home from the war, it had seemed like a logical fit. He liked the structure of the organization and the camaraderie of the team. He didn’t want to rot behind a desk for the rest of his life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>However, he hadn’t had to use his weapon and still had flashbacks from the trenches. His job so far had mostly consisted of walking the beat and learning how to file paperwork. His ears still  rang at night when he laid in bed and tried to sleep. His wife would try to soothe him with gentle caresses or by humming a tune, but the ringing never subsided. His dreams didn’t provide any relief either - the endless muck, the stench of rotting corpses, the never-ending shells raining from the sky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sullivan! Come on!” His detective was yelling now, and he snapped out of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Coming, sir.” He holstered his Colt revolver and threw his jacket and cap on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The chief looked out of his office window at his men scrambling in the precinct. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck, fuck, fuck. </span>
  </em>
  <span>“O’Rourke, get in here!” He called a passing officer into his office. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, chief?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t you hear? That new Attorney General was just in - he’s calling on us to raid every speakeasy we can find tonight. They are setting a new quota - they expect 2,000 arrests a week!” The officer exclaimed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God damn it. Where are you guys heading now?” The chief was worried. He had made many promises to various gin joint owners around the city and taken his fair share of bribes. They were the reason he had been able to drive a brand-new Lincoln Model L to work each day and afford an apartment in Manhattan. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Harlem area. AG Buckner said he got a tip off that a gang is hosting a big event tonight at one of the smaller clubs. Apparently it’s too big an opportunity to let slide, so we’re all going.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks officer.” He dismissed the young man. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh no...Lilia. </span>
  </em>
  <span>The chief had a soft spot for the old broad. She was one of the most generous of the club owners, but she also took the time to get to know him. She would send him beautifully written birthday cards and drop off the most delicious moonshine.   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He scrambled to think of a way to warn her. He didn’t have a phone number. He didn’t know her home address and surely she wouldn’t be at the pharmacy at this hour. He couldn’t outrun his unit at this point. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Damn it.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He just had to hope that they went quietly, without a fight. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix rode in the back of the wagon with six other rookies. It was his first raid. He normally worked the day shift and had only switched this week to try to earn some overtime. His first child was on the way. He had flashbacks to the frontlines and closed his eyes to try to come back to the present.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“First time, Sullivan?” One of the others saw Felix’s leg bouncing and his shut eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nodded and tried to calm his nerves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry. We do these almost every weekend. It’s really simple. We storm the place. People try to run. We grab as many as we can and arrest them. Take them to the station and throw them in a holding cell. The city makes a bunch of bail money, the politicians celebrate their empty win, we do it all again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rookies laughed at the simple explanation. Felix relaxed a bit and gave them a strained smile. They all felt the car slow down and stop abruptly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The doors opened and the team piled out. There were over 40 officers standing on the street, and the detective in charge cleared his throat. “Okay men, you know the drill by now. We normally aim for the staff since they are the ones technically breaking the law by selling the hard stuff, but tonight this whole place is infested with trouble boys. Grab whoever you can get, and we’ll be able to call it a win. Do not - I repeat, </span>
  <em>
    <span>do not </span>
  </em>
  <span>draw your weapon unless under fire. The last thing we want is a gunfight down there.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix followed the group as they entered a dark alley. It looked abandoned, but the detective approached a nondescript door and pounded on it. It was quiet for a while. Felix wondered whether they had the right location at all. Finally, after what felt like ages, the small window slid open and shut just as fast. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Open up, this is the NYPD!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Silence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have 10 seconds before we bust this door down!” The detective barked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They watched in anticipation, then the door slowly creaked open. There was nobody on the other side. The sound of music came flowing out like smoke, wrapping them all in its allure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“On me, let’s go.” The leader flung the door open the rest of the way, and the troop stormed the place, flying down the stairs in a sudden barrage. One of the officers kicked the main door down and the cops swarmed into the hall like ants. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“POLICE, freeze! Hands up!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop! You’re under arrest!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The patrons were already scrambling when they entered the club. The doorman must have given them a heads up because people were running for their lives. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix felt overwhelmed. There were men and women flying in every direction - he couldn’t focus on anyone fast enough to catch them. People were dropping their drinks and broken glass was all over the hardwood floor. He felt like his shoes were glued to the ground. The band on stage had stopped and now the cavernous space was echoing with chaos. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He closed his eyes to try to get a handle on himself. He tried to imagine the beach - playing in the waves at Coney Island, relaxing in the sun. The calmness of the salt air, the heat coming off the yellow sand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He opened his eyes in time to see a young man near the stage pull a gun from behind his back and aim it at the nearby officer arresting a young lady. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Felix didn’t say a word. He didn’t even consciously think anything. His hand flew to his revolver. All the months of basic training before he deployed came back to him in an instant, like it was part of his DNA. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He fired the shot. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And all hell broke loose. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Agatha saw the warning light near the door flash three times as she was still held hostage by Pietro.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We need to go. We need to go right now!” She desperately looked at the man holding her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re not going anywhere, babe.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No! We’re being raided. We need to get everyone out!” Agatha tried to convey the urgency. They had just seconds before the cops showed up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pietro looked at her with concern. Then Alice flew through the door, “Run! The cops are here!” She shouted with all her might. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone looked at each other for a moment, wondering if this was for real. But all of the staff immediately booked it. Herb and the security men ran for the nearest exit. Darcy bolted for the side entrance and was gone. Billy immediately went to grab Jen from the back room - he didn’t know if he could make it across to the bathroom to get Rio.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha yanked and pulled to free herself, but Pietro still wasn’t convinced and refused to let her go. “We’re going to get arrested, you fool!” She yelled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fuzz sped down the stairs in the record time and immediately started yelling and going after anyone and everyone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck, how do we get out of here?” Pietro pulled them to standing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me go and I’ll show you.” Agatha begged. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get on the ground! You’re under arrest!” They watched a cop slap some bracelets on a girl nearby. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We don’t have time, let me go!” Agatha saw Pietro considering it as his fellow gang members started to succumb to the overwhelming police presence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked over his shoulder and saw a young guy reaching into his pants waistband. “No!” She yelled out but it was too late. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first shot exploded in the room, and she immediately covered her ears. Pietro had released her when the sound surprised them both. She watched the blood start to pour out of the gangster and was hypnotized by the slow moving river of red, until more shots started going off all around her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pietro fired at the cop who shot the boy and other remaining gang members started pulling hidden weapons and throwing lead. The police returned fire, and the place became a battlefield. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha ran for the bar and grabbed the gun that Lilia had given her. It was heavier than she expected and the cool metal felt like ice in her palm. She watched Pietro retreat backstage and decided to follow. She wasn’t going to let him get away unscathed.  </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>At the first shot, Wanda reached out and snagged Rio by the back of her head. She gripped the raven locks with a firm grip and whispered in her ear, “You’re going to get us out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tried to think carefully. The main entrance was probably surrounded by cops - that’s a no go, despite being the closest and quickest escape. If they could cross the landing into the storage hall, there was a secret exit at the other end, but it was also obvious and the first place the cops would check. She ran through the exits in her mind. The best option was the one backstage in the first green room - it let you out almost a block away on the complete other side of the street.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know a way.” Rio muttered out. She could feel the tip of the knife at her back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go.” Wanda pushed her out of the bathroom door. Rio looked around and didn’t see anyone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pushed the potted palm in the corner of the room out of the way and opened the hidden door. It led to a secret hallway along one wall of the club. It was tight, so she ducked and Wanda followed her closely into the dark space. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How many exits are there in this place?” Wanda asked, genuinely curious. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“More than I can count. We’re nothing if not prepared.” Rio said. The hall was barely the width of a person. It was lit by thin cutouts in the brickwork that let light in from the main room. The two shuffled down quickly and could hear the commotion happening just a few feet away. It deposited them out backstage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The performers were rushing to grab their things and make a run for it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She squinted to try to make out the figure calling her name. It was incredibly dark with the curtains drawn. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy ran up to her, completely unaware of the threat behind her. She tried to give him a look but it was so difficult to see anything. “Hey kid, you need to scram!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I warned Jen then came back here to find Sharon. I didn’t know if anyone tipped her off. She is normally holed up in the green room.” He was too good for this world. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The teen opened up the dressing room that Rio had been going to, and he finally took in the woman holding Rio by her hair. “What the…” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room was empty, the false wall had been pushed open, likely by Sharon, and the exit hall was visible behind the racks of clothes. Wanda looked to the boy, “Who are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door banged open and Pietro jumped inside. His arm was bleeding and he was holding it delicately, breathing heavily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pietro! What happened?” Wanda’s attention turned to her brother. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fucking Johnny. He saw one of the coppers grab his doll and lost his head. That fucking idiot pulled out his gun in a room full of police. He was clipped before he could even pull the trigger. Everyone started shooting then, I got hit in the crossfire.” He grimaced and held the wound on his bicep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door opened again and Agatha slipped in - she locked it behind her then took in the wild scene in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Heard you guys were having a party.” She couldn’t help the sarcasm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice of you to join us, Mother.” Wanda spoke. “Pietro, grab the boy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her twin pushed through the pain and held Billy in a headlock with one arm. He reached into his jacket and pulled his trusty pocket knife out. He held it at his side as a warning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wanda, let them go. They don’t deserve this.” Agatha looked between Billy and Rio - they were both at the mercy of these sadistic twins. She remembered the gun in her hand and lifted it. She didn’t know where to aim. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Pick one.” Wanda smiled as she tugged on Rio’s hair, forcing her neck to tilt back. “Who gets to live - your lover or your teenage sidekick?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop this Wanda. We can all take the run-out, the exit is literally right there. Hurry before the cops make it back here.” Agatha watched the redhead carefully. She also listened for movement on the stage, knowing it couldn’t be long before the coppers continued their raid of the place.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <b>You</b>
  <span> don’t call the shots here! I’m in control! Nobody tells me what to do, not anymore.” Wanda yelled. Rio could feel her shaking behind her and worried about her erratic nature. One slip of the hand and that was that.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy started to cry. He tried to hold it in but the sobs escaped from him, and Agatha watched the tears running down his face. He was terrified. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Billy, dear. Look at me. You’re going to be alright.” Agatha tried to get him to calm down. She saw Pietro struggling to hold his grip. She saw the blood dying his shirt sleeve and his face contorting in pain. “You’re going to see Tommy again. Just hold on.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda dropped her knife. It clattered against the floor and drew everyone’s attention. Rio took the opportunity to twist out of her clutches and break free. She ran to Agatha and fell into her arms. The gun also dropped to the ground as Agatha wrapped Rio into a tight hug. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda was stark white, all the color had been drained from her face. She looked at Billy like he was both a celebrity and a phantom, like she was both star struck and absolutely terrified. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How old are you?” She stammered the words slowly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ummm, I’m almost 17.” Billy was looking at her with confusion. His eyes flicked between her and Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda collapsed on the floor. Her head in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You have to do this.” Vision said coldly as he placed one of the babies on the doorstep. “We can’t provide for them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Vis, please. They’re our boys.” Wanda cradled the sleeping baby in her arms. They were only a week old, but it was abundantly clear that it wasn’t going to work. Wanda and Vision were living in an abandoned warehouse in the Bronx with a dozen other Sokovian refugees. There was hardly enough food for the adults, let alone any children. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There was no running water, no heating. They burned whatever garbage they could find in attempts to stay warm through the brutal city winter. They didn’t have enough money to send for Pietro yet - she was all alone. Her parents were gone, her husband was always out working - “building an empire” he said, and so she was left with endless time by herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pregnancy had been a mistake. A night of passion gone too far, and then Wanda had begged to keep it. She had felt so lonely in this country since arriving, and this was the one thing she felt ownership over. The only thing that felt she could control. Vision had relented at first after seeing her excitement and had briefly considered the possibility, but reality came crashing down when it wasn’t just one baby that came out but two. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the first little boy was placed on her chest Wanda whispered out, “Tommy” like she was finally releasing her deepest secret into the world. When the second was cleaned and handed to Vision, he looked into the innocent crying eyes and said, “Billy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda had glanced up at him with a quizzical look at his name choice. He rocked gently and said, “After William Shakespeare - All the world’s a stage.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt like she might burst - it was like her heart had been pulled from her chest and split in two. It was glorious pain, uncomparable joy and sorrow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that was nothing compared to the feeling of placing her sons on the doorstep of the orphanage. It was agony, it was a live death. Saying goodbye to the life she hoped could be hers. Offering up her heart on a platter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Darling, they are hungry. We can’t…we can’t feed them. I wish it wasn’t so.” Vision tried to reason with her but there was no reason that would make this okay. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If we do this, I will hate you forever.” She spat the words out, knowing she didn’t really mean them. But not knowing any other way to convey this loss. She loved her husband, but it would be a lie to say she didn’t harbor an unending feeling of resentment for this decision. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It will get better with time.” Vision hardened his heart and stepped back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, boys.” Wanda placed one last kiss on both of their heads and left a note with the baby names and birth dates in Billy’s carrier. She wiped the tears from her eyes but nothing would stop them from falling for weeks, for months, for years. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She would replay that moment endlessly in her nightmares. She would agonize over the lives that they were living without her - were they happy? Did they miss her?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wanda? Wanda, what’s wrong?” Pietro’s voice brought her back to the present.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let him go.” She spoke flatly but the strength of the words caused her twin to release his hold on the teen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy rushed over to Agatha and hugged her with an outpouring of emotion like she was his shield, his sanctuary. The look on Wanda’s face was devastating. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door splintered open at that moment as a gaggle of police kicked it down with their guns drawn. “Freeze! Grab some air!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At that moment, everything seemed to happen in slow motion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pushed Billy as hard as she could towards the escape hall. “Get Lilia!” She shouted - her voice rough and desperate. He booked it at full speed before any of the cops could register what happened. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>An officer kicked Wanda from her kneeling position with more force than necessary and she hit the floor hard, causing Pietro to lunge for the gun that Agatha had dropped. Another cop saw the move and fired, hitting Pietro right in the chest. He took one final shuddering breath, and his eyes glazed over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda screamed with the full force of her lungs. She grabbed her hunting knife from the floor and threw it at the cop who had shot her brother. It spun in the air and connected with a sickening sound in its target. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It hit him in the guts and stuck, causing him to falter his next shot. Instead of drilling into Wanda, the bullet found a home in Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked down at her thigh and couldn’t reconcile the dripping wound with her expectation for what should be there. The pain hadn’t even registered in her brain yet. It was like she was looking down at someone else’s limb. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“NO!! Rio!” Agatha’s voice shattered out of her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She watched in shock as Rio faltered on her feet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She lunged to help lower her down and then ripped a skirt from the nearby clothes rack. She tied the fabric tightly around the thigh - it looked like the bullet had gone all the way through, there was blood coming out of both sides.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bunny, I need you to hold this tightly. Right there.” Agatha moved Rio’s hands to hold the fabric to her leg. “So good, just like that. You’re going to be fine, okay? You’re going to be just fine, sweetheart.” Her voice was trembling, her vision was blurring. There was so much blood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cops stared in shock before one spoke up, “Fuck Sullivan, what have you done?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another one sprung into action. “Let’s cuff these two. Thompson, call an ambulance! Fuck…nobody say a word. We were just defending ourselves. D’Angelo, help Sullivan with that knife. Let’s go!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda was mute, staring down at Pietro’s lifeless body. She didn’t resist arrest or make any acknowledgement that it was happening. She was escorted from the room without a sound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another officer grabbed Agatha and wrestled a pair of handcuffs on her. “Stop, she needs me! Let me go, you bastards!” Agatha was thrashing now, staring down at Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her lover was barely moving. The usual fire was gone. Her face was a beautiful statue - the shock freezing her features in look of disbelief. She was holding the makeshift tourniquet and looking at Agatha with fear in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha…don’t leave. Please, my love.” Her voice was shaking, barely audible, a quiet plea. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio!” She called out as the cop forced her to her feet and bumped her out of the room. She tried to twist and turn to get one last glimpse, but the cop was moving too fast. “Hold on, Rio!” She screamed and her voice broke. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shut up.” The cop muttered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off, filthy pig.” Agatha bit back, which earned her a swift jab at the back of her knees. She could only hope that Billy had made it out, that Lilia was coming, that someone had actually called an ambulance. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio, my precious Rio.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Her body caved under the stress and adrenaline. Her mind shut down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The last thing she remembered was being pushed out from behind the stage and seeing the bodies littered across the floor.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Agatha had collapsed in the club and been carried out by two cops. She awoke in the back of the paddywagon - her hands were still cuffed behind her back, and she was leaning against the cold metal wall. There were seven others stuffed in there with her. She saw Wanda immediately but didn’t recognize any of the others, who must be part of the gang.</p><p>She then remembered Rio. Rio with a bullet wound. Rio bleeding on the floor. Rio scared and begging her to stay.</p><p>She felt the tears falling before she could muster the energy to stop them. She wanted to bawl and scream simultaneously but not here. It was overwhelming and crushing. How could she keep going? How could she live in a world without this woman who had her in a chokehold?</p><p>The car stopped, and she heard the front doors slam. The back door flung open and a cop unceremoniously pulled the catch-of-the-day out one by one. She was shuffled into the station and dumped in a holding cell with Wanda and the two other women that had been picked up, while the men were taken elsewhere. They removed the bracelets from her wrists and slammed the metal gate. </p><p>“Hey! Hey! I need my phone call. Please.” She grabbed the bars and called out to nobody. There were at least 30 other gals in the cell, and from what she could hear across the hall, the men’s cell was overflowing. This was going to be a long night.</p><p>Agatha’s adrenaline was settling and the exhaustion was threatening to knock her out. She dropped onto the concrete bench next to Wanda. </p><p>“Nothing to say, red?” She looked at the woman beside her. Wanda was blank-faced, staring at the ground in a trance. She didn’t make a move that she heard or knew who was speaking. Agatha didn’t care enough to push it. </p><p>Hours dragged by. This place was woefully understaffed. The sun was already starting to rise by the time the processing team booked her. She considered a fake name, but unfortunately several of the officers had already clocked who she was. One of the downfalls of cultivating a reputation in this town. </p><p>“Harkness, one phone call.” </p><p>“Jesus, finally.” She sighed and pushed herself up. She dialed Lilia’s phone number and tapped her foot waiting. It rang and rang…nothing. <em> Fuckkkk.</em></p><p>She swallowed hard and grabbed the bridge of her nose. <em> Deep breath, it’s fine. Maybe she’s just…out or helping someone else or.. </em>. She rotated the dial and entered Jen’s number. </p><p>A few seconds passed. “Hello?” Jen’s voice came through the earpiece - the relief like a cold rain on a steaming hot day. </p><p>“Jen! What’s happening?? Is Rio okay? Did everyone make it out alright?” She rambled the words out in a torrent. </p><p>“Whoa, whoa. Where are you?” </p><p>“I’m at the police station - they pinched me. Have you seen Rio?”</p><p>“No, I got out as soon as Billy warned me, and I ran home. I haven’t been back yet. I don’t know what happened.”</p><p><em> Damn it. </em>“I’m glad you made it. Can you check in with the rest of the crew? I don’t think I’m getting out of here today.”</p><p>“Of course. I’ll tell them you’ve been locked up. Stay safe in there.” Jen knew Agatha could handle herself in any situation, but jail was a whole different beast. </p><p>“Thanks, Jen.” She hung up and the worry within her was only growing. <em> Where was Rio? Lilia? Billy?  </em></p><p>Agatha went back to the cell dejected. She watched the other young women from the club slowly empty out as their loved ones showed up with the $25 bail money and a range of disapproving looks on their faces. </p><p>“Hey, what’s my bail?” She jumped up to the door when the officer came to let out another low life. </p><p>“Harkness, ha! You wish. The big boss isn’t setting bail for you or your pretty friend over there. The pressure from the top brass is too great.” The young man smirked. </p><p>“What the fuck? You can’t do that! I want a lawyer!” She shook the gate angrily to the sound of his laughter. “Where’s my lawyer?!”</p><hr /><p>“Rio, honey. Are you there?” </p><p>The soft resonant sound entered her mind. It was like stepping through the thickest fog. She felt hazy and disoriented. She blinked slowly and winced at the lights. </p><p>“Where am I…what’s going on?” Her voice sounded foreign like it belonged to a stranger. </p><p>“Sweets, you’re in the hospital.” Lilia rubbed Rio’s hand gently and leaned against the hospital bed. </p><p>“What happened? Where’s Agatha?” She looked around, her neck felt stiff. There was nobody else in the small white room.</p><p>“You got shot by a fucking trigger-happy cop.” Lilia broke the news. “Alice is on another floor. She got trampled in the mad panic when she came down to warn everyone. She fell and landed on a mess of broken glass. They were able to stabilize her. Do you remember…”</p><p>Rio looked down and threw the warm blanket back. There was a stiff bandage wrapped around her thigh. She tried to lift it and bit her tongue to hold back the shout. She held her breath and collapsed backwards on the pillows. </p><p>She tried to push her mind back in time. </p><p>The biting burn in her leg like someone had slammed an ice pick into her thigh. It was so sudden and unexpected that her brain couldn’t even process the sensation. One second she was watching the life leave Pietro’s eyes and the next she was staring at the spread of red down her stockings.</p><p>The expression on Agatha’s face as if the world was crashing down around them. The flurried panic and painful exasperation. Her name being shouted again and again. </p><p>The rush of blue uniforms lifting and carrying her love away. Someone telling her that help was on the way. </p><p>Being trapped in the room with that silver-haired corpse. The smell of blood overwhelming her nostrils. Her consciousness drifted in and out as she tried to stay awake. </p><p>Billy appearing out of nowhere with Lilia in tow. Being lifted and carried like a child. </p><p>Hearing someone whisper, “You’re going to make it. Hold on for Agatha. She needs you.”</p><p>She opened her eyes again and looked at Lilia, “Is Agatha alright?”</p><p>The older woman looked at her with love in her eyes, “I haven’t heard from her. She was hauled out and taken. I was going to go down to the station but wanted to make sure you didn’t wake up alone.”</p><p>“She could have escaped. She saved Billy…why didn’t she run?” Rio stared down at her hands. </p><p>“Do you really have to ask?” Lilia had a look on her face. “You were hurt. You were in pain. They would have had to drag her out screaming to get her away from you.”</p><p>Rio felt warmth climbing her neck and cheeks. “When you see her…can you tell her thank you?”</p><p>“Of course. I’ll head over now. Are you okay here?” </p><p>“Yeah, I’ll be fine. Go, she is probably worrying herself sick.” Rio squeezed Lilia’s hand and gave her a small wave goodbye as she left. </p><p>A nurse came into the room with a tray of food for breakfast. “How are you feeling, dearie?” She was a short woman with a pleasant heart-shaped face. She adjusted the pillows so Rio was sitting up. </p><p>Rio attacked the scrambled eggs with the fork. She felt famished, “I feel groggy but mostly okay. Trying to move my left leg was a mistake.”</p><p>The nurse nodded, “It may feel like that for a while unfortunately. The doctor cleaned and sewed up the wound, but it will take time for the muscles to heal. You’re very fortunate that the bullet passed through. I treated many men overseas who weren’t as lucky. I’ll grab some morphine, which should help you rest.”</p><p>“Thanks, ma’am.” Rio continued eating her meal while the nurse ducked out. She rolled a metal cart back in with her. </p><p>“I’ve just got to give you an anti-tetanus shot - standard practice these days.” </p><p>“Go ahead.” Rio presented her arm and took the injection- the pain barely more than a pinch.</p><p>“Here’s your pain medicine, rest up.” Rio finished her meal then took the tablets. She thought of Agatha to calm her racing thoughts - her piercing blue eyes, the timbre of her voice, the feel of her smooth fingers running through her hair, the scent of her skin. It wasn’t long before she surrendered to the drug-induced sleep.  </p><hr /><p>Lilia hurriedly walked to the neighborhood police station where they typically held the folks rounded up in raids. </p><p>She was running on less than two hours sleep since it had been near midnight when Billy showed up at her door.</p><p>He had arrived huffing and puffing, saying the club had been raided and Agatha needed her. She threw on the nearest dress, grabbed a coat, and sped over to the speakeasy - grateful for the close proximity.  </p><p>Billy pulled her to the secret entrance behind the apartment building on the opposing corner. When she saw Rio lying there on the green room floor, her heart stopped. She looked so pale, and there was so much blood. She glanced at Pietro, already well and truly gone and knelt down to close his unseeing eyes. She saw her gun laying slack in his open hand and pocketed it. </p><p>“Take her down to Sydenham Hospital. Can you carry her?” She looked at the young man, who was nervously shifting on his feet, trying to avoid looking at the dead body. </p><p>“Yes, I can do it.” He lifted Rio with surprising ease. She whimpered at the change in position but held on tightly to Billy, who rushed out the exit.</p><p>“Be careful! I’ll be there as soon as I can.” </p><p>Lilia eased out of the room to assess the damage. Backstage was empty, there were costumes, instruments, and trash littering the area as people had obviously scrambled to get out of there. </p><p>She stepped from behind the curtain and saw several physicians and nurses attending to fallen or injured police officers and any gang members still living. The place was a disaster zone - tables thrown to act as barriers, glasses smashed all over the floor, bodies slumped in awkward positions in booths or across the ground. </p><p>She walked down the steps and tried to avoid eye contact with the lost souls in her pathway. Mostly young men from the gang from the looks of things. Such a sad ending to a short life. </p><p>Officers were carried off in stretchers, groaning and clutching their injuries, and the eerie silence that remained was suffocating. </p><p>She hurriedly cashed out the till and collected the tips before any wiseguys got the bright idea to rob them. She checked the storage hall and back room - empty. She locked the doors to protect whatever liquor was left. She sat on one of the barstools that was still standing and poured a shot of vodka. </p><p>The liquid was a welcome intrusion and would hopefully soften the edges of this nightmare. She knew it had been a mistake to dance with the devil, but she hadn’t expected it would ever end this tragically.  </p><p>When she finally arrived at the prison, she spoke to the officer at the desk, “I’m here to see Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>The man looked through the notebook in front of him, “She can’t have any visitors.”</p><p>“Excuse me? Why not?” </p><p>“Ummm…it just says here - she is not to see anyone.” The officer couldn’t be older than 20. He was out of his depth. </p><p>“Where’s the chief?” Lilia didn’t have time to faff around. </p><p>“You can’t…just…ummm…the chief isn’t…” He was tripping over his words and starting to sweat under the filthy glare coming from this woman. </p><p>“Tell him Lilia is here to see him.” The boy didn’t move. “That will be all.” </p><p>He nervously rose and scurried to the back. He came back trailing behind Chief Jones, looking sheepish. </p><p>“Lilia, this way.” He gestured for her to follow. They entered his meticulously organized office. </p><p>“Chief, do you want to explain what the <b>hell </b>happened last night? I thought we had an agreement.” She took a seat and crossed her legs. </p><p>He took a stack of bills out of his drawer and passed them over his mahogany desk. “Here, take it back. I’m sorry. I only found out as they were gearing up to leave. The new attorney general is on the warpath, I couldn’t call it off. It wasn’t supposed to go down like that.” </p><p>Lilia stashed the cash in her purse, “Two of my staff are in the hospital, Agatha is behind bars, and the club is a graveyard of gang members and cops. Who knows when we’ll be able to re-open?”</p><p>“I’m really sorry, Lilia. I promise that wasn’t the intention. What can I do? How can I help?” </p><p>“For starters, you could let me speak to Agatha. I’ll be in contact when I think of anything else.” She stood without prompting. </p><p>“I can give you five minutes before people start asking questions.” He grabbed his keyring from a hook on the wall.</p><p>“That’s enough.” </p><p>He led them to an interrogation room and sat her down. A minute passed and Agatha was placed across from her. Lilia could see the immediate look of relief on her face. The chief closed the door behind him. </p><p>Agatha sprung up and hugged Lilia tightly. “Is Rio alive?” Her voice was quaking with fear. </p><p>“Yes, my dear. She’s okay.” Agatha crumbled in Lilia’s arms. Her body shook with all the sobs that she had accumulated and held at bay for hours. They were reaping their vengeance now. </p><p>“Shhhh. It’s alright. She just woke up in the hospital. The doctor treated her leg and said she will have to stay for a week to monitor for infection. She seems okay - she was asking for you.” Lilia ran her fingers in circles on Agatha’s back, trying to soothe the crippling waves of sadness. </p><p>It took a moment for Agatha to get her breathing under control, “They said I can’t pay bail. I’m stuck here.” Her lungs gasped for air as the realization overtook her. </p><p>“Let me see what I can do.”</p><p>“How is everyone else? I know Jen made it - I’m assuming Billy fetched you like I asked?”</p><p>“Yup, the boy did good. He’s just fine. I saw Alice in the hospital. It was touch and go for a second there. She had cuts all across her arms and a large piece of glass lodged near her ribs. The doctor said it was a miracle it didn’t hit her lungs. She’s going to be down for the count for a while though. Billy said Darcy made it home, and that he saw Herb and Sharon as he was running to my place.”</p><p>“What are we going to do now? How do we move forward?” The thought had been nagging Agatha, and she only had time to think while sitting in the cold jail cell. </p><p>“Let’s just take it one step at a time. Let me try to get you out of this joint first.” </p><p>Agatha nodded then suddenly remembered, “Can you check in on my place and feed Ebony? I don’t know when I’m getting out of here.”</p><p>“No problem, I still have your spare key. I’ll take care of everything.”</p><p>They heard a knock on the door and an officer forced Agatha out. The chief came to sit where she had just been. </p><p>“How long are you going to hold her?” Lilia looked to the man for answers. </p><p>“My hands are tied. Her name is too well known, they want to make an example of her. Maximoff is the same. These two are too infamous to let slide.”</p><p>“Come on, there are thousands upon thousands of speakeasies in this godforsaken town. We’re peanuts compared to the big dogs out there. I’ll pay - whatever it takes. Slap her with a fine, we can cover it.” </p><p>“I wish it were so simple. That might help, but she’s going to do time. She has to. I’ll see if I can get them down to a few weeks rather than months or a year. Would she agree to take a plea bargain?” The chief removed his hat and ran his fingers through his short white hair.</p><p>“What’s the charge?”</p><p>“Conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act and operating an illegal business.”</p><p>“Oh eat my ass, chief! That carries a $10,000 fine! It could be 5 years in prison, are you kidding?” Lilia raised her voice.</p><p>“No, they wouldn’t let a woman go away for that long. The pollies are just looking for a win. I think I could negotiate three weeks and maybe a thousand bucks. She may have to do some community service but that’s it. It’s the best I can offer.”</p><p>“Fool me once…” Lilia gave him a look that would strike fear into anyone. </p><p>He extended his hand across the table, and she shook it with hesitation, “You’re good people, Lil. I’ll talk to the judge and the prosecutor. I may be an old man, but my name still carries some weight around these parts.”</p><p>The chief was a man of his word this time. Agatha pled guilty and was sentenced to just three weeks on Welfare Island and a fine of $500. It was hardly a slap on the wrist, and she was beyond grateful, considering the alternative. </p><p>Wanda was less lucky. She went to trial and even with the gang money funding her high-powered lawyer, it wasn’t enough to save her from a sneaky tax evasion and racketeering charge that carried a 2 year sentence. </p><p>They travelled together on the boat to the women’s prison, which was located on the thin strip of land in the middle of the East River. It was formerly known as Blackwell’s Penitentiary but recently renamed to Welfare Island to try to kick the poor reputation. The castle-like building was four stories and had over 800 cells, yet somehow, as a cruel twist of fate, they ended up in cells next to each other. </p><p>Agatha changed into the drab grey dress uniform. <em> Ugh these stockings are going to itch like hell </em>. She tried to adjust the horrific cheap fabric but it was a losing battle. It was a far cry from the normal silk ones she normally bought. She could also already feel the blisters forming at the back of her heels from the stiff excuses for shoes they doled out. The flats were already worn down and clearly molded to the shape of some other poor sod’s feet. </p><p>She got acquainted with her new living space - she could touch both side walls with her arms outstretched. There was a plank bed attached to the wall, with a shelf above it and a single bible. One foldable chair in the corner and a tiny window for light and ventilation. It was beyond bleak. She missed her apartment, her stuff, her life. </p><p>Wanda had yet to say a word to Agatha or anyone for that matter. She was a husk of her former self. She saw her in the dining hall, during the morning and nightly checks by the guards, and out on the yard for work, but the redhead ignored her completely. The soul behind her eyes was gone. Agatha would feel sorry for her if she didn’t resent the mobster for this entire debacle. </p><p>It was their third night in the Big House. She had gotten used to the wails and non-stop noise that echoed through the concrete halls. They were on the ground floor and could hear the constant commotion above them. Agatha was laying on her bunk when she heard the familiar sound of her next door neighbor, “What is he like?”</p><p>She wasn’t sure at first if she imagined it or if it was really addressed to her. The voices were generally hard to distinguish, but this was a voice she knew. “Sorry?”</p><p>“Billy - what’s he like?” Wanda was sitting in her cell, leaning against the wall that they shared. </p><p>Agatha sat up and moved near the bars. She contemplated not saying anything, but it was obvious that this question had been eating at her neighbor. She decided to rise above the games, “He is hilarious. He’s got more energy than he knows what to do with. He is incredibly hard-working - I usually have to beg him to take a day off. He loves movies and takes Tommy to the cinema every weekend. They are best friends. He is sarcastic and can give as much as he gets. He’s so so kind.”</p><p>She could hear the soft cries and whimpering sniffles but kept going, “Billy is…resilient. He never lets a challenge get him down, and he’s been through a lot already. He wants to go to New York University and saves everything he earns. He can read people and get an immediate sense of them, almost like he can infiltrate their mind. He is nosy and loves gossip but never uses it for personal gain. He looks more beautiful in a dress than most women I know. He sets his mind to things and never gives up.”</p><p>Wanda was a leaky tap now. The tears were a salve on her soul. Hearing about this boy, no - her Billy, was like a bandage on her broken heart.</p><p>“He can annoy the living hell out of me sometimes, but I love him. I love the kid. I’m so grateful to know him. He brings endless enjoyment to my life.” Agatha wiped the tears from her eyes at the confession. She had never vocalized her appreciation for the teen but saying it now was as healing for her as it seemed to be for the broken woman on the other side of the wall.</p><p>“Thank you. Thanks, Agatha. I see why they call you Mother now. You really do have a maternal side.” Wanda held her knees against her chest and felt the tears running down her legs. </p><p>Agatha let the compliment wash over her. It wasn’t the origin of her name, but it felt nice regardless.  “I’m sure he would like to meet you properly, Wanda. He doesn’t know that you’re his...I mean, he doesn’t know who you are.”</p><p>“I don’t want him to be embarrassed or ashamed of me. His father and I aren’t exactly the best role models. And now I’m going to spend the next two years in prison - not really Mother of the Year material.” She sounded weary and drained. </p><p>“He’s not like that. He’s the least judgemental kid I’ve ever met. He can see the good in everyone. You don’t have to decide now, but I can tell him if you want. He can come visit you.”</p><p>There was a long pause. Agatha wasn’t sure if Wanda was icing her out again. “I’ll think about it.” She finally spoke. “Goodnight Agatha. Thank you.”</p>

    <span>Dear Agatha,</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>I think about you every day. It’s beyond boring in the hospital - there is absolutely nothing to do. I’ve started making up songs in my head because there is nothing else to keep my mind occupied. All I can hear is your voice calling my name as the cops hauled you away. It echoes in my mind - it’s so quiet here. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>I miss you desperately. I wish you were here now. I’m never bored when you’re around. I hope prison isn’t as bad as they say. I told the nurse that you were at Welfare Island and she looked scared. They say it’s awful and that the treatment is horrific - is that true? I can’t stand it if it is. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>I have to stay at the hospital for just a few more days. My leg is healing well, but I can still barely stand. What if I can’t dance again? What if I never walk properly? They have given me crutches, and I’ve been practicing but it hurts my arms. I don’t know how I’m going to get around. I wish you were here to help. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Lilia said you were getting out in two weeks. I’ll try to be there at the gates when you are finally a free woman again. I will be thinking of nothing else except having you in my arms again. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>I have a lot to say in person that I don’t want to put in a letter. Think of me, mi reina. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Love, </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Rio</span>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <span>Dearest Rio, </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>You have robbed me of my mystery. I am yours eternally now. I cannot imagine any universe, any life, any existence where I am not tied to you inextricably. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>I won’t sugar coat it - prison is as awful as they say. I am counting down the minutes until I am free from these shackles and in your arms again. It is miserable living here. I am starving for regular food, for some devil’s candy, for your touch. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Wanda is here with me. She is in the cell next to mine. She has been cordial and asks me about Billy. If you haven’t already guessed, she is his birth mother. I’m going to break the news to him when I’m out, please don’t say anything unless he’s already deduced it. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>I can’t wait to see you. I will carry you anywhere you need to go if you still can’t walk properly. I’ll happily get on my hands and knees for you. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>No, not like that…unless you also want that…either can be arranged. This time here has made me appreciate every aspect of my life tenfold. I wanted to wait to say this to your face, but I am compelled to write it out now - I love you. I am so overwhelmingly in love with you. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Yours eternally,</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Agatha</span>
  </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p><span>Rio held onto the letter with both hands. She read and re-read Agatha’s declaration like it was the only sentence in existence.</span> <span>I love you. I love you.</span><em><span> She loves me.</span></em><span> It was the truth laid bare, and she couldn’t be happier. She regretted holding it back in her letter now.   </span></p><p>
  <span>She was on the couch in Lilia’s apartment, laying back with her bad leg up on the cushions, trying to keep it raised. She got discharged from the hospital yesterday morning and was told to return in a week to get the bandages changed and have a doctor examine the wound. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia helped her hobble home on her wooden crutches and cooked her spaghetti and meatballs to fill her up. It made her think of Agatha - her heart ached. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How’s the club looking?” She asked Lilia in between bites. The crew had been spending their nights cleaning up the joint after the disastrous event last week. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Better than it did that’s for sure. We’re going to have to replace most of the furniture in the dance hall. I don’t know how they managed to smash every chair that we owned but there ya go. The flooring is gonna need to go too, the blood just won’t come out. Luckily we put aside money for repairs and maintenance.” Lilia explained. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Won’t the cops just show up again?” The thought made a shiver run down Rio’s spine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Usually once they hit up a place, they leave it alone for a while. Since Agatha took the fall, I think they’ll cool their heels for some time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is Alice out yet?” She hadn’t been able to visit her when they were in the hospital together. The staff preferred the patients stay separate to avoid spreading any unnecessary illness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not quite yet. She has to stay another week or two - her injury is very sensitive and they said it is at high risk of re-opening. It needs more time to heal.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I come with you today?” Rio missed everyone and wanted to help however possible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure? Didn’t the doctors say you should be resting?” Lilia raised an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please, Lilia. I’m losing it cooped up in here. I won’t overdo it, I just want to see the crew.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you hurt yourself more…” She warned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t, I promise!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha will have my head if you do.” Lilia said and then, “We’re leaving in half an hour.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio beamed and slowly walked to her bedroom to put on some decent clothes to leave the house. She was able to get around on her crutches alright, but it was definitely slow going. She was starting to be able to put some weight on her leg, but it still felt incredibly weak. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ready?” Lilia peeked in and Rio nodded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They walked the short distance to the club. Lilia was as patient as ever with Rio’s pace. She had been a godsend since Rio had gotten out of the hospital - helping her get in and out of the bath, cooking her delicious meals, changing her bandages, getting her prescriptions. Rio couldn’t be more grateful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The stairs down into the basement proved a tricky challenge. Lilia held onto Rio’s crutches and offered her other arm as they carefully stepped their way down to the club. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio!!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy rushed over and threw his arms around her, almost knocking them both to the ground. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whoa! Careful kid, I’m not as steady as I used to be.” She held onto him for balance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, sorry, sorry. I didn’t think you would be here today! How are you? You look great. How’s your leg? When will you be back at work? I miss you!” All of his thoughts spilled out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed. He hadn’t changed one bit, “I’m okay. I probably won’t be back for a few more weeks yet. It’s still too painful to stand for long periods, but the doctor said it will keep getting better every day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow, I’ve never met anyone who has been shot before. What was it like?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen approached them, “Morbid much? I doubt she wants to discuss that, teen!” She hugged Rio tightly, “Glad to see you on your feet.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey Jen, it’s so good to see you too.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s up, rookie?” Darcy called up from behind the bar, she was stacking the new glassware. Rio waved back with a smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This place doesn’t look half bad, ya know? You’ve made a lot of progress.” Rio looked around the club. The team had cleared out all the wreckage, so it was mostly just an empty room now but at least it was clean. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re pulling the booths out today. Most of them are riddled with bullet holes or stained with blood so…” Billy shrugged with a hammer in one hand and a crowbar in the other. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can count up the remaining supply of booze, Rio.” Lilia suggested, knowing that task could be completed without much physical labor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, happy to help wherever.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She walked to the storage hall to take inventory. Luckily there was already a clipboard on one of the stacks of boxes. She counted each crate and noted the liquor type and amount on the sheet. After about 30 minutes or so, Billy appeared in the dim hall with her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Everything alright?” He asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, all good. How are you?” She could sense he wanted to ask her something but wanted to give him the space to start. He leaned against the brick wall, and there was a long pause. She had never seen him be silent for so long. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He took a deep intake of air, “Why did Wanda let me go? They could have…you know…it could have been me. Is she my…my mother?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hesitated for a moment. She knew that Agatha wanted to be the one to break this news, but the look on Billy’s face was too deep to ignore. “Yeah, I think so. But that doesn’t change anything about you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s…not a good person.” He spoke slowly. “But, she let me go?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“People are complicated. It’s not always like the movies where there is a hero and a villian. I don’t think she knew who you were until Agatha said Tommy’s name.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why did she abandon us?” Billy spoke but the voice that came out sounded like his five-year-old self. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t answer that, kid. I’m sure it wasn’t an easy decision though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy stared at the ground, “What does she want from me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know. Agatha told me that they are neighbors in the pen, if you can believe it. I’m sure she will be able to speak to this more once she’s out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy let out a cathartic laugh, “Two of my mothers in jail! I can’t imagine what they’re talking about. When is Agatha walking free?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“13 days, 18 hours and…” She looked at her watch. “23 minutes”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not like you’re counting or anything?” He leaned off the wall and turned to head back to the main room. “I’m glad you’re okay, Rio. I was really scared.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Billy. Really - thank you so much. I don’t know if I would be standing here if you hadn’t saved me and carried me to the hospital. I owe you my life.” She couldn’t reach him to give him the hug she desperately wanted to, but she hoped her words conveyed the feeling. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know you would have done the same for me.” He seemed shy suddenly and gave her a look, which seemed to say the words he couldn’t, then he was gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio finished her counting job and rocked back out on her crutches. She sat down on the sole remaining bar stool as her leg was cramping up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Want me to take you back, Rio?” Lilia dropped the broom she was holding and came over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just need to rest for a sec. I can walk back if you help me up the stairs.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come get me when you’re ready.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio decided to walk around the block instead of directly back to the apartment. The doctor had encouraged her to stretch her legs whenever possible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was late May, in that perfect incomparable moment between spring and summer when the weather gods decide to really show off. The city was lit by brilliant warm sunshine which bounced and reflected off the endless windows and growing skyscrapers. A cool breeze swept through the air offering sweet relief and the cloudless blue sky enveloped everything in its expanse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She made it about halfway around the block before needing a rest. She lowered herself on a bench and took part in some innocent people watching. The city was bustling on this beautiful day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A voice called out and approached. She looked left and saw Claudia making her way over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mi amiga! Qué tal? What happened?” She sat down beside her and looked at the crutches with worry.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was surprised at the appearance of her old friend. She hadn’t seen her since she had visited their old place and heard about the attack on Tony. Things had been so busy at the club that she hadn’t had a chance to reconnect. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Claudia! Te extraño mucho. I really miss you, and I’m sorry I haven’t called.” She reached out and held her former roommate’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No es nada. I know you’ve got a lot going on. Now what happened? Are you hurt? It wasn’t…Tony was it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, no thank god. I haven’t heard from that pendejo since he was run out of town. It’s sorta related though. Those gangsters that attacked you were at the club when the cops raided the joint. I was working and things got crazy. They started pumping metal and lots of people got hurt. One of the cops accidentally shot me, and it went right through my leg. I’m just lucky it wasn’t worse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Claudia looked at her friend in shock. It was difficult to process. “Wow, no kidding. I’m glad you’re alright - how frightening!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, enough about me. How are you? How’s Miguel?” Rio tried to shift the conversation. She didn’t want to dwell on her injury.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bien, we’re doing well. He just got promoted to foreman at the factory, so we’re planning to move to a new apartment. I can’t stand living in the old place anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s amazing! You’ll have to invite me over for dinner some time. I miss your mofongo - I’ve been craving that dish since I moved out. It transports me straight back home.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No problem, I’ll send word via the pharmacy?” She asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Perfect, I look forward to it. I’m so glad you spotted me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are the chances? I’m on the way to an appointment so have to run, but I’m sure we’ll see each other again soon. Hasta luego!” Claudia kissed Rio on the cheek tenderly and left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio sat with her feelings for a while, reflecting on her past life. She arrived to this country alone, and there was a story in her mind for what her future held. Marriage to her teenage sweetheart, a life at home raising children, a quiet existence of service. It was the expected plan. There just weren’t many alternatives for women like her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ever since meeting Agatha she was so happy to watch that fiction burn. Life could be exhilarating, seductive, scary, dangerous, and fun. The lows were low but the highs were so much higher.  </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>It was her final Monday in the pen. Agatha was set to be released on Friday - just one final week to endure. She understood now why people called this place Farewell Island because once people got here, they never came back the same. You said ‘farewell’ to the person you once knew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The place was overcrowded, filthy, and in a state of disrepair. She had grown used to the sound of scurrying rats along the floor, but she would never be able to handle the occasional maggot in the slop they called food. It was prison, sure, but the conditions felt inhumane. Nobody deserved to live like this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a seat in the yard. They usually had an hour in the afternoon to get fresh air - a welcome break from the suffocating concrete walls and scent of damp that wafted through the halls despite the windows. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Four other dames came to sit with her. It didn’t matter where she went, Agatha attracted women like a moth to a flame. She had only been in here for two weeks and already had a crew of adoring followers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda sat down gently next to her, and Agatha waved her fans away.  A few minutes passed in silence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally Agatha broke the tension,  “Are you gonna say something, tiger, or are you just gonna to keep stealing my precious air?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda let out a strained laugh, “You have quite the way with words, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve been told. Now what’s eating you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you...tell Billy about me? No need to paint a pretty picture or lie to protect me, I just…I want him to know who I am.” The words felt charged as they left her lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked over and took in the broken woman beside her, “Yeah. What do you want him to know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda paused, “I’d be happy to meet him…if that’s something he wants. If it isn’t, I understand too. I have thought about him and his brother every single day since they were born.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll give him the choice - I’m sure he’ll do what he thinks is right.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you. Can I ask - why are you agreeing to help me? I have been awful to you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure, that’s true, and to be honest, this isn’t about you at all. Billy is important to me, and I will do anything for that kid…even doing a favor for his callous mother.” Agatha said. “After this, Wanda, we’re done. You let me go. I don’t want to see your face again.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wanda looked at her and nodded, “I get it. We’re done.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha pushed up off the bench and was walking away when she heard, “Wait.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She turned and Wanda spoke, “Can you look out for him? For Billy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I always have.” Agatha confessed and walked away from the redhead for the last time. “I always will.”</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>On Friday, Rio put on a freshly ironed jersey frock and grabbed her crutches as they walked out the door. Lilia was going to drive them to the ferry wharf at East 34th Street to pick up Agatha. The day had finally arrived. She was excited but also felt nagging anxiety. What if it wasn’t the same? What if something had changed between them?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the drive over, Lilia asked, “What’s wrong?” She could tell that something was off with her passenger. She was staring blankly out the window. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm? Oh, just…I hope Agatha still…I mean, I hope she still feels the same way about me. When I’m like…this.” She motioned down at her injured leg. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I honestly think you could lose all your limbs, and Agatha wouldn’t care. She loves you for who you are, not just how you look.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, I know. I can’t stop my mind from going there sometimes though. What if I can’t work again? I can barely stand for more than thirty minutes…” Rio knew it shouldn’t matter. Their relationship started and blossomed at work, she worried about what it would mean if that was taken out of the equation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your leg is healing every day. I’m sure in a few more weeks that you’ll graduate from the crutches and maybe just need a cane and then perhaps nothing at all. It will take time, and knowing Agatha, she is very patient when it comes to anything related to her favorite topic - you.” Lilia was surprised that Rio was worried, but she knew her fears were unfounded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a short trip and they arrived at the pier about 15 minutes before the prisoner transport boat was due to arrive. They parked and decided to get out and wait by the dock. Rio watched the ferry slowly creep across the river. Her heart was starting to beat faster as the anticipation grew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The boat pulled up and the crewman secured it. She watched as the passengers stepped off, scanning each one carefully, waiting for the familiar shock of wild brown hair to appear. At least ten other women disembarked before she saw her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was the only one still wearing a striped prisoner dress, her hair was down and looked more akin to a rat’s nest than her normal polished do, she was make-up free, and despite all this, she still looked like a Hollywood starlet to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she stepped on shore, Rio watched her take a dramatic inhale and blow out a breath like she was exorcising a painful memory. She opened her eyes and made eye contact with Rio. The smile that spread across her face was contagious. Rio wished she could run in that moment, that she could dash over and leap into her love’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead, it was Agatha who threw caution to the wind and jogged the distance to reach Rio. She dropped her small bag of belongings and threw her arms wide. Rio let her crutches fall with a clatter to the concrete. They collided in a searing embrace as if they could somehow absorb each other, as if this was their first touch in centuries, as if this singular moment could make up for every second apart. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha held Rio up in her arms - taking her full weight and allowing the younger woman to give herself over completely. Rio feasted on the scent that had haunted her memories and tried to memorize the tinges of its complexity. Even through the barrage of cheap prison soap and freshly laundered clothing, she could make out the distinct smell of her lover.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She ran her hands along Agatha’s back and traced the ridges of her spine. She felt like a ship at sea and Agatha was the anchor holding her still - stable and steady in a dangerous world. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I missed you.” Agatha’s voice was a siren’s call, beckoning her down to the deep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you.” She spoke the three words that had been queued on her lips for weeks now. It wasn’t relief that she felt upon speaking them. It was a declaration, a line in the sand that she had finally flung herself over. It was a promise. It was her future. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you too.” Agatha had never meant the phrase more than she did now, saying it to this woman, her Rio. She had never said it to her mother and only said it out of obligation to her late husband. But now, it was as easy as reciting the alphabet. There was nothing holding them back anymore. This was it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio buried her head in the crook of Agatha’s neck. It wasn’t safe to kiss here in the open, but she placed a gentle peck on the delicate skin that was so readily available. She heard Agatha let out a soft moan and pull her closer. Their bodies were flush like two books on a shelf. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia who was standing nearby finally let out a small cough, and they separated reluctantly. Agatha kneeled and picked up the crutches that lay at their feet. She carefully placed them in Rio’s arms, then went over to hug her oldest friend. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wait…what the hell are you wearing?” Rio suddenly registered Agatha’s full appearance and descended into a fit of giggles.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, somebody at the prison nicked the outfit I was wearing when I was arrested. Clearly they aren’t used to seeing a prisoner get booked in a dress from Saks Fifth Avenue. All they had to give me was this.” She did a twirl ironically to show off the uniform. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We better get going before someone thinks you crushed out of jail. Last thing we need is the cops chasing us down.” Lilia started moving back towards her car.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fair point, thanks for coming, Lilia.” Agatha said, “I don’t know how I’ll repay you for everything you’ve done to help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s nothing, dear. Just a few favors with our old friends in the fuzz. Next time listen to me when I warn you about someone! I always knew that Wanda was bad news.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I owe you one. Let’s be real, I owe you a million.” Agatha conceded. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shush, we’re not keeping tally. Let’s get you home…and out of that hideous outfit.” Lilia shuffled them to the street. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They made it back to the neighborhood, and Lilia dropped them outside Agatha’s building. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks for the lift, Lilia. Don’t wait up for this one. I have a funny feeling she won’t be coming back home tonight.” Agatha held the car door open and pointed to Rio, making her intentions clear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio limped out but made an effort to shove Agatha before grabbing her crutches, “You’re terrible.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, you love it.” She walked slowly beside Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So good to see you again Ms. Agatha!” The doorman held the front doors open for them both</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Glad to be back, Carl.” She replied and they walked to the elevator. She resented that the crutches blocked access to holding Rio’s hand or snaking an arm around her waist but knew they were necessary. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha helped Rio traverse the small steps up to her door and let her in. Ebony immediately rushed over - a very rare sight indeed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Somebody else missed you!” Rio said, watching the black cat snuggle against Agatha’s legs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m so sorry, Ebony. You missed Mama, didn’t you?” Agatha picked up the kitty and stroked her brilliant black fur. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stared at the display of affection and was reminded of yet another thing she loved about this woman. She had such a hard exterior upon first glance but this version of her, the version that Rio had a front row seat to, the one that obsessed over her adorable pet and melted over an animal that was smaller than a loaf of bread. Rio loved the way Agatha’s face softened and how her voice pitched up in a playful tone to communicate with Ebony. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are unbelievably cute.” Rio spoke. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t go spreading that around. I’ve got a reputation to uphold around these parts. That will kill my newly minted prison cred!” Agatha replied and let Ebony jump down from her arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God forbid people know you won’t bite their heads off.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes exactly, glad you understand.” Agatha snarked back. “I’m desperate for a bath. I need to wash the stench of that place off me - care to join?” She wiggled her eyebrows. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio could only muster a nod. She watched as Agatha quickly stripped off each article of clothing, leaving them in her wake like breadcrumbs. If Agatha was a witch, Rio would be the perfect victim because she followed the trail right to the target. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the bathroom, she stood in the doorway as Agatha turned on the taps. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are a real dish. I thought my daydreams were good, but they were really nothing like the real thing.” Rio was mesmerized by the nude figure in front of her. She let Agatha see her appreciation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t fair. Take your dress off.” Rio almost unconsciously followed the command, and she unbuttoned the front of her dress, slowly pulled her arms out one by one while balancing on her crutches, letting the fabric fall. She was now standing in just a pair of knickers and matching vest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped over to her and went straight in for a kiss. It was their first one in weeks and the reunion of their lips felt like the resonance of perfect harmony. It was an explosion of emotion in such a delicate action. Rio felt Agatha’s hands tracing up and down her sides. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can you help me get these off?” She asked and Agatha was all too happy to comply. Rio leaned her crutches against the sink and put most of her weight on her good leg. Agatha helped her pull the rayon vest up and over her head, planting a smacking kiss when the fabric revealed the luscious lips as it came off. She then dropped down and guided the undergarments down Rio’s legs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt her breath catch when she saw the bandage covering the gunshot wound and ghosted her fingers around it as if she could will it to heal with her hands alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need to remove the dressing before I get in. I can’t sit fully in the bath, but I can sit on the edge. The doctor said I shouldn’t soak the wound fully until it heals more.” Rio said. The bathtub was now full, so Agatha turned off the water. The quiet surrounded them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s okay. I can help.” She tenderly unwrapped the gauze from around her thigh. She held in the cry that almost escaped upon seeing the injury for the first time. A painful reminder of the night she almost lost everything. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked down and saw the tears welling in Agatha’s blue eyes. “Mi amor, it’s alright. The nurse said I was really lucky, that it’s healing better than expected. Everyday the pain lessens. I’m okay. I’m here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood and hugged Rio tightly, enjoying the feeling of their bodies against each other. “I was scared. I was so afraid of losing you that night.” The older woman confessed. She had thought about that moment on a loop. There was endless time to think in jail. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was scared too. When they pulled you away, I thought…is this it? Is that really the last time that I’m going to see her? And I never got a chance to tell you…you know…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That you love me?” Agatha prodded and Rio could hear the smile on her lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Get in the bath. I thought prison would humble you, but somehow it’s made your head grow? How is that possible?” Rio sarcastically asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha walked them both to the tub and helped Rio sit on the edge before easing in on the opposite side. “You love it. Don’t deny it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do love you. I’ve known for a while, and when I was laying in that room, wondering if that was the end, my only regret was not telling you sooner.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stared up at Rio from the water, washing herself with her fancy soaps. “I would sit in my cell, and I wasn’t about to dive into the bible. No thank you. So I would just stare at the ceiling and imagine you. I could almost conjure an image of you working the bar, charming customers, pouring drinks, looking effortlessly gorgeous. I would just lay in bed and imagine all the places that I want to take you - Coney Island, another ball game, my hometown in Massachusetts, the beach, Puerto Rico. There’s so much I want to do with you, it feels like we don’t have enough time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not going anywhere. We have as much time as you want.” Rio said as she carefully washed her legs with a cloth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It could end in a second. When that gun went off…it was just a reminder that this could be taken away at any moment. I can’t lose you now that I have you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then we better make use of every second we have together.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And the insinuation couldn’t be mistaken for anything else. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped out of the bath and towelled off before offering a hand to help Rio stand. She wiped the water from her legs and then in an impressive, unexpected feat of strength, Agatha lifted Rio in the air and carried her across the hall and placed her down on the bed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Momentarily distracted, Agatha rolled around on the bed like a puppy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were you more excited to sleep with me or to sleep in your bed again?” Rio deadpanned. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry! You try sleeping on the hard excuse for a bed they have in that hell hole.” Agatha shimmied around in the blankets before settling down, “Where were we?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think about here.” Rio laid down beside Agatha and kissed her. When Agatha’s tongue beckoned entrance, she gladly let it in. She rolled carefully on top and deepened their kiss. She could feel a hand running through her short hair and another gripping firmly on her ass. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt Agatha rocking up against her, seeking pressure at her center. Rio writhed against the thigh beneath her and felt the oncoming thrill of pleasure. Both of their desperations grew as they chased the fickle mistress of desire.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio, I need you.” Agatha was the first to break, to admit her carnal need. She sat up, straddling the hips below her and Rio moved her hand down to the drenched folds awaiting her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is this all for me?” Rio traced along the pink flesh with her fingers, teasing, taunting her lover. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please.” The request was a hopeless call for more. Agatha shifted and wiggled her hips to try to seek contact. Rio finally gave up the act and entered her smoothly. The delicious sounds that came from Agatha’s mouth bordered on indecent, and Rio had to abstain from moving her other hand to her own treasure as the temptation was almost too much to stand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha rode Rio’s fingers like she was galloping on a prized horse. The tremors of joy were filling her as she moved excitedly up and down. Rio was transfixed on her bouncing breasts and used her free hand to grab and squeeze one of them - the pressure on Agatha’s sensitive nipple sending new shockwaves of stimulation to her core. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She wasn’t going to last long. The feelings were too overwhelming, and it had been far too long since her last dance of delight. Agatha wished to savor the thrill, to prolong the journey, but her thighs were trembling, her will to hold off was long gone. “Don’t stop, Rio.” She panted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha threw her head back as she mounted the heights of her climax and cried out as she fell over the edge of pleasure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watched the scene above her and again felt the power of the act coursing through her. The heat between her legs felt all-consuming now. She needed Agatha, needed her now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha, my love, your fingers…please.” Rio wished she had the power to mount Agatha but didn’t think she could hold herself up with her legs. The older woman was in her rosy haze but aware enough to shift and lower her body down next to Rio. Her hand whispered its way down the smooth flesh and settled at the soft entrance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her ministrations started slowly as she aroused the small bud with her careful caresses, but she quickly sped up the strokes, and Rio was enraptured by the sensation. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That feels so good.” She muttered before Agatha pulled her in for another kiss. Her body was alight with all of the stimuli - it was on the verge of too much yet she was ready to feast. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was struck at once with gratitude. She was so grateful to be alive, to be here in this moment, to know Agatha in this way, to be able to experience this unbelievable pleasure. “I love you.” She cooed as she leaned back to gasp for air. She couldn’t get enough of saying those three words. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you so much, Rio. I missed this, I missed you.” Agatha thrust two fingers in and caught Rio’s exclamation with her mouth. She moved quickly but thought she felt a grimace or noise of pain and eased off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, don’t be gentle with me.” Rio reassured her. She had felt a small twinge of pain as she had adjusted her thigh, but it was quickly outweighed by the coiling tension building inside. Agatha bit her lip and considered hesitating but saw the need as clear as day on Rio’s face. She continued her efforts and felt the trembling around her hand. She watched Rio succumb to the chase and finally cross the finish line with a jolting convulsion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please don’t go.” Rio whimpered, eyes still shut, body still recovering. Her deepest fears coming to the surface in this moment of pure vulnerability. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t. I’m not going anywhere, I won’t leave you.” Agatha held her against her chest, and Rio could hear her heartbeat - the steady pulsing helped settle her nerves. They clutched each other in bed and laid in comfortable silence for either ten minutes or two hours for all they knew. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha spoke first, “Move in with me.” She didn’t want to spend another night without Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you didn’t ask, I was going to.” Rio admitted as she drew lines along Agatha’s exposed belly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So that’s a yes?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” Rio didn’t care to consider what people might think or what they might say. Women were frequently roommates with other women, and if people wanted to gossip, let them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll go get your stuff from Lilia’s tomorrow. Is that alright?” Agatha couldn’t wipe the smile off her face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not this afternoon?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t plan on leaving this bed for several more hours, hun. Three weeks was a long time to go without. It’s like going without water in the desert, there’s only one thing that is going to quench my thirst.” Agatha’s eyes were predatory as she licked her lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was both a tiny bit scared and also shamelessly turned on. She threw her arms out, accepting her fate and welcomed her huntress. </span>

  <p>
  <span>The Hidden Gate reopened its doors on the first Friday of July. It had taken over a month to restock their alcohol supply, acquire new furniture, tear up and put down new flooring, and make the place presentable again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It would have taken most places double the time, but once again Lilia’s endless connections came in handy. On top of that, the whole swath of regulars at the club decided to pool their modest incomes and donate a hefty sum to the renovations. They wanted their place back as soon as possible. As much as the team missed it, the customers missed it more. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia was able to get a team of contractors to do the entire floor in one weekend. They matched the look of the old design, but the fresh varnish made it really sparkle. The new booths dazzled with a unique fabric choice - a deep, mysterious ripe plum. Agatha had searched high and low to find it and scoured every back alley in the city to source enough for the club. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wall decor was replaced, bullet holes were either filled in or covered with art, broken lamps were restored, and eventually the place looked better than it ever had. This was the longest closure in its history. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>On opening night, Darcy took up the post at the door as Alice was still out of commission. She had been discharged from the hospital but was advised not to put herself in any dangerous situations. Of course, nobody expected anything bad to happen, but you could never be 100% sure in this line of work. All the other staff members returned, excited to be back together again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the door opened at 10pm, the guests streamed in like a torrent and filled the hall with raucous joy. There were hugs, kisses, long-awaited reunions, new friends, old acquaintances, and infectious happiness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello suckers!” Agatha stood on the stage and exclaimed her signature phrase to the masses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hello Mother!” They all called back, and Agatha almost choked up. Hearing their voices, seeing their excitement, feeling their energy. It was beautiful, and she hadn’t realized how much she had missed it all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gathered herself, “Thank you. Thank you so much to everyone here. For your donations, for your support. It has meant so much to me and the entire team. We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for each and every one of you. This place isn’t just a bar to me, to all of us. It’s a family. It’s our escape. So thank you again for having our back. We hope we have many, many more years together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now enough about us, let’s get this party started. Give it up for one of our favorites - the Salem Seven!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The crowd broke out in applause and cheers as the big band swung into a groove. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha walked backstage and almost walked right into Rio who was standing in the wings. She was off her crutches and now sported a dandy walking cane with an elegant silver handle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whoa, almost bowled you over there, tiger.” Agatha put both hands on Rio’s hips to regain her balance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Great speech. They love you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What can I say? I’m loveable. Shouldn’t you be behind the bar? Who’s helping Billy?” She looked at her carefully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just wanted to do this quickly before we eventually end up separated all night.” Rio leaned in and placed a gentle kiss on Agatha’s lips. It was slow and deliberate yet held as much passion as ever. Rio felt her stomach flip and her breathing increase - somehow every kiss still had the same effect. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped back when she heard someone call her name from the front, “I wish I could stay but I’ve gotta run, my love. I’ll see you.” She squeezed her hand then walked off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Te veo.” Rio replied and made her way back to the bar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course there was already a huge crowd of people waiting for drinks. She stepped right into the chaos and got to work. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was worried you breezed off! I’m drowning over here.” Billy exclaimed between pouring drinks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, mac. Had to take care of something.” Rio grabbed some glasses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did that something rhyme with ‘gagatha’? He eyed her with a grin on his face. She laughed, how she had missed his sarcasm and endless commentary. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go help some customers, kid. This line isn’t getting any shorter.” She played faux angry and took the next order. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It took a while but finally the crowd eased as the dance floor filled up. They had a moment to breathe. Rio leaned her weight against the bar top. She could stand pretty painlessly these days, but her leg still got sore if she was on her feet for too long. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you okay, Rio?” Billy asked as he wiped down the counter, cleaning up a spilled drink. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it’s all jakeloo. Just fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did Agatha tell you anything about me and Wanda?” He asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, just that she told you about her and that you could visit her in prison if you wanted.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I went to see her a few days ago.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How was that?” Rio was surprised as Billy normally shared every detail of his life. She hadn’t heard him mention anything about Wanda until now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I asked Tommy if he wanted to come, but he didn’t want to this time. So I went by myself. I was nervous. The prison was really intimidating. It’s a huge building, and they took us into this room with lots of tables. There were a few other visitors too. She looked anxious when they brought her in. She looked so different than the other times I’ve seen her - more normal, less scary. Just like any other woman.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She sat across from me, and it felt a little awkward at first. Then she just started asking me questions about myself and about Tommy. Like what I like to do for fun, my favorite foods, my favorite movie, what I want to study in school. It was...actually not so bad.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad you felt okay with it. It took a lot of courage for you to go and see her. Are you going to go again?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think so. It seemed like she just wanted to know more about me. And I would like to know more about her too. Do you think that’s okay?” He seemed conflicted.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not doing anything wrong. It’s natural to be curious. If you ever feel uncomfortable or pressured, you can cut it off, alright? Don’t feel obligated to do anything you don’t want to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks, Rio.” They shared a genuine moment of understanding before another group of patrons flagged them over to top up some drinks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re so happy to be back.” One of the men sat at the bar with a group of friends. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I tried going to some of the bars in Midtown. Big mistake. So full of suits and big eggs. Guys who would rather get corked than dance or have fun. It was a bore.” Another man added. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A gal raised her glass, “Amen! There really is nowhere like this place. It feels like another world.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here’s to Mother!” They all raised their drinks in the air and clinked them together. Even Rio and Billy joined in the cheers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did somebody call?” Agatha appeared out of nowhere among the crowd. People reached out for her as if touching her would transfer some of her intangible power. Others simply stared, dumbstruck by her close proximity, and some openly ogled her - wishing they were the object of her affection. But Mother could only be swayed by one person. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Excuse me, miss. I think the dance floor needs to be broken in by a certain skilled dancer. I heard there was one working here.” Agatha swaggered around the bar and held her arm out for Rio to take. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio couldn’t hide the blush that appeared on her cheeks. Nothing could compare to the feeling of Agatha’s light shining on you. She took the outstretched arm and decided to leave her cane behind the bar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As they walked towards the stage, the crowd parted a pathway for the duo, as if this was all planned in advance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you put them up to this?” Rio whispered out of the side of her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Innocent old me? Well I never!” Agatha jested and winked. She always had something up her sleeve to surprise Rio with. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The people cleared a space on the dance floor as the drummer counted in a mid tempo jazz song. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha could sense a tinge of anxiety in her partner, which was unexpected. If there was anywhere on Earth that Rio felt the most confident, it would be the dance floor. “I’ve got you.” She mouthed as the music was growing in volume. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, “I know.” She said back and took Agatha’s hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This one is for our fearless leader and for the greatest dancer this joint has ever seen. Let’s hear it for Agatha and Rio!” The band leader called out loudly from the stage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt like she could die of embarrassment, but the way Agatha was beaming at her made her set her shoulders back and stand tall. The crowd was clapping in time and rallying around them. The energy was potent and drowned out any fear she had about dancing on her weak leg. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looked into Agatha’s eyes, and everything faded away. They nodded with the beat and then their bodies moved as if compelled by an outside force. Agatha took the lead and Rio, for once, was completely happy to let her. They hardly needed to communicate at all. It was like they were in each other’s heads. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As Agatha would move to lift her arm, Rio was already getting ready to spin out. As Rio pulled left for a twirl, Agatha was right in step with her. It wasn’t a push and pull - it was a glorious partnership, a perfect harmony between two unlikely sources. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The onlookers shouted encouragement as they marvelled at the brilliant show, and when the song finished, the applause was deafening. Rio looked around at all the smiling faces and felt an unbelievable high. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I see why you crave attention now.” She murmured to her dance partner, who let out a loud cackle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh no, have I created a monster?” Agatha covered her mouth in roguish shock. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nah, I don’t think I could handle this all the time.” Rio started walking back to the bar. “Plus I doubt you could handle the competition.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t go there, daddy-o! You wish you could compete with me.” Agatha called out to Rio’s retreating figure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The night continued without any shocks or surprises. It was a night of rejoicing, of reunions, of celebration. It went until the dawn broke over the city and exhaustion threatened to take everyone down. Nobody wanted to go, but Agatha promised everyone they would be open again tomorrow. Eventually the masses took their final swigs and heaved their bodies up the stairs to the real world. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was hiding the last bottle of gin in the wall alcove when she felt a pair of arms wrap around her waist. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ready to make like the wind and blow out of here?” Agatha asked in her ear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ready when you are, sweetheart.” Rio replied. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The couple said their goodbyes and went home together. The walk to their shared apartment was one of Rio’s favorite parts of their routine. It was a quiet reprieve after a night of constant noise and music and demands. They didn’t often converse or debrief. It was enough to enjoy each other’s company in the simple act of walking together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They made the short walk night after night. Throughout the entire summer, the club was packed to the brim. The police raid hadn’t left a black mark on the place; it somehow seemed to only increase its allure. People came from every borough and even from other cities and other states. One night Rio served a group of women who had travelled all the way from Paris and even a fella from across the ocean in Australia. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>As the summer nights got shorter and the cool breeze off the Hudson snaked through the air, a thought that had been itching at the back of Rio’s head finally set itself in motion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any plans tomorrow?” She asked Agatha one Sunday afternoon as they lounged on the couch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing on the calendar.” She narrowed her eyes suspiciously, “Why?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to take you somewhere.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Patience is a virtue.” Rio jabbed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I never did care much for virtues.” She said over the newspaper she was reading. “Well at least tell me what I should wear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t pretend you don’t look good in everything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t help that! But is this a formal occasion? Should I wear sporting wear? Will I need a fur coat? Should I don gloves? A girl needs to know these things in advance.” Agatha rambled on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wear something casual and a warm coat. Shoes you can walk around in. Happy?” Rio relented. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very.” Agatha moved over and kissed Rio on the cheek. “I look forward to whatever you have planned, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The next morning, they took the subway down the entire length of Manhattan to Battery Park. They rose to the surface on a clear and sunny day and walked down to the edge of the water. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the distance, Lady Liberty could be seen standing sentinel over the horizon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know I’ve never been to see her up close. I’ve lived here for so long and never made the trip.” Agatha confessed. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, well, well. Today’s your lucky day.” Rio smiled. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really?” Of all the things Agatha could have guessed they were doing today that hadn’t even crossed her mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I already bought the ferry tickets. Let’s go!” She led them to the dock and boarded the boat with the other hordes of tourists for the short ride over to Bedloe’s Island. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they disembarked on the island, they walked with the crowd to the front of the imposing statue. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow.” Rio said aloud. It was one thing to see it from across the river but standing under her towering form was something else entirely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I remember when she was all bronze.” Agatha noted as they both stared up. “I think the green suits her better. It’s a great color.” She looked to Rio knowing it was her favorite. The statue had only recently shifted color in the past few years as the copper naturally weathered over time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She’s beautiful.” Rio felt tears springing to her eyes. She was taken back to her original boat ride from Puerto Rico. She had watched the city skyline as they approached and then remembered how her eyes fell on the Statue of Liberty. She had heard people talk about it and seen photos, but seeing it in that moment was indescribable. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had been on the precipice of such a dramatic life change - full of fear and worry and excitement. The statue seemed to convey a welcome as if it spoke directly to her, like a calming reminder that she wasn’t alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio felt movement beside her and looked down to see Agatha extend a handkerchief in front of her. She took it and dabbed her eyes. They sat along the short brick wall under the statue’s persistent gaze, and Rio placed her cane at their feet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I always wanted to see this place up close. It’s such an iconic landmark and holds such a significant place in my memory of this country. It’s a reminder of the past, but I also see it as a symbol of my future. A future I want to share with you. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I have never loved anyone as much as I love you, Agatha. I finally understood what liberty felt like when we first kissed. There was no expectation and no role that I was trying to play. I feel completely free when we’re together like my voice matters, like I have a say. I’m never scared, never walking on eggshells, and never worried about your intentions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And you are a shining light through all my doubts. You love me so completely that I never question it. I didn’t know it was possible to feel like this, yet here we are.” Rio saw the tears falling down Agatha’s face now and passed back the hankie with a soft smile. She gripped her hand tightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I never thought I would find freedom in another person, but I’ve found it in you. I want to spend my life with you.” Rio reached into her coat pocket and pulled out a small velvet box. Agatha let out a gasp of true surprise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She had been saving all her earnings and tips for the last few months and was able to amass a decent sum, thanks largely to the fact that she no longer paid rent since moving in with Agatha. She didn’t want for anything, so when she walked by the family-owned jewellery shop near the grocery store one weekend, she went in on a whim. The kind shop owner showed her the latest styles but it was an older ring that caught her eye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio opened the box and revealed a silver band with intricate flowing filigree with a small square cut, deep blue sapphire gemstone in the middle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached out and took the ring out herself, never one to wait for anyone. The smile on her face stretched from ear to ear. She eagerly placed the ring on her hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So…that’s a yes?” Rio had watched the whole sequence with joy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha couldn’t take her eyes off her hand but glanced up to see the earnest brown eyes staring at her, “Yes!” She almost tackled Rio in a bear hug, knocking her back to her elbows on the grass behind them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She pulled back and let her own declaration burst out, “I love you desperately, obsessively, passionately, overwhelmingly. You’ve changed me, Rio. I considered asking the prison warden if I could see a shrink because I thought something must be wrong with my head. I missed you so much I thought I was going crazy. I thought there was no way that I could be so singularly fixated on a person, but I am. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>I used to be so tough and alluringly unavailable, and now I melt at your touch and crumble at your every request. You’ve cast your charm. It’s over - I’m done - You’re it for me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re sure? Last chance to back out.” Rio joked. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Very funny. Just like Lady Liberty, I’ve been carrying a torch for you for ages now. I don’t see any other future without you by my side. What about you? Are you sure?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know it won’t be easy, but after everything we’ve been through so far, I can’t imagine doing it with anyone else.” Rio leaned in and placed a chaste kiss on the side of Agatha’s mouth. It could be read as innocent by any bystander, but they could both feel the promise and the heat behind it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re stuck with me now. You know that right?” Agatha questioned with a tease in her tone. They stood and wandered over to the edge of the island beside the river. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe it’s you who’s stuck with me.” Rio chuckled then stared off, deep in thought. “I wish we could get married.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll do something special. We could host a big party at the club and invite everyone we know. We could say vows to each other in the middle of the forest up in the Catskills. We could scream our love from the top of the Woolworth Building. It may not be legal, but it will be real to us. That’s enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They leaned against the railing, hand in hand, and marveled across the water at the gorgeous skyline of their city.   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where did you come from?” Agatha broke the silence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Umm…Puerto Rico?” Rio looked at her with confusion. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes I’m aware. I meant how did you end up in my life? In this city full of so many countless people, how did we find each other?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looked out at the city again and could see the tiny specks bustling along in their own individual lives. “I don’t know. Maybe it’s just the natural order of all things. I don’t necessarily believe in a God or anything, but I do believe in fate and the unspoken magic all around us. I can’t believe it was simply chance that brought me to you.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I almost don’t care. I’m just grateful to have you. Whatever happens from here, wherever we go, I plan to enjoy every second that we get together.” Agatha released her intention out into the world and held onto Rio’s hand tightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had come so far in such a short time, but she couldn’t wait to see what happened next.   </span>

  <p>
  <span>On December 5th, 1933, the hammer fell and Prohibition faded into the night, the 13 year "noble experiment" came to an unceremonious and welcome end. </span>
</p><p><span>It’s estimated that the federal government lost a total of $11 </span>billion <span>in tax revenue and spent over $300 million trying to enforce this ill-conceived law. On average, over 1000 Americans died every year of Prohibition from the effects of drinking tainted, unregulated liquor. The homicide rate during the 20’s is said to have increased by 78% over the previous period, in addition to increases in robberies, assaults, and related crimes.  </span></p><p>
  <span>Thousands upon thousands lost their jobs as every trade related to alcohol was eliminated, in addition to the knock on effects on all hospitality and entertainment industries. Public trust in law enforcement hit an all time low due to the rampant corruption, bribes, and the rise in organized crime. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The road to hell was paved with good intentions. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>While many suffered during this period, others prospered. Notorious gangster, Al Capone estimated that his bootlegging criminal organization, The Outfit, made as much as $100 million </span>
  <u>
    <span>a year</span>
  </u>
  <span> during Prohibition. He ran about 6,000 speakeasies in Chicago, which are said to have made more than $6 million a week. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had a similar story to tell (though much less extravagant). The Hidden Gate was able to rake in several million dollars in its tenure as an illegal speakeasy. She was a keen saver and pocketed a pretty penny from her efforts and shared the love with her staff. They were all able to ride out the stock market crash and ensuing Depression while the rest of the country descended into poverty. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They kept the doors open through it all - becoming a legal establishment as soon as they were able to apply for the permits. The “peculiar” folks of the city needed somewhere to meet, somewhere to let their hair down, so even though most restaurants and bars were struggling to find clients, Agatha’s place was as popular as ever. She was able to keep prices low due to the booming years prior and that kept the seats and the dance floor full. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio remained by her side. The pair were a fixture of the area, and a pillar of the community. Everyone who was anyone knew them, the inseparable duo that ran the best bar in the city. Some knew them as “roommates” while most knew they were as good as married. Outside of work, they donated generously to the local orphanages, and they volunteered their time at the local soup kitchen, which had lines around the block during the Great Depression. They held season tickets at the new Yankee Stadium and were frequent patrons of the Great White Way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In 1935, they decided to finally move out of Agatha's apartment and bought a brownstone on Manhattan Avenue to make their home. It was bittersweet to say goodbye to the third floor of that beautiful building where they first shared a space together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They had made so many memories in that one-bedroom apartment. It was where they had shared a bed for the first time. Where they had taken care of Ebony before she passed of old age. Where they had hosted weekly Sunday night dinners with their friends.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the new townhouse was more than worth it. There was a massive kitchen where Rio could cook up her favorite dishes, a spacious parlor where Agatha could spin around her lover for a late night dance, a rooftop landing where they could share a kiss under the stars.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will you ever tire of kissing me?” Rio asked one day as they lounged on the roof. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t think that day will ever arrive. Something will have gone terribly wrong if I ever get tired of this.” Agatha declared and planted another smacker on her lover. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Would you give up a kingdom to marry me?” They had just recently listened to the shocking radio address from Edward VIII, who was the first English monarch to abdicate the throne. He gave it all up to marry an American divorcée. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I would surrender all titles, relinquish all my money, disown my name, and sully my reputation a thousand times if it meant I could legally marry you.” Agatha proclaimed in a fairly convincing English accent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I would do the same for you. Do you think it could happen someday?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Giving up my royal birthright?” Agatha joked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, smartmouth. Do you think we’re any closer to getting married in the eye’s of Uncle Sam?” Rio held Agatha’s hand and asked the question without jest. It didn’t often bother her anymore, but sometimes it rose to the surface again.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha stared up at the moon, “I can’t see a world where it happens. Are you…unhappy with our life?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not at all. I love everything we have together. There are just things I wish we could have that everyone else gets. I wish I could kiss you on the street or call you my wife. I wish I didn’t have to hide the most important part of my life sometimes.” Rio loved Agatha completely, but her frustration at the injustice of the world was occasionally hard to come to terms with. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Close your eyes.” Agatha whispered and looked over as Rio listened. “Imagine we live a hundred years in the future. Can you see it? They’ve just passed a new law - it’s now legal for us to get married. We jump in our flying car and zoom to the courthouse. A robot performs our ceremony as we exchange rings. Beep Boop, I declare you wife and…wife. You may now kiss the bride.” Agatha surprised Rio with a sloppy peck on the lips. They giggled like schoolchildren. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Golly, we gotta wait a hundred years? I’m not a very patient person.” Rio whined. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, my love. One day things will change. I have to believe that. We may not be around to see it, but I hope the things we do in our life will be the stepping stones that lead to real progress. It may take decades, but the road towards acceptance is wild and wicked. We can only keep marching forward.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio took over management of the pharmacy when Lilia finally decided to hang up her coat and retire. She kept things running smoothly and made a pointed effort to hire new immigrants whenever possible. She would occasionally jump on the soda fountain to pour some drinks, just for old times sake. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia was a wealthy woman by the time she stopped working at the shop, but she still liked to stay busy. She spent every weekend at the theatre and shared her thoughts on the performances and performers with anyone who would listen. Somehow this led her to a side gig as a critic for </span>
  <em>
    <span>Gotham Life </span>
  </em>
  <span>magazine. Her cutting reviews could make or break the latest shows, as the city’s art-lovers looked to her well-trained ear and cunning wordplay to decide where to spend their hard-earned wages. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Billy graduated from NYU with honors and a degree in business. He took over the accounting and financial management for both the pharmacy and bar and helped settle the books to paint a plausible story for its sustained success throughout the 20s. He handled all that, in addition to his full-time career working in film distribution at The Astoria Studio in Queens. The timing couldn’t have been more perfect. As the talkies exploded on the movie scene, Billy was there to usher them into the mainstream and ride the Golden Age of Hollywood straight to the bank. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He and Tommy saw Wanda a few times a year. She left Vision and the gang after serving her time. The past was too haunting and that part of her life died with her brother. She took the money she made in her divorce and paid for Billy’s entire education - he was able to keep his savings and go on a dream trip to Hollywood with his twin. Wanda moved out to New Jersey to start fresh and reset. She hung up her knives and lived a quiet life, punctuated by joyous visits from her sons. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen’s moonshine was acquired by Jean-Paul’s Northstar Distillery and sold under their brand name. She was able to negotiate a 10% profit sharing agreement and almost fainted when the first cheque arrived in the mail. Her product was found on shelves across North America, and they were even able to export it overseas to Europe, where it found a surprising cult following in France. She settled down with a Canadian gal who caught her eye on one of her trips to Montreal and decided to move up North permanently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice recovered from her injuries and determined that security was really not worth the risk. It had been exciting at first, but her brush with death had recalibrated her priorities. She decided to pursue her long-forgotten dream of music and dove back into the piano. She became only the second woman to join the New York Philharmonic, just two years after the pioneer harpist Stephanie Goldner. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In 1965, the month of Agatha’s 85th birthday, the couple was contacted by </span>
  <em>
    <span>The Ladder</span>
  </em>
  <span> magazine for an interview. It was the first and only nationally distributed lesbian publication in the country. They were looking for couples who had been together for decades to inspire hope in a community that was struggling to find much of it otherwise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The 40’s and 50’s had been a perilous time in the country with the government actively persecuting anyone outside the expected heterosexual norm. Where the 20’s had been a time of sexual freedom and exploration, the pendulum swung hard and fast in the opposite direction. Laws were passed to criminalize “that way of life” and homosexuals were tied to communists and targeted in what came to be known as the “Lavender Scare.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thousands lost their jobs, were arrested, were attacked. Millions simply hid in fear, but always, in the background, others reached out and found each other. Brave souls sought community and built safe havens and protected each other.    </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio helped Agatha ease into her favorite lilac shirtwaist dress with matching short gloves. She was as spry as ever thanks to decades pounding the pavement in New York, but Rio liked helping her get dressed. She passed over a pair of pearl earrings, which Agatha affixed to her ears and admired in the mirror. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here you go, my love.” Then helped pin a special flower brooch to her lapel. She brushed the long white locks that cascaded down Agatha’s back. It took effort to maintain but Rio had to admit that the long hair really worked. Then again, at this point she could say every hairstyle looked good on Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio donned her black cigarette pants and a classic red check button-down shirt blouse. She loved how fashion had evolved over time to allow more variety in her options. She had also gone through all types of hairstyles through the years, but now in the later era of her life, she was back to a classic bob. She didn’t care much for accessories except for one important ring she never took off her left hand, a gold band with a pear-shaped emerald that Agatha had gifted her on their 1 year anniversary. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ready?” She asked Agatha, who smiled up at her from her seat at her dressing table. Rio helped her stand and they linked arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two walked downstairs gently when they heard the doorbell ring and greeted the interviewer. They all took up spots in the front sitting room. Agatha brought out a pitcher of iced tea and a tray of Rio’s homemade quesitos, a childhood favorite similar to a cheese danish. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The interviewer opened her notebook and clicked her pen. Rio threw her arm around Agatha’s shoulder and leaned in. She felt a familiar hand on her thigh, gently massaging around a very old scar - a long-practiced habit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So how did you two meet?” The young interviewer asked with interest, looking between the two elders. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you want to tell her, bunny?” Rio shook her head with a bashful smile and Agatha smirked, always the ham no matter her age, she loved retelling the tale. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The year was 1922…”</span>
