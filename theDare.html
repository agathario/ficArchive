  <b>The Dare</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have </span>
  <em>
    <span>got</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be fucking kidding me,” Agatha groaned as she and Rio stepped into the crappy little hotel room in the crappy little hotel that Jen and Alice had booked for their wedding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hotel had apparently been overbooked (Agatha couldn’t imagine </span>
  <em>
    <span>why</span>
  </em>
  <span>. They didn’t even offer a complimentary breakfast), which meant that the bridal party was forced to double-up in whichever rooms they had left.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which meant that the Maid of Honor (Agatha) and Best Man (Rio) were being forced to share a room. This wouldn’t have been so bad (Agatha could admit that Rio wasn’t as annoying as she </span>
  <em>
    <span>could</span>
  </em>
  <span> be, and she wasn’t bad to look at, either) if it weren’t for the fact that this hotel was </span>
  <em>
    <span>so shitty</span>
  </em>
  <span> that they apparently couldn’t afford to put at least </span>
  <em>
    <span>two</span>
  </em>
  <span> beds in all their “double” rooms, which Agatha had specifically requested when she helped Jen make the reservation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span> wouldn’t have been as terrible if it weren’t for the fact that the singular available bed in the room wasn’t even a </span>
  <em>
    <span>queen-sized</span>
  </em>
  <span> bed. No, it was fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>full</span>
  </em>
  <span>-sized.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fucking hell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Rio said, peering over her shoulder at the bed, “that’s…unfortunate.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And that,” Agatha retorted, “is a severe understatement.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room was tiny, too. Barely twice as wide as the bed itself with little more room on either side of it to fit more than an end table with a flickering lamp. There was a singular dresser with a thirty-inch TV propped up on it and an old, ratty, easy chair in one corner of the room. In another corner was the door to a miniscule bathroom that looked more like a water closet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where the fuck did Jen find this place?” Agatha huffed, placing her bag at the foot of the bed. It creaked eerily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think Alice is the one that found it, actually,” Rio said. “She said she remembered stopping here when she was really little, on tour with her mom. She remembers it being a lot bigger.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well Alice is tiny,” Agatha snorted. “This bed is probably </span>
  <em>
    <span>giant</span>
  </em>
  <span> to her.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“She and Jen have a California King at home,” Rio pointed out. “I think she’ll notice it’s not that big. Besides, they got the honeymoon suite.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope it’s better than </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span> dumpster fire,” Agatha grumbled, sitting down on the right side of the bed. It creaked again, but the mattress was relatively firm. The bedframe was the issue, it seemed. She hoped it would hold through the night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not so bad,” Rio said, placing her own bag on the left side of the bed and perching herself on the chair. “I’ve lived in shittier places.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s sad,” Agatha huffed. “You realize that’s sad, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “It is what it is,” she said. “I’ll take the chair for the night if you’d like to have the bed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not sleeping in that chair,” Agatha snorted. “Your back will hate you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ve done worse things to my back,” Rio said, waving her off. “Slept in a truck bed for a week without anything between me and the cold metal of the floor.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are you still walking straight?” Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t,” Rio retorted. “I walk rather gay, thank you very much.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hardee har har,” Agatha snorted. “Seriously, though, Rio. We’re not twenty anymore. You may have been able to get away with that shit before, but now you need an actual bed. If you start walking like Quasimodo down that aisle tomorrow, Jen is going to have my head for letting you sleep like that.” She motioned toward the bed. “It’s big enough for the two of us. We can even put up a pillow as a buffer if that’s what you’re scared of.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not </span>
  <em>
    <span>scared</span>
  </em>
  <span> of anything,” Rio huffed. “I just didn’t think you’d be comfortable sleeping in such a tiny excuse for a bed with another person. You’ve complained enough about the size of it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged. “Only because I’ve </span>
  <em>
    <span>also</span>
  </em>
  <span> slept in shittier places before,” she said. “Shitty mom, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brows furrowed. “Right,” she said. “Sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged. “The bitch is dead now,” she said. “Can’t hurt me. Can’t force me to sleep on a twin-sized mattress in a closet until I go to college.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jesus Christ,” Rio huffed. “Are you Harry fucking Potter or something?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted at that. “No,” she said. “I did fuck a ginger all through college though. She was cute, but it wasn’t meant to be. Come on. Get ready for bed. You’re not sleeping on that chair.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you’re sure…” Rio said, cautiously standing up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sure,” Agatha said, taking a blanket out of her bag and draping it over her side of the bed. No way she was climbing under these gross hotel sheets. Who knew the last time this bed was cleaned? “I’m just gonna go change. You okay changing in here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just taking my pants and bra off,” Rio said, her face turning pink. “I’m wearing boxers. They’re pretty much my sleep shorts.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, feeling something flutter in her chest as she made her way into the bathroom, shutting the door with a soft </span>
  <em>
    <span>click</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio Vidal was…an enigma.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was Alice’s best friend, apparently since high school, and had always been kind of a quiet presence in their friend group. She took minimal part in their discussions, but she laughed at their jokes and even cracked one of her own from time to time. She had a pretty face, Agatha had to admit, and a nice smile, with a cute little gap between her two front teeth. She was prone to darker clothes with earthy tones and beanies that looked hand-crocheted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to imagine Rio with a crochet hook and some yarn, constructing a beanie on a Friday or Saturday night while some murder podcast played in her ear. She found that she liked the image in her brain, as improbable as it was.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had been the last one to join their little tightly knit group in her second year of college, having spent the entire summer getting torn down by her bitch of a mother and making a vow to herself that she was never going ‘home’ again, not even on holidays. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In order to pull that off, she decided, she’d have to find friends –</span>
  <em>
    <span> actual friends</span>
  </em>
  <span> – that she could attach herself to and possibly score invites to </span>
  <em>
    <span>their</span>
  </em>
  <span> families’ homes for holidays and vacations.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She thought she’d hit the jackpot with Jennifer Kale, a biochem major who was the </span>
  <em>
    <span>pinkest</span>
  </em>
  <span> person Agatha had ever met. She had pink </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span>, from her backpack, to her notebooks, to all the decorations in her dorm room. Ninety percent of her </span>
  <em>
    <span>wardrobe</span>
  </em>
  <span> had been pink, as well. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha had met her during a mandatory science course (she’d done well in chemistry in high school, so it couldn’t have been much harder in college, right?) and had asked Jen for help during their second class, unable to keep up with the chicken scratch notes that the professor was writing on the board.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen had been all too happy to help, giving Agatha her notes and offering to do a little light tutoring during their free time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It had been almost </span>
  <em>
    <span>too easy</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Agatha thought, accepting the help. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then she actually started to </span>
  <em>
    <span>like</span>
  </em>
  <span> hanging out with Jen, even if chemistry was something that made her feel incredibly stupid. It was basically potions and witchcraft. She could practically hear her mother’s voice calling it something of the devil.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon enough, Agatha had passed chemistry with a B and Jen was inviting her to an end-of-semester party with some of the people who lived in her dorm suite. One of them was Alice, her long-term girlfriend, who was tiny, dressed primarily in leather, and had piercings and dyed hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was exactly the kind of “devil-worshipping lesbian” that Agatha’s mother had warned her about all her life, so naturally Agatha liked her immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then there was Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quiet, observant, shadowy Rio. She and Alice had been best friends since high school because they were both considered ‘odd’ by their peers. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Lurkers</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Alice had said, recounting what one bitchy girl in their English class had called them. They wore the moniker like a badge of honor, though, ironing patches onto their jackets (Rio still had a dark wash denim jacket she wore like a second skin anywhere she went) and making inside jokes about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice and Jen met in their first class at university and, well, the rest is history…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha still couldn’t believe that Jen and Alice were getting married now, a whole decade later. They seemed like total opposites, but they were definitely still very much in love.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And they were </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> shy about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Rio was…well, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Rio</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t know how Rio felt about her, but she thought the other woman was…interesting. That was the best word to describe her. She spoke a little bit more now than she did in college. She smiled more, too, which Agatha actually really liked to see. She was always at get-togethers and parties and whatever else Jen and Alice hosted. Sometimes, she had a book in her hands, but Agatha could tell that she stayed tuned into their conversations.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A couple of times, Agatha had even been able to talk to her, one-on-one about…stuff. Usually about whatever book Rio was pretending to read. It was obvious to Agatha that she’d already read whatever was in her hands and just wanted somebody to ask her about it, to talk about it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Agatha did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was an English major and had read her fair share of good and interesting books. She’d learned how to discuss them in her major classes and had even gone for her Masters, intent on becoming a professor – which she achieved. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio, who had studied botany, worked in a lab somewhere upstate. Agatha followed her social media, which was full of pictures of plants with descriptions and scientific names and whatever else. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha was careful not to like the posts, but she never missed one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When she re-emerged from the bathroom, after changing into a pair of soft purple pajama pants and an old oversized t-shirt, washing her face, brushing her teeth, and psyching herself up to spend the night in the same bed as “Lurker” Rio Vidal, Agatha padded to the bed as casually as possible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio was tucked under her own green crocheted blanket, pretending to read a book. There was a single pillow that separated the two halves of the bed. Agatha noticed that Rio’s side was a bit smaller and she bit back a smile, shaking her head as she got underneath her own blanket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatcha reading this time?” Agatha asked, peering at the cover of the book.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio silently lifted the book so that she could more easily see the cover. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ooh,” Agatha said. “That one is </span>
  <em>
    <span>really</span>
  </em>
  <span> good. Which one was your favorite?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Her wife,” Rio snorted, glancing sideways at Agatha as she closed the book. “This is my third time reading it, actually. I really like the story.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So do I,” Agatha sighed. “Hollywood glamor mixed with light tragedy and so much longing. Can you imagine what it must have been like to have to hide your love from the world like that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was pretty deep in the closet in high school,” Rio admitted, “so yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha snorted. “Same,” she said, starting to lie down. “My mom would have </span>
  <em>
    <span>flipped</span>
  </em>
  <span> if she ever saw me so much as hold hands with a girl. Thankfully, I had no friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s sad,” Rio said, laying down and facing her. Agatha could only see about half her face over the pillow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged. “I survived,” she said. “And then I found Jen. And Alice…and </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>. My book buddy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even in the low light of the hotel room, Agatha could see the flush appear on Rio’s cheeks. She bit back her smile as she turned over, reaching to turn off the light on her side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio mirrored her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not gonna keep reading?” Agatha asked, glancing over her shoulder at Rio, who settled back down, still facing her while Agatha faced away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Three times, remember?” Rio snorted. “Besides, it’s late and I have to stand up for my best friend tomorrow. I need my beauty sleep.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Darling, you don’t need beauty sleep,” Agatha snorted. “Trust me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The words were past her lips before she could stop them, but there was nothing that she could say or do to draw them back or explain them away, so Agatha just stayed quiet, her face burning as she pressed it into the pillow, silently cursing herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good night, Agatha,” Rio whispered after a long moment, into the darkness shrouding them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good night, Rio,” Agatha replied, her voice much softer. She doubted Rio heard her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha awoke about an hour later to something poking her in the back. It took her a long moment to remember where she was as she rubbed sleep out of her eyes and glanced around the darkened hotel room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then she remembered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shitty hotel. Tiny bed. Sharing said tiny bed with </span>
  <em>
    <span>Rio Vidal</span>
  </em>
  <span>. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio Vidal, who was now pressed up against her back, snoring lightly in her ear, arms wrapped around Agatha’s waist, </span>
  <em>
    <span>something</span>
  </em>
  <span> hard poking into the small of Agatha’s back, just above her ass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At first, Agatha thought it was Rio’s bony knee that was just bent at an odd angle, but then she realized that both of Rio’s legs were now tangled with her own. But then, what was…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio?” Agatha whispered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stirred slightly, but her grip on Agatha tightened instead of loosened. Her palm was flat against Agatha’s belly, just under her breasts. Agatha sighed, instinctively cuddling back into her, feeling whatever that was press more insistently into her back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She almost forgot what she was doing for a second. Almost.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” she whispered a little bit louder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm?” Rio murmured in her sleep, and Agatha felt the soft touch of lips on the back of her neck for a moment before Rio was off of her like a shot, tumbling out of the bed in a tangle of her own blanket and limbs. “Shit!” she exclaimed. “Sorry!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned over and peered over the edge of the bed, staring at a rumpled-looking Rio sitting in the tight space between the bed and the wall, her hair mussed and her green blanket covering her lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Which was tented.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes widened at that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can explain!” Rio said, her face going beet red. “I don’t have a penis!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um…” Agatha stared at the tented blanket. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was a dare!” Rio said, trying to push the cause of the tent down, but it just popped back up, creating an even more obvious shape.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um…what was?” Agatha asked, her brows furrowed and nose wrinkled as she continued to stare at Rio’s lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Um…” Rio said, avoiding her gaze. “Alice,” she said, “bet me a hundred dollars that I couldn’t wear it for the entirety of the wedding trip.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wear…is that a strap then?” Agatha asked, trying not to laugh. “You’ve been wearing a </span>
  <em>
    <span>strap</span>
  </em>
  <span> the entire time we’ve been on the road?” She couldn’t hold back a giggle as the words came out of her mouth and she slapped her hand over it. “I’m so sorry!” she said, through her fingers. “It’s not funny. It’s not. Oh my god.” She shook her head, trying to suppress her giggles, but failing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually, she was absolutely losing it, rolling all over the bed, laughing so hard that she couldn’t breathe. Then she heard Rio start laughing, too, and they were two idiots, laughing like hyenas at a stupid strap on.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Agatha finally calmed down, she was splayed across the bed on her back, staring at the ceiling. “Can I see it?” she asked, suddenly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Rio asked, still chuckling. “Seriously?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah!” Agatha said, turning to peer over the edge of the bed again. “You kept it so well-hidden for </span>
  <em>
    <span>hours</span>
  </em>
  <span>. How did you do that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I had it tucked in my boxers,” Rio said, blushing as she scrambled up from the ground. Agatha backed up to her side of the bed so that Rio could sit, still keeping the blanket over her crotch. She swallowed thickly. “It must have popped out.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You popped a boner!” Agatha whisper-screamed, then dissolved into a fit of giggles, falling back onto the bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh my god,” Rio snorted, “you are such a child. Who knew?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jen definitely knew,” Agatha said. “Now, come on: let me see.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ugh,” Rio said, peeking under the blanket. “Fine,” she said. “Don’t laugh at my boxers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll probably be too distracted by the fake dick to even care about – are those dinosaurs?” Agatha blinked at the multicolored cartoon dinosaurs that littered the dark background of Rio’s baggy boxers. They were adorable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Rio huffed, blushing. “Dinosaurs are cool.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No arguments from me,” Agatha said, holding her hands up in surrender as she tugged the green blanket entirely off of Rio’s lap, her eyes widening at the dildo strapped to her waist. “Whoa,” she said, her voice soft and a little reverent. “That’s…wow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was green. And long. And thick. And </span>
  <em>
    <span>realistic</span>
  </em>
  <span> in shape. Agatha swallowed thickly at the sight of it and instinctively reached out to touch it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand caught her wrist just as her fingers brushed against the silicone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry,” Agatha said, her hand flexing in Rio’s grip. “I didn’t mean to…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s fine,” Rio said, clearing her throat. “It’s just…it’s a </span>
  <em>
    <span>special</span>
  </em>
  <span> one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha furrowed her brow. “Special </span>
  <em>
    <span>how</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” she asked, eyeing the strap-on. It didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>look</span>
  </em>
  <span> very special.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s textured,” Rio said, after a long moment. She cleared her throat. “A-at the bottom.” She looked away, her face an impressive shade of red that Agatha had never seen before.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mean, where it’s touching your–”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Rio confirmed. “You can touch it, but I just…I can feel </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything</span>
  </em>
  <span>. You know? Just please…be gentle.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded as Rio released her wrist. Her movements were slower now, more gentle as she reached for the fake dick. She slowly wrapped her fingers around the tip of it. The silicone was soft and warm from having been pressed against Rio’s body all day. Agatha moved it slightly and heard a tiny gasp come from the back of Rio’s throat. Agatha’s eyes widened as her gaze snapped to Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her eyes were shut tightly. Her hands were clenched in the comforter underneath her, the one neither of them had even attempted to pull back and use. She was gritting her teeth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gave the strap a stroke and Rio let out another gasp, her hand reaching for Agatha’s wrist again, but she didn’t stop her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Agatha did it again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes opened and found Agatha’s, staring practically into her soul as Agatha continued to stroke the fake dick in her hand. Agatha leaned forward, pressing her forehead to Rio’s as she continued to stroke, keeping eye contact with her as Rio panted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hand not stroking Rio’s strap came up to cup Rio’s cheek, Agatha’s thumb sweeping across Rio’s cheekbone. Her skin was so soft, softer than the silicone by </span>
  <em>
    <span>far</span>
  </em>
  <span>, and she found herself leaning in until their lips were brushing, eyes still open, staring into each other’s souls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha,” Rio gasped against her lips, and Agatha closed the gap, her eyes closing too as she fully kissed Rio Vidal for the first time, her hand stroking her faster and a little harder while Rio gasped into her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s own hands rose, one grasping around the wrist attached to the hand that was stroking her cheek and the other burying itself in Agatha’s hair, pulling her into a deeper kiss, which Agatha gladly accepted, her own hand never pausing its movements.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before long, Rio’s hips were canting up to meet Agatha’s strokes, her breathing becoming more shallow, her gasps more numerous as they were swallowed by Agatha’s mouth on hers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m…I’m gonna…” she gasped against Agatha’s lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go ahead,” Agatha murmured back. “Come for me, baby.” She opened her blue eyes as they continued to kiss and saw that Rio had done the same, her own deep brown eyes half-lidded as her mouth gaped open, her lips no longer kissing Agatha so much as rubbing against her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ag-Agatha!” Rio gasped, finally falling over the edge as Agatha continued to stroke the strap, her movements faster and rougher in an effort to prolong Rio’s pleasure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s body pulsed next to her, her head falling to Agatha’s shoulder as all the breath seemed to leave her lungs in an instant, her body slumping, draped over her bedmate. Agatha held her, smiling into her dark, mussed hair, her fingers releasing the silicone in favor of wrapping her arm around her waist, holding her close.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Rio’s breath was back to normal, she pulled away slightly from Agatha’s grasp, her brown eyes wide as she found Agatha’s blue. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What was </span>
  <em>
    <span>that</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” she asked. “What just happened?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm,” Agatha said, leaning back slightly on one hand with the opposite staying wrapped around Rio’s waist, “looks like you haven’t had this one for very long, huh? I would have figured you know what happens when you buy something like this.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes, flushing. “Of course I…this isn’t my only one, Agatha,” she scoffed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that so?” Agatha’s eyes darkened noticeably at that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio cleared her throat. “Yes,” she said. “But what I meant is…what is this? What does this mean…for us?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>have</span>
  </em>
  <span> to mean anything,” Agatha murmured, tilting her head, “unless you…want it to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> want it to?” Rio asked, suddenly looking shy as she searched Agatha’s eyes nervously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Baby,” Agatha snorted, “I just gave you a handjob in a seedy hotel room – what do </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> think?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed, rolling her eyes. Then she cupped Rio’s cheeks with both hands and pulled her into a passionate kiss, her stomach and chest both fluttering. She hadn’t realized just how much she’d wanted this, wanted </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> until they were here, in this moment, her hand wrapped around her…well…</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>God</span>
  </em>
  <span>, she wanted her </span>
  <em>
    <span>so bad</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they pulled back – </span>
  <em>
    <span>again</span>
  </em>
  <span> – both of them were panting, Agatha’s forehead pressed to Rio’s, hands still cupping her cheeks as she stroked her cheekbones with her thumbs. Rio’s hands were wrapped around her wrists, gripping tightly as </span>
  <em>
    <span>her</span>
  </em>
  <span> thumbs stroked over her pulse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So…you like me?” Rio asked, searching Agatha’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are dense, you know that?” Agatha teased, grinning toothily at her. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Yes</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Rio Vidal, I like you. Do you like me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “You’re okay,” she said, noncommittally, but she was grinning, that adorable little gap showing between her two front teeth. “Yes,” she said, after a long moment, “I like you. I’ve always liked you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All this time?” Agatha asked, a little surprised, as she pulled back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Since day one,” Rio admitted, nodding as she leaned in to press another kiss to Agatha’s lips. Agatha moaned into her mouth, wrapping her arms around Rio’s waist and pulling her down to lay down on the bed, opening her legs as Rio twisted her body to lay between them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then do us </span>
  <em>
    <span>both</span>
  </em>
  <span> a favor,” Agatha husked, reaching down with one hand to wrap around the silicone attached to Rio’s hips once again, “and let us </span>
  <em>
    <span>both</span>
  </em>
  <span> feel how much pleasure this thing can give us, hmm?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio wasted no time in ridding Agatha of her sleep bottoms, practically tearing them down her legs and tossing them off the side of the bed, her underwear coming next. Agatha was a little relieved that Rio didn’t tease her about the purple granny panties she was wearing, with the little bow on them, but Rio seemed to be preoccupied with </span>
  <em>
    <span>other</span>
  </em>
  <span> things.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She kissed and sucked up Agatha’s legs, from her knees to the insides of her thighs, her fingers stroking and clutching at the soft skin there, her teeth nipping everywhere she could reach as Agatha writhed beneath her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” she gasped. “Please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could </span>
  <em>
    <span>feel</span>
  </em>
  <span> Rio’s self-satisfied grin against her hip as she placed another kiss there. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bastard</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha tugged at her hair, attempting to get Rio to move one way or the other, but Rio was surprisingly strong for somebody as thin as she was. She reached for Agatha’s wrists, placing them flat on the bed on either side of her body as she continued to suck and nip at Agatha’s hips, pushing up Agatha’s oversized sleep shirt with her forehead until she couldn’t anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No touching,” Rio growled up at her, pressing Agatha’s wrists insistently into the bed. “Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded frantically, desperate for more. She didn’t care </span>
  <em>
    <span>what</span>
  </em>
  <span> that entailed. She just </span>
  <em>
    <span>needed more</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha did her best to stay still as Rio’s hands abandoned her wrists in favor of pushing up her shirt until the material was pooled just under Agatha’s neck, exposing her breasts. Rio wasted no time in attaching her mouth to the left one and sucking her nipple into her mouth while her hand squeezed and teased the nipple on the other. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” Agatha practically sobbed, her hips canting up against Rio’s. “Please. I need more. I need </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt Rio nod as she continued to press kisses to her chest, her lips trailing up over the pooled material of the shirt until she reached Agatha’s jaw and then, eventually, her lips, pressing more kisses there that Agatha greedily accepted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure about this?” Rio asked, pulling back with a heavy sigh. “There’s no going back after this, Agatha. I…I don’t think I can.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t want to go back,” Agatha gasped, her hands finally leaving the bed to stroke up and down Rio’s back.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why the hell is her shirt still on?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why the hell is </span>
  </em>
  <span>my</span>
  <em>
    <span> shirt still on??</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want this,” Agatha swore, reaching for the hem of Rio’s shirt, tugging it upward. It was tight, a black t-shirt that was practically her default, but Rio’s hands helped her with it before moving to rid Agatha of her own shirt.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soon enough, they were both entirely naked (save for Rio’s boxers, which were still dino-covered and resting over the straps holding the fake dick to her body), and Rio was nestled between her legs, the silicone brushing through Agatha’s wetness as Agatha gasped and writhed against her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Rio,” Agatha whined, “please, baby.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded, leaning down to press another kiss to her lips as she reached down with one hand to position herself at Agatha’s entrance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both gasped as Rio entered Agatha slowly, her hand returning to run into Agatha’s hair, tugging the strands as their pelvises met. Agatha gasped, her nails scoring down Rio’s back at the sensation of being filled so deliciously.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you…have to…choose…the biggest one…for the dare?” she huffed out.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alice was only going to give me fifty for the smaller one,” Rio replied, pulling out slightly. “At least this way I can buy you a </span>
  <em>
    <span>nice</span>
  </em>
  <span> dinner for our first date.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed out a laugh that turned into a gasp as Rio thrust into her, her arms tightening around Rio’s middle. She pressed her face into the crook of Rio’s neck and opened her mouth, biting down on Rio’s pulse, which in turn made the other woman’s hips stutter as she let out a groan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re so fucking hot,” Rio gasped. “Didn’t take you for a biter, though.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There’s a lot about me – oh fuck – that you don’t know,” Agatha said, gasping as Rio continued to thrust into her, grinding slightly against her clit. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Jesus!</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Jesús no está aquí,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Rio panted into her ear. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Soy solo yo.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s entire body quivered at that and she leaned up to press her lips to Rio’s ear. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Eres más que suficiente,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” she husked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aw, </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Rio exclaimed, her thrusts getting faster. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>, that’s so hot. I didn’t know you spoke Spanish.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Like I – </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck, Rio</span>
  </em>
  <span> – said,” Agatha replied, trying to paint on a smirk, but failing as Rio hit a particularly deep spot inside her when Agatha tilted her hips just so… “Oh </span>
  <em>
    <span>God</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” she cried out, doing her best to keep her hips tilted. “Yes, Rio! Right there, baby! Oh fuck! Oh fuck! Harder! Faster! Please!” Her nails raked up and down Rio’s back, uncaring whether she was leaving permanent scars.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She was </span>
  <em>
    <span>certain</span>
  </em>
  <span> that Rio wouldn’t mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio, for her part, was </span>
  <em>
    <span>very</span>
  </em>
  <span> good at following instructions. She placed her arm under one of Agatha’s legs, lifting it up for the deepest angle yet, shifting her hips a little sideways so that she could hit a spot inside Agatha that she had never even considered, a spot that made her see lights behind her eyes, her nails digging even harder into Rio’s skin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her babbling was nonsensical as she held on for dear life, feeling herself get closer and closer as the coil in her lower belly tightened and tightened until…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, fuck!” Agatha cried out, pulling Rio down so that she could bury her face into her shoulder as she came. “Rio!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Agatha!” Rio grunted, her own hips stuttering as she chased Agatha’s release with her own, the textured bit of the dildo hitting her clit again and again as she thrust into the woman below. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pleasure washed over Agatha like a wave and she tightened her hold on Rio, pulling her impossibly closer, pressing her lips everywhere they could reach until they finally reached Rio’s, her lips curving up against Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio started to tilt to the side, intending to take her weight off of Agatha, but Agatha just tightened her grip, holding her firmly against her body. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t,” she murmured into Rio’s neck. “Just…stay.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She felt Rio’s smile against her temple. “As you wish,” she husked, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ugh,” Agatha groaned with a chuckle. “You are </span>
  <em>
    <span>such</span>
  </em>
  <span> a nerd.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A nerd whose name you just screamed in the throes of passion,” Rio pointed out, grinning as she pulled back to meet Agatha’s eyes, keeping her promise and staying nestled against her. Agatha scowled and Rio pressed a kiss to her furrowed brows, keeping her lips there until they relaxed before moving down Agatha’s face, pressing pecks everywhere she could reach until she arrived at Agatha’s lips once again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>smiling</span>
  </em>
  <span> lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That was…” Agatha sighed. “Wow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll say,” Rio snorted. “You’re quivering.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Agatha said. “No, I’m not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then what’s that vibration that I–agh!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both squealed when the bedframe finally gave out beneath them, the legs at the end of the bed falling over as the body dropped the mattress to the ground, making them both grunt in shock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did that really just happen?” Agatha huffed, slamming her foot down on the mattress. “Piece of shit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio couldn’t respond as her face was pressed to Agatha’s shoulder, her own shoulders shaking with her mirth. Before long, Agatha joined her in her laughter, arms tightening around her shoulders as they lost their shit together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re paying for that bedframe,” Jen huffed as they walked out of the crappy hotel the next morning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Absolutely </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span>,” Agatha huffed. “You need to appeal. That thing could have </span>
  <em>
    <span>killed</span>
  </em>
  <span> us! It was </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> made for more than one person at a time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe it wouldn’t have broken if you two hadn’t fucked like bunnies!” Jen hissed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth gaped and her eyes went wide at Jen’s accusation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you forget that Alice and I had the room right next to yours?” she snorted. “Thin walls, Agatha.” She lifted one eyebrow and smirked. “How was it, though?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha flushed, picking up her pace to get away. Jen was hot on her trail.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come </span>
  <em>
    <span>on</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” Jen huffed. “Alice and I have been trying to hook you two up since sophomore year! Who knew a stupid strap-on bet would be just the thing to do it after more than a decade of watching you two </span>
  <em>
    <span>idiots</span>
  </em>
  <span> shoot each other shy smiles and longing glances. You two are worse than a bad romance novel, I swear.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are unwell, Kale,” Agatha huffed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> are my Maid of Honor,” Jen said, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s body, trapping her arms against her sides. “And, as such, you owe me details. Now </span>
  <em>
    <span>spill</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha let out a long groan as Jen practically dragged her to the rental car.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Behind them, Alice handed Rio a crisp hundred dollar bill.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The wedding isn’t even over for a few hours,” Rio said, confused.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Trust me,” Alice retorted, avoiding her gaze, “you earned that.”</span>
