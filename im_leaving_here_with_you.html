<h2>
    i'm leaving here with you
   </h2>
<div>
<p>
     Never let your son convince you that Halloween is a date as special as Christmas, or you’ll just end up going back to your home town and be forced to stand face to face with the biggest problem of your life, the trammel that keeps you from living the happiest you could be; your own mother.
    </p>
<p>
     That was the only thing going through Agatha’s mind as Jen’s car raced across the green “Welcome to WestView” sign.
    </p>
<p>
     “Almost there?” Nicholas asked from his seat in the back, energetic after the two hour nap that he took and the prospect of filling his tummy with candy in just a few more hours.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, honey, almost there.”
     <em>
      Unfortunately
     </em>
     , Agatha thought as she replied, but Nicholas didn't need that, she took very seriously the promise that she made for herself when holding him for the first time; Never bother children with problems that they can’t understand much less solve.
    </p>
<p>
     And Nick was just so excited to see his family again, to play with friends that he made when visits to his mom’s old home used to be more frequent, dress up and run around the blocks collecting every sugar loaded stuff that he could. How could Agatha ever deny him that?
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re here!” Jen announced as she parked right in front of Evanora’s house.
    </p>
<p>
     A chill ran through Agatha's spine, as it usually happened every single time she saw that house again, recalling how she used to sit on the steps of the front door and look at the moon asking the silver glistening heavenly body if the way she felt about other girls was okay, how she used to be walked home and kissed goodbye just outside the window’s view area, how she more than just once spent a night sleeping against the door with a backpack between her legs begging her mother to let her inside after being kicked out
     <em>
      again
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     WestView is where hopes go to die, and Agatha always wanted Nick to dream and be big.
    </p>
<p>
     He leaped out of the car as soon as Agatha finished unclasping his safety belt and ran to ring the doorbell, bouncing happily on his feet until his grandmother opened the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicki!” She exclaimed, hugging him tight and lifting him slightly off the floor as far as her back allowed.
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora was a good grandma, Agatha would never deny that. She deeply cared for and loved Nicholas, calling him “her little miracle”. A miracle well planned in a conception clinic and cost about ten grand, but a miracle nonetheless, considering that Agatha was already thirty-five at that time.
    </p>
<p>
     The day that Agatha announced her pregnancy lingered in her mind, the glint of happiness in her mother’s eyes and the deception filling her voice as she said “
     <em>
      You could’ve got a real man for the job. Are you sincerely so incapable of being normal?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She had always wanted children, a dream that she gave up on very young when realizing that laying down with a man ranked first on her worst nightmares list and a dream that returned to her when she found
     <em>
      someone
     </em>
     that was willing to go all the way to form a family, to give a child the double of motherly love. But that someone went away, and Agatha found herself only getting older and decided to fulfill it on her own.
    </p>
<p>
     And what were the odds? She turned out to be a great mother who had been raising a great kid for the last eight years of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hello, mother.” She greeted, back hunched with hands in her pockets. Evanora's stare had the power to diminish her, make her feel smaller.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.” Her mom nodded, a stern tone. “And who is that?” Asked with an up and down look at Jen, who had just finished taking out the luggage from the trunk.
    </p>
<p>
     “She 's Jennifer. She's my friend”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen put down the luggage and fixed her pink dress. “Nice to finally meet you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew it was a lie.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Friend?”
     </em>
     Evanora scoffed. “Come on Nicki, let’s get inside.” She guided the boy through the threshold with a hand on his back, giving Agatha an over the shoulder look that spelled “
     <em>
      How dare you take this filth inside my home?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She had grown accustomed to hearing that.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen shoot her eyebrows up with a chuckle. “Woah, what a delight!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Isn’t she?” Agatha mocked, grabbing her own luggage. “Text me when you settle in, ok?”
    </p>
<p>
     The thing was, Jen really was just a friend. And a really good friend, who accepted the journey all the way from Massachusetts to New Jersey just so Agatha could have a familiar and
     <em>
      comforting
     </em>
     face nearby. Was no trouble since Jen had lived in EastView for a long time and still had many friends there, and that was something that Agatha didn't.
    </p>
<p>
     But Agatha was a good friend too, getting Jen a good hotel - if there was such a thing in WestView - just so that she wasn't obliged to carry the burden of being in Evanora's presence.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I'm out of here.” She circled the car and opened the door. “And, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stopped on her tracks and turned back. “Hum?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You
     <em>
      wish
     </em>
     you could handle all of this.” She gestured towards her own body, getting from Agatha a loud and much needed laugh before driving off.
    </p>
<p>
     She carried their things upstairs to the guest room and organized silently, trying to not catch her mother's attention while hearing the noise of Nicki putting up decorations downstairs. Agatha smiled at that, he was such a happy child and she wanted him to have as much fun as possible.
    </p>
<p>
     The loud stomp of sneakers up the stairs was heard. “Hey, mom!’’
    </p>
<p>
     “What have I said about running on stairs?” Agatha asked, authoritarian, while folding neatly one of his shirts as Nicki appeared on the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry,mom.” He said, his hair a mess and short of breath with bright red cheeks. “The twins next door invited me over. Can i go?” His hand joined in prayer.“Please,please,please,please,pleeeease.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha loves him so much.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course you can, sweety.” Chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you!” Nicholas ran out, this time down the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Be back before seven!” Agatha shouted, with no response. “Okay?” The entrance door slammed.
    </p>
<p>
     Ah, yes, the twins. Nicholas had been friends with them for quite some time, maybe ever since birth when she spent the whole of her postpartum stashed in that same room and the neighbor was with a giant pregnancy belly ready to explode. Wanda was funny and charismatic, maybe a bit controlling at times, but she and Agatha got along well.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha used to watch her and her loving husband taking care of the kids, Billy and Tommy, and even helped them on occasion, wishfully thinking about how sometimes she didn't want to be the strong single mother, how she craved someone to hold her at night and tell her everything would be fine. How it was always the same woman inhabiting those daydreams by her side.
    </p>
<p>
     When Jen finally texted her, Agatha was already sinking in bed after a long shower and ready to put her middle aged body to an afternoon nap.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Everything okay there?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      yes avoiding my mom at all costs
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Great!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Heading out to meet some friends, wanna come?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      no.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      seriously in need of a nap if i want to survive tomorrow night
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      🙄🙄
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      K grandma.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Even Lilia is coming.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      good for her!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She blocked her phone and tossed it aside, getting her nécessaire and organizing the items on the nightstand. A vanilla scented hand cream, the expensive natural deodorant that Jen produced for her, band-aids, emergency pads (not that she would be needing them for much longer), toothbrush and her dark purple bullet vibrator that she wasn't going to use. Even as a young woman she was scared of intimacy with herself in her own house, as if she could feel her mother's disapproval even when she was locked away in her room during the late hours of the night.
    </p>
<p>
     But you never know, right? And god knew that the little object runned by battery was the only thing that Agatha had other than her own hands in a
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     long time. The longest, actually.
    </p>
<p>
     Ever since
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     Agatha never had someone so constant in her life. The pool of women in Massachusetts who were interested in a long term relationship with a middle aged single mother wasn't very large, and the both girlfriends she managed to have since Nicholas was born got scared when things became to real, the first could not stand the constant crying of a 1 year old, and the other got irritated with how many “Why”s a 4 year old boy could ask within the span of two hours.
    </p>
<p>
     And Agatha considered herself too emotional to one-night stands, so she just tried telling herself that Nicholas was what mattered the most and he should be the main focus of her life. Who needed romance anyway?
    </p>
<p>
     When she woke up and checked her phone for the time, she leapt out of bed when she saw it was already eight p.m and ran down the stairs looking for any sign of Nicholas.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom?” Agatha called, finding the woman in the kitchen and seeing her for only the second time in the day.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,Agatha?” Always the harsh tone. Like Agatha wasn't deserving of speaking to her own mother.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is Nicki back? I asked him to come home by seven.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You worry too much.” Evanora replied, calmly sitting at the table. She would never agree with Agatha, even if it cost her grandson's safety. “I’m sure he’s fine. You suffocate him too much, maybe the poor boy just needed some time away from you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes and ran out of the house, going straight to her neighbor’s and knocking firmly on the door.
    </p>
<p>
     A redhead opened it and smiled when she saw her there, opening her arms. “Agatha! I was expecting you to visit!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, hello” She hugged Wanda quickly. “Is Nicholas here?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well he and the boys left some time ago to play outside, some of the kids around the block invited them.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed frustrated. “God, what year does this town live in, ninety eighty seven?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda just laughed, going inside and signaly with her head for Agatha to follow her. “WestView is a far cry from Boston, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, don't I know.” Agatha said, closing the door behind her as Wanda disappeared to the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “They do this almost every weekend.” She returned, with a bottle of wine and three glasses. “Settle in, I'm sure they will be home soon.”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda poured her a generous amount of good wine and sat on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure?” Agatha asked, reluctant but seduced by the ideia of sitting down with a friendly face and just relaxing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, of course! Now come here.” She patted the seat next to her. “Tell me everything! It has been so long.”
    </p>
<p>
     It had been a year and a half since her last visit and not much had changed in her life. She could not ignore the subtle pinch of jealousy at the pit of her stomach as she heard about Wanda’s happy life, how Vision was doing so well at his job, how the twins were getting along just fine and exceeding at school, how her and her husband took little two day vacations often so they could get alone time with each other.
    </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, Agatha’s occupation as a detective challenged her constantly to not soak up all the work and forget about herself and her son, never being able to fully complete house chores, while having to buy groceries and get Nicholas to school on time, pick him up and help with homework. All of this while trying to be a good and responsible mom, have quality time with her kid and supervise hangouts with a bunch of other eight year olds and have her
     <em>
      own
     </em>
     hangouts with friends. And just friends, there wasn't time for anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     “It's so exhausting sometimes.” Agatha confessed,face flushed from her third glass of wine.
    </p>
<p>
     “I get it.” Wanda said, putting her hand on top of hers. “It’s a lot around here too, you know? Maybe you should try dating again, someone nice who would raise Nicholas with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cackled.
    </p>
<p>
     “It's even more exhausting looking for
     <em>
      that.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda tapped her glass, thinking for a moment. “Since we're on the subject, there’s something I wanted to tell you…”
    </p>
<p>
     She was interrupted by a loud knock on the front door. “Oh! Vision must have forgotten his keys, my husband and his indestructible head”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed, taking another generous sip of her wine as Wanda rounded the sofa to get to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Kids! What happened!?” She jumped from the sofa at that, putting her glass on the center table and rushing off to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “I found this one by Ellis Avenue.” Agatha heard her before seeing her, unfortunately not fast enough to stop on her tracks and not appear dumbstruck and blushed behind Wanda and before her ex-girlfriend holding her son by the shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     Hazel eyes widened as they made note of Agatha, plush lips parting slightly with the shock of seeing her again
     <em>
      closely
     </em>
     after so many years.
    </p>
<p>
     “He got lost,Mom.” Billy said, unaware of what was happening, bless him. “We turned around and he wasn't there.”
    </p>
<p>
     That seemed to pull Agatha out of her stupor, pulling Nicholas gently by the arm with enough distance to not get close to
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     as her tan skinned hands slipped from his shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     “What happened, Nicki?” She asked, holding his face and checking it for any bruises. “Are you hurt? Did someone hurt you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, Mom.” Nicholas said and Agatha tried her best to ignore the sharp inhale coming from the woman at the door with the mention of that word. “I'm sorry! The ball went far and I tried to go after it, but I didn't know how to come back.” His eyes started to redden and fill with tears. “I'm sorry, please don't make me lose Halloween.” Nicki started to sob and hide his face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha clicked her tongue and hugged him, petting his hair. “It's okay, sweetheart, you won’t lose Halloween. It was just a mistake, everything is okay now.”
    </p>
<p>
     She tried telling this to her own heart, still racing from the thought of her sweet boy lost on a street of that godforsaken town, unable to locate himself and come back home.
    </p>
<p>
     “Boys…” Wanda started, firm but gentle. “You two were supposed to take care of Nicki.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We went after him as soon as he left, Mom.” Tommy explained. “We saw him coming back with this lady and she insisted on bringing us home.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted up her gaze, locking eyes with her for the first time after what felt like a lifetime. Her pupils were blown and shiny, heavy with a million words unsaid.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cleared her throat, aware of Wanda staring at them. “Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It's no problem, really.” Her tone was soft, Agatha felt like throwing up on Wanda's expensive carpet.
    </p>
<p>
     “I really appreciate it,
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     .” Wanda said. “For keeping our boys safe.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio Vidal. Agatha had been running away from that very name for a long time.
    </p>
<p>
     The redhead chimed in again as Rio and Agatha stood looking at each other, making no effort to move. “Why don't we wash up? Dinner has been ready for some time.” The kids ran inside, starving from the hours playing on the street.
    </p>
<p>
     “You too, Rio.” Agatha shoots an alarmed look at Wanda upon hearing the invite. “Let me thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio already felt the thick tension present between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think it's best if she goes home, Wanda.” Agatha said, avoiding looking at Rio's face. Her words stung.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio breathed deeply. She always was prone to confrontation, but her barriers were always unprepared for the force that was Agatha. “I should really get going. Like I said, it was no problem.”
    </p>
<p>
     When Wanda closed the door, Agatha couldn't hold herself a minute longer. “You knew? That she was back in town?”
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda nodded apologetically “I was about to tell you when she knocked.”
    </p>
<p>
     Great, that was everything that Agatha needed for that already cursed weekend. Under the same roof of her bitch of a mom while her ex was roaming the street outside.
    </p>
<p>
     Dinner went by in a flash as Agatha could not focus on much after the encounter, putting Nicki to bed was a struggle as he was so excited for Halloween on the following day and wanted to keep talking about it, but his mom's mind kept drifting back to
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     . Her and her raven hair, longer and straighter than the last time, her tan skin that seemed darker, like she was now living on a sunny place, her well fitted suit that seemed so out of place, like she was a business woman too good to waste her talents on fucking WestView.
    </p>
<p>
     She lay awake at her bed, staring at the ceiling while trying to fall asleep and thinking about how Rio looked the same as ten years ago, but at the same time looked like a completely different person. How she still managed to slip inside Agatha's chest and make home.

     On the following morning Nicholas was happy as if October 31st meant Christmas, jumping out of the bed before Agatha and rushing her during the day to finish the decorations, set up their candy station and give the final touches on his costume, unaware that his mother spent the hours in a almost trance with her own ex-girlfriend filled mind.
    </p>
<p>
     So unaware that by lunchtime, he brought her up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, who’s that lady who helped me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha froze in place on the sink, a dish mid-washing on her hand. She cleared her throat. “Um, yeah. We knew each other when I lived here.”
     <em>
      And you have her mouth
     </em>
     . “Her name is Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She's funny.” Nicky chuckled. “We passed Mrs.Hart lawn and Rio scared her with a fake spider.” He laughed, recalling the memory. It made Agatha smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, she's pretty funny. But what have I said about going with strangers?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, i said I wasn't going with her. But then she said i was very smart and that she knew my mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Nicky, anyone could say that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, but she said you feel tickles only on the left side.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gasped, knowing damn well how Rio used to use that for advantage and how Nicky found it curious.
    </p>
<p>
     He went on rambling about how she talked to him about plants and knew about all the flowers he pointed at on the way to find Billy and Tommy, how she was nice and made sure they were okay.
    </p>
<p>
     At every word, Agatha's heart seemed to get faster.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom, can I get ready?” He asked at only four p.m.
    </p>
<p>
     This year Nicky had asked for a simple costume and his mom assembled a white and cream set of knee-breeches and polo shirt paired with long fuzzy ears. At six-thirty Jen arrived to help with his face painting as Agatha's lack of talent for anything beyond lipstick and mascara was obvious. She did a nice base with pink nose and whiskers, completing his white rabbit costume.
    </p>
<p>
     At seven, Agatha was standing at the front door of the Maximoff’s house just as planned yesterday so Wanda and Vision could take the kids trick-or-treating through WestView’s calm streets.
    </p>
<p>
     The redhead greeted her in a red costume with a cape and tiara. “You look great, what are you supposed to be?”
    </p>
<p>
     She laughed, pointing at her own head and replying as if it was obvious “I’m a Sokovian fortune teller!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Got it, and your husband there?” Agatha questioned by seeing him getting the twins ready to leave, wearing a green set up with thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh.”
     </em>
     Wanda giggled and leaned closer to her. “I have a thing for mexican wrestlers.”
    </p>
<p>
     God, that was adorable, Agatha wanted to kill them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nicki, behave! Don't wander off and keep close to them at all times.” She instructed as the family gathered on the porch, Billy dressed as some kind of wizard that resembled his mothers costume and Tommy with a blue shirt and hairstyle that made him the closest thing to a velocist superhero.
    </p>
<p>
     “You got it mom!” He exclaimed, already running with the boys.
    </p>
<p>
     “We will take good care of them.” Vision said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Go home and relax for the night, Agatha. I promise you he will be safe.” Wanda tranquilized.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha went back to her mother's house with a lighter heart, especially considering that Evanora wasn't anywhere to be seen and Jen’s presence graces her.
    </p>
<p>
     She found her friend going through her old closet, picking at all of her black clothes. “Jen! What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Trying to find something nice for you to wear tonight” And Agatha understood what she was trying to say.
    </p>
<p>
     She laughed, making her way to her bed and sitting. “You’re terribly wrong if you think I will move a muscle to get out of this house tonight.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen laughed right back at her. “Agatha, you
     <em>
      will
     </em>
     get out of this house tonight. It's Halloween! Don't you want a night off with friends?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You're my friend and this is a night off.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen rolled her eyes, pulling an old black dress from one of the drawers. “Wow, that's a smoke show. Put this on.”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     should have been given to goodwill years ago.” Agatha pulled her feet up, reclining on the pillows. “It's not like I will be going out with it anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her friend exhaled, sitting on the bed with the dress on her lap. “Agatha. I don't even remember the last time we went out. All you think about is work, and Nicki, and how your work is affecting Nicki. Can’t you spare your friend a night out with her? Grab a few drinks?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed, defeated as she snatched the black fabric from her hands. “
     <em>
      Just
     </em>
     a few drinks, and
     <em>
      i
     </em>
     will be home by midnight.”
    </p>
<p>
     She walked away to change as Jen clapped in cheering in the other room.
    </p>
<p>
     Not even two hours later and they were walking in on a dim lit bar on EastView border, decorated with Halloween elements and jack-o-lanterns. Jen with a mad scientist-esque costume and Agatha with a stupidly small witch hat that her friend made her wear. The famous Alice and Lilia arrived shortly, and Agatha decided to give them a chance, realizing that both were much more fun then she originally thought.
    </p>
<p>
     Her night was going great until she scanned the room casually while waiting for her drink at the bar and saw
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     a few tables down, chatting with friends and laughing. Agatha could hear her laugh and something stirred inside her by the sound of it.
    </p>
<p>
     The thing was, Rio looked great. She was dressed in all black with a simple flowy cape, something fitting and casual for the occasion. Agatha felt hot all over.
    </p>
<p>
     Then she decided to do what was best, ignore her presence.
    </p>
<p>
     Until Jen ruined it at some point of the night. “Agatha? Isn't that your ex?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice and Lilia went into an uproar by this, asking who it was and where she was.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, she's beautiful.” Alice said after Jen pointed subtly at Rio. “Kind of intimidating too”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right?” Jen laughed. “Wait, Nicky kind of looks like-”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned, annoyed. “Can we
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     talk about my ex-girlfriend?”
    </p>
<p>
     The three of them exchanged meaningful glances that only annoyed her more.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia chuckled. “I’ll say, are you jealous, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at her, wheels on her brain going off to try and find the better course of action. She laughed. “No! Of course not!”
    </p>
<p>
     Fortunately they changed the conversation path as the bar began to get even more stuffed. Agatha started to feel it was too much for her middle aged body to be around so many college kids for so long, she decided to take a breath outside.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     *
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped outside on the chilly night and the first thing that she saw was Rio, sitting alone on a bench a few meters from the bars’ front door.
    </p>
<p>
     Her feet started walking without her commanding them to, but Rio had made a really nice act yesterday, hasn't she? And Agatha hadn't been very nice to her. Maybe she could apologize, thank her again and then leave.
    </p>
<p>
     Each step led her closer to Rio, sitting and blowing smoke into the night while holding a cigarette between her long fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi.” Agatha made her presence known and startled Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her with eyes changing to a slight shade of red, not very happy. “Hi.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled awkwardly and sat beside her on the bench with a good distance. “I wanted to thank you, you know, for yesterday. I can't even think about what would happen if…”
    </p>
<p>
     “It's okay, Agatha, really.” Rio's voice saying her name again almost dragged all of the air out of her lungs. “How is he?”
    </p>
<p>
     “He's okay.” She sighed. “More worried about trick or treating than anything else.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed and Agatha's heart compressed. “Nicholas is a nice kid. We talked all the way home, he's very smart.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio always knew that Agatha had a son, news ran faster than bullets on smalltowns. She remembered everything, how her mother told her that Agatha was pregnant and the thought of the woman she still loved and held so close to her heart was going to achieve their dream, stomach turning with all of the what if’s - What if her job wasn't more important than us? What if I had just stayed quiet about it? Would he be my baby too?
    </p>
<p>
     The first time she saw him a few years ago from a distance in the local grocery shop with Agatha, she didn't dare to approach, but she noticed how much he looked like his mother and a small voice in the back of her head dared to hurt her even more by whispering. “
     <em>
      He looks like you too.”
     </em>
     As if his birth was a miracle of nature or simply destiny toying with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “He told me.” Agatha said. “He likes you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn't bear to look at her so she turned her face to the other side and dragged.
    </p>
<p>
     The charged silence soon became too much for Agatha. “I'm sorry. About the way I acted yesterday. I wasn't expecting to see you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her as if she had said something absurd, a half smile appearing. “Recognizing your mistake, are you? Agatha Harkness, how you have changed.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was torned between being offended or prideful, she was out of words for both situations.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I got pretty upset with the way you talked to me.” Rio confessed. “I forgive, it's whatever, really.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scoffed in a playful way. “Admitting to being hurt? I'm not the only one who changed, am i?”
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio laughed and stared at her a question bloomed on their minds, the same one that appeared on random moments of needing affection, or when they found old pictures, even when they bumped into each other's relatives on the street. Why did it end?
    </p>
<p>
     The answer was so simple and at the same time so complex.
    </p>
<p>
     They had met in the local college, a place that gave them both a little more freedom to be themselves than the streets of WestView. Agatha was studying criminology and Rio was a brilliant biology student. A forensic science’s congress later and the rest is story.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been 7 years of bliss, understanding and trust, with bumps and fights here and there that were expected by any couple who consisted of two different human beings. Keeping each other close and safe despite her mother's hatred and small town talks, finding at least some kind of acceptance from Rio's family.
    </p>
<p>
     Until everything started to crumble and pet peeves suddenly became fatal mistakes, time spent more apart than together because of work and studies, days and nights of passion becoming dry conversations on the phone, plans about getting the hell out of town and starting a family being pushed aside and gathering dust.
    </p>
<p>
     The final blow came when Agatha was offered her big promotion and accepted it without even thinking twice, in the heat of the moment not remembering the woman she wished to make her wife. And that broke Rio's vow of keeping her feelings bottled up and not picking fights beyond her usual bratty behavior to support Agatha on her jouney.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha left, Rio didn't ask her to stay.
    </p>
<p>
     “How have you been?” Agatha asked surprised with how much curiosity she put on the question.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio seemed even more surprised. “Ah,you know, work and stuff. It's good, i’m mostly surrounded by plants all the time. ” She smiled shyly.
    </p>
<p>
     It was so strange, feeling so distant from the woman who used to be her best friend, her confidant,
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     woman.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kept staring at the floor for a few seconds, until Rio broke the silence again. “I kind of get it now. The work. It can be a lot.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It's still a lot.” Agatha chuckled dryly, full of regrets.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’s Nicki in all of this?”
     <em>
      Nicki
     </em>
     , not Nicholas or simply “he”, as if he was a part of her life too.
    </p>
<p>
     “I do my best.” It’s what Agatha could say. “But it's hard sometimes, doing all of it alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't expect to let Rio know about her loneliness so naturally, give her the upperhand like that.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can't even imagine it.” Rio simply replied. “I live on my own and it's already hard enough.”
    </p>
<p>
     Well, that surely wasn't what Agatha expected. She calculated the next steps in her head, what to say and how.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her the mercy of not needing to step forward. “It’s been two difficult years.”
    </p>
<p>
     She tried glancing slowly at Rio, only to find her hazel eyes  already staring her dead in the eyes. Subtlety was never her forte.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked away quickly. “You think that's difficult? Try four.”
    </p>
<p>
     The words hung in the air. Was it an invitation? A means of reaching out to each other? Saying “I’m still here, and I never forgot you.”  Saying ''I've never found someone who understands me like you, whom i can be myself with.''
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood up. “Do you wanna….?” She gestured to the bar entrance with her head, Agatha only nodded and followed after her, thinking how ridiculous she must look having a conversation with her ex while wearing a costume.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could feel the inquisitive looks from Jen and her friends in her direction when she stepped in on Rio's tail. The bar lights were low and the smell of sweat and smoke already started to cloud the place.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     ?” Goosebumps ran up her arms with Rio's whisper in her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hm?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Come dance with me.” She only realized it wasn't really a question when Rio grabbed her by the waist leading her to the dancefloor.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio held her by the shoulders in a familiar motion and Agatha's hands instinctively found her waist, holding her with both arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who are you supposed to be?” She asked Rio in a low voice.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled. “I’m death.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha arched her browns, gathering Rio closer in her arms. “Yeah? Guess you always had an inclination to the morbid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it? Morbid? I don't think so.” Her fingers grabbed a lock of Agatha's long hair and twisted it between them. “It's the natural order of all things, baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     One song merged into the other and none of the women seemed prone to step away from each other, speaking softly about how life had been all this time, falling so easily back into conversation patterns they knew so well, so comfortably. Secretly, Agatha longed to bump into her all those times she had been to WestView again, unsuccessfully. Now, she was back in town to enjoy some time of her vacation with family and Agatha, for the first time, wished she had planned to spend more time in WestView.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, guess I haven't been totally honest with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha furrowed her brows at her, slowing the pace of their swaying.
    </p>
<p>
     “My mom told me a few days ago you were gonna be back here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked deeply into her eyes. “Maybe, just maybe, our meetings weren't an accident.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha untangled from her, immediately missing the warmth. “What are you trying to say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “When I found Nicky yesterday, I was already on my way to your house.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a half smile, not deluding herself to jump into conclusion. She took Rio's hands between her own and brought them to her waist, getting closer. “
     <em>
      Why?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s breath shook. “Cause I'm done being a coward and pretending I wouldn't like to try again.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was insane. After all their story, all the misfortunes, setbacks and fights. It had been almost ten years, for god's sake! Almost ten years of watching each other from afar, of spending hours on the other's social media taking caution to not accidentally like a photo, of feeling that
     <em>
      somethi
     </em>
     ng was missing in all that came after.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been told before, of course she had, how much Nicholas looked like her ex. If anyone didn't know better, they would think that Nicholas was
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     son.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe that was destiny’s way to rub it in her face exactly what she needed.
    </p>
<p>
     The most insane thing was; Agatha did want to try again.
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn't help it. For so long, she didn't want to love or care for Rio anymore. But
     <em>
      she couldn't help it
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     That's why she took Rio's face in her hand and kissed her. In a gentle and slow way, feeling again how their mouths fitted together, the softness of those lips between her, the taste of Rio on the tip of her tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     They parted and Rio whispered to her a secret, the same one she used to all those years ago. “My mom is not home.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     *
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn't help but laugh remembering how the three women at her table looked at them when she stopped by quickly to get her bag, introduce Rio and say her goodbyes in only one breath. Glances and malicious smiles like they
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     Agatha was about to get the fuck of a lifetime.
    </p>
<p>
     Her laugh reverberated in Rio's ears as she was hugged from behind by Agatha, fumbling desperately with her keys to open the house’s door and not finish the night right there on the porch. She laughed too, just because she felt like it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed the door behind them and reclined lightly against it feeling how heavy the air became in that moment, with Agatha eyes looking at her in
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     way, like she could undress her right there with just the power of her mind. Maybe she could.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha threw her bag on the floor and approached slowly like a hunter who wouldn't dare to miss its prey, standing in front of Rio and slowly, gently trailing her hands with featherlight touch through Rio’s arms leaving goosebumps in its wake. Her fingertips reached the other's cheeks on both sides, Agatha finally gave in and leaned in.
    </p>
<p>
     Their noses bumped as their lips met in a sweet and familiar way, Agatha moved her lips slowly and felt Rio's slender fingers closing around her wrists.
    </p>
<p>
     As she parted from her and stared right into Rio’s eyes heavy with desire and yearning, her defenses crumbled to let out in a whisper  the sentence never dared to be spoken. “I missed you.”
    </p>
<p>
     A flicker went through Rio's hazels. “Do something about it, then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha threw herself at her, holding her face and pulling her deeper into the kiss, Rio held her with both arms in closeness capable of merging them into one. Neither of them knew who moaned first when Agatha's tongue invaded Rio's mouth and lapped at her’s like a starving woman, making Rio lose balance and collide against the door with Agatha's body pressing into her.
    </p>
<p>
     She clung to Rio's back, opening the other woman’s legs to slot her knee in between them. Rio moaned loudly and arched her back by feeling the strong and sudden pressure on her desperate for contact cunt, gripping Agatha's hair from the scalp and knocking out the stupid witch hat to the floor, trying to devour her mouth as Agatha groped her ass in a way that would leave the mark of her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Ah.”
     </em>
     Rio gasped when Agatha latched her lips suddenly on her exposed neck, pulling her head back by the hair just so.
    </p>
<p>
     They knew each other's tells and precise points, everything felt so easy and natural.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on.” She urged Agatha and pulled her by the hand to the bedroom down the hall, murmuring nonsense when her woman constantly and inevitably claimed her lips against the corridor’s walls, expert hands pulling her shirt down the shoulders by the neckline and punishing the left one with a gentle bite.  “
     <em>
      Agatha.
     </em>
     ” The sigh as a request for her to finally enter the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed at her desperation and entered it slowly, stepping down her heels and kicking them to the corner. She immediately felt Rio's anxious hands grabbing at the zipper on the back and pulling it down in a swift motion before Agatha could even protest. The dress pooled around her on the floor and Rio’s front bumped on her back, Agatha allowed herself to throw her head back on Rio's shoulder, enjoying her wet open mouthed kisses on her neck as warm hands grabbed at her boobs.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped back taking off her own shirt, but Agatha pulled at her belt hoops and threw her on the bed before she could fully complete the task. Rio’s laugh was muffled by Agatha's lips against hers while the other pulled at the clothing and threw it across the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Her pants were also gone in a hurry, Agatha kissed the path of her legs as it was revealed and Rio stared at the ceiling asking herself how they got here.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.” Agatha called her back to reality, hovering on top of her and caressing her face. “Everything okay there, my love?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      My love
     </em>
     . How she missed that.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded with a smile, looking deep into Agatha's eyes - who smiled back at her. The heat on their lower bellies accentuated by the feeling they tried to keep away for too long, the memories of the many nights they spent exactly like this resurfacing. She brushed back the strands of Agatha's long hair and kissed her some more in a tight embrace that compressed their chests together, Agatha moaning in her mouth with the scratch of her lace bra against her naked nipples.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do you want it, baby?” Rio asked with their mouths so close that Agatha could feel the movement of every syllable.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked at her and lowered her body, hooking her fingers on each side of Rio's panties and pulling it down her pretty legs. Rio adjusted herself half sitting against the headboard breathlessly remembering how much Agatha
     <em>
      loved
     </em>
     to eat her out, how she delighted in the feeling of her head being compressed by her lover’s thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, she also remembered how Agatha loved torturing her for a bit first. She spent her time kissing up her legs everywhere she could find, mouth sucking on the inside of Rio's thighs and getting soft moans out of her, nosing the edges of her labia until finally, after all those years, she put her eager mouth on Rio. Agatha made a mess out of her, anchored on her thighs like they were a lifeboat, tongue lapping at her pussy from entrance to clit, where she sucked hard with her lips making an obscene noise that mixed with Rio's moans and curses. Agatha lifted her blue eyes to meet hers just as her tongue dived inside Rio, her hand jumping at the other woman's hair and holding her there, grinding her hips and her warm cunt against her face in a frantic motion, practically screaming when she felt Agatha's nose bumping repeatedly against her clitoris. Agatha pushed her back with a hand on her womb and brushed her nose in circles against that swollen spot along with her tongue and Rio couldn't even articulate a single thought anymore, she could only say uncontrollable and intangible things, swearing that if she closed her eyes she could see stars. When Agatha slid her hand up and held Rio's neck in a strong grip, it was over.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha!” She screamed, smashing her head by the hair against her center and cumming so hard that her hips shot up. The sweet and electric feeling begins on the pit of her stomach and extends through her body like vines, tensioning all of her and relaxing at the same measure, enhanced by the lack of oxygen that her love’s hand provided. Agatha detached her mouth as Rio came down her high, tingles on her spine and breathing heavily like she was the one with the aching jaw and shortness of air by spending long minutes with her face shoved down a pussy. No, that was Agatha, and she appreciated every single one of those minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     She kneeled on the bed and analyzed her work on Rio, open legs evidencing the pink folds of her wet with her own liquids and Agatha's spit, knees trembling slightly, the straps of her bra falling from her shoulders and showing one of her boobs, disheveled hair and flushed face. She always was in awe of her potential to reduce Rio to a whimpering mess, a brief spark of jealousy went through her by the thought of how many women had achieved that after her but she quickly felt ridiculous about it because she was in her forties and Rio was looking at her as if she was the first woman to land on the moon.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pushed her to fall with her back on the bed and quickly mounted on her stomach to take a better look at Agatha, noticing then that the room was only being lit by the corridor light passing through the door. Agatha held her wrist when she reached for the bedside lampshade.
    </p>
<p>
     When she was about to ask what was the matter, Agatha already answered her. ‘’I’m not….like i used to be.’’ Rio seemed confused so she kept going. ‘’I’m already past forty, toots, and a few years of breastfeeding on my back.
    </p>
<p>
     ‘’Yeah, i know.’’ She said it like it was obvious,dragging a finger along the valley between her breasts. ‘’That makes you even hotter,m’lady.’’
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled until she looked at Rio’s face and found her looking back with reverence in her eyes, mouthing a quiet ‘’
     <em>
      Please’’.
     </em>
     And Agatha did the only thing she could think of, she said yes.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned on the yellow light and exhaled with the sight of Agatha's body like the vision itself was enough to get her going again, she ran her hand through her torso, her shoulders, her arms, the big scar she had on the left elbow after a knitting accident, roaming to her boobs and squeezing the soft flesh with just a slightly mean pinch on her pink nipples, appreciating the difference from the last time they were in this position.
    </p>
<p>
     She adjusted herself to be next to Agatha and half on top of her, her leg between both of Agatha's to keep them open as she slipped her hand along the woman's soft stomach and the white stretch marks on it.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      God.
     </em>
     ” Rio whispered against her neck with a kiss, not sure if she was calling for high above or for the woman under her. “
     <em>
      You’re so beautiful,my love.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha moaned, overwhelmed,
     <em>
      feeling
     </em>
     the last piece of fabric on her get wetter, her hands opening the black bra’s clasp. “I want to see you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio parted from her just enough to take it off and came back hungry, taking Agatha's left boob on her mouth and sucking on it while her fingers entered her panty and found the swollen and rigid clit.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held her by the arm and hair, panting her name and moaning religiously in her ear as Rio's mouth refused to leave her boobs and fingers worked in slow and hard circles on her clit, gathering wet from her entrance to help. The reality of how much touch starved she had been and how much she missed Rio’s touch started to weigh when she felt her climax approaching quickly, trying to hold it back.
    </p>
<p>
     But again, Rio knew all of her tells. “Come, baby, let me make you come.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was delirious, she gripped Rio's head and pulled her in for a open mouthed kiss, short nails digging on the taunt skin of her back as her orgasm took hold of her, hips rolling on her fingers uncontrollably and words she didn't even understand coming out of her mouth. Something along the lines of how good Rio was, how good she felt.
    </p>
<p>
     They laid back panting for a moment, Rio's wet fingers resting against her hip as her mouth peppered kisses on her exposed shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think we ruined my duvet.” She said, what made them laugh. That type of intimacy you don't have with one night stands and flings.
    </p>
<p>
     They kicked it down to the floor and got under the sheets, Rio layed on her stomach and threw one arm at Agatha, who promptly hugged it and scratched it lightly in a display of affection. This close, she could distinguish all the colors in Rio's eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can't believe we just did that.” Agatha laughed, covering her face with one hand in the adorable way she did when embarrassed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her shoulder. “Did we get better at this?”
    </p>
<p>
     She laughed louder, nodding. “I didn't think it was possible, but we did.”
    </p>
<p>
     The other beamed at her, caressing her face. “I missed you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     They spoke in whispers to each other again, feeling anxious to know everything about all those years they managed to lose together.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve been wanting to move for a while now.” Rio confessed. “New York is great but it's too stuffy, I just don't want my mom to think I'm abandoning her by moving further.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Come back to Boston with us!”
     </em>
     Agatha's mind screamed and pushed the words until the seams of her mouth. She refused to rush this even more, there are only so many lesbian cliches one can do in one night and Agatha had already passed the limit.
    </p>
<p>
     “I heard Massachusetts is great this time of year.” She was content to say, even more content with the smile that it got from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't know how but Rio managed to sneak up on her again and when she realized, she was being kissed slowly and dirty for quite some time, one hand in her hair and the other pulling her panties down. The weird thing was, her legs instinctively kicked up to get rid of the fabric faster. Witchcraft, really, what Rio did to her.
    </p>
<p>
     She soon found herself on top of Rio while kissing as if the whole time of the world was theirs, until it became quicker and sloppier as the throbbing on both their cunts became impossible to ignore.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, I have something for you.” Rio said, pushing her off and walking over to her closet in all of her naked glory.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched propped on her elbows in the bed as Rio pulled from the top drawer a black harness coupled with a purple simple dildo. She laughed, throwing her head back. “I'm not letting you use that on me, hot stuff. God knows how many skanks were on the other end.”
    </p>
<p>
     She was being petty, of course, they had always been the jealous type and Agatha wasn't going down without teasing her first.
    </p>
<p>
     “For your information.” Rio said, sitting on her thigh and throwing the strap on the bed, leaning in for a light kiss. “I got it yesterday when I saw that you were back in town, in that little sketchy place just out of WestView we used to love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shot her eyebrows up, impressed with how sure Rio was that they would end up in this exact situation. “You're such a self centered bitch.”  She said, affectionately, holding Rio's chin.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was being hopeful. And I was wrong?”
    </p>
<p>
     She shut Rio up with a kiss accommodating her body between her legs and lying down again on the bed, pulling Rio to be completely on top. Rio put on the strap in a hurry with a little help and distraction from Agatha who couldn't keep her hands off her.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, she supported herself on top of Agatha, hooking one of her legs on her waist to have better access and aligned the purple silicone with her moist and expecting entrance. Agatha pressed her heel on Rio's butt to help the push and whimpered with the slow intrusion, it had been too long with only her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio fucked her slow and hard, pulling almost all out and going back with a snap, kissing eachother on the lips, cheeks and necks, grabbing at everything they could reach while also caressing eachother's hair between moans and sighs. The silicone base gave a much welcome friction on her clit, and just a bit of speeding up was enough to send her tumbling over the edge again, Agatha watching amused as her woman came for the second time on the night.
    </p>
<p>
     She was sweaty, trembling on top of Agatha and hypersensitive. But she would be damned if she didn't make her lady come again, so she kept going.
    </p>
<p>
     That was until Agatha pushed her and, without disconnecting them, got on top. “You’ve been so good. Let me work my magic now.”
    </p>
<p>
     The new position relieved Rio from the continuous friction and made Agatha take the dildo even deeper. She supported herself on Rio’s breast plate as the other squeezed her waist to help her ride. She rode the strap with quick motions of her hips, so deep she could feel her buttcheecks grinding against Rio's thighs, who angled her hips slightly and pressed on the sensitive spot inside.
    </p>
<p>
     The vision of Agatha throwing her head back with furrowed brows and mouth slack in staccato moans as she orgasmed again made Rio's still sensitive pussy twinge.
    </p>
<p>
     She rested still mounted on Rio for a few seconds feeling the tremor on her legs and lungs exhausted. Hissing as she pulled out and fell at Rio's side on the bed, helping her to get out of the harness and getting under the covers again.
    </p>
<p>
     “God, I need some water.” Rio laughed, giving Agatha a quick kiss and standing up on shaking legs. She snatched one shirt from her armchair and threw over her body, getting out of the room and leaving Agatha there worned out and incapable of articulating a single thought.
    </p>
<p>
     She came back almost limping, with a big water bottle in one hand and Agatha's phone on the other, handing it to her. “Someone was calling you, babe”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat on the bed and winced with the discomfort on her hips now that her blood was cold, reading the name “
     <em>
      Wanda
     </em>
     ” on the display along with seventeen missed calls. Not weird, considering it was already 1 a.m and Wanda was supposed to drop Nicholas home at eleven.
    </p>
<p>
     She called the redhead back, hearing how worried she was. “Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. I'm sorry. I went out a few hours ago with Jen to a bar. Didn't plan to stay out this long.” A smile played on her lips as she looked at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Wanda paused for a bit.
     <em>
      “Oh, okay. I didn't know what to do so i let Nicky sleepover with the boys. Is it fine with you?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Um,yeah, okay. Totally fine. Thank you.” Rio stared at her, amused with her flushed face and a mess of a hair. “I’ll pass by tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “Okay, good night Agatha.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Good night.” She was about to hang up when she heard Wanda's voice calling her name again. “Yeah?”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “And tell Rio i said hi.”
     </em>
     She had the audacity of laughing before ending the call.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did she know?” Agatha asked, confused.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio denied with her head. “I think she just figured.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha drank the other half of the bottle in a chug, hydrating her dry mouth and throat, not realizing before how thirsty she had been. “Told you, i’m old now.” She said, as Rio wasn't only six years younger.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio got under the sheets with her again, holding Agatha and keeping her close.
    </p>
<p>
     “When can I meet Nicki, properly?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Come pick him up tomorrow with me, i’m sure he will love it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, and Agatha couldn't hold back just one more cliche for the night. Knowing that there was still so much they needed to talk about and figure it out, but feeling deeply that everything would fall into place.
    </p>
<p>
     “He will love to have you as his other mom.”
