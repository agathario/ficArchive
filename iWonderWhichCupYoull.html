<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“And where would I do that, moron?”</p><p>“I don’t know!” Rio flounders, “In the shower?”</p><p>“You think getting myself off quietly in the shower, in the room next to your bedroom, having to be quick so the hot water doesn’t run out… is conducive to good orgasms?”</p><p>Well, when she puts it like that.</p><p>OR</p><p>Rio and Agatha aren’t friends. They’ll probably never be friends—they’re just wired that way. But that doesn’t stop their mutual friends from suggesting Agatha live with Rio while her divorce finalizes. If it sounds like a recipe for disaster, it probably is.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s times like these when Rio wishes she weren’t single.</p><p>Because out of all her friends, of course she’s the one who got talked into (read: agreeing the first time she was asked) helping Agatha Harkness out of a bind.</p><p>(“I mean,” Agatha runs a hand through her messy hair, fingers getting stuck part way through and she grimaces as she untangles herself, “I thought we’d sorted everything out already. It’s a no-fault divorce, how hard can it be?”</p><p>She signals the bartender; he doesn’t even need to be told anymore, she’s been ordering the same round for the group since she slid, late, into their regular booth at The Witches’ Road—a single whisky, neat, and a bottle of beer each for herself, Rio, and Alice, and a bottle of Syrah for Jen, Lilia, and Wanda. Rio can feel her liver protesting it already but she’s always set to match Agatha beat for beat.</p><p>“She's not even fighting me for custody of our son.”</p><p>“You might wanna keep that down before she catches wind and changes her mind,” Rio huffs a laugh, “Before you know it it’ll be bye bye bunny.”</p><p>Agatha glares at her from her corner—it’s always the same no matter where they are. Their other friends place themselves between the two of them so that they’re as separated as can be—a precaution so that the night doesn’t end in bloodshed.</p><p>It’s no secret that Rio and Agatha don’t get along, never have in the whole ten years they’ve known each other. They bite at each other's words, snipe at each other’s actions.</p><p>“You know, you could at least pretend you’d be upset if she took my boy away.”</p><p>“I really wish you'd stop referring to that rabbit as your son,” Rio slides her still unfinished beer bottle across the wood of the table, watches the condensation drag across the surface, “Anyway, it’s a mutual dislike. I respect Scratch and he respects me, but we don’t have to like each other.”</p><p>“Aw, just like you guys.” Jen rests her head in a palm and bats her eyelids, first at Agatha and then at Rio. Rio schools her face into something resembling neutrality when she sees Agatha grimace.</p><p>“Bold of you to assume I even <em> respect </em>Rio.”</p><p>“Feeling’s mutual, Harkness.”</p><p>“So you respect her rabbit but not her?” The look on Alice’s face tells Rio she’s crazy but she doesn’t feel it.</p><p>“Which is <em> insane </em> by the way,” Agatha leans in front of Alice to punctuate her words, “What reason would you have not to like him?”</p><p>Rio balks at the insinuation, “What reason would <em> he </em> have not to like <em> me </em> ? <em> That’s </em>what’s insane, actually, that you vet all your friends via animal.” She can’t believe she’s getting this worked up about a rabbit—this is kind of embarrassing.</p><p>“Scratchy’s a very good judge of character,” In their frustration, both women have been squashing closer and closer together, friends packed in like sardines, “And he’s much, much cuter than you. Easier to listen to him.”</p><p>They’re close enough to touch each other—Rio knows because Agatha reaches out and boops her nose, the amount of alcohol she’s already put back means she taps just the right side of it. Rio scrunches her nose, has to nudge the left side with her knuckle to even herself out. What a rude thing to say, anyway. She’s very cute.</p><p>She’s lucky Wanda’s there to reroute them, “I don’t understand why she’s changed her mind. Didn’t you guys draw up the agreement weeks ago?”</p><p>Agatha barely lets the bartender place her drinks in front of her before she’s throwing back the whisky. Rio watches as a small trickle misses her mouth, watches it run from the corner of her lips, to her chin, before dropping off into the abyss.</p><p>Agatha huffs at her question, “So did I. Oh no, <em> now </em> her fucking lawyer’s come back with <em> new </em> terms,” Her eyes are glassy; she grabs at her beer bottle, “Where does she get off wanting the fucking house? It’s <em> my </em>house.”</p><p>“Well, you’re gonna refuse the terms, right?”</p><p>Agatha clicks her tongue, “Meh, it’s kinda tainted anyway. I mean who wants to live in their dead mother’s house forever? Kinda tempted to let her keep it.”</p><p>“What the fuck, Agatha, you’re gonna, what? Let her win?” Alice has a hand on Agatha’s shoulder, forcing her to look into her eyes.</p><p>“It’s maybe not as big a win as you’d think. Or she’d think,” Agatha smirks at her, “If she'd bothered to talk to me civilly, she'd know there's mould in one of the spare bedrooms, damp in the kitchen, and it's slowly but surely starting to subside.”</p><p>Of course. Agatha never misses a trick.</p><p>Rio pushes her tongue into her cheek, closes her eyes so Agatha can’t see she’s maybe <em> mildly, </em>a little bit impressed.</p><p>“I, uh,” Agatha uncharacteristically clears her throat, brings a long finger up to wipe away imaginary sleep from the corner of her eye—probably so she doesn’t have to look at any of them when she says, “I may have had some ulterior motives when I asked you all to meet me tonight.”</p><p>Jen faux gasps, “You? Never.”</p><p>“So let's say I agree to the terms. Give her the house,” Agatha waves a hand around as she speaks, a distraction tactic well worn by her over the years, “She wants me to put my money where my fucking mouth is and get gone before she signs anything.”</p><p>Rio is past the point of pretending not to find this interesting—Agatha Harkness’ life crumbling down around her, but she’s not exactly following. <em> Should </em> she be following?</p><p>It seems no one else is either, so Agatha huffs and elaborates, “I don’t have that kind of cash just sitting around to buy a whole house with. Not until I get my share after the divorce.”</p><p>“No one is helping you rob a bank, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha purses her lips. Rio can see the cogs turning in her head, sees Jen give her a pointed look from next to her.</p><p>“Well, we can come back to that. But I was <em> going </em>to ask if maybe,” It’s like Agatha built herself up to say it—to jump off the slope but instead lets herself just drop over the edge underwhelmingly, mumbling something.</p><p>Rio’s losing her patience, “Agatha, if you’re going to ask, you kind of need to <em> ask. </em>”</p><p>Agatha sneers, “I’m not even asking <em> you </em>, you’re just furniture at this point. But for… everyone else,” She buries her head in her hands, stares at her empty tumbler, speaks low and evenly measured through gritted teeth, “Will someone put me up for a couple of weeks while this goes through?”</p><p>Oh, well this is just <em> too </em>good. How the mighty have fallen indeed.</p><p>Rio has to hold back a laugh as she watches this unfold.</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda starts, reaches out and touches Agatha’s arm from her seat opposite, “You know I would but I have two sixteen year old boys in the house, and Vision works from home,” Rio can practically hear Wanda wincing through her words, “There’s not really enough space.”</p><p>“Speaking of kids, we have a very demanding child,” Jen says, strokes Alice’s arm over the table, “And that’s <em> without </em>you living with us.”</p><p>“And you don’t even like kids. I don’t think you living with our screaming baby will be good for anyone.” Agatha avoids looking at Alice as she speaks.</p><p>Lucy’s a cute kid but she <em> is </em>teething at the moment.</p><p>And that’s when Lilia, quietly observing Lilia, chooses to speak up, “Rio’s single,” Every head around the table whips round to look at her, “Why doesn’t Agatha move in with her?”</p><p>The idea must bring them all a lot of amusement because it’s only moments later that Rio, sulking in her seat, is watching Jen wipe away <em> actual </em>tears, clutching on to Wanda, who stifles her laughter into her hand.</p><p>Agatha looks just about as offended as Rio feels.</p><p>“Oh, that’s <em> amazing, </em>” Jen says once she’s collected herself enough to talk again, “It’s perfect.”</p><p>“My heel in your eye would be perfect.” Agatha grumbles.</p><p>“Well, do you have anyone else to ask?”</p><p>“Lilia’s single!” Agatha lurches across Alice who has to steady all the glasses that threaten to be taken with her, “Lilia, tell me one good reason I can’t move in with you.”</p><p>Lilia’s responding chuckle is of polite amusement and she takes a sip of her wine, “Honey, I have a much more active sex life than Rio and I am <em> not </em>putting that on hold for you.”</p><p>Which, okay, Rio would love at this point to chip in with a rebuttal but as she opens her mouth she realizes it’s been months since she’s had sex—closer to double digits than she’d like.</p><p>“I live in a teenie, tiny apartment. You guys realize that, right?” Is how she responds instead, because there’s no way in hell Agatha Harkness is choosing to stay on her sofa.</p><p>“Great,” Agatha throws her hands up, “So none of my friends are willing to help me in my time of need. I’ll remember that.” She downs Alice’s whisky, massages her temple.</p><p>“I’m pretty sure you referred to me as <em> furniture </em> a minute ago.”</p><p>Agatha waves a hand, “Desperate times.”</p><p>“You can’t bring every material good you own. I’m not having my home turn into a museum.”</p><p>“I’m not <em> broke, </em>Rio. I can afford a storage unit.” Agatha huffs, fully looks at Rio then, blue eyes softened beyond what Rio can ever remember seeing—a freshwater lake rather than the thrashing sea, “Are you saying yes?”)</p><p>That was three weeks ago.</p><p>Why she agreed to house a woman she actively tries to avoid a lot of the time, a woman she’s on the very outskirts of a base friendship with, she’ll never know.</p><p>Maybe she’ll rack up enough ‘good deed’ points just within this one act to never have to be nice to Agatha for the sake of their friends ever again.</p><p>Now though, she has the absolute joy of hauling two colossal suitcases up to her fourth floor apartment because the landlord ‘just hasn’t had time to call the guy out yet’ to fix the elevator. Rio’s been reminding him for a whole year. It must be <em> such </em>a hard job being a landlord.</p><p>She nearly collapses on one of the cases when she finally makes it to her floor. Her arms are shaking, biceps feeling like they’re about to rip into shreds when she slides her hand into the pocket of her jeans to fish her keys out—embarrassing because she carries 10 liter paint cans on the regular like they're nothing. What the hell has Agatha brought with her?</p><p>She rolls the suitcases inside, unwilling to take them any further than a few feet past the door. She makes a beeline to the sofa that’s set to become Agatha’s new bed, and collapses, just needs to get her breath back for a second; there’s still more to come up.</p><p>Agatha waltzes through the door holding a cardboard box in one hand, a leather travel bag leisurely hangs off her other arm. She’s wearing fucking sunglasses for God’s sake—like she’s the one who’s been made to help Rio out, not the other way around.</p><p>She peers at Rio over the top of the frames, pouts, “Did I tire you out already?”</p><p>Rio huffs, or well, tries to. It’s hard to differentiate between that and her already heavy breathing. “Oh yes, because we’re clearly both pulling our weight equally here.”</p><p>“You’re young! I thought you’d have more stamina than that.”</p><p>“Agatha, I’m hardly <em> young. </em> Not young enough to carry your entire life stashed into suitcases while you swing around a purse, anyway.”</p><p>Agatha waves her off, “You don’t get to complain til you hit 40.”</p><p>“Oh yes, those 15 months I have left are making all the difference, you’re right.”</p><p>“I usually am, hon.” The condescending tone the words are said in has Rio dragging herself up off the sofa.</p><p>She rolls her eyes, slips past Agatha to go and bring up more of her things; it’s not like Agatha’s making a move to, “I don’t like that.”</p><p>“Right,” Agatha follows, “Maybe I should talk more like Wanda’s kids. Call you <em> bro </em>like Billy would.”</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve heard Billy say that <em> ever </em>.”</p><p>“Hm. Tommy then. Same difference.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, glad she’s in front of Agatha going down the stairs so that doesn’t start up another fight, “They’re not even identical, how are you getting them confused?”</p><p>“Oh, I just do <em> not </em>care enough about them to learn the difference.”</p><p>Which is funny. It’s true that for as long as she’s known Agatha she’s always been uncomfortable around children—even the twins who she’s known since birth. She’s only been around Agatha once when she’d been left with Jen and Alice’s daughter and found her sitting still, looking like she was a bomb about to go off when she sensed she’d been left alone with her.</p><p>Now that the twins are older though, from what she’s heard from Billy, his friendship with Agatha is a more recent development—a kinship Rio doesn’t totally understand, but it’s how she knows Agatha is lying. Interesting.</p><p>“Do <em> not </em>call me bro.”</p><p>“Whatever you say, handsome.”</p><p>Stupidly, Rio’s knees buckle. Thank fuck she’s only a few steps from the ground. After one too many drinks at the same bar that started <em> this </em> mess, Agatha had wheedled the information out of Rio that she likes being called <em> that </em> , didn’t ever think she’d have it used against her. She should have known better than to trust Agatha with anything personal, even if they <em> were </em>all having a good time, drunk and sharing a little more than usual about their sex lives.</p><p>She clears her throat, “Stop it.”</p><p>Agatha just winks, walks past her to the pickup truck again—concerning because there’s not a driver waiting in said truck, and Agatha definitely doesn’t have a driver’s licence.</p><p>Now that the giant suitcases are out of the way, Rio can see everything that’s left in the bed to come in, can see what they’d been blocking before.</p><p>“What the fuck is that?”</p><p>Her question is redundant—she can see what it is.</p><p>A fucking rabbit hutch.</p><p>She shifts her eyes over to Agatha whose upper body is inside the truck. When she pulls back, Señor fucking Scratchy is bundled in her arms.</p><p>“Agatha, no…”</p><p>“How can you say no to this face?” Agatha brings his furry little head up to Rio, his nose twitching. Rio can see evil in his eyes.</p><p>He looks just like his mother, and now she’s outnumbered two to one.</p><p>But Rio is a nice person. Or, she tries to be. And she’s already agreed to help Agatha out—how would she look if she turned her away now?</p><p>Which is how Rio ends up hauling a two-storey indoor rabbit enclosure up to her apartment while Agatha lounges on the sofa watching Señor Scratchy explore his new—<em> temporary </em> home.</p><p>Once Rio’s set up Scratchy’s hutch in the back corner of the living room, the location settled on after she’d just about dragged it around the whole space trying to find where it least offends her, she nudges one of the cases with a foot, “I’m not unpacking for you too.”</p><p>Agatha slides off of the sofa with a groan—because she’s just done <em> so </em>much manual labor today, and unzips the case; it’s absolutely stuffed full of clothes. She opens the large oak sideboard up—Rio’s already emptied it as much as she can, mostly just TV remotes and charger cables left in one of the drawers, and begins putting her things away.</p><p>Rio watches her for a moment—this is one of those very human things that is rarely seen by anyone but a lover, nevermind a person you can just about tolerate, something very domestic, a menial task. Rio’s always been fascinated with the mundanity of just existing—witnessing <em> other </em>people existing, really.</p><p>It’s then that the skin on the back of her neck prickles like she’s being watched. She shifts her eyes away, locks onto Señor Scratchy who has ceased his investigating in favor of watching her watch Agatha. Rio flushes, feels it all the way down to her toes. She clears her throat, shuffles to the kitchen space just behind her and busies herself with making tea. Does Agatha even like tea? Rio decides she doesn’t care.</p><p>Without word, on the coffee table, on the coaster closest to Agatha, she puts a mug down—a sage green one, and Rio’s favorite out of her guest mugs.</p><p>Rio owns five mugs. She has her own—a tall one covered in dinosaurs that Wanda had bought her for her birthday a few years back, and four she has for guests, each in various shades of green—a collection she’s built from thrifting singular mugs until she had one for each of her friends. Rio’s never had Agatha at her apartment before.</p><p>Rio’s… curious. That’s why she waits, watches Agatha take two big gulps of the scalding tea, wincing through the heat before putting it back down to cool.</p><p>The second suitcase, Rio is relieved to see, isn’t full of more clothes. Agatha <em> has </em>packed possibly every bit of skincare and makeup she owns, but also, as far as Rio can see, at least five books, her laptop for doing… whatever it is Agatha does for work, and a ziploc bag of—</p><p>“Tell me you didn’t bring your own cutlery.”</p><p>Agatha pauses her movements, “I could definitely <em> tell </em>you that.”</p><p>“Agatha, we’re two people. I <em> have </em>cutlery.”</p><p>“This is just in case your handles aren’t up to standard. I can’t stand a flimsy fork,” She heads with the bag to Rio’s kitchen, starts pulling open the drawers one by one to find where she keeps her cutlery—Rio flatly refuses to help. “Think of it as a gift.”</p><p>“Oh, that’d be a first. Is this to make up for missing my birthday?”</p><p>Rio watches in horror, not reacting in time to stop Agatha dumping her cutlery into the trash, “This is the nicest thing I’ll probably ever do for you.”</p><p>Yes, Rio thinks, because that was just lovely.</p><p>“You know, I have a perfectly good spork that has a pretty hefty handle you could have had.”</p><p>“Oh, Rio, don’t even joke about that,” She shudders, “I just prefer to use something with a little more girth.”</p><p>“Oh, do you now?” Rio’s grin is wide and she wiggles her eyebrows when Agatha looks at her, eager to put her on the back foot. She’d like to think she sees a faint blush coat Agatha’s cheeks but that’s probably wishful thinking.</p><p>Rio leaves then, while she has the upper hand, heads to the bedroom to pull out the quilt and pillows she’d bought for Agatha and folds them up into a round wicker basket to be kept by the sofa so it’s not constantly set up as a bed.</p><p>When she gets back, Agatha is perched on the edge of the sofa, drinking the rest of her now cooled tea, scrolling through emails on her laptop.</p><p>Maybe this won’t be so bad.</p><p>It’s only gonna be for a couple of weeks anyway.</p><p>When she looks out of her window, the truck Agatha’s things had arrived in was gone.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the day is spent with them getting used to each other, Rio supposes—Rio with Agatha in her home, her very, very <em> small </em> apartment, and Agatha with living in someone else’s home when she’s used to her very, very <em> big </em>house. They’ve never spent more than a few minutes alone in each other’s company, and so even in another room, Agatha’s presence can be felt through the walls.</p><p>Rio cooks for them that night, a stir fry, something simple. Agatha seems surprised by this so tells her it seems pointless to waste her gas on cooking two meals. They don’t sit at the kitchen bar to eat like Rio usually would—that would require them to talk.</p><p>No, Rio endures the small discomfort of sitting in her living room to watch a show to push aside the big discomfort of having to make conversation with Agatha. She puts on an episode of Prehistoric Planet—she’s hoping David Attenborough’s soothing voice pacifies Agatha, (“you’re seriously the most boring person I know”) and settles on one end of the sofa, Agatha on the other.</p><p>They stay like that after they finish eating. Agatha’s stopped making bitchy comments about her choice of program and so the silence almost edges on comfortable. Rio’s fiddling with the cork of the wine bottle Agatha had brought—probably as close to a thank you as Rio’s going to get for letting her stay.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says when the third episode has finished, because she’s stupid and <em> has </em>to break the peace, “You know if the situation had been different any of them would have had you, right?”</p><p>Just because <em> she </em>doesn’t like Agatha, doesn’t mean she can’t tell their other friends don’t love her.</p><p>Agatha bristles at her words, hackles raised, “I know,” She says, flicks her hair like she’s in a shampoo commercial, avoids Rio’s gaze entirely, “I’m a goddamn delight.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t respond to that, doesn’t know how. If Agatha is uncomfortable she doesn’t say, but then again why would she?</p><p>That night, when she goes to bed, the last thing Rio remembers thinking about is Agatha Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>In the morning, Rio wakes to a loud crash. She jolts to life, heart thump thumping in her chest as she skids out into the hall in the plaid boxer shorts and vest she slept in last night. In all honesty, she’d kind of forgotten Agatha was there—unused to sharing her space with another person. She sees her crouched down near the kitchen counter gathering pieces of whatever she’s broken in her hand.</p><p>“Stupid fucking mug tree.” She hears Agatha mutter as she approaches.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>She watches from the doorway, sees Agatha flinch before she turns her head to look her way. Rio pulls out the dustpan and brush she keeps in the laundry closet and pads over to Agatha, sees the sage green mug in pieces.</p><p>“What the fuck, Agatha?”</p><p>“It wasn’t on <em> purpose, </em>” Agatha tips the pieces she’s collected into the pan before snatching the brush from Rio’s hand, and Rio can’t even tell if she’s lying, “I was trying to make coffee.”</p><p>“I see that.”</p><p>“There's barely any space to fucking <em> move </em>in here. I’d hate to have a look at your books if this is all you can afford with your own business.” Agatha says as she finishes brushing up.</p><p>Rio grits her teeth. Last night Agatha had been tolerable, subdued perhaps by the kindness of Rio’s actions. It seems she’s over it now. “I’m doing just fine, actually.” Not that it’s any of Agatha’s business.</p><p>She knows her apartment is small. She also knows she can afford something bigger, what with her owning the aptly named Vidal’s Painting and Decorating—there’s hardly a house in Westview Rio hasn’t had <em> some </em>input in, whether that just be recommending a paint brand, or working in partnership with interior designer Jen for a full scale remodel of a house.</p><p>But Agatha doesn’t deserve to know how she enjoys the feeling of the whole space being used, plants and flowers in every corner of her colorfully painted home, the trinkets on display on her coffee table, her shelves. Doesn’t deserve to see her rock collection in her bedroom, a new one added every time she makes the drive down to the beach.</p><p>She definitely doesn’t deserve to know how Rio knows what it’s like to feel alone in a vast, empty house meant for a big family—a family Rio has had to bury every member of until, eventually, she was the only one left.</p><p>Rio can feel Agatha’s eyes on her as she leans against the kitchen counter, picks at the skin on her fingers. Agatha hums and Rio cuts in before she can say anything else, “You’re up early. You going to work?” Rio takes in Agatha’s outfit, slacks and a loose fitting shirt, hopes her words prompt Agatha into telling her what she actually does for a living—it’s much too late into knowing her to ask now.</p><p>The look Agatha gives her is incredulous, “I work from home.” She yawns and Rio pours the brewed coffee into one of her other mugs, sliding it along the counter before she can think to stop herself, “I'm meeting my lawyer. Think I should be able to speed things along now that I’ve moved out. I told you I won’t be here long.”</p><p>She had. She’d assured Rio back when they were at the bar that she’d be out of her hair as soon as possible, just needed to get out of the house, show her metaphorical belly to her soon to be ex-wife so she doesn’t cause any more delays in thinking Agatha’s winning.</p><p>“You at a job today?” Agatha asks as Rio pours herself a coffee, adds her milk and sugar; she’s too awake now to go back to bed.</p><p>She shakes her head, “Starting a new one tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha checks her watch, gulps down the rest of her coffee, probably still too hot to drink comfortably, then sets her mug down by the sink, “Gotta finish getting ready.” She says, glides past Rio and heads to the bathroom.</p><p>Rio sinks down on her sofa, hands cupping her mug. It would almost be relaxing if she couldn’t see Señor Scratchy out of the corner of her eye. She almost wishes she <em> was </em>on a job today.</p><p>She should be grateful, she supposes, that at least Agatha’s going to be out of the house. An Agatha who works from home—from <em> her </em>home now, is not what she needed to learn about today.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha gets back that night, Rio pops her head around the fridge to see her drop her bag off her shoulder with a groan and loosen the tie in her hair.</p><p>Rio begrudges asking but, “How did it go?”</p><p>Agatha freezes momentarily, mustn’t have realized Rio was in the kitchen. When her limbs start up again she hums, “Fine, actually. Just tired.”</p><p>“Not used to sleeping on something other than your premium memory foam, temperature controlled, made using NASA technology mattress, are you?” Rio can’t hide the smirk that plays on her lips.</p><p>“Stalking me, Vidal?” Agatha smacks Rio’s arm as she rounds the fridge and into the kitchen. She steals one of the cherry tomatoes Rio had been chopping up, throws it into her mouth. Rio hears it pop, watches Agatha’s mouth, her lips reddened from her lipstick, doesn’t look away until she sees her throat bob.</p><p>“I was right, she jumped at the chance to get the house. I think she thought I wouldn’t do it.”</p><p>“So it’s going ahead then?”</p><p>“Yep.” Agatha pops another tomato into her mouth.</p><p>Rio shoves her away, “You won’t get fed if you keep stealing the food.”</p><p>Agatha grins, cups Rio’s cheek in the palm of her hand, “Aw, it’s sweet how you hear me telling you I always get exactly what I want and think you can start telling me what to do.” She punctuates her words with two taps to Rio’s cheek.</p><p>Rio’s lip curls as she pushes Agatha away, hates how Agatha can go from actively pissing her off to flirting to get her own way, knowing how much Rio hates it. Agatha’s always been a flirt though, the whole time she’s known her—and Agatha’s been married for all of it. She’s heard from Wanda that it contributed to the divorce, but she doesn’t know how true that is—Wanda can be a bit of a gossip, and it’s not like she really cares enough to ask Agatha outright what the reason is.</p><p>(Agatha had been the last to arrive at The Witches’ Road that night. She’d dropped into the booth, reached across for Lilia’s wine, downed it in one go, then reached for Wanda’s drink—a fruity cocktail of some kind. She’d taken one sip, gagging and screwing her face up at the sweetness, shoving it back across the table.</p><p>No one spoke as this was happening, like they’d all known something was wrong—wrong about the way Agatha hadn’t so much as announced her arrival, hadn’t bought herself a drink, just headed straight for the bench and collapsed.</p><p>“Helen and I are getting divorced.” She eventually said. Alice barely missed a beat before she pushed her own drink in Agatha’s direction. She downed it before continuing, “Don’t get all nosy and start asking questions—I’m not talking about it. It’s been coming for a while, and that’s all you need to know. Let’s just get on with our night. I don’t want to hear her name, alright?”</p><p>Those rules have kind of stuck since then.)</p><p>Agatha saunters away after that, leaving Rio to continue cooking. She hears her talking to Señor Scratchy in low murmurs, but can’t make out what she’s saying. When she turns to the stove to start cooking her chicken, Rio spots Agatha in her periphery, completely stripped down to just her bra and underwear, a sweatshirt held loosely in one hand, her phone in her other, held up close to her face like she's struggling to read it.</p><p>Rio’s stunned for a moment, mouth cottony as she stares, can’t seem to look away. She’d forgotten her kitchen, living room amalgamation had technically become Agatha’s bedroom. If she’d averted her gaze right away she probably wouldn’t have noticed, but, since she’s still staring, Rio can see the dark hair that peeks throu—</p><p>In her distraction, she doesn’t notice her elbow coming close to the frying pan handle until it’s too late—it tips off the stove, splashing hot oil all over the bottom of her jeans.</p><p>“Shit.” Rio jumps away, but the damage is done. She puts the pan next to the sink and when she turns back round, hand full of paper towels to wipe the oil, Agatha is leaning against the counter, still only in her underwear, delight painted across her face as she watches Rio struggle.</p><p>Rio tries valiantly not to look too hard at Agatha this close up, lest she hand over the last shred of control she has over this situation.</p><p>She focuses, instead, on wiping up the oil.</p><p>“We’re two for two on clumsy today.” Agatha’s mouth twists into a smirk.</p><p>The laugh that escapes Rio’s throat is strangled—she has no idea why.</p><p>“Give me, um, give me a sec.” Rio says and all but runs away from Agatha to the safety of her bedroom.</p><p>What is <em> wrong </em>with her?</p><p>Rio strips off her jeans as soon as she’s closed her door, pulling on sweatpants and sprinting back out to the bathroom to scrub at the oil.</p><p>She hopes to high hell her brain gets back to normal. Thank fuck this won’t be going on for much longer.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>There must be something in the air—Rio wouldn’t be surprised to find black mould growing somewhere in her apartment, and she feels a little less insane about her atypical behavior when she comes home from work, two days post <em> incident </em>.</p><p>Really, all of this is Alice’s fault. She never would have had to deal with any of this if she’d never hired her and let Alice yank her into her group of friends, introducing her to Jen for more work, and meeting Agatha along the way.</p><p>Owning her own business means Rio’s hours can fluctuate depending on the job, and how willing the customer is to let her continue past normal operating hours. Rio’s always kept an irregular schedule—she’s lived on her own since she dropped out of college and there’s never been any reason for her to be home at the same time every day if it’s not needed, never kept a girlfriend long enough to worry about being home on time.</p><p>Such working hours are in operation today, Rio’s phone telling her it’s nearly 8 when she slips it out from the pocket of her white work pants. She hangs her company jacket up on the coat hook just inside the doorway and only gets a brief glance at Agatha’s undeterminable expression before her wine glass plummets to the ground, smashing into tiny shards, red wine trickling towards her rug and starting to seep.</p><p>Rio’s going to be drinking from bowls by the time Agatha moves out.</p><p>“How many glasses have you had?” Rio asks as Agatha cleans up. She mindlessly picks at the flecks of <em> Forest Symphony, Woodland Wildflower, </em> and <em> Plum Sunset </em>that have dried on her forearm.</p><p>“Don’t be a dick, I’m about to be a divorcée. It’s an unwritten rule I’m allowed to drink during this period.” Agatha grumbles, walking the sopping paper towels over to the trash.</p><p>“Siri, set a reminder to buy paper towels at 6pm tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio narrowly avoids the shoe that gets thrown at her head for that.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>They have managed to settle into some sort of rhythm since then—Rio’s not seen Agatha in her underwear again, nor has Agatha managed to smash another one of her cups. A win, really.</p><p>And if Rio comes home later than usual, even when she’s said goodbye to Alice, and dropped her new weekend help, Billy, courtesy of Wanda, off home, that’s no one’s business but her own.</p><p>Because it’s good for her, Rio thinks, to keep away from Agatha when she knows that she’ll feel that burning anger creep up in her chest when she gets home to see, for example, Agatha sprawled out on her rug, Señor Scratchy lying on her belly as she plays an album from Rio’s vinyl collection, or opens her door to Agatha walking about, dripping water onto the floor from her long, dark hair—unselfconscious about the fact she’s wrapped in nothing but one of Rio’s towels.</p><p>It’s how Rio knows it’s real, something almost tangible—her frustration with Agatha, because even these insignificant things have it bubbling up inside of her.</p><p>Today when she gets home, Rio can already hear Agatha’s raised voice penetrating the door, a result of someone else provoking her for a change.</p><p>“I swear to fuck, Helen—”</p><p>
<em> Glasses. </em>
</p><p>That’s the only thought running through Rio’s mind when she opens the door to see Agatha, large squared glasses on her nose, massaging her temple as she paces back and forth, phone pressed to her ear.</p><p>“Tell your useless son of a bitch lawyer to answer <em> my </em>lawyer if you don’t want to speak to me! Trust me, this is my last resort.”</p><p>She spots Rio in the doorway, half waves as she listens to whatever her soon to be ex-wife is saying on the line.</p><p>“Yes, <em> that </em>Rio. How many Rio’s do you know?”</p><p>A sharp spike of discomfort zips up Rio’s spine at the mention of her name.</p><p>“Oh my God. This is petty, even for you. Good <em> fucking </em>bye.” Agatha snarls the words down the phone before she hangs up, growls and drags a hand down her face, “How much of that did you hear?”</p><p>Rio finally takes off her cap now that the call has ended, fluffs her hair, “I’m not even sure what <em> that </em>was.”</p><p>Agatha ignores her for a moment and Rio has to roll her eyes when she sees her head over to Señor Scratchy’s enclosure. Rio notes how he lets Agatha pull him out and hold him in her lap, and she’s just quiet enough to hear her talking to him.</p><p>“Mommy’s sorry for raising her voice. I know you don’t like it.”</p><p>Rio has to bang her head on the cupboard door when she hears that, “Agatha, what the fuck?”</p><p>“What?” Agatha kisses the top of his head before she lets him hop off of her lap, “He’s sensitive.”</p><p>“You gonna tell me what that was all about?” Rio opens her fridge to grab a soda out of the door, but Agatha’s hand comes to still hers, a shiver ricocheting through her body at the touch. She reaches further in and grabs out two cans of beer that Rio had forgotten were in there.</p><p>“We’re gonna need these.”</p><p>Agatha passes the cans to Rio to open, holds her hand up to Rio’s face to show off her long nails, “See,” She says, wiggling her fingers, “This is how long it’s been since I got laid.”</p><p>A laugh makes its way out of Rio’s throat at the absurdity—she feels a little hysterical.</p><p>Once they’re comfy on the sofa, Señor Scratchy worryingly out of sight, Agatha says, “So the good news is the divorce is still going ahead.”</p><p>“And the bad news?”</p><p>Agatha grimaces in a way that’s barely even exaggerated, “I thought maybe we’d finalize in the next few days, but it seems I might have to stay a little longer than planned.”</p><p><em> No, no, no </em>, she thought this would be over soon.</p><p>“But you gave her the house—she knows that, right?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha takes a swig of her beer and pulls a face, “God, it’s so cheap.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t allow herself to be sidetracked by that—she <em> likes </em>shitty beer, thank you, “So what’s her problem?”</p><p>Agatha makes a noncommittal noise, waves off Rio with a flourish. And, well, if Agatha’s not going to address why her name was brought up, Rio certainly isn’t.</p><p>It’s fine, Rio thinks, they’re past the weirdness of the first few days; if she can just keep managing to miss Agatha when she comes home from work—limit their contact time, if you will, she can live with this a while longer, no problem.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>In true <em> jinxed it </em>fashion, the weirdness returns a week later.</p><p>Agatha’s mood worsens from then. Rio comes home, Agatha bitches about work,</p><p>(“Ah yes, your job with the uh, bank—”</p><p>“Advertising, Rio, I work in advertising.”)</p><p>threatens to quit various jobs before she’s even <em> started </em>them, until she’s at least half a large glass of wine in and reconsiders.</p><p>And any steps towards a tentative friendship have been solidly pushed back; any attempts Rio makes at conversation are met, once again, with glares, huffs—and that’s on a good day, the snarky comments are back with a vengeance.</p><p>That’s if Agatha even acknowledges her existence at all—a lot of the time Rio will come in from work, her paint stained body and clothes being judged by Agatha without her even having to say a word, can tell just by the way her eyes glaze over as she looks her up and down, bottom lip tugged between her teeth, probably to stop herself from saying something <em> awful </em>about the way Rio’s dressed, unwilling to maintain any semblance of conversation with Rio.</p><p>Back to relative normalcy then, alright.</p><p>“So everything’s good with the living situation, then?” Rio blinks back into reality, her own arm holding a paint roller to the wall of the Proctor’s dining room coming back into focus, the edges of her vision unblurring. She looks to Alice on the other side of the room, rolling her own wall.</p><p>Rio snorts, a 1 bedroom apartment housing two people and a rabbit is less than ideal, especially when Rio’s relationship with both is tenuous at best.</p><p>Agatha has left strict instructions on what to do with him if they’re in the apartment together when she’s not there, which isn’t super often, though whenever Rio tries to let him out of his enclosure for some exercise he always nibbles at her fingers once he gets a taste of freedom. Somehow, Agatha never seems to believe her, citing it as a probable workplace injury.</p><p>Teeth marks.</p><p>Just shows how much decorating Agatha did in her own house.</p><p>Though if anyone could infuriate a paint can off enough to cause it to bite, it would be Agatha.</p><p>He’s playing a good game, Señor Scratchy, knows no matter what he does he’ll still have Agatha on his side.</p><p>Asshole.</p><p>“Not for lack of trying.” Rio goes back in with her roller, smoothly joining up her roll with the edge she’d cut in before, Alice staying unusually quiet as she does.</p><p>Rio looks to her when she’s finished, sees how Alice has been watching her the entire time, a contemplative expression pulled over her face, “What?”</p><p>“Hm?” Alice is pulled out of her thoughts, “Oh, I was just thinking about something Jen said.”</p><p>Rio squints, waits for her to elaborate.</p><p>“Just that she thought Agatha would be itching to look for somewhere else.”</p><p>Rio thinks about how agitated Agatha’s been lately, “Oh, don’t worry, she fucking hates living with me, that hasn’t changed. Nothing she can do when the wife starts dragging shit out though.”</p><p>Alice’s brow furrows and her lips part like she might say something and Rio can’t take that, raises her eyebrows to prompt Alice.</p><p>“Just… wasn’t Helen the one who filed for the divorce? Why would she want to drag it out?”</p><p>Rio worries her bottom lip between her teeth, “That’s what I heard too.”</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is curled up on the sofa next to Señor Scratchy when Rio gets home.</p><p>She watches Agatha’s eyes track her body from her feet all the way up without saying a word; Rio’s body tingling as she feels herself being analyzed. She quickly excuses herself to the bathroom after that to scrub her body of paint.</p><p>She returns wearing Scooby-Doo pajama pants and a tight white t-shirt, the bottom scissor cut and showing a small sliver of stomach, the waistband of her boxers, watches Agatha’s bottom lip jut into a pout when she approaches and Señor Scratchy hops off the sofa to get away from her.</p><p>Rio settles on the sofa, her space warmed slightly by the rabbit’s little body, and she readies her response to Agatha’s now regular <em> he knows where his loyalties lie, </em> or, <em> we can’t be friends until Scratchy says, and he doesn’t like you any more than I do. </em></p><p>She’s practically got her mouth open ready to parry, when Agatha says, “When was the last time you had sex?”</p><p>Rio promptly chokes on her own spit.</p><p>“Um, what?”</p><p>“Based on that reaction, I probably shouldn’t ask again.” Agatha smirks and it only spurs on the rapidly spreading blush Rio can feel on her neck.</p><p>She clears her throat, she’s not a child, “Like, a few months ago, I don’t know. Probably more than a few,” She shouldn’t ask, but, “Why?”</p><p>Agatha purses her lips like she’s thinking about it, as if she wasn’t the one who asked, “I was just thinking about how long it’s been for me,” She throws a glance to Rio, “A lot longer than you, by the way.”</p><p>It probably shouldn’t be surprising considering Agatha’s in the process of getting divorced but she feels it anyway.</p><p>It’s not like she’s ever been that open with <em> Rio, </em>but she’s heard Agatha, wine drunk and sloppy, oversharing with the rest of their friends, knows she has the libido the size of a skyscraper.</p><p>All of this makes a lot more sense when Rio spots the half empty wine bottle and a red tinged glass on the floor next to the sofa.</p><p>“Like, don’t you just wanna get <em> fucked? </em>”</p><p>“Um, I don’t—” Rio chokes on her words, “I mean, <em> yes </em>, but like—”</p><p>She’s aware she’s just spitting filler words at Agatha, who watches on with an amused raise of an eyebrow. Rio sees Agatha’s eyes flicker down her body, just briefly, before they snap back up again like she hadn’t meant to do that. She hums, “No, maybe not.”</p><p>Rio’s not really sure what that <em> means </em> but she suddenly realizes—</p><p>“Is that why you’ve been such a bitch lately?”</p><p>Agatha balls herself up on the sofa, legs to her chest, “Fuck off, I’m always like this.”</p><p>“No, no you’re not. You were alright to live with at first and I thought you were just getting more and more pissed off having to live here,” She can practically feel her own eyes gleam with this newfound information, can feel her lips tugging into a smirk, “You’re horny.”</p><p>“This is maybe… embarrassing to admit,” Agatha starts, eyes narrowing, “And if you ever tell anyone I’ll deny it and bury you,” Which Rio knows is probably a very real threat, “As much as I wanna just… go out and find someone, I’m 45, and I haven’t fucked anyone who wasn’t my wife for a long, long time.”</p><p>Rio feels a compulsion to keep Agatha talking; it’s the most real she’s ever been with her, the most her voice hasn’t run all over the pitch scale like everything she says to Rio is one big joke, “You think you won’t find someone who likes what you like?”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head in acquiescence, “Yes,” Then pauses, “And no.” She’s silent for a minute, Rio not interrupting in case she shakes Agatha from her thoughts, “I think maybe I have trust issues?”</p><p>Rio nods, taking that in, not having expected Agatha to be so honest, “I get that.”</p><p>“Is that why you don’t have sex often?” Rio’s instinctive response is to bare her teeth to which Agatha rolls her eyes like she’s nothing but a domesticated house cat, “That wasn’t a <em> jab </em>, just a question.”</p><p>Rio sits with that for a minute, trying to determine just how much she wants to share, “One night stands are so awkward. I never know how to ask for what I want.”</p><p>She finds it in her to look at Agatha, watches as she runs her tongue over her teeth, “I think I’d even just settle for an orgasm at this point.”</p><p>“You haven’t…” She doesn’t really want to finish that, doesn’t need to be thinking about sworn enemy Agatha Harkness getting herself off.</p><p>Sworn enemy might be a little of an exaggeration but—</p><p>“And where the fuck would I do that, moron?”</p><p>“I don’t know!” Rio flounders, “In the shower?”</p><p>“You think getting myself off quietly in the shower, in the room next to your bedroom, having to be quick so the hot water doesn’t run out… is conducive to good orgasms?”</p><p>Well, when she puts it like that.</p><p>“Do it when I’m not here then,” Rio holds her hands up, “I don’t fucking know.”</p><p>“What, when I’m working?”</p><p>“Do it when I’m late on a job.”</p><p>“Yes, because you keep me so updated on your work schedule.” Agatha huffs and folds her arms over her chest.</p><p>Rio sighs, she doesn’t know why she’s trying to help with this, it’s <em> way </em>past the bounds of letting a non-friend live with her.</p><p>“The job I’m on right now—the Proctors. They want everything done as soon as possible. Alice said they’ve already asked Jen for mocks of their bathrooms now, they’re like, super impatient,” She bites at her thumb, distracting her a little from what’s going on, “I’ll be late home for the next couple of days, is that enough time?”</p><p>Agatha stares her down, probably trying to make sense of this insane offer. Because that’s exactly what it is, insane. And then she nods, just once.</p><p>It’ll likely make Agatha much more manageable, is how Rio justifies to herself the insanity of it all.</p><p>She can feel that was the end of the conversation, doesn’t want to overstay her welcome and so quickly throws a sandwich together to eat in her room. When she gets there, Señor Scratchy makes the most diabolical eye contact with her as he chews on the edge of her quilt.</p><p>As she lunges for him, he evades her, nimble as anything, and hops back to the safety of Agatha.</p><p>She’s said it before and she’ll say it again.</p><p>Asshole.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>They’re nearly finished, Rio and Alice, with painting the Proctor’s house. Rio’s finishing off their halls, stairs, and landing today, balancing on planks that Alice still refuses to attempt.</p><p>(“Pussy.”</p><p>“I have a <em> baby </em>now, I’m not risking my life balancing on a plank of wood resting on a ladder just so Sarah Proctor has an even finish.”)</p><p>Honestly, even though nothing bad has happened to <em> her </em>on the planks, Alice has always been pretty worried about some kind of generational curse her grandmother had been paranoid over before she passed. Best not to encourage any demons; she knows what it’s like to grow up without a mother.</p><p>It’s barely hit 5:30 when Alice’s phone rings.</p><p>She can’t hear what’s being said, but Alice’s tone of voice verges on panic. She hears her quickened footsteps coming towards her.</p><p>“Jen’s taking Lucy to the hospital, she’s been vomiting all day and she’s worried she’s gonna get dehydrated.” She rubs at her face, inadvertently smearing still wet paint on her cheek.</p><p>“Oh shit, you want me to drive you?”</p><p>Alice’s shoulders drop in relief, “Oh my God, would you? I know we were meant to be finishing this job toni—”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio says, already making a move to pack up her things, “This is more important than work, okay? Family is <em> always </em>more important. I’ll text Sarah and tell her I can come and finish the last bits in the morning.”</p><p>“God, you’re a fucking lifesaver, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio returns home after breaking more than a few of the speed laws to get Alice to the hospital as soon as she could, and it’s not until she’s already opened the door that she realizes her mistake.</p><p>She’d completely put her conversation with Agatha out of her mind, wasn’t something she needed to dwell on, she thought.</p><p>But when she sees Agatha, head tipped back over the arm of the sofa, thick hair flowing down and grazing the floor, eyes clenched tightly shut, she freezes in place.</p><p>Agatha hasn’t noticed her. Rio can understand why when her eyes follow a headphone wire leading from Agatha to her phone that’s resting on the coffee table.</p><p>She should leave, pretend this never happened. Agatha never has to know.</p><p>She’s sidetracked by the view of Agatha’s pale thighs, one leg hanging off of the sofa, the other pressed up against the back of it, pushing an indent into the leather as she rocks her hips into her own hand, stuffed inside her underwear.</p><p>The noises she’s making are breathy, coming faster now.</p><p>“<em> Fuck </em>.” She whimpers and brings her hand up to her own mouth. Rio can’t see what she’s doing from this angle but it doesn’t help to stifle her sounds—breathy whimpers making way for deep rumbling moans.</p><p>She’s close, Rio realizes.</p><p>She needs to fucking leave.</p><p>And that’s when Agatha’s eyes fly open, find Rio.</p><p>She jolts, flips over and scrambles to grab the throw on the back of the sofa to cover herself with as Rio covers her eyes with a hand and slams the door shut, standing facing it.</p><p>It’s Agatha who breaks the silence, “Were you standing there with the fucking door open?”</p><p>“Um—”</p><p>“Fuck’s sake, you can turn around, I’m covered.” Agatha’s voice is gravelly.</p><p>“I’m good.” Even though she’s facing her now shut door, Rio still keeps the hand over her eyes.</p><p>“Got a good look already, did you?”</p><p>Somehow that makes her feel like an even bigger creep than not facing her so she turns around, “Agatha, I am so, so sorry.”</p><p>Agatha <em> is </em>covered, thankfully, blanket covering her lower half, and the t-shirt that had been rucked up around her ribs, pulled back down, “You said you’d be home late.”</p><p>Rio swallows, thick, “Alice had to leave early. Lucy’s sick.”</p><p>Agatha nods, has a faraway look in her eye. Rio jumps to fill the silence, “Do you want me to leave?”</p><p>“Why, so you can stew in your guilt?”</p><p>“No,” Rio rolls her eyes, takes off her cap and runs a hand through her hair, “So you can, like… finish?”</p><p>“What’ll you do, sit on a park bench until I text you that I came?”</p><p>Rio pushes her tongue into her cheek; Agatha’s <em> really </em>getting on her last nerve. She shrugs her jacket off, hangs it up, aware that Agatha is watching her every move, “Fine then. I’ll stay.”</p><p>She watches Agatha’s lips curl up around the edges when she turns—why the fuck is she smiling?</p><p>“I <em> do </em>perform well in front of an audience.”</p><p>Oh God, what?</p><p>“Agatha…” She intends for her tone to be firm, a warning, but she can hear it when it comes out that it’s little more than a whine.</p><p>Her heart is <em> pounding. </em></p><p>“Unless you’re <em> scared… </em>”</p><p>And Rio, stupid, gullible Rio, has never been able to back down from a challenge issued by Agatha.</p><p>She walks over to the chair on the far side of the sofa, slowly, waits for Agatha to back down. She doesn’t, just follows her movements, tosses the blanket away, and flips onto her back again so she can still look at Rio. As Rio sits down, her eyes fall to the space between Agatha’s legs, sucks in a breath when she realizes Agatha hadn’t removed her hand the entire time they’d been talking.</p><p>She settles back, hopes she looks calmer than she feels, doesn’t even care that there might still be wet paint on her clothes. No, <em> she’ll </em>be the one to call Agatha’s bluff, looks her dead in the eye and waits.</p><p>But Agatha doesn’t withdraw. No, Agatha lets her left leg drop back down to the floor like it had been before, effectively spreading her legs for Rio.</p><p>The eye contact feels heavy then, feels like a provocation.</p><p>And she drops her eyes.</p><p>She can see Agatha’s hand in her underwear, can see the hair trailing up towards her belly, spilling a little onto her inner thighs. But most important, she sees the wet patch on the gusset of Agatha’s underwear; her breath stutters in time with her heartbeat.</p><p>“Agatha…” She says again, can’t say anything else; all of her senses taken over with nothing but <em> Agatha, Agatha, Agatha. </em></p><p>It only serves as encouragement for Agatha, whose lips part with a shaky breath as she slowly starts moving her fingers again.</p><p>“<em> Fuck, </em> ” She gasps, eyes fluttering shut, “Just, <em> ah, </em> before you judge,” She cuts herself off, bites her lip, “I was close, so this won’t, <em> fuck, </em>take long.”</p><p>Rio has no idea what compels her to say it, but, “I know.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are back on hers once more, darker than she’s ever seen them, like a moonlit sky, pupils blown wide, and her parted lips curve into an open mouthed smile and she knows she’s caught, “You like watching me?”</p><p>She looks back down to where Agatha’s hand is rapidly moving, wishes she could see <em> properly </em> how she’s rubbing her clit. She’s right, she does like watching, doesn’t know why her brain can so easily separate hate from lust—does she <em> hate </em>Agatha?</p><p>Rio tries to summon the feeling; this isn’t for her, after all, this is just Agatha exerting her control in any way she can, but finds she can’t—any memory of Agatha deliberately aggravating her gets twisted until all she knows is what’s right in front of her.</p><p>All Rio can do is nod, dumb.</p><p>“God,” She gasps, “I’m fucking close,” Rio gulps, watches Agatha’s hips buck into her hand, leg twitching, “You gonna watch me come, handsome?”</p><p>Rio can’t stop the whimper from escaping her mouth, her own hand hot on her thigh, fingers twitching over the material of her work pants.</p><p>It’s almost comical how out of control Rio feels—she’s the one fully clothed, watching the woman she can’t stand in the most vulnerable scenario she can think of, and yet she’s the one feeling exposed. Feels like Agatha’s stripped her of her layers, pushed her back to something primal, feels like Agatha knows exactly who she is.</p><p>Agatha bites her lip, hard, stifles her moans and Rio mourns the loss, tips forward in her chair unwittingly to reclaim the sounds.</p><p>Rio must be somewhere outside her own body because she hears, gentle, “Let me hear you.” And—<em> fuck, </em>that’s her own voice.</p><p>And Agatha, cruelest woman in existence, says, <em> “You don’t fucking deserve it.” </em> And comes with her fingers in her mouth, muffling herself as best she can, hips twitching, back arched.</p><p>Rio stares, unblinking as Agatha’s fingers slow their movements, bringing herself down slowly.</p><p>When Agatha opens her eyes once more, Rio flinches at the sudden contact, her skin that had been pleasantly warmed with arousal before shifts to a clamminess, hands sweat damp on her pant legs.</p><p>Rio doesn’t want to be here when Agatha realizes what she’s done, when the haze of lust lifts from her eyes and makes Rio regret being so naive.</p><p>So Rio does what Rio does best—she runs.</p><p>It’s what she did after her first kiss, playing spin the bottle and having the sudden, overwhelming realization in the middle of some kids' living room, brain fuzzy from Smirnoff Ice, fingers sticky from jello shots, that she was a lesbian.</p><p>It’s what she did when she felt her first real relationship start to crumble—unwilling, or unable, she’s still unsure, to deal with the consequences; managing to avoid her first love long enough that a text sealed their breakup.</p><p>It’s what she did when her father died. It had been just the two of them for some time; the famous five, to the fab four, to the three musketeers, to Dad and Rio, until, in the end, just Rio. She hadn’t even gone to his funeral, just packed up her shit and left, thinking maybe if she never saw his body, returned to that big, empty house that she could pretend it never happened.</p><p>Agatha is right, ultimately. She lets the evening air bite at her bare arms, forgoing her jacket in her bid to escape faster and rocks back and forth on a swing in the park until the sun sets, guilt sitting heavy in her stomach.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio makes sure she’s up early the next morning, slips out without breakfast or her coffee, tiptoes to the door holding her boots, eyes trained on Agatha to check for any sign of movement.</p><p>She finishes up at the Proctor’s house before lunch, packs her equipment into her truck and drives to the nearest coffee shop after sitting for a good while with her head on her steering wheel ignoring her growling stomach protesting her choice to skip breakfast.</p><p>She grabs her order, makes her way over to her favorite spot in the window before she’s being held in place from behind, hands on her shoulders.</p><p>“Boo,” Wanda spins her round, Rio’s body shutting down from the shock of it, almost drops her bagel on the floor, “I haven’t seen you in <em> ages. </em>Let me sit with you.” She swipes her drink from the table she’d been sitting at, not leaving any room for argument.</p><p>Wanda slumps into one of the armchairs at the window table, knows it’s Rio’s favorite, Rio stiltedly perching on hers, wondering how she’s ever going to act normal ever again.</p><p>“Aren’t you teaching today?” Good, that’s a good, normal Rio question.</p><p>Wanda squints at her, stirs the ice in her drink around with the straw, “You know I only teach morning classes on Fridays.”</p><p>Oh God, this is how it starts, isn’t it? She’s going to actually lose her mind over this. She needs Agatha dead, like, immediately.</p><p>Rio gulps, hopes it’s not visible, “Right, no, yeah, I knew that.”</p><p>A strange sort of smile crosses Wanda’s lips and Rio scrambles to say another, normal thing, “So Billy’s still up for coming with me to John’s next week? Thought I’d add ceilings to his list of skills.”</p><p>Thankfully, the mention of her son brings swift change, “Oh yeah, he’s looking forward to it. I think he was a little mad that you don’t have a job on this weekend, actually. He likes it more than I thought he would,” She pauses for thought, “Though I’m not sure if that’s to do with the painting or the gossiping you indulge him with.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio shrugs, happy to be on neutral ground, “I don’t tell him anything about <em> you, </em>I’m not out to traumatize the kid with what you and Vision get up to on the weekends now you’ve got both of your kids jobs.”</p><p>Wanda balls up her napkin and throws it at her, shushing Rio as she looks around for anyone who might have heard her.</p><p>“You know, I was getting kind of worried about you, I’ve had no proof of life since Agatha moved in with you,” Wanda says, unaware of the way Rio just about dies in her chair at the mention of Agatha, “But you’re alive and with all your limbs so that’s a good sign.”</p><p>The laugh that leaves Rio’s body is forced, <em> sounds </em>forced. She knows it, and by the look on her face, Wanda knows it too.</p><p>“Things <em> are </em>fine, right?”</p><p>Rio, acting totally cool, calm and collected says, “Yeah, why, has she said anything?”</p><p>Except Wanda’s looking at her like she’s crazy and that’s never a good sign, “Why would Agatha say something? Has something happened?”</p><p>Shit, shit, shit, she needs to get out of here.</p><p>Rio shifts in her seat, one hand reaching for her phone, the other patting her pocket down for her keys, “No, what, why would you think that?”</p><p>“Because you’re acting like <em> that. </em>”</p><p>That’s about as much as she can take before she’s scrambling up out of her seat, “Maybe <em> you're </em>acting like that.” And promptly speed walks to her truck.</p><p>It’s only when she slams her head on the steering wheel, the accidental blare of the horn a sweet relief to her own mind, that she realizes she left her bagel on the table.</p><p> </p><p>✦</p><p> </p><p>Rio, by some grace of a higher power, manages to not sight Agatha, awake and alert anyway, for a whole two days. She becomes something of a hermit, not leaving her room until she hears the front door shut or the shower running. Even tonight, she dropped out of the group plans to go to the bar—the first time that’s ever happened, and a sure way to get Wanda calling her every five minutes tomorrow to check on her.</p><p>She just <em> can’t </em>be around Agatha, especially under the influence of alcohol, right now, can’t look her in the eye and see the visceral disgust painted across her face.</p><p>So she orders a take out and gets drunk by herself, like any other rational person would do in her position.</p><p>It’s late when she hears Agatha get in, hears her stumbling through the door, the telltale sign of her shoes clattering to the floor.</p><p>The walls are thin, she can hear Agatha humming to herself as she runs the kitchen tap.</p><p>Rio contemplates turning off the lamp beside her bed so the light can’t shine under the door—an invitation, but Agatha wouldn’t—</p><p>Her door creaks open, just a touch.</p><p>“Jesus, Agatha, you mind knocking?”</p><p>Agatha’s head peeks around the doorframe, taking Rio in, tucked up in bed, book she’d intended to read but couldn’t focus on in her lap, near empty wine glass in hand, “What, like how you knocked the other day?” The rest of her body enters the room.</p><p>The one thing Rio’s never been able to deny is how gorgeous Agatha is. For all her flaws—and there are many, Agatha Harkness is, and has been since the day she met her, one of the most beautiful people Rio has ever seen.</p><p>She’s wearing slim, flared suit pants, a silky shirt tucked in and unbuttoned to a degree that borders on obscene, the inner curve of her breasts on display—not that Rio’s looking.</p><p>“What are you doing here, Agatha?” Rio says, crosses her arms over her chest, feels very underdressed in her regular, tank top and boxers combination.</p><p>“You didn’t come out tonight.” Agatha says, like that’s an answer.</p><p>“Right, and I’m alive so you can report that to Wanda or whatever the fuck, and leave me alone.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t leave her alone, because Agatha isn’t in the business of listening to Rio. She comes inside, closes the bedroom door behind her; Rio can just about <em> feel </em>all of the air in the room leave.</p><p>“You’ve been avoiding me.” Agatha says, crawling onto the end of Rio’s bed.</p><p>Rio doesn’t answer. She can’t say no, doesn’t want to say yes, so she quite literally bites her tongue for something else to focus on.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>A laugh wheezes out past Rio’s lips at the question, “I’m sure you know, Agatha. You were there.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her for a moment, like she’s really dying to say something, but then the moment passes and she crawls further up the bed, flopping down with her head on the pillow next to Rio.</p><p>“Okay, so here’s what I’m thinking—”</p><p>“Oh, I wasn’t sure you did that,” Rio interrupts, “You seem to operate only on impulse.”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head to the side, her glare ineffective, with her slightly drunken pout and glassy eyes. Rio looks away, gestures for her to continue.</p><p>“You can absolutely say no, but just hear me out for one second.”</p><p>“Is this you circling back to the bank robbery thing?” Rio reaches over the wine bottle on the bedside table, refills her glass—she thinks she’s going to need it to make it through this, “Like, I know we’re both not fans of this situation but I still feel that’s a little drast—”</p><p>“Um, no, no,” Agatha cuts her off, hand flying up in the air and drawing Rio’s attention, “I was gonna ask if you’d wanna have sex with me.”</p><p>“What the fuck?” Rio splutters, wine going down the wrong way.</p><p>“You’re so fucking dramatic.” Agatha says, makes no move to help her as she recovers from a very embarrassing coughing fit.</p><p>“Oh, says the woman pretending to offer sex as a distraction technique because she can’t ever just have a normal conversation.” Rio puts her wine glass on the floor, just in case Agatha says anything else that might prove to be a choking hazard.</p><p>Agatha sits up then; she’s so, so close to Rio, but not touching, “I’m serious.”</p><p>Rio looks at her, feels all her years of knowing Agatha, disliking Agatha, wane into just this moment.</p><p>“You’re serious.” Not a question.</p><p>“Just—before you say no,” Agatha’s quick to interject, “Think about it for a minute. It makes sense.”</p><p>How the <em> fuck </em>does it make sense?</p><p>Agatha must see the baffled look on her face, “I wanna get laid, I assume <em> you </em>wanna get laid, based on what I saw the oth—”</p><p>She cuts herself off when Rio groans and covers her ears with her hands. A touch, gentler than she’d ever have expected from Agatha, fingers wrapping around her wrist to pull her hand away; Rio obliges.</p><p>“Obviously you can say no,” And Rio can see it now she’s looking Agatha head on, gaze flickering between both eyes, how serious she is, “We can forget I ever brought this up, but if there’s a chance you want some no strings attached sex, then I promise I’ll still hate you in the morning,” A smirk, “No worry about either of us catching feelings.”</p><p>Rio sits with it and, well, she can see why Agatha could get away with murder if she wanted, knows exactly the right thing to say.</p><p>The only thing running through Rio’s mind as she leans in is <em> this is such a bad idea. </em></p><p>Her lips are but a breath away from Agatha’s when a hand on her shoulder pushes her down, back thudding against the mattress as Agatha swiftly tugs back the quilt and straddles her.</p><p>“I like these.” She says, pulling Rio’s plaid boxer shorts between a thumb and forefinger—something she probably wouldn’t say without the influence of alcohol.</p><p>Rio reaches up to Agatha’s shirt, manages to get her fingers on the buttons before her hands are batted away.</p><p>“Who said you could touch?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are deadly sharp as she reaches for her own shirt buttons, taking obvious pleasure in watching Rio become unmoored in her gaze.</p><p>Rio’s hands come to rest on Agatha’s legs, thumbs stroking lightly—a gesture allowed by Agatha as she slips off her shirt, bare chest on display.</p><p>Rio’s mouth waters, “Can I?” A hand tentatively reaches up before Agatha grabs it and pins it against the pillow under Rio’s head.</p><p>“No,” Agatha nips at her jaw, “You’re going to be good for me, aren’t you?”</p><p><em> Fuck, </em>whatever Rio had felt before about them consistently existing on an equal playing field goes out the window, and she nods her head.</p><p>The hand Agatha isn’t using to pin Rio in place pulls her tank top up so she can scrape her nails down her stomach, Rio’s abs flexing instinctively, much to Agatha’s delight, “Who knew you were built like this?”</p><p>Rio lets out a pathetic whine at that, again, to Agatha’s pleasure.</p><p>She tries to capture Agatha’s lips in a kiss once more, only for Agatha to turn her head, which—she thought her avoidance before had been a teasing gesture, but this genuinely might be a boundary for Agatha.</p><p>Rio kisses her cheek instead; she can work with that—less room for confusion anyway.</p><p>Agatha lets the kiss happen, then pulls away to look at Rio before getting up, rolling her eyes at Rio’s noise of protest, “I’m taking my pants off, fucking calm down.”</p><p>Once stripped to nothing but a lacy pair of dark green underwear, she straddles Rio once more, rocks her hips down into Rio’s.</p><p>“It’s so pathetic how much you want me,” Agatha’s lips pull into a wolfish smile, “How much I can <em> tell </em>you want me.”</p><p>“Please.” She says; Agatha already knows, not much point in denying it. Against all odds, she <em> does </em> want her, <em> does </em>feel pathetic when Agatha’s barely done anything but can feel her thighs beginning to stick together.</p><p>She can see the moment Agatha retreats into her mind’s eye, an image forming before she blinks back into the moment, decision made. She shuffles a little higher up Rio’s body, “I want you to eat me out.” She says, and<em> —fuck </em>, Rio knows exactly what’s meant by that, hands reaching out to grab Agatha’s hips in encouragement, pulling her in closer to her face.</p><p>Agatha allows it, settles above Rio’s mouth, pulls her underwear to the side and doesn’t have to wait long for Rio to pull her down, for her to slot her mouth over her wet cunt, groaning as Agatha’s taste overwhelms her senses.</p><p>She tries to start slow, long licks that avoid her clit and her dripping entrance, but Agatha quickly rectifies that, hand harshly tugging at Rio’s hair, “I want you to make me come, not take me out to fucking dinner with it.”</p><p>The words make Rio laugh, breathy out of her nose, before Agatha’s fist tightens further, “I’m fucking serious, get a move on or I won’t be touching you.”</p><p>Not about to risk that, Rio tilts her head, sucks Agatha’s clit into her mouth, laving her tongue against it, and Agatha rewards her with a loosened grip, hand carding through her hair.</p><p>Angled like this, focused on her clit, Rio can feel Agatha’s wet cunt dripping onto her chin, and she moans, loves that she gets to take Agatha apart like this. Loves that, for as much teasing as Agatha made about how pathetic <em> Rio </em>got for her, she has tangible proof that she wants her just the same.</p><p>Agatha moves her hips a little, grinding, and encouraging Rio’s tongue to dip into her cunt. Rio indulges her, hands reaching up experimentally to Agatha’s ass, holding her close, pleased when her hands aren’t shoved back down.</p><p>Rio gets as deep as she can with her tongue, drinking up everything Agatha has to offer, moans at the taste—if this is only going to happen once, she wants to do it right. She lets Agatha buck her hips against the bridge of her nose for a few shaky moments, before, Rio’s heart speeds up in excitement, it becomes too much and Agatha has to back away, removing the stimulation from her clit.</p><p>Agatha, feeling obviously pleased with Rio’s performance so far, leans back, dips a hand into the waistband of Rio’s shorts, feels down through the trimmed hair until she reaches her cunt, already soaked, despite having not been touched.</p><p>Rio swears she hears Agatha moan in time with her when she parts her lips, gathers slick on her fingers to circle around Rio’s clit, but she’s in no position to debate it, tongue as deep inside Agatha’s cunt as she can get it.</p><p>She’s not sure if it’s the length of time since someone else had their hands on her, or the physical <em> and </em>mental stimulation she’s getting from having Agatha Harkness on top of her, touching her, grinding into her mouth, but Rio feels ashamedly close to coming already.</p><p>Luckily, it seems Agatha isn’t close behind.</p><p>Rio pulls away, dragging her tongue back up to Agatha’s clit to suck hard, revels in the whiny moan Agatha can’t hold back, “Yes, <em> yes, </em>Rio, make me come.”</p><p>The words encourage Rio in her desperate attempt to make Agatha come before she does—not entirely sure she’d bet on the odds.</p><p>When Agatha presses harder, fingers pressed together to frantically rub over her clit, Rio can’t stop her hips from bucking into the touch as she catches just the right angle that almost sends her over the edge in an instant.</p><p>What she hadn’t counted on, though, was Agatha’s reaction to the rise of her hips to meet her touch, the catch in her breath as she moans and whines into Agatha’s cunt, fingers pressing indents into her ass, unable to stop them flexing through the pleasure.</p><p>“Yes, yes,<em> yes— </em>” Agatha’s fist tightens in her hair again, body tightening as her orgasm washes through her, fingers stilling over Rio’s clit but it ultimately doesn’t matter; Rio feels herself responding in a way that’s almost Pavlovian, hips bucking her clit into Agatha’s fingertips, once, twice, before she tips off the edge, moaning open mouthed into Agatha’s cunt.</p><p>Rio moves her hands back to Agatha’s hips when she feels her start to slump, helps her move off of Rio to lie down next to her, chest heaving.</p><p>Rio licks her lips, tastes Agatha as she watches her recover.</p><p>“That wasn’t half bad.” She says once she has her breath back.</p><p>“Oh, shut up.” Rio shoves her shoulder, but there’s a smile on her face that wouldn’t usually be there.</p><p>Rio waits for the panic to creep up inside her chest, but it never comes.</p><p>She takes a deep breath, lets her body relax into the mattress, closes her eyes and feels Agatha bring the quilt up over their bodies.</p><p>Rio’s aware of the murmuring noise she makes, has no idea what she was planning on saying, eyes and brain heavy with exhaustion.</p><p>“Sleep.” Is all she hears from Agatha.</p><p>When she wakes in the morning, Agatha is gone.</p>

<p>
<span>The aforementioned deaths of her family members </span>
<em>
<span>may </span>
</em>
<span>have fucked Rio up a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio was five her mother gave birth to twins. They were </span>
<em>
<span>tiny, </span>
</em>
<span>Rio remembers—much too tiny, she knows now, looking back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she was a bit older and asked her dad about it he told her that her mom was a little different, that where she had grown Rio, where she’d grown the twins, was shaped like a heart—something they hadn’t known until Rio’s own difficult birth. Apparently she’d only grown in one side of her mother’s womb, that even though her mother had her at full term, she was small.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The twins came much earlier than expected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s little sister was even tinier than her brother, her heart unable to withstand its own body. Her brother held on a little longer—a fighter, her dad had said with his large hand through the hole in the NICU. He had been in and out of hospital after that with a number of health problems his little body just had no way of keeping at bay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio remembers tentatively pushing her mother’s bedroom door open, seeing her curled up on the bed, facing away from the door, “Not now, love.” Over and over again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They said she died from a broken heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It made sense up until it didn’t—age fourteen and angry at the world with the rest of them. Why hadn’t she been enough?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, age thirty eight, Rio didn’t blame her mom anymore, didn’t blame the twins for putting two tiny puncture wounds in her family, didn’t blame her dad for the motorcycle accident that killed him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even still, if Agatha has trust issues, Rio is </span>
<em>
<span>riddled </span>
</em>
<span>with abandonment issues—didn’t need to spend all that money on having a therapist tell her so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s built for people to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her apartment is quiet when she pads out of her bedroom, mouth dry from last night’s wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bile rises in her throat—not from the wine, but from Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or the lack of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows, heavy, tries not to panic as she glances around the living room with no sign of Agatha, heart in her ears. She wasn’t in the bathroom either, the door open when she’d passed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It seems her body can’t separate Agatha from her past experiences. Rio tries telling her shaking hands when she fills a glass of water that this was to be expected—Agatha would realize the mistake she’s made and bail. Her hands, her rigid spine, her guilt filled belly don’t listen though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A movement in the corner—Señor Scratchy hops out from… behind the curtain? Great, now she has to check for rabbit droppings there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It means Agatha isn’t </span>
<em>
<span>gone, </span>
</em>
<span>gone though.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her self imposed anechoic chamber is broken then—Agatha Harkness exists as a whirlwind, sweeping everything and everyone up around her, and the world filters back in. A crinkling brown paper bag is bundled under Agatha’s arm, Rio notices, when the door is thrown open, door handle knocking against the wall and leaving a permanent scar in Rio’s otherwise perfect paint job.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fucking teenagers.” Agatha mutters as she breezes past Rio, as though she hasn’t been the cause of a very near panic attack on Rio’s end, dumps the bag on the kitchen counter, Rio spinning in place like one of those ballerina music boxes, following her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning?” Rio says, unsure if Agatha’s even seeing her, even though she’s been standing between the front door and the kitchen, should be unmissable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Agatha says, glances over her shoulder, “Did you just wake up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts her eyes around, “Yes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pauses, eyes trailing over her face, expression unreadable until—a twitch—the corner of her mouth pulling up briefly, ever so slightly, til it drops again, “Tired?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio feels her face flush, stupid, “So, uh, what issue do you have with the youth of today?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs, “All I wanted was a jar of coffee and a bag of cashews,” She steps to the side, hand thwacking the paper bag on the kitchen counter to show Rio its sturdiness, “Does this </span>
<em>
<span>look </span>
</em>
<span>like just a jar of coffee and a bag of cashews to you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um… no?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aw, well done,” Agatha smiles condescendingly, “Feels good being right for once, doesn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, that does nothing to stop the spread of her blush, “So?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha drags the word out, “I get to the register. Tommy’s there,” She pauses, tilts her head, “Now that I’m thinking about it I should probably text Wanda, I think he should have been in class. Anyway, I’m there, trying to buy my </span>
<em>
<span>two </span>
</em>
<span>items when he points out a home baked garlic bread. I ask him what I’d want with a home baked garlic bread at ten o’clock in the morning, and he says, oh, you might be having pasta for dinner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>say, well I’m not, we’re literally out of pasta. So he looks all sheepish and embarrassed and tells me he’s been told to upsell to outdo their competitors,” Agatha throws her hands up in the air, eyes wide like it’s the most ridiculous thing she’s ever heard, “</span>
<em>
<span>Competitors? </span>
</em>
<span>Which of the zero other grocery stores in town are trying to steal customers from Westview Groceries, huh? Unbelievable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she turns back around, pulls out her jar of coffee, her bag of cashews, and then—a bag of pasta, a jar of sauce, and a home baked garlic bread, lays them on the counter. Rio pushes her tongue into her cheek to hide her smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s pasta for dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clears her throat, “We were out of coffee?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha says, putting her purchases away into cupboards she now knows like the back of her hand, “Actually it’s a good job you slept so long I probably would have torn you limb from limb if you’d tried to talk to me before I’d had any. Good job I went to the café before the store or my phone call to Wanda might be </span>
<em>
<span>very </span>
</em>
<span>different.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And now that Agatha is here, back from a morning trip to the grocery shop to buy fucking coffee, Rio realizes her panic may have been a little premature. Agatha was </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>out dragging their friends from their houses, stuffing them into another truck she can’t drive that she got from God knows where, and taking them far away from Rio, never to be seen again. Cool.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forcefully kickstarts her body into action—she’s just been standing, pivoting in the same spot since Agatha blew through the front door. She leans back on her elbows against one of the counters, watches Agatha start making her coffee, two mugs in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Rio says, spotting it, “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha startles, looks from Rio back to the mugs in front of her like they’d magically appeared, “Well, you’re just gonna make your own anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stays silent as Agatha adds the right amount of sugar, pours just the perfect amount of milk into her dinosaur mug, before sliding it over to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Should we talk about last night?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And what is </span>
<em>
<span>with </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha saying shit like that when Rio’s drinking? Her coffee almost comes out of her nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She recovers, Agatha watching with an eyebrow raised, “What’s there to talk about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just thinking we might be more sexually compatible than I’d thought and it would be a sha—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve </span>
<em>
<span>thought </span>
</em>
<span>about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scowls at her, lip curling as she quickly throws a glance down Rio’s body, lip curling like that was the worst thing she could have said, “Only last night when I </span>
<em>
<span>actively </span>
</em>
<span>had your mouth on my cunt, deflate your ego please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Christ, Agatha.” It is </span>
<em>
<span>much </span>
</em>
<span>too early for this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? Can’t handle a little dirty talk?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not dirty talk if we’re not having sex.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha loudly sips her coffee, “Aren’t we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are we?” Rio squints.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignores her for a moment in favor of downing her coffee, surely burning her throat—Rio’s barely taken a sip of her own, “If you’re up for it we could have </span>
<em>
<span>more </span>
</em>
<span>no strings attached sex. Like I promised last night—I still don’t like you. Maybe this could be a good outlet for all that… a friends with benefits type thing, if you will?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks, finds an opening, “Are you saying we’re </span>
<em>
<span>friends?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches as Agatha’s fist clenches, eyes narrow, “Stop talking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That’s how Rio ends up on her knees on her kitchen floor, Agatha’s pants discarded somewhere over her shoulder along with her underwear, one of Agatha’s feet propped up on a drawer handle as Rio moans into her cunt—an effective way to shut her up, really.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She basks in the taste of Agatha’s dripping heat, a taste she wasn’t sure she’d ever know again. Rio’s allowed to take her time with it a little more, it seems—Agatha content to let her explore, a hand holding her hair back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes track up Agatha’s body to her face, just in time to see Agatha’s own snap shut when she gets there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unsure where she’s allowed to touch, Rio’s hands have remained by her sides, just in case Agatha gets mean again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Huh, thinks Rio, for some reason Agatha being mean to her </span>
<em>
<span>during </span>
</em>
<span>sex is a </span>
<em>
<span>lot </span>
</em>
<span>more appealing than out of it. She doesn’t know what it says about her when a split second later, she creeps a hand up Agatha’s leg from her ankle all the way to her upper thigh. Agatha’s hand tightens in her hair the higher she goes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she reaches the soft, sensitive crease between the top of Agatha’s thigh and her hip, Agatha catches her wrist, holds tight as she pulls Rio’s head away from her cunt, forces her to look up at her. Rio has never felt more pitiful, staring up at Agatha, eyes wide as she tries to lean back in, a whine catching in her throat. Rio has </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> been more turned on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you planning to do with that?” Agatha says, eyes flickering over to Rio’s caught hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I—” Honestly, the extent to Rio’s plan ended here with Agatha’s sharp eyes looking down on her in disappointment. She’s learnt more about herself in the last twelve hours than in the rest of her sexually active past. She wracks her brain for </span>
<em>
<span>something, </span>
</em>
<span>“Inside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches as the corners of Agatha’s eyes tick up, even as the rest of her face doesn’t change. She loosens her grip on Rio’s wrist to grasp her fingers, folding down her fingers bar her middle two, which she presses together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tests her luck, “I thought you </span>
<em>
<span>preferred</span>
</em>
<span> more girth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unless you want me out of commission, we’ll start here,” Agatha presses Rio’s fingers to her own lips—she folds, takes them into her own mouth, wetting them for Agatha, “You’re the only one who’s done this for over a year. Forgive me for being a little cautious.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The only one.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, hand still wrapped around Rio’s wrist, pulls her fingers free, brings them in between her legs and loosens her grip, “Make me come, and I’ll </span>
<em>
<span>consider </span>
</em>
<span>paying you back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that incentive, Rio noses up against Agatha’s inner thigh, watches her cunt clench in anticipation as she spreads her open. At Agatha’s impatient huff and a roll of her hips, Rio pushes in with both fingers, revelling in the feeling of having Agatha stretch around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once she’s in as deep as she can get, she waits two beats before she slowly pulls out, unblinking as her fingers come back soaked. She can </span>
<em>
<span>hear </span>
</em>
<span>how wet Agatha is when she pushes back inside, shivers as her brain begins to fog over. Rio fits her mouth back to Agatha’s clit, eager for possibly the first time in her life, to overwhelm herself as quick as humanly possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio speeds up when she hears Agatha’s answering hum, feels Agatha’s nails scrape through her hair, moving it out of her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like you </span>
<em>
<span>much</span>
</em>
<span> better with your mouth occupied.” Agatha hisses, hips coming down to meet every one of Rio’s thrusts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fucking rude, Rio thinks, and—as punishment, lightly bites Agatha’s clit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, a freak apparently, lets out a sound unheard before by Rio—high pitched and uncontrolled as she comes, clenching </span>
<em>
<span>tight </span>
</em>
<span>around Rio’s fingers, body slumping onto the counter. The hand that was in Rio’s hair leaves to scramble for the surface so she doesn’t fall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wonders how much she can get away with—doesn’t slow down her thrusts, sucks over Agatha’s clit to soothe it and it’s not long before Agatha’s coming again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She brings her down slowly after the second orgasm, unoccupied hand coming to hold Agatha’s hip to steady her as she pulls her fingers out, watches how when she does, Agatha’s own come and her spit drips down her thigh. Rio blinks, breathes deep and heavy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brings her foot down from where she’d propped it up, not yet meeting Rio’s eyes, head still tipped toward the ceiling as her breathing regulates. Once recovered she lowers her gaze, makes sure Rio’s looking at her as she swipes a thumb across Rio’s lips. She pops it into her own mouth, moans at the taste—her taste, before releasing it, pushing Rio away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She walks around Rio, picks up her pants and underwear, slinging them over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scrambles to stand, “Hang on, you said—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh! You thought I meant now,” Agatha smirks, clearly having been looking forward to this, “No, no. You’ll have to wait for your reward, I have places to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lost for words, Rio watches Agatha’s ass as she heads to the bathroom to clean herself up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For fuck’s sake, she’s going to have to up her game if Agatha’s going to carry on like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tips her too cold coffee down the drain, needs to wait for Agatha to finish up in the bathroom, then spies Señor Scratchy out of the corner of her eye—Jesus, </span>
<em>
<span>fuck, </span>
</em>
<span>was he there this whole time?</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stare each other down before Rio, not one to concede to a rabbit, approaches, leans down and says, “Yeah, I fucked your mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His nose twitches and he hops away from Rio, who feels maybe a little disproportionately pleased with herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha does, as it turns out, have places to be. Rio’s not privy to </span>
<em>
<span>where </span>
</em>
<span>she is, but the big smile on her face when she comes home late in the afternoon clues her in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guess who’s finally, </span>
<em>
<span>finally</span>
</em>
<span> getting rid of her fucking god awful wife?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm,” Rio looks over to Agatha from the sofa, tilts her head in mock thought, “Helen?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, ha ha.” Agatha flops down next to Rio, slaps her arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, she’s finally agreed to sign?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums her assent, “Just had to change a few things in the, uh, terms, but yeah. She’s gonna look over it properly and then hopefully by the end of the week,” She claps her hands together, “Divorced.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>God, what Rio wouldn’t give to know what happened there. But she knows that would be like asking a magician to reveal his secrets—Agatha would never share with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was Helen really that bad?” Is what she settles on, allows Agatha to tell her as much as she wants.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sucks a breath in between her teeth, “No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alright, so she doesn’t want to tell her very much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she starts up again, “No, she was alright, I’m just projecting, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks, “So </span>
<em>
<span>you’re</span>
</em>
<span> the god awful wife?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lip twitches, “She would say so, yes. I think maybe I’d say so too,” She looks lost in thought for a moment; Rio wants to be inside her mind—but then she quickly sobers, “I mean, she wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>great. </span>
</em>
<span>We just… weren’t super compatible by the end.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods along even though she doesn’t really know what Agatha means by that. She thinks back to what Agatha had said this morning, “Is that why you guys weren’t, uh… having sex?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s funny, she can hear Agatha swallow before she answers, “A little. We, uh, wanted different things.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, not wanting to push further in case she tips Agatha back into her defensive preset, leaves it there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was thinking—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fucking hell, not again.” Rio says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was </span>
<em>
<span>thinking,” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha speaks over the top of Rio, glares at her, “Maybe you’d wanna come with me to view some houses?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Houses?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you dense? Yes, houses. If I’m finally going to get my share of the money, I’d like to move out of here as soon as I can.” Agatha shrugs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Surely Rio’s the last person Agatha should want to take house shopping; she knows she’s repeating herself but, “You’re going house shopping and you want me to come with you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks a little like she’s regretting bringing it up, exaggeratedly readjusts on the sofa until her whole body is facing Rio, head resting against the backrest, “Do I look like someone who enjoys being bored out of her mind? This way you can listen to the important details like, oh, I don’t know… what condition the fascias are in and if the walls have sound structural integrity, while I can have some fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fun?” Rio raises her eyebrows, amused, “What exactly makes good fun for you? Killing the neighbors before you even move in?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio feels a little like she’s fallen into a very obvious trap when Agatha smirks, “I don’t know, Rio,” She leans forward just a little, voice dropping to something low and sultry, “A little death can be fun sometimes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chews on the side of her tongue, trying to decipher Agatha’s meaning, “Right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smirk wavers, “A little death, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffs, all amusement gone from her expression, “Like an </span>
<em>
<span>orgasm,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio,” And Rio can feel heat prickling up the back of her neck, “Oh my god, were you never properly socialized?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh!” And, well, uh—maybe she wasn’t, “Like… now?” Rio says, and clambers to say something else—something less desperate sounding, “Or at the viewing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And it must be the right thing to say because Agatha moves in close, close enough that Rio can feel her hot breath on her cheek as she exhales, “I’ve been told I’m greedy,” Rio’s been so caught up in watching the subtle expressions on Agatha’s face that she hadn’t spotted the wandering hand until the button on her pants is popped open, and the sound of her zipper being lowered breaks her out of her trance, “Why not both? I do </span>
<em>
<span>owe</span>
</em>
<span> you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand strokes across her lower abdomen, touching skin and the waistband of her boxers all in one, “You’re free on Thursday, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tries to stop the shiver wracking her body to no avail. She needs to regain some control, “I can be… if you make it good for me,” She says, echoing Agatha’s sentiment from this morning back at her, “Fair’s fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha digs her nails, still a little long, into Rio’s stomach, and—fuck, she really needs to get this control thing on a leash because </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span> is her first thought that she hopes to see little crescent moons there in the morning? </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I take it back,” Agatha says, “For that, I don’t think you’re getting anything.” She doesn’t remove her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hums, blinks away the fog and, in a spell of cockiness, says, “Yes, but I made you come </span>
<em>
<span>twice</span>
</em>
<span> this morning. So,” She lets the confidence wash over her, grabs Agatha’s hand and dips her fingers underneath the waistband, just so that her fingers are grazing the hair there, “In the spirit of keeping things nice and even, if you just take one away, I think you’ll find I’m still owed </span>
<em>
<span>one</span>
</em>
<span> orgasm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t quite know how she’s managed it but even as she takes her own hand back, Agatha’s remains, “Well,” Agatha licks her lips, lets her gaze fall from Rio’s face to where her hand is visibly inside Rio’s pants, “Just because I’m a nice person.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you—and I say this with the amount of respect that you are owed from me—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So a lot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever helps you sleep at night,” Rio sends up a silent prayer to a God she doesn’t believe in for the way she keeps her cool, even as Agatha’s hand dips down to feel how wet she is, “You are </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> a nice person.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha presses a finger harshly to Rio’s clit, “I think in about three minutes you’ll find I’m a </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> nice person.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Three?” Rio says, absolutely not struggling for air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grins, “Two, then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio forgets entirely to respond then when Agatha’s clever fingers rub precise circles over her clit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In a way, she still feels like she’s won.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On Thursday, Rio very kindly does leave her schedule open for Agatha. There’s an open house only a five minute drive from Rio’s apartment, and Agatha has viewings booked at two others.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, though unsure how much she can really take being around Agatha for an entire day, agrees to take Agatha out for coffee first, mostly because if she isn’t caffeinated, the little deaths Rio has been regularly receiving since the weekend threaten to become big deaths.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s not sure how interested Agatha actually is in either of these houses. At the open house, while Rio is dutifully feeling the walls for any signs of damp, and inconspicuously placing marbles in different rooms to check for sloping, Agatha spends the time fucking with the real estate agent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>An hour they’re there for—a whole </span>
<em>
<span>hour</span>
</em>
<span> of Rio trying to gather as much important information as she can for Agatha before she decides there’s something </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> important stopping her from buying this house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(“Are these the original finials?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um… I would have to check with the homeowners. I don’t believe anyone’s ever asked me that question before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, don’t worry—I’m something of an expert.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In… fini—oh God, ma’am, please climb down from there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nevermind, I can see they’re cheap and tacky. Come on, Rio, we’re leaving.”)</span>
</p><p>
<span>The second house is no better.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s beautiful—a Victorian build. Probably a little too big for Agatha on her own, but what does Rio know? She could probably count on </span>
<em>
<span>bigger is better</span>
</em>
<span> being words Agatha lives by.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seems a lot more interested in this one, seems to actually be looking around rather than just humoring the poor real estate agent, who still seems a little intimidated by Agatha, even though he currently has no reason to be. Maybe there’s like, a real estate agent group chat and an SOS alert has already been sent out by the mustachioed man from the open house, warning all of New Jersey of the severe looking woman in the long coat and heels.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness </span>
<em>
<span>should</span>
</em>
<span> come with a warning, honestly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They’re in the kitchen when Rio spots a hole in the baseboard, silently points it out to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are there </span>
<em>
<span>mice</span>
</em>
<span> living here, Arthur?” She points to the hole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s </span>
<em>
<span>Todd,</span>
</em>
<span> actually</span>
<em>
<span>.</span>
</em>
<span> And no, they’ve all been cleared out, I think the family just haven’t found the time to fill the hole in yet.” Arthur or Todd says, diplomatically.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tuts, stalks over to the hole and presses the tip of her heel to the baseboard, “Hm, I don’t know how I feel about sharing with rodents.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, because they’re so much worse than </span>
<em>
<span>other</span>
</em>
<span> burrowing mammal you live with.” Rio interjects with an eye roll—this is clearly Agatha’s way of dramatically calling the tour to an end.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you see what I have to put up with, Art?” Agatha gestures toward Rio with a flourish, ignoring the way he tries to correct her on his name again, “She constantly equates my </span>
<em>
<span>son</span>
</em>
<span> to a </span>
<em>
<span>rodent.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t bother trying to hold back her sigh, just folds her arms across her chest and waits for this to play out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I, uh, I see you and your wife have a lot to discuss,” Rio’s stomach threatens to bottom out then, “I’ll email you with some more detai—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t bother,” Agatha says, grabs hold of Rio’s bicep, squeezes lightly, “I don’t share.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio is promptly dragged out of the house and back to her truck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t say a word, face hardened as she keeps her hand wrapped around Rio’s arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha—” She starts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Quiet.” Is all she gets back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knows it must have been hard to hear that—wife. Knows Agatha’s mind would have gone to Helen, knows she’s probably thinking about her old life, the one that’s ending this week.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s seen Agatha angry, she’s seen her frustrated, she’s seen her disgusted. She’s never seen the expression that covers every inch of Agatha’s face right now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha only lets go of Rio when they get to the truck, door slamming shut as she shoves herself into the passenger side of the bench seat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Drive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t hesitate to throw the car into gear. She drives for a minute with no clear direction, “Home?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She side eyes Agatha, sees her jaw clench and unclench before she says, “Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air in the car feels stagnant—the tension Rio hasn’t felt between herself and Agatha for a while commanding her attention once more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s only a few minutes from her apartment when Agatha instructs her to take a diversion, and Rio—not in the mood for an argument, does as she asks, letting Agatha direct her to a quieter part of town.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pull over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio does as she’s told. There’s not much around, she sees when she turns the key, a now disused factory is the only thing of note. Beside her, Agatha is flapping to get her coat off, grunting when her movements are limited by the space. Once freed, she runs her hands through her hair, breathes heavy, strain still evident on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She takes a final deep breath, calmer now, before looking over to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And though Rio feels a desperate need build up inside of her to taunt, to ridicule Agatha for this outburst, she can’t bring herself to actually do it—unwilling to be the one to crack the very brittle foundation of their somewhat positive relationship.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio can do something stupid like </span>
<em>
<span>comfort</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha, the other woman is lunging for her, hand wrapping around her neck as she shifts across the bench to come and straddle Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need you to fuck me,” Agatha says, unbuttoning her own pants in some sort of frenzy, “I want as many fingers as you can fit inside me,” Rio moans at her words, already picturing it, slots her mouth to Agatha’s neck and hums over the sharp taste of her perfume, “I wanna fucking </span>
<em>
<span>feel</span>
</em>
<span> it in the morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s the first time Agatha’s handed over control like this to Rio, hasn’t dictated her actions, hasn’t belittled her as she undresses herself, has </span>
<em>
<span>trusted </span>
</em>
<span>Rio enough to let herself go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even in the middle of the afternoon, the sun warming the car through the windows, Agatha’s willing to slip her pants down her legs in search of just the right angle to get what she wants.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She is pure, molten heat, moaning with her head tilted back as Rio unthinkingly marks her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(It’s quite easy, it turns out, to fit four fingers inside of Agatha when Rio’s biting at her neck and moaning in her ear about what a whore she is for wanting to be fucked in public.)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s divorce papers come back to her signed the next day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice and Jen kindly offer to host a small get together in celebration next week when they’re all available.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But for now, Agatha celebrates on the sofa, Rio on the floor between her legs with the promise to make her come as many times as physically possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And if Agatha follows Rio to her bedroom that night, slips into crisp sheets in nothing but one of Rio’s freshly washed work t-shirts, neither of them mention it past Agatha bitching about her sore back from sleeping on the sofa for so long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Two days later, on the second day of them painting John’s house, Rio experiences the consequences of her own actions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I ran into Agatha on my lunch before.” Billy says, steadily working his roller over the wall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He says like I don’t live with her and coming to work isn’t my only chance of respite,” Rio says, watching him work out of the corner of her eye as she feathers the edges of the next wall, ready for him to roll, “But go on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had trusted him with the ceiling yesterday and he’d done an impressive job for his first time; the way his eyes crinkled and mouth tugged to the side to hide his smile when she’d told him that was absolutely worth it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was wearing a turtleneck </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> a scarf,” He says and Alice’s head pops round the corner, their words easy to hear in the emptied out, echoey room, “It’s not even cold out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s excitement is palpable even as Rio turns away from her, unable to look either of them in the eye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think we know how </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span> celebrated the divorce.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice!” Rio says, gesturing to Billy, who looks just as excited as Alice does at the thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, sorry,” Alice tugs her lips into her mouth like without doing so would have the words spilling out like water. And then she decides she doesn’t care too much to stop it, “But do you think she did?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to think about it.” Rio turns away, hoping she’s outwardly showing disgust even as her ears get hot and the phantom feeling of Agatha’s hand tugging her hair is all she knows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But did she go out on Friday night?” Alice says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The question makes Rio panic, heartbeat in her fingertips. If she says yes she’s lying, and even worse, she’s practically confirming Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> sleep with someone—someone that isn’t her. She doesn’t know why the thought curdles in her belly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she says no though, she runs the risk of them being found out. They’ve never had an explicit conversation about keeping their whole… thing private but Rio feels it’s implied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know.” She says, to keep things neutral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice groans, “You’re no fun. I really thought this whole living with Agatha thing would bring out the gossip in you. You’ve never held back in talking about her before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And—that can’t be true, can it?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio uncomfortably grinds her teeth together as they get back to work, thinks about how she </span>
<em>
<span>used</span>
</em>
<span> to talk about Agatha when she wasn’t around and well, yes maybe there’s some truth to Alice’s words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But that doesn’t </span>
<em>
<span>mean</span>
</em>
<span> anything. Just because she’s sleeping with Agatha now, doesn’t mean she feels any differently about her. She knows she doesn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s relieved to find that when she focuses on the thought of Agatha, her chest, her stomach, her head, her heart all tell her the same thing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She feels the same way about Agatha as she always has.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In the week between almost letting slip their secret and going to Jen and Alice’s house for what Agatha says is a much needed celebration, Rio thinks she has more sex than she’s ever had in her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Since Agatha had been willing to hand the reins over to Rio in her truck, it’s happened more often.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s had Agatha on her bed, one of her hands pinning Agatha’s wrists together above her head as she works her up again, and again, and again, before caving to Agatha’s pleas to let her come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s had Agatha on her knees in the shower, hand curling into the wet hair at the back of Agatha’s neck, moans vibrating through her cunt from Agatha tasting her for the first time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(That had been an interesting evening. Rio had come home from a job, sweaty, dusty and covered in flecks of paint, with the intention of heading straight to the bathroom for a much needed shower.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had barely let her cross the threshold before her hands were on her body, untucking her t-shirt from her dirty work pants and running her hands across her abs with a groan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had no idea what had gotten into her but Agatha was </span>
<em>
<span>desperate,</span>
</em>
<span> pupils blown and swallowing up the blue of her irises.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the longest she’s been around Agatha without her speaking, incapable of doing so with her tongue pushing as deep into Rio’s cunt as she could get it. She kind of missed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once Agatha had made her come twice, one of her hands between her own legs to get herself off, she stood on shaky legs, sneered at Rio and said, “You need a fucking wash, you’re filthy.” And promptly left Rio to her shower.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hasn’t experienced a better feeling than this right now though—Agatha bent over on her hands and knees in the middle of the bed—the bed they’ve been sharing since Agatha’s divorce papers came through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had become very comfortable very quickly with rifling through Rio’s things, and it was really only a matter of time before she found the box of sex toys Rio kept under her bed.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Ah, </span>
</em>
<span>fuck, </span>
<em>
<span>fuck, </span>
</em>
<span>Rio, deeper—” A moan rips through Agatha’s chest and cuts her off as Rio pounds her hips against Agatha’s ass, gets her cock as deep inside her as she can.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They’d been getting ready to go over to Jen and Alice’s, Rio stealing glances at Agatha’s bare body as she did her makeup in Rio’s mirror, citing it as having the best lighting, in nothing but her underwear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio had been doing a remarkably good job of keeping herself controlled, if she does say so herself, but there’s only so much she can do when Agatha slips a deep purple, long satin skirt up her hips, catches Rio’s slack jawed expression in the mirror and sending her a wink with the explanation—easy access.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only seconds later did Rio have that skirt bunched up around Agatha’s hips, telling her to be patient as she set out to grab her harness and strap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You take it so fucking well, baby.” Rio hisses, presses her shirt to her stomach so she can see how Agatha’s cunt looks around her. She punctuates her words with a light slap to Agatha’s ass, not hard enough to cause her any pain if she’s not into it but—</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh,</span>
</em>
<span> fuck, harder, harder, </span>
<em>
<span>please</span>
</em>
<span> harder—” Rio feels herself slip into some sort of melty brain fog, grips Agatha’s hip with one hand to steady herself and delivers a harsh slap to Agatha’s ass with the other, Agatha’s moans choking off in a wet groan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I bet it fucking kills you, doesn’t it?” Rio says, smoothes a hand down Agatha’s back before spanking her again, watching the skin start to pink a little under her palm. Agatha makes a vaguely questioning noise and she takes pity on her, “I’m the only one who can fuck you like this, and that kills you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the Agatha of last week, who would have snapped at her for less than that is nowhere to be found. Instead, Agatha keens, drops to her elbows and presses her mouth to the inside of her own arm, babbling incoherently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio fists a hand in her hair, tips her head back to free her mouth, “I can’t hear you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha whines, shifts her hips back to meet Rio’s thrusts, “Only one, you’re—</span>
<em>
<span>fuck,</span>
</em>
<span> you’re the only one.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio knows it’s just dirty talk, that it doesn’t mean anything, but the idea of being the best Agatha’s ever had—better than her wife even when they were at their best, is a heady thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just like outside of sex, once Agatha gets going she can’t seem to stop. Rio’s hand stays in her hair, keeps her head raised so that she can hear Agatha make what must at this point be involuntary pleas and demands, throat tight and words rough.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh,</span>
</em>
<span> fuck, Rio, you’re so fucking deep—so good, </span>
<em>
<span>fuck,</span>
</em>
<span> love how you fuck me, love how you—</span>
<em>
<span>fuck,”</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha almost sounds like she’s being brought to tears by it, overwhelmed by everything she’s feeling, </span>
<em>
<span>“Please</span>
</em>
<span> make me come, Rio, make me come on your cock.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groans, speeds up her hips, wishes she could </span>
<em>
<span>truly</span>
</em>
<span> feel Agatha’s grasping cunt, and lets go of her hair, Agatha’s head falling back down to the mattress as she seeks out her pulsing clit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It doesn’t take long then for Agatha to tip over the edge, shuddering against the mattress, Rio slowing down her thrusts so as to not overwhelm her, wants to prolong her pleasure, </span>
<em>
<span>wants</span>
</em>
<span> to be the best Agatha has ev—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes the thought loose as Agatha comes down, almost collapses on the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulls out gently, works the harness down her hips, then presses a palm to Agatha’s spine, “Good girl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That seems to break Agatha out of it and she rolls over, snarls at Rio, “I’m not a </span>
<em>
<span>pet,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just rolls her eyes, used to this by now, and hums as she wets her thumbs in her mouth, brings them to swipe under Agatha’s eyes at her smudged makeup.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think we’re going to be late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And whose fault is that?” Agatha groans, pushes Rio away and then lets her eyes fall to Rio’s hips, “You should have kept that on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Around our friends?” Rio laughs, hysterical, picks up her pants and pulls them back on, tucking her shirt in, “Yeah, no thanks, I’m not looking to be caught like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs, “You’re so boring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knows what Agatha’s trying to do but she won’t let herself be baited like that. She only begins to regret it when, on the drive over, her thoughts are consumed with images of Agatha reaching over and stroking her through her pants.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hours later, they’re spread around Jen and Alice’s living room, across their two sofas with wine glasses in hand, bar Rio—the chosen one, sitting cross-legged on the floor with their cat, Tiramisu, curled up in her lap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Rio, I’ve been meaning to ask,” Wanda starts, pokes Rio’s hip with a sock covered foot, “Billy said work ran late last Sunday, but he came home wearing this denim jacket I’ve never seen before, so I just wanted to check how true that was.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitates—she doesn’t want to rat Billy out, but she’d kind of assumed Wanda would have known about the suspected boyfriend. Then again, from a safety aspect, his mom didn’t know where he was or who he was with and he </span>
<em>
<span>lied</span>
</em>
<span> about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her silence proves to be an answer in itself, “I </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> it!” Wanda throws a fist in the air, vindicated, “Well, I mean, I’m going to need to have a talk with him about lying to his mother, but his first </span>
<em>
<span>boyfriend, </span>
</em>
<span>my god, this is so exciting!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who, Eddie?” Agatha scoffs from where she’s tucked up against the arm of the sofa, swirls her wine around in her glass, oblivious to the way everyone’s watching her in shock, “Yeah, that kid’s not Billy’s first boyfriend, but it’s cute that you thought that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>knew?”</span>
</em>
<span> Wanda throws a piece of dried mango—her idea of a good snack, for some reason, at Agatha, who dodges easily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, calm down, it’s not like he’s doing anything dangerous,” Agatha waves a hand, “I would have </span>
<em>
<span>told</span>
</em>
<span> you if I was worried.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But he told you?” Wanda looks a little upset at this and Agatha—uncaring of anyone else’s feelings but her own, softens.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda, no,” Agatha holds eye contact with Wanda from across the room, “I figured it out. And I asked him about it because </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> said we’re supposed to be, like, his aunts, or whatever else overly emotional shit you called us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen pulls a face and Lilia looks seconds away from trying to ward off some kind of evil.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ew, is this what divorce does to you, Harkness?” Jen says, shaking over dramatically, “You have </span>
<em>
<span>feelings</span>
</em>
<span> now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, I hope not.” Agatha mumbles into her wine glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Speaking of which,” Lilia says, a small gleam visible in her eye, “Are you finally going to dish about what happened, or am I going to have to get the tequila for you to spill your secrets again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The group descend into laughter, Agatha sulking in the corner, middle finger held out at them while she necks the dregs of her wine. Tequila was one of Agatha’s only known weaknesses, and was notoriously what had got her sharing about what she enjoyed in bed, all those years ago—things Rio is now intimately aware of.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If someone had told Rio at age twenty-eight that she’d have first hand knowledge of just how many fingers Agatha Harkness prefers to have inside her, she would have laughed in their face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come </span>
<em>
<span>on,</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha,” Alice tips in Agatha’s direction, leaning with a hand on Jen’s thigh to aid her, “Do you even understand how hard it’s been for us </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> to ask questions?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, and now you’re done respecting my privacy?” Agatha sniffs and fills up her glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Honey, please just give us </span>
<em>
<span>something, </span>
</em>
<span>we’re dying here.” Lilia grips Agatha’s arm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groans, tips her head back against the headrest, offers Rio a glorious view of her neck. If she focuses, she can just about see where her mouth had sucked hickies—</span>
<em>
<span>hickies,</span>
</em>
<span> like she’s a horny teenager, into Agatha’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s not much to tell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bullshit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s not!” Agatha plays with the end of her hair, watches herself wrap it around a finger, turning the tip of it purple as she cuts off circulation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blames the wine for the way she finds herself wanting to re-mold herself around the pulse it must have created.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looks away, cuts the urge off at the root.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia jokingly slots a finger to the bottom of Agatha’s glass, forces it gently back up to her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth twitches as she appeases Lilia, taking a long sip, “We’d been… separated for a while before the divorce. I guess I never told you guys,” She looks down, smoothes her hand over her skirt, ridding it of imaginary wrinkles, “We just… couldn’t get past it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a beat of silence as they all wait for her to continue, but when it becomes obvious she isn’t going to, Wanda says, “Get past what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha levels her with a look, “The thing that made us separate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God, Agatha, it’s like pulling teeth with you. </span>
<em>
<span>What</span>
</em>
<span> made you separate?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something happened,” Agatha huffs, “When we were in bed together. The </span>
<em>
<span>last</span>
</em>
<span> time we were in bed together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>If Rio wasn’t invested before, she certainly is now—skin prickling at the information. The thing is, she’s now sort of involved in this, in a strange and twisted way, by involving herself with Agatha in that same way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Again, when she doesn’t elaborate, it’s Wanda who asks, “What kind of something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swears she must be going insane because she thinks for just a split second Agatha’s eyes meet her own, but a blink later and it’s gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I—” Agatha rests her head in her hand, “I said someone else’s name.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And as everyone else bursts out laughing, Rio feels her chest cave into her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She has no idea why—she’s never felt like this before. She doesn’t even </span>
<em>
<span>like</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha so why does the thought of her wanting someone else so badly that she’s thinking of them when she’s getting fucked by her wife, make her feel sick?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Throughout this whole thing, she’s never once found herself thinking of Agatha any different—she knows that for a fact, so what the hell is this?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, Harkness, that’s bad even for you,” Jen’s clutching Alice’s arm, wiping genuine tears from her eyes, “Who was it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> telling you that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it someone we know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck off, did you sleep with her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda and Alice fire off their questions rapidly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I—” Agatha says, voice unsteady, “I wasn’t sleeping with her. I don’t even know why it happened, I didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>want</span>
</em>
<span> to sleep with her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And Helen didn’t believe you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She, uh—” Agatha swallows, harshly, “No. She said she should have expected it. I’m still trying to figure out what she meant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The heavy look evident on Agatha’s face must tell them the conversation is over because the questions stop there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thinks she knows less about Agatha’s divorce now than she did before she’d told them anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment breaks when the baby monitor crackles to life, Alice going upstairs to check on Lucy, the others migrating to the kitchen for more snacks, more drinks, and Rio is left with Tiramisu still on her lap.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She watches Agatha—she’s put her glass down and is holding the baby monitor, intently looking at the screen, probably watching Alice with Lucy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It almost seems like Agatha doesn’t realize Rio’s still in the room with her, and she watches her jump when she says, “At least you didn’t have to worry about kids in the divorce, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks back and forth between Rio and the baby monitor before she puts it back down, running a hand through her thick hair, “That’s one way to look at it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the other way?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closes her eyes with a sigh, perhaps going back to a memory, “I wanted them, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Kids?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods—which… doesn’t seem right. Agatha’s never liked kids; in fact, Rio’s been with her multiple times over the years where she’s </span>
<em>
<span>explicitly</span>
</em>
<span> said ‘thank God I don’t have kids’.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I… never knew that.” Rio says, keeps things as open as possible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just—” She starts then huffs like she doesn’t know the right words, or like she knows them but isn’t convinced Rio’s really the person she wants to be sharing this with. Why </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> she sharing this with Rio?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Helen didn’t want them and I—” Agatha works her jaw, looks up at the ceiling, “She said she didn’t think we’d be good parents. I couldn’t even argue with that—I actually think it’s the one argument I </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> had. My own mother was… well, she wasn’t a </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span> mother. I think we both were convinced I’d turn into her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She holds a hand up, stopping Rio from talking, from comforting her, reassuring her. Rio thinks about how she is with Billy—harsh and mean from the outside, but Agatha possibly understands him more than anyone, treats him like his own person, </span>
<em>
<span>listens</span>
</em>
<span> to him. She thinks about an Agatha with her own child—can’t see her as anything other than loving and protective.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s too late now, anyway. Maybe things could have been different, but I don’t even know if I knew they </span>
<em>
<span>could</span>
</em>
<span> be ten years, </span>
<em>
<span>fuck,</span>
</em>
<span> even five years ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen and Lilia wander in together from the kitchen, and Rio thinks that’s probably the first and last time she’s ever going to hear about that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Living together has done wonders for the two of you. Look, Lilia, they don’t have their hands wrapped around each other’s throats.” Jen says, disbelief coating her tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wonders if Agatha is </span>
<em>
<span>also</span>
</em>
<span> thinking about having her hand wrapped around her throat, albeit in a very different context.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The air feels a little different when they get home that night, a little softer. Agatha heads straight for the sink to pour herself some water, downing the first cup, then fills it back up again before heading over to let Señor Scratchy out of his hutch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She scoops him up, nuzzles her nose in the spot between his ears, “Mommy’s home.” She says before she lets him back down, sits on the floor, back pressed against the sofa just to watch him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s ridiculous that Rio’s used to this by now, and nothing but a smile comes to her lips. She turns away, roots through her cupboard for her mug. Not there. She glances at the draining board—it’s not there either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s about to head to her bedroom to see if she left it there when she sees Agatha take a sip of her water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s mine.” Rio says, a little childish.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulls the mug away from her lips and looks at it, fakes surprise, “So it is,” She smirks, brings it back up to her lips for another sip, “Finders keepers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s, uh… it’s fine. She can just make her tea after Agatha’s finished with it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you free on the weekend?” She says instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilts her head, “I could be. Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just… if the weather’s nice we could drive down to the beach. I want to,” Rio clears her throat, feels a little silly about it, “Add a new rock to my collection.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s the first time Rio’s ever invited anyone to come </span>
<em>
<span>with</span>
</em>
<span> her before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rock collecting, </span>
<em>
<span>really,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio would really love to be able to say that doesn’t hurt as much as it does.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it was stupid. Forget I asked.” She smiles tight, hopes her mouth doesn’t wobble. Fuck’s sake, why is she even upset about this? Agatha is </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> the type of person to take fucking rock collecting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, okay,” Agatha gives her a funny look, “Talking of inviting each other places, Wanda told me there’s a house for sale by her’s, if you wanted to come and have a look at it with me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She should say no, just to spite her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha smiles with her eyes at that—and Rio forgets what she was upset about. She loves Agatha’s eyes, loves how they betray her when the rest of her face remains unmoved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha goes to thei—</span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> bedroom, Rio collects the mug she’d been too lazy to bring back over to the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t bother herself with washing the cup out, just scrolls through her phone while her tea steeps in it. It’s only when later, in bed next to Agatha, she brings it up to her mouth that she notices Agatha’s lipstick stained onto the side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she has time to really think about it, Rio slots her mouth perfectly over the shape of Agatha’s lip left on the mug, takes a sip and before she can destroy the thought, her stupid, stupid brain wonders if it’s the tea or Agatha’s mouth that tastes that good.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The house viewing on Sherwood Drive goes a lot better than the previous ones. It wouldn’t exactly be difficult, seeing as all Agatha needed to do was act like she wanted to be there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It may also have something to do with Wanda being there; Rio should have shoved Agatha in Wanda’s direction and saved herself all this hassle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once Wanda heard Agatha was taking her up on her advice to look at the house this </span>
<em>
<span>Ralph Bohner</span>
</em>
<span> was selling, she took it upon herself to encourage Ralph into swaying in Agatha’s direction. Perhaps she, like Rio, didn’t have high hopes for Agatha doing it herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It also helps that Wanda’s willing to stay and ask questions while Agatha drags Rio around the house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They’re only halfway through touring it when Agatha stops on the staircase, looks down at Rio from her position a few steps above her, “Do you like it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The house?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hums, “Yeah, do you like it for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve only seen half of it,” Agatha huffs at that so Rio shakes her head, looks around and thinks about what they’ve seen so far. She imagines it in colors Agatha likes, expensive fabrics for the curtains and sofa, and tasteful art on the walls, “Yeah,” Rio says, soft, “It feels like you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t have a direct response to that. She purses her lips, then says, “If I bought it, you’d paint it for me, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’d </span>
<em>
<span>want</span>
</em>
<span> me to?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs, “Well, sure, I’ve heard you’re the best. I don’t settle for any less than that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Watch out, Agatha,” Rio grins, “It almost sounds like you </span>
<em>
<span>respect</span>
</em>
<span> me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as Rio thought they would, those words punctuate the end of that conversation, Agatha shaking out her hair as she silently stomps up the stairs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they reach the final room, a bedroom, Agatha barely takes a look around before she closes the door, shoves Rio up against it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, what—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha covers her mouth with her hand, presses close to Rio, one of her legs coming up by Rio’s hip as she starts grinding against her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck is this outfit, by the way?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words are harsh, her face is a sneer, and her tone is mean, but Rio knows Agatha well enough now that she’s not put off by it. She sees right through the act, looks down between their bodies to see Agatha grinding against her belt buckle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t even dressed up today; she’s just wearing a white t-shirt tucked into faded jeans, a brown belt tying it together. Agatha gets turned on by the </span>
<em>
<span>slightest</span>
</em>
<span> thing, it’s actually quite funny.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her grinding doesn’t last long—the action probably born from the desire to grind on Rio’s belt buckle rather than it being something that actually felt good through the thick material of her jeans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She removes the hand covering Rio’s mouth with a warning look, undoes her jeans and grabs Rio’s hand, pushes it down to her wet cunt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do we need to get you spayed?” Rio rolls her eyes, even though she does exactly what Agatha wants, spreading her slick up to her clit to get it wet, “You’re going to get us caught.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t have time to banter with her apparently, grabs Rio’s jaw and looks her dead in the eye, “Be good for me, Rio. Be a good boy, be quiet and make me come.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s words are like electricity through her veins. Her head tips back, thudding softly against the door and her eyes roll back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s pretty sure she blacks out, one hand gripping Agatha’s hip, the other working tight circles over her clit, and her brain echoing </span>
<em>
<span>good boy, good boy, good boy—</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She only comes back to her corporeal form when Agatha jerks against her, muffling the sounds of her moaning through her orgasm in Rio’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she recovers, Agatha pulls Rio’s hand from her pants, takes her wet fingers into her mouth and cleans them, maintains eye contact. It’s a miracle Rio doesn’t pass out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smirks at Rio, looking </span>
<em>
<span>much</span>
</em>
<span> more composed than Rio feels after she’s finished, which doesn’t really seem fair, and says </span>
<em>
<span>thanks,</span>
</em>
<span> before reaching for the door handle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(When Wanda excitedly asks her if she liked the house later, when she’s walking them back to Rio’s truck, Agatha grins and says, “I wasn’t sure at first, but when we got to that bedroom I got some </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> good feelings, you know?”)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On the days Rio isn’t working and doesn’t have plans she likes to treat herself by waking up without an alarm. It’s one thing Agatha hasn’t been able to disturb for her since the other woman has </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> set an alarm the entire time she’s lived with Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(“I don’t dream. Why would I want to cut short the most peaceful part of my existence?”)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Which makes it weird for Rio to wake up to an empty space beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio can begin to wonder where she is, Agatha pushes open the door, two steaming mugs held in her hands, “Oh, you’re awake.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You made coffee?” Rio says, a little disoriented.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need you alive and alert if you’re going to drive me to the beach.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The… the beach?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha points to the window, the gap in the curtains lets in a stream of sunlight, “The weather’s supposed to be nice all day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, are you serious?” Rio says, pushing herself up to make a grab for her coffee.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha shrugs, looks a little bashful, “You came to that viewing with me, it’s only fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha is the last person Rio thought would be concerned about what’s fair, but she’s not going to argue with that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have half an hour before I change my mind.” Agatha says and watches Rio scramble, unwilling to take any chances with that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Being at the beach has always brought Rio comfort. The sounds of the waves crashing, the wind whipping, and the gulls squawking always manages to take her out of her own head for a while—the outside much louder than the inside, for once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once she’d explained to Agatha that the rock collecting thing hadn’t been a joke, she has, to her credit, been trying to help Rio find the perfect one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s not a specific thing she’s looking for, so there’s no wrong answers, which Agatha seems to appreciate—she’s not someone who enjoys being wrong, it’s more just about how she feels when she sees it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha picks up a rock, brushes sand from it and holds it up to Rio who shakes her head after a brief inspection. She only ever takes one at a time, so it has to be the right one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I got Bohner to bring his asking price down,” Agatha says, kicking up some sand, “I think I’m gonna go for it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Strangely, throughout all of this, it’s the first time Rio’s really </span>
<em>
<span>realized</span>
</em>
<span> what viewing these houses means. Agatha is moving out and their relationship is probably never going to be the same again. It’s unlikely when Agatha has her own house again that she’ll be inviting Rio over to watch the documentaries she pretends she hasn’t been enjoying. Rio doubts they’ll even have sex again. It’s a weird thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Are they friends at this point? Or have they just found a balance right now while they have no choice?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows—now’s not really the time to be thinking about this. They’ll cross that bridge when they come to it. They’re adults. They can have a conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, and how did you convince him to do that?” She says, instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I asked him very nicely,” Agatha smiles, too many teeth, “And he agreed because I am a beacon of sunshine, a veritable well of </span>
<em>
<span>good vibes,</span>
</em>
<span> as the kids would say.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Rio squints, “And what’s the real reason?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs, bends down to pick up another rock, cleaning it with her fingers. It seems to pass some kind of initial examination because she reaches for the water bottle in her bag and pours a little onto the rock to properly remove all of the sand, “I threatened him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For fuck’s sake.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shush, he’s fine,” Agatha distracts her by bringing this new rock to her. It’s gray and scratched, part of the edge looks like it’s been gouged out, but there are lovely amber colored veins running through it, “What do you think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s perfect.” Rio answers, honestly, taking the rock from Agatha, fingers brushing in the transfer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s so caught up in admiring the rock, the rock that Agatha found for her, even though she’d practically laughed in her face about coming last week, that she doesn’t notice how close Agatha’s face has gotten to her’s until her nose brushes Rio’s cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stays very still, as if noticing a tiny bird right beside her, knows any sudden moves will scare her off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha presses a little closer, her lips brush the side of Rio’s mouth, just briefly, but that’s all it takes for a shiver to run through Rio, breaking her intent to stay still, and just like that, Agatha pulls away with a sharp inhale.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Was Agatha about to kiss her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>No.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, of course not. That was just her own stupid brain wishing she would.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wait.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wishing she—but Rio doesn’t want Agatha to kiss her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Does she?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s vaguely aware that Agatha’s walking away from her, picking up pace as she leaves Rio stock still.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She can feel herself going numb, starting from her toes and working its way up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio realizes she’s shivering, knows it’s not from the wind, and tries to calm herself down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She can’t though—all she can think about is Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio imagines kissing Agatha, imagines Agatha hadn’t stopped herself. She can see it almost, passersby seeing them and assuming they’re a couple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She thinks of these past weeks with Agatha and is plunged into the startling realization that she can quite easily imagine kissing Agatha at most times.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In her mind she kisses Agatha while she makes them both coffee in the morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kisses Agatha when she comes in from work, Agatha pretending to be grossed out by how dirty from the job she is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kisses Agatha before they go to bed together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kisses Agatha in bed, lying on their sides, pressed close together, bodies so close she can’t tell where she ends and Agatha begins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kisses Agatha as she touches her, as she’s inside her, as she makes her come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Surely she should have known.</span>
</p><p>
<span>How did she not know?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thinks about Agatha now, tries to reconcile </span>
<em>
<span>these</span>
</em>
<span> feelings with her feelings of the past and crumbles to her knees when they fit together perfectly, an almost perfect overlap of years of emotions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knows now why she’s never felt any differently about Agatha since they started sleeping together. It’s entirely, stupidly possible that she might be in love with Agatha—that she might </span>
<em>
<span>always</span>
</em>
<span> have been in love with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stays there for a while, hands cradling the stupid rock Agatha gave her. She hasn’t been able to see Agatha for quite some time, and she doesn’t think she’s coming back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she eventually makes her way back to her truck, Agatha isn’t there either. She checks her phone and has only one message.</span>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Making my own way back. Drive safe.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands are shaking when she unlocks the door to her apartment. She doesn’t immediately spot Agatha, but it’s obvious what’s happening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One suitcase is open, empty, while the other is on the floor, nearly full—clothes barely folded properly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha breezes out of the bedroom, sparing Rio only a quick glance, and otherwise ignoring her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wants to speak, wants to shout to get Agatha’s attention, but she thinks if she opens her mouth her voice will break and she’ll begin to cry, and then the important conversation they need to have won’t be taken seriously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to stay with Wanda.” Agatha says, eventually.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods like a bobblehead, still not trusting her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think,” Agatha can’t even look at her, “I think somewhere along the way things got </span>
<em>
<span>confusing</span>
</em>
<span> and there’s maybe feelings that weren’t supposed to be had,” She knows. She fucking knows how Rio feels, must have been able to see it written across her face. “I don’t think I can ignore it, and I think we need to stop.” Agatha says the words so diplomatically, so devoid of emotion—she still won’t even </span>
<em>
<span>look</span>
</em>
<span> at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She feels fucking sick.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.” Rio forces herself to say, voice predictably breaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This,” Agatha gestures between them, “Was a mistake.” Her lip curls as if the thought of Rio feeling anything beyond lust for her is nauseating.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods again—this, Agatha watches.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turns to go back to the bedroom to get more of her things, and Rio can’t help but take a couple of steps in her direction, pulled in Agatha’s direction like a damn magnet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go away, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she doesn’t, she can’t. She almost bumps into Agatha when she spins in a flurry when she hears Rio’s feet still making noise on the wood floors.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, for fuck’s sake, leave me alone. Stop being so fucking needy, for once,” Agatha snaps, eyes narrowed like how Rio remembers from </span>
<em>
<span>before,</span>
</em>
<span> but it feels worse now, “You’re following me around like a lost puppy. Is that all you are, Rio? A dog?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop it.” Rio forces out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha snarls like a wild animal, bares her teeth, “You’re not going to </span>
<em>
<span>sit,</span>
</em>
<span> and </span>
<em>
<span>stay</span>
</em>
<span> like a good dog, Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop.” The anger builds, suppressing the sadness for now because </span>
<em>
<span>what the fuck?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop what?” Agatha says, and she’s on a fucking roll now, “This is what we do, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Agatha laughs, but it comes out wrong and it grates on Rio’s ears, “So because I fucked you a few times you think we’ve changed?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck off, Agatha, this is pathetic,” Rio bites back, “You’re so desperate to get away from any amount of emotion, you’d rather take us right back to not being friends again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We were </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> friends, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, right, okay,” Rio feels insane, presses her hands to her head, “You know, it’ll probably just go away, anyway. You could have just ignored this until you fucking moved out and we would have been fine!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha has the gall to look furious with Rio for that, and she stops her search for her things, storms past Rio, almost knocking her down as she goes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck you, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches as Agatha picks her bag up from the sofa, grabs a jacket and leaves without any of her belongings, unable to stand even being around Rio now, knowing what she knows, slamming the door behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio collapses to the floor, all adrenaline from their fight leaving her body, making it impossible to hold her own weight. She closes her eyes in a desperate bid to stop the tears from falling but it doesn’t do much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t realize what Agatha not taking </span>
<em>
<span>anything</span>
</em>
<span> with her means until a tiny ball of warmth presses into her side. Rio opens her eyes and sees Señor Scratchy pressing himself against her thigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hesitantly reaches out a hand, waits for him to scamper away like usual, but instead, remains unmoving, lets Rio touch his soft fur. She gets a little brave after that, scoops him into her lap where he remains, as happy as he seems when he’s with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sit like that together in silence for a long while. It’s only when the sun starts to set, darkness cloaking her apartment that Rio realizes she stopped crying as soon as he approached her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Asshole, Rio thinks, affectionately.</span>

</p><p>
<span>She's saying something now—unintelligible, the sound rattling around Agatha’s brain, and it's almost soothing to have a voice in there that isn't her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm?” Fuck, she has no idea what Wanda just said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, honey. Come inside, you're okay.”</span>

</p><p>
<span>“Billy?” Agatha whispers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gets closer, hovers over Billy like a phantom in the night, tries again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes widen and she has to throw a hand over his mouth to quieten him.</span>

<span>“Shush, it's me.”</span>

</p><p>
<span>He does, unquestioning. Good, she still incites at least a little fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha creeps back downstairs, curls back up on the sofa.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It rings—a good start.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Hi, you're through to Helen. I'm not available at the moment, but leave a message and I'll call you back.”</span>

</p><p>
<span>Again, the same.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, third time's the charm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello?”</span>

<span>“It's Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ag—whose phone are you calling from?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A friend's,” Agatha licks her lips. Now that she's here it feels harder than she imagined, “I needed to talk to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you been drinking?” Helen’s voice is tired on the line, “Do you need me to pick you up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, no, I'm fine. I mean, yes I've been drinking, but—” She cuts herself off, she's getting off track and if she doesn't say it now, drunk and fresh off the back of—well, she never will, “You were right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There's a moment of silence as Helen takes that in. Agatha's head spins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right about what, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallows, thick—foolish heart thudding; a new wave of sickness washing over her with every beat, words crashing to the surface, “About Rio,” She hesitates, stuttering like only a fucking loser would do, “About how I feel about her. You were right. I didn’t know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She thinks she hears Helen muttering </span>

<p>
<b>2:07am</b>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha is devastatingly not drunk.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Surprising considering how much she had to drink, but the water Wanda plied her with paired with the conversation she’s forced her ex-wife into about the woman she’s just now finding out she’s apparently in love with is pretty fucking sobering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re </span>
<em>
<span>sure</span>
</em>
<span> she doesn’t want you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughs, ruefully, “Do we really need to rehash what she said to me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, that </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> my favorite part of the story.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes, tries not to bite back. It’s a miracle Helen’s stayed on the phone with her for this long—it’s probably the most civil conversation they’ve had in months, and it’s likely because Helen’s suspicions have been fucking vindicated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever,” She doesn’t rise to it, stays calm and laid back like Helen wished she was throughout their marriage. Let it never be said Agatha Harkness doesn’t get the last laugh. “It’d never work anyway. It’s probably for the best that she doesn’t feel the same way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha runs her tongue across her teeth—she can still taste the mint from when Wanda had forced her upstairs, handed her a still packaged toothbrush and a pair of pajamas to sleep in. Is it stupid of her to miss the taste of Rio’s toothpaste?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wishes she’d had the chance to taste it direct from Rio’s mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That thought feels particularly insane.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’d destroy each other,” Agatha says, needs to get back on track—needs to do as Rio said and get over her, “That’s all I know how to do—you can’t even tell me that it’s not. This is,” She sucks in a breath, “This is what I needed. A fucking reality check. I mean, even if she </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> feel the same way, it would be an inconceivably terrible decision. We’d what? Date for a few months and then inevitably break up and ruin all our other friendships in the process?” Agatha’s frenzied mind concocts images of exactly the type of shit a relationship with Rio would look like.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aga—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” She cuts Helen off, “This is a good thing. Better to know now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hasn’t left her apartment for nearly two weeks. She’d never put Alice out of work so she hasn’t cancelled any of her jobs, just moved a few things around so they’re manageable for Alice on her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s the first time since starting her own business that she’s ever dropped out of a job. Even that time she was so sick, surviving only on powdered chicken noodle soup—the only thing she could stomach, she still turned up for all of her jobs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio was seventeen, after years of being </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> fucking angry—driving away friends and what little family she had left, she told her dad that, for her birthday, she wanted to completely redecorate her bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And her dad, who had spent years fielding slamming doors and silent treatment, her dad who was burdened every single year with not knowing what to get Rio for her birthday because she refused to let him know her, was all too happy to finally get her exactly what she wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the most fun she’d had in months, Rio remembers, picking out color swatches at the hardware store her dad had driven her to in his truck after school.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the most time she’d willingly spent with her dad in a long time, and it took her much too long to realize why he kept reminding her of things she’d forgotten—throw cushions, a rug, a new mirror, just one more framed poster so the balance isn’t off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And when she got home from school one day to find her dad already making a start on the paint, she’d forgotten why she’d ever been so angry with him, picked up a paint roller and asked if he’d show her what to do.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This </span>
<em>
<span>thing</span>
</em>
<span> with Agatha is the only thing that’s ever come between her and her work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she first texted Alice saying she wouldn’t make their next job, Alice had replied with at least eight texts that went unread for only about twenty minutes—enough for Alice to start calling her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next time she dropped a job had Alice banging on her door, begging her to let her in. Rio refused, spoke through her closed door and told Alice she was so sick she was on her deathbed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And honestly the only reason she </span>
<em>
<span>wasn’t</span>
</em>
<span> on her deathbed, wasn’t quite literally withering away was because she still had Tommy’s number saved from when the twins both went to their first house party and Wanda had, in a panicked state, made sure her sons had all her friends phone numbers and vice versa. So she had, even though it wasn’t a service Westview Groceries provided, been getting her shopping delivered to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Stupidly, the only reason she thinks she hasn’t gone entirely insane is because she has Señor Scratchy to talk to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(“What’s wrong, buddy? I know. I miss your mom too.”)</span>
</p><p>
<span>It might be because he’s fucking shallow and she’s the one providing his food now that Agatha is gone, but he’s been a lot more affectionate lately. Or, you know, at least she hasn’t caught him chewing through her internet service cable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s like a line in the sand has been drawn, a truce made of some sort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Or maybe he can see just how pathetic Rio’s become in the wake of Agatha leaving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s sat with him on the sofa, watching another David Attenborough documentary that she’d started with Agatha, feeling pretty smug about the fact that this particular episode of Frozen Planet features those polar bears Agatha had come to love.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Suffice to say, this is one of Rio’s better days—the fact that she knows Agatha doesn’t have the means to watch this without her only adds to her mood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It can’t last though, it never does, and there’s a knock at her door that frightens Señor Scratchy from his place where he’s nestled in the corner of the sofa, scampering out of Rio’s sight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighs, pauses her show, waits for the knocking to taper off. She’s become a little used to this—not the knocking exactly, but Alice, Jen, and Lilia have all tried to encourage her out of the apartment, or tried to persuade her to let them in to no avail, voices crackly over the intercom system.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The knocks grow louder, angrier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stays motionless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” It’s Wanda. It’s the first time she’s visited—she can’t blame her, she wouldn’t want it to be her turn after inevitably hearing what happened from Agatha, “I know you’re in there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tips her head to the back of the sofa with a groan—Tommy must have given her the key to the main door she had made for him. She pads over to the door, adjusting one of her socks that’s slipped too far down her calf, rests her head against the cool of the door, “I’m sick, Wanda.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then you should probably be dead by now with how long you’ve taken off work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t really have a response to that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re worried about you,” She’s heard that from Lilia, “No one’s seen you in weeks.” And she’s heard that from Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” She says to Wanda like she’s said to the others, “Just getting over it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The unspoken ‘it’ being Agatha Harkness, unfortunately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thinks she’d rather </span>
<em>
<span>actually</span>
</em>
<span> be ill.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, I’m not leaving until I see you’re okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s,” Rio wracks her brain, “It’s very contagious. I can’t let you in.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a small moment of silence in which Rio blissfully thinks Wanda might have given up, but then, “Agatha asked after you,” A beat, “And she wants her bunny back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio’s heart fucking </span>
<em>
<span>hurts</span>
</em>
<span> at her name.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck, this was so much easier to cope with when she thought she was just experiencing heartburn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she was forced to rank her friends at this very minute, everyone else would be on an even playing field, with Wanda right down at the bottom for having the audacity to even mention Agatha to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuuuuuuuck.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opens her door, just a crack. She hasn’t ventured past her door plate in so long she can actually discern, for the first time, the weird burnt smell out in the hallway Agatha had mentioned when she’d first moved in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m </span>
<em>
<span>fine,</span>
</em>
<span> Wanda.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>From where she’s pressed, one eye to the crack in the door, Rio watches Wanda tilt her head, “Tommy told me you’ve been getting your groceries delivered.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Does the rule of not having favorites apply to non-biological aunts too?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Either way, Billy’s her favorite now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wrenches open her door, adjusts her sweatpants so she’s not showing the strip of waistband from her boxers that peeks out from where she cuts her t-shirts. Wanda doesn’t need to know she hasn’t done laundry in so long that she’s left with only cartoon character underwear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio steps to the side, lets Wanda inside, avoiding eye contact the whole time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sees Wanda give the apartment a quick once over—probably the most untidy she’s ever seen it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s Señor Scratchy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, he’s around here somewhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She finally manages to give Wanda a brief glance, sees her mouth twitch, “When Agatha found out you haven’t been going shopping she got kind of worried you’d have eaten him by now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets out a small breathy sort of laugh at the thought—a thought she definitely would have had weeks ago, but now, with that damn rabbit as her only company, she’s become a little fond of him, even if it is in a sort of Stockholm syndrome kind of way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t do that. Not now,” Rio scratches her head, “I think we’re kinda friends.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It takes a few seconds of Wanda looking at her before, “You and Agatha? Or you and the rabbit?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows harshly, busies herself with taking a two day old plate to the kitchen, “The rabbit,” She says, able to speak now she’s no longer looking at Wanda, “Agatha and I aren’t friends.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought things were going well with you two.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>hasn’t</span>
</em>
<span> talked to Wanda about what happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A hysteric laugh erupts from Rio before she gets the chance to stop it, “They, uh—well they were.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Biggest shock of the year, by the way,” Wanda picks up the dark green mug from the coffee table and brings it over to the sink. Rio shuts her eyes, thinks of the dinosaur mug shoved to the back of the cupboard that she hasn’t been able to drink from since Agatha left, “I know we haven’t seen you together much, but when Agatha texted me saying her house viewings had been a disaster because of you, I’d assumed you two were on the verge of killing each other. And then I came with you to that viewing, thinking I’d have to act as some sort of buffer, and she just drags you away upstairs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitches; she never should have let Wanda in. She’s gone days without thinking of that final time she had sex with Agatha. It’s so stupid—it was so insignificant at the time, a quick, quiet orgasm given before they expectedly crashed and burned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She said it was a disaster?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She can’t even stop herself from asking the question, barely even caring how pathetic it makes her sound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes roam her face, a look on her face like she’s been handed a locked box with no key and told to open it, “Listen, Rio. I’m worried about you. We all are,” She says, “Even Agatha asked if you were okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha, Agatha, Agatha.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gulps, “She did?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s too close now that they’re in the kitchen—can probably see every microexpression Rio’s face makes, but she’s hemmed in a little where she’s stood, and putting space between them will surely look like running away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She did. And we couldn’t tell her anything because you wouldn’t let anyone see you. Honestly, Tommy’s the only reason we were certain you were still alive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sticks her tongue in her cheek, thinks how best to go about this—how to slacken her grip just slightly on the secret she’s holding, “I’m sorry. We argued.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s it?” Wanda turns her back on Rio, turns on her tap and starts filling up the sink. And Rio knows what she’s doing—has seen her do this on her kids, looking away so they don’t feel as pressured under her gaze, and </span>
<em>
<span>fuck,</span>
</em>
<span> it works, “How’s that any different from how you guys are usually?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We… things haven’t been like that for a little while,” Rio fiddles with a loose stitch on her t-shirt, “But Wanda, this was a </span>
<em>
<span>huge</span>
</em>
<span> fight. It was so bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was it about?” Wanda asks, still facing the sink. She reaches for the pile of dishes and begins washing them, in no immediate rush for Rio’s answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t tell you.” Rio says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda, </span>
<em>
<span>please.</span>
</em>
<span> I can’t tell you. It… it was my fault, but I—I can’t tell you more than that, I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda seems to accept this. Or, at least, she doesn’t push any further—Rio’s grateful either way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s a little less grateful when, later on, after Wanda’s gone home and taken Señor Scratchy back to Agatha, she receives two texts from her:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Wanda</b>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>i’m banning tommy from bringing your groceries</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>please try leaving the apartment</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio would like to reiterate the point she made earlier about Wanda being her least favorite.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The apartment feels a lot emptier without Señor Scratchy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Having him around Rio could almost imagine Agatha had just gone out for the day—she’ll be back home in a few hours, maybe more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t remember her home ever feeling this dead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Days later, Rio is showered, wearing </span>
<em>
<span>actual</span>
</em>
<span> clothes, and is determined to catch Tommy’s eye and bare her teeth at him like a feral fucking mongrel when she passes by his register.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, so whatever—maybe Wanda’s plan to get her out of her apartment for some much needed fresh air had worked; she doesn’t have to be happy about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The familiar chime jingles over her head when Rio pushes the door open, picks up one of the baskets from the stack. She makes eye contact with Tommy as she passes by the register near the door and executes her plan, hums with satisfaction when the show of teeth has him scrambling to pretend he’s busy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Huh, she thinks, maybe Wanda was right about doing her own shopping, she </span>
<em>
<span>does</span>
</em>
<span> feel a little better now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s part way through her list when she rounds the next aisle and sees an all too familiar face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s only viewing her from the side but she’s spent enough time with her over the years—at birthdays, at Thanksgivings, and even at Jen’s semi-famed Christmas get-together a few times, to know that that’s Helen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio curses under her breath, darts to the nearest display—a pyramid of oranges, and angles her body behind it. It’s hard to keep an eye on Agatha’s ex-wife while pretending to be making a serious examination of these oranges, and the minute she loses track of Helen, she panics, whips round to try to spot her and knocks over the carefully stacked fruit in the process.</span>
</p><p>
<span>See, and this is why she should have been left to wallow in peace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio drops to the floor, reaching out for the oranges that are quickly rolling away from her, gathering them by her feet. God, this is so fucking embarrassing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nearly breaks her neck with the speed her head turns to the voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh no.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Obviously, because Rio’s never deserved an ounce of peace in her life, Helen is standing over her, peering down at Rio like she’s insane.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scrambles to stand, dumps a load of the oranges into her basket and markedly chooses to avoid looking directly at Helen, like maybe eyes </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> the window to the soul and Helen will know instantly that Rio’s been fucking her wife, “Oh, uh, hi.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you… okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah!” Rio says, much too enthusiastically—it sort of comes off like she’s the host on a children’s channel, “Just, you know,” She says, toning fake energy down a little, “Buying oranges. Gotta keep my Vitamin C intake up,” What is she talking about? “Don’t wanna get scurvy, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>What the </span>
<em>
<span>actual</span>
</em>
<span> fuck is she talking about?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Helen sort of seems like she regrets approaching her, which is maybe the best outcome she could hope to get from this situation, “Yeah, sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you, um, need anything?” Rio says, starts picking up the remaining oranges and starts trying to rebuild the pyramid, just so she has something to do with her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I heard Agatha moved out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Cool, cool. No, this is fine—Rio’s totally in a good place now, definitely able to handle talking about Agatha to Agatha’s ex-wife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lets out a noise a little like a squeak, clears her throat to cover it, “Where did you hear that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio can see Helen out of the corner of her eye, shopping basket slung over her forearm, a hand on her hip—the picture of composure, “Agatha told me.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Agatha</span>
</em>
<span> told you?” Rio can’t stop the shock coloring her tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She called me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Rio nods more times than probably necessary, “That’s cool. Nice that you can, uh, still talk to each other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She waits for a response Helen doesn’t seem interested in giving—rude considering she’s the one who approached Rio, “She say anything interesting?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A few things,” Helen says, plucks an orange from Rio’s shoddy tower, and Rio chances a look at her. Helen looks entirely unaffected by this whole encounter, “Have you spoken to her?” She says, instead of throwing Rio a bone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. No, I’ve been busy,” Rio says, but her stupid brain doesn’t present her with a lie quick enough, “Like, super, super busy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Helen’s mouth curls into what could be considered a smile, but Rio recognizes it as one of Agatha’s own—a trap laid under the guise of friendship. The thought nauseates Rio, serves as a reminder of just how long Helen and Agatha were together for—long enough for them to mimic each other's mannerisms. She wonders which one of them wore this particular smile first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Buying oranges?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly. Listen, Helen,” Rio moves on quickly so she doesn’t have to linger in her own embarrassment much longer, “We really don’t have to do this. The whole small talk thing. I’m sure this is awkward for both of us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The smile doesn’t drop. In fact, Helen seems to lean into it, “I don’t feel awkward,” She says, “Do </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> feel awkward?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She absolutely does.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio wheezes, “No, no. I, uh, you know what?” She gives Helen a tight smile, and backpedals out of that conversation as fast as she can, “I actually have to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaves her shopping basket next to the haphazardly re-stacked oranges.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck, Rio thinks as she bolts back to her truck, maybe she </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> going to develop scurvy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio texts Wanda to ask if Tommy can be unbanned as her delivery driver, but as Rio refuses to explain </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span> running into Helen was as traumatic an experience as it was, she says no.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The likelihood of running into Helen again is slim but she’s not taking any chances. She grabs her truck keys, her jacket, and her shopping list that she shoves into one of the pockets.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio first drives to the gas station, fills her tank, before heading out of Westview to one of the larger supermarkets in New Jersey. It’s the first time she’s purposefully avoided shopping local—it seems she’s experiencing a lot of ‘firsts’ because of Agatha Harkness, and it’s maddening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It only takes pushing her cart through the sliding doors with one hand patting down her jacket for her list, for Rio to regret leaving the house once again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her steps falter, heart leaping into her throat and obstructing her airway. Rio’s vaguely aware of someone bumping into her with their cart from the way she’s pretty much shut down in the entrance to the store, but she barely even feels it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s like she’s not even seeing what’s really in front of her anymore, wholly dragged back to that moment on the beach with Agatha as her fingers curl around the rock sitting heavy in the bottom of her pocket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tears well in Rio’s eyes but don’t yet fall as she tries to tell her stupid body to cooperate and let go. It doesn’t—her grip only tightens, the hard edges of the rock digging rough into her palm, the joints at the base of her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pain is grounding in a way—easier to deal with the physical than the emotional, and eventually the store’s fluorescent overhead lights start spotting in her eyes again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes herself out of it, wipes the tears gathered in her lower lashes and finally loosens her grip on the rock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d completely forgotten about it—she hasn’t exactly left the house enough times for her to have come across it before.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’ll throw it away, toss it into a neighbor’s loose stone garden path, or bury it underneath similar looking rocks in one of those massive planters that are part of Westview’s initiative to be in with a chance of winning an award at this year’s ‘America in Bloom’.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she does.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On her drive back, Rio parks her truck and heads to one of the flower beds, reaches into her pocket before she has time to think about it and shoves that stupid rock deep down amongst the others, eyes focused on the blue sky above her so she can’t see where it ends up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(Rio only gets as far as the next block before she’s turning her truck around. It’s like she’s tethered to the damn thing because she instantly picks it out, even though she hadn’t been watching for where it ended up, even though she’d purposely buried it </span>
<em>
<span>under</span>
</em>
<span> other rocks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She berates herself for briefly wondering if the invisible string that wraps her heart, that in turn twists around the rock, is long enough to extend to Agatha as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she gets home, Rio smoothes a thumb over the grooves in the rock before placing it on the shelf in her bedroom, tucks it in amongst the others so she can’t see it from her bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her efforts are fruitless however, as even though she has bigger rocks, shiner rocks, more colorful rocks, the only one that catches her eye every time she walks in her room is Agatha’s rock.)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Following Rio’s big boy trip to the supermarket she hypes herself up to return to work, with the caveat that Alice is </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> under any circumstances allowed to ask her anything about her time off sick.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice adheres to this rule, even though Rio can see it in her eyes that she </span>
<em>
<span>desperately</span>
</em>
<span> wants to ask.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It does feel good though, to be back doing what she loves, what she’s good at. Rio gets to, just for a little while, turn her brain off and not think about anything that’s been going on. She blasts her music on her speaker and focuses her attention on lining up the wallpaper she’s hanging. Fuck, she wishes she’d have known sooner that this would help.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There are a number of times throughout the day that Alice opens her mouth with a breath like she’s gearing herself up to say something, but ultimately plays it off as a deep inhale or a yawn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After around the tenth time, Rio sighs, “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Alice clamps her lips shut, eyes wide and trying to appear innocent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You keep going to talk,” Rio gestures to Alice with her utility knife from where she’s stood at the top of the ladder, ready to cut the seam of the paper, “So talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice makes a sort of disgruntled noise, “I know you’ve been avoiding all of us, and I’m not going to ask </span>
<em>
<span>why,</span>
</em>
<span> before you cut me off there,” Alice speaks quicker when she sees Rio’s eyes narrow, “It’s just… it’s Jen’s birthday next week. She likes to pretend she wouldn’t mind if you didn’t come but she would. You’ll be there, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice,” Rio softens, steps down from the ladder so they’re eye level, “Of course I’ll come. I’ve just… been dealing with some stuff, but I’d never let that interfere with something like this,” She nudges Alice’s arm with her knuckles, “Just tell me when and where.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smiles, lips curled into her mouth like she doesn’t want Rio to see how big her smile has grown, “Tuesday, at The Witches’ Road.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not having a big party this year?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice grins, “Don’t tell her I said this, but I think she’s getting to the point where humoring people she doesn’t really like is getting tiring.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pretends to zip her lips shut and throw away the key, and then gets back to work, trying not to think too much about how she’ll be seeing Agatha again in just four days.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio arrives later than she usually would to The Witches’ Road. She’s never felt nervous to be around her friends before but the idea of turning up and not having the maximum number of people there to use as a buffer between her and Agatha is discomforting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She makes her way over to their usual booth, breath hitching as she’s taken back to the night everything changed—when she agreed to let Agatha stay with her. Even the seating arrangement is nostalgic with Agatha tucked away in the corner by the wall, a space left on the opposite end, on the opposite side for Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s kind of hidden behind other bodies and she doesn’t seem to have noticed Rio yet, head resting on the wall and body pressed to the back of the seat—an unimposing image that doesn’t suit her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, Rio!” Jen squeals when she spots her—she must already be a few strong drinks in, and starts trying to clamber over Alice to reach her. Alice very heroically takes an elbow to the face with no complaining, because Jen is afterall, the birthday girl </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> her wife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio meets her halfway, hugs Jen while she’s in Alice’s lap with a laugh, “It’s my birthday.” Jen smiles up at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio chuckles, squeezes her one last time before pushing her gently back to Alice, “Happy birthday.” She passes Jen an envelope with her gift in—a spa weekend at that hotel she loves, that she’d planned with Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She catches Alice’s eye when Jen slips off of her lap into her own seat again to grab her drink, and mouths, </span>
<em>
<span>how much has she had?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Alice winces a little, speaks low, “Well I took her out for brunch at that place that does bottomless mimosas.” And that’s pretty much all Rio needed to know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s about to take a seat when her eyes land on Agatha, who quickly looks at her phone like Rio hadn’t been able to feel her eyes on her the entire time, “I’m gonna get myself a drink.” She'll </span>
<em>
<span>need</span>
</em>
<span> one to get through being near Agatha again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A hand on her shoulder knocks Rio out of her spaciness while she’s at the bar waiting for her beer, and she jolts, Lilia’s face coming into view beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How are you doing, honey?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” She smiles tight, and Lilia gives her one of those disbelieving looks that makes her want to spill her guts—no wonder Wanda’s methods had the same effect, she and Lilia had neighboring lecture theaters when she first moved to Westview, so they probably shared tactics for getting students to tell them the truth, “I’ve been better, </span>
<em>
<span>but</span>
</em>
<span> I’ll be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia sighs, rubs Rio’s shoulder, “I don’t know what happened, and I won’t pry, but you’ll come out the other side stronger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods like that makes any sense to her—she doesn’t think she’s ever felt weaker, but Lilia’s always saying things like that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she gets back to their booth, it’s like these whirlwind weeks with Agatha never happened, like she doesn’t know how Agatha tastes, how she feels, how she smells. It’s almost like she imagined waking up with an arm accidentally slung over Agatha’s waist too many times to count, listening to soft snores that she would match her breathing to in the early hours of the morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The only difference between the Agatha of past and the Agatha of present is that </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha doesn’t engage with her </span>
<em>
<span>at all.</span>
</em>
<span> She removes herself from any conversation whenever Rio has something to add, she ignores any remarks Rio sends her way, and most telling of all is the way she doesn’t argue with Rio, doesn’t try to rile her up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s weird.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t think she’d </span>
<em>
<span>miss</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha’s calculated aggravation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’s Señor Scratchy?” Rio blurts out, sick of Agatha acting like she doesn’t exist. It’s the one topic she can’t ignore.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Agatha says, taps her fingers on the table, eyes darting around the room like she’s making a note of all the escape routes she can’t get to while she’s boxed in, “He’s fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s it?” She can’t help herself—her sadness makes way for the anger she last felt when she saw Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> fine.” Agatha shrugs, takes a sip of her drink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Right. Conversation over, she guesses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kind of zones out after that, chipping in when she’s addressed, but otherwise just trying to get through the night without being made to feel that small again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, it’s a cash purchase so it shouldn’t take too long to complete.” She hears Agatha say a little later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Agatha, that’s so exciting!” Alice says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m just glad to be getting rid of her, she’s a nightmare.” Wanda says with a big grin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s this?” Rio says.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice tuts, “Agatha’s house, keep up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The house on Sherwood Drive,” Agatha says, actually </span>
<em>
<span>looking</span>
</em>
<span> at Rio for the first time tonight, and the mention of the house puts Rio right back there for a moment, “My offer was accepted a couple of weeks ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods, voiceless, she can’t believe Agatha is buying that house. Yes, the house had felt like it was </span>
<em>
<span>made</span>
</em>
<span> for Agatha, but that didn’t change the fact that they had sex in that house, in a room that might become Agatha’s bedroom. How is she ever going to be in that house without thinking of that? How will Agatha?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe she won’t have to, a small voice tells her, maybe Agatha won’t invite her over ever again. And maybe Agatha will replace those memories of Rio with someone new.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re still going to paint it, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice permeates her panicked thoughts, and it takes her a second to even realize she’s talking to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t think that ask would still be in the cards.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallows, throat rough, and stands before she can even think to do it—she needs to be alone for a minute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Rio says, stilted, “Bathroom.” And makes her escape.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She throws open the bathroom door and shoves her hands under the tap, lets the feeling of the perpetually freezing water washing over her wrists bring her back to reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She splashes a little on her face, and just as she’s beginning to settle, the door opens behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She can see her in the mirror, eyes locking like it’s easier to do it with their reflections.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” Rio says, without turning around, doesn’t want to break whatever magic this mirror seems to hold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I,” Agatha clears her throat, “I shouldn’t have asked you that in front of everyone. You don’t have to do it if it makes you uncomfortable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Rio scoffs, breaks their eye contact and switches the tap off, “Is Agatha Harkness actually worried about my feelings?” Agatha’s still looking at her when she looks into the mirror again, “After the way you spoke to me the other week, I wasn’t sure. Don’t worry, I’ll still paint your stupid house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks away—Rio hopes it’s guilt she sees on her face, “I’m not doing this. I didn’t come here for a fight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So that’s it then?” Rio says, turning around, frustrated, lets the alcohol fuel her words, “If we can’t talk like friends and we can’t argue like we hate each other, what then? Are we just going to ignore each other forever?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And instead of biting like Rio thought she would, hoped she would—just to get back a little piece of who they were before, Agatha’s face drops, </span>
<em>
<span>“Fuck,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio. I just need some fucking time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Time,” A disbelieving laugh wheezes out past Rio’s lips, “Right, yeah, because this is all so hard for </span>
<em>
<span>you.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“It </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> hard for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a fucking joke, Agatha,” Rio runs a shaking hand through her hair, and heads to the door, shivering when her shoulder brushes Agatha’s. She stops, hand on the door handle, Agatha at her back, unmoved, and even though she’s so angry she needs Agatha to know, “I hate that I can’t bring myself to regret it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s silence for a moment, and Rio begins to pull the door open when Agatha says, “You don’t?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She drops her hand, gathers the courage to turn around and look Agatha in the eye, “Do you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gives an almost infinitesimal shake of her head, and then, like she’s hesitant about what she’s about to say, inhales sharply, lips parted, “I do regret </span>
<em>
<span>one</span>
</em>
<span> thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The beach, Rio’s mind supplies. The almost-kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods, doesn’t want to hear any more, but Agatha continues, “I just wish I’d known the last time we have sex was going to </span>
<em>
<span>be</span>
</em>
<span> the last time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was… not where Rio thought that was going.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She has absolutely no idea why, knowing what she does now, Agatha feels that way. However, Agatha’s version of the truth is always going to benefit </span>
<em>
<span>her,</span>
</em>
<span> and Rio wouldn’t be surprised if she’d said it just to get under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what?” Rio takes the bait that might not have even been set, “You want a dirty bathroom bar quickie so we can get some fucking closure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t back down, embarrassed Rio’s called her bluff like she thought she would. Instead, she just looks at Rio with wide blue eyes like the thought hadn’t even crossed her mind. She sways towards Rio, eyes dropping briefly to her mouth, which is </span>
<em>
<span>insane.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” She says, tries to break the trance, even when all she can think about is dragging Agatha into one of the stalls, “That would be… such a bad idea.” A monumentally bad idea, in fact. The fuck up of fuck ups.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, no, I know,” Agatha swallows, still too close for Rio to think clearly, “It was stupid. I think I’m just used to that being our default. You mentioned us being friends but the only time we’ve ever really been friends is when we were also…” Rio hopes she manages to keep the surprise off of her face at being referred to as Agatha’s </span>
<em>
<span>friend,</span>
</em>
<span> “I think this… thing between us is only good for sex.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio must have hit her head somewhere between standing up from the booth and coming into the bathroom because having to hear Agatha telling her she doesn’t want her the way Rio wants her should act as a deterrent. Instead, her brain picks out the part that tells her Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>still</span>
</em>
<span> wants her, even just for sex, and </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> nudges all rational thought aside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wraps a hand around Agatha’s wrist and pulls her into one of the stalls, shoves her against the wall divide and it shakes from the impact. Agatha lets it happen, doesn’t fight her for control—just keeps her big blue eyes on Rio’s face as she watches her lock the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reaches for Rio, hands landing on her hips and gently pulling her in—but Rio doesn’t want gentle, </span>
<em>
<span>can’t</span>
</em>
<span> be gentle when she knows she’ll break if she runs her hands over Agatha’s body with feather soft touches like she wants.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rather than lose herself to the thought of something she can’t have, Rio wastes no time, pushes the straps of Agatha’s dress down her shoulders, a soft groan leaving her lips when she notices Agatha isn't wearing a bra. She leans down and laves her tongue over a nipple, one of her hands coming up to cup her breast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It's purely self-indulgent, and something they don't really have time for, but she can't know this is the last time she'll get to have Agatha like this and </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> touch her favorite places.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With much reluctance, Rio pulls back, then hikes one of Agatha’s legs up; the skirt of the dress slides up her thigh at the motion and Rio gets her hand on the new skin available while she pushes her hips against Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasps, eyes fluttering closed as one arm comes to wrap around Rio’s neck while the other presses into the small of her back to encourage the movement of her hips, leg wrapping around Rio’s waist, </span>
<em>
<span>“Please.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“So desperate for it already.” Rio murmurs, nudges her nose against Agatha’s jaw to get her to tilt her head and presses a kiss to her neck. And though Agatha makes the sweetest noise in response, Rio remembers she’s not supposed to be gentle, and so bites down on the skin under her mouth, relishes the way Agatha’s fingers tighten on the back of her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Yes,”</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha whispers, “Want it so bad, hurry up.” She unwraps the hand around Rio’s neck to move the hand on her thigh to her underwear, pressing Rio’s fingers into the already damp patch there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They don’t have time for the teasing Rio had started to love—seeing how much Agatha would let her get away with before she was growling threats in Rio’s ear. She moves her fingers up and slips her hand into the waistband of Agatha’s underwear, fingers spreading her folds and seeking to spread her slick around.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s response is in a jerk of her hips and a chest rumbling moan, hand retaking its place on Rio’s neck to stabilize herself. Rio doesn't notice Agatha’s other hand wandering until her zipper is being pulled down and her pants are being pushed slightly to make room for Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the ‘before’ it wasn’t often that they’d touch each other at the same time—Agatha likes to bask in her pleasure, and </span>
<em>
<span>only</span>
</em>
<span> her pleasure most of the time. But she must know they’re running low on time, and if she doesn’t touch Rio now she never will again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stifles a moan at the first touch of Agatha’s fingers, nips at her jawline. She dips the two fingers that had been stroking Agatha’s clit down to her entrance and pushes in, tries to commit the feeling of Agatha’s cunt adjusting to her to memory.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shushes Agatha when she whimpers, obviously not as concerned about staying quiet as Rio is, but she barely seems to hear her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you have to be quiet, we’re gonna get caught.” She taps Agatha’s cheek to get her attention.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes open, eyelids heavy, pupils consuming most of the color, </span>
<em>
<span>“Please.”</span>
</em>
<span> Is all she says before she speeds up her fingers, circling Rio’s clit the way she loves—slightly off center so it’s not too overwhelming for her. It’s something that had taken past partners months to understand, but merely days for Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thinks it’s probably unlikely that she’s going to be able to quiet Agatha, so her only choice is to make her come as quick as possible—minimize the risk. She pumps her fingers faster, her thumb coming to lightly brush over Agatha’s clit, and she moves her hips in time, Agatha’s fingers losing rhythm slightly. She hopes the mental stimulation of feeling Rio’s hips thrusting in time with her fingers will push her towards her climax, might remind her of how it felt to have Rio </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> fuck her like that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or maybe that’s what you want, huh?” Rio speaks low in Agatha’s ear, “Maybe you wanna get caught,” Rio pulls back just in time to watch Agatha’s eyes roll back before they slip closed again. She leans back in, drags her tongue over the shell of Agatha’s ear, “Everyone here knows us, and you still can’t help acting like a little </span>
<em>
<span>slut,</span>
</em>
<span> just for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knows being degraded is the fastest way to push Agatha towards the edge, and Agatha lets out a loud, needy whimper that Rio can’t even fathom wanting to muffle and then, “Yes, </span>
<em>
<span>yes,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio, </span>
<em>
<span>fuck,</span>
</em>
<span> ‘m your slut, </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> slut—”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh, fuck,”</span>
</em>
<span> Rio lets out under her breath, barely audible, and she can tell Agatha’s close by how her fingers tighten their grip on her neck, how she clenches again and again around the two fingers inside her cunt, how her own fingers are moving without any sort of pattern. Rio doesn’t mind though, Agatha’s noises, her words are enough to get her there anyway, “You’re gonna be good and come for me, aren’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Uh-huh,”</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha whines, hips rocking into Rio’s thrusts now before she says something especially </span>
<em>
<span>cruel,</span>
</em>
<span> “Yours, </span>
<em>
<span>fuck, yours, yours, yours—”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And she doesn’t stop saying it until she </span>
<em>
<span>can’t</span>
</em>
<span> say it, mouth latched onto Rio’s neck, sensitive skin caught between her teeth as she comes. Rio follows a few moments later, rutting against Agatha’s fingers, mind torturously replaying Agatha’s words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pants into Agatha’s neck as she comes down, Agatha doing the same when she finally dislodges her teeth. Selfishly, she doesn’t want to pull out yet, not when she knows it’s really over the moment she does. Strangely, Agatha doesn’t push her away, lets her have this moment as if it’s her final act of kindness.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio breathes in heavy, takes in the scent of Agatha’s sweat and her perfume in the hopes she never forgets it. She knows she has to be the one to end it—it’s not fair on Agatha to make her do it again, and she doesn’t want to look too needy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she can stop herself, Rio presses another soft kiss to Agatha’s neck, a last goodbye, before she slowly slides her fingers out. Agatha follows suit, pulls her fingers from Rio’s pants, and Rio feels </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> stupid at the way her heart clenches when Agatha re-fastens her pants for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t get a chance to panic over how big a mistake they probably just made before Agatha soothes her nerves by saying, “Thank you for that,” She unhooks her leg from around Rio’s waist, “I know it was a selfish thing to want from you, so thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio can only nod, deludes herself into reasoning that if they </span>
<em>
<span>both</span>
</em>
<span> thought they were being selfish, even if it was for different reasons, then they kinda cancel each other out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So we’re… we’re fine, yeah?” Rio’s voice is traitorously wobbly, but she has to know.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha offers a little smile as she readjusts her dress, “Yeah, we’re fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And for all Rio’s inner mind was telling her this was a terrible idea before, maybe she had nothing to worry about. They can put this all behind them, Rio can properly start getting over Agatha, and she can feasibly see them forming a tentative friendship on the back of this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they return to their table, Jen’s up and dancing with Lilia to the music thumping over the shitty bar speakers. It’s not usually as loud as this so she assumes Jen’s bribed Carol so she can dance on her birthday. Jen jumps over to them both, takes one of their hands in each of her’s, “Were you guys fighting?” She shouts over the music.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s immensely thankful for how low the lights are in the bar when she feels her face flush, and even though they’re </span>
<em>
<span>fine</span>
</em>
<span> now, she still can’t look at Agatha when she says, “What? No!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just,” Jen swings their arms as she carries on dancing, “You look all hot and bothered.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s brain doesn’t work fast enough to produce anything more than, “Uhh—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But luckily Agatha cuts in, “That’s ‘cause we’re dancing with you, silly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah.” Jen smiles and lets the conversation drop along with their hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shoots Agatha a grateful, tight lipped smile, heads to the bar, and begins to truly enjoy the night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The days that follow see Rio return more or less to her old self. She washes regularly, she eats proper meals, and doesn’t allow her dishes to stack up. She even washes the bed sheets she hadn’t been able to bring herself to change since Agatha moved out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Things with her friends have been good too—she’s been answering them in the group chat, she’s been vocal in the plans they’ve made to meet up again. She’s even agreed to meet Wanda at her house for a coffee today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(She’d called her earlier in the morning to ask, and when Rio had asked if they were meeting in the usual coffee shop, Wanda had hesitated, just slightly before saying, “Oh no, come to mine, it’s always so busy there on the weekend,” And then, before Rio could interject, “No one is home, either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio knows that’s a polite way of telling her Agatha won’t be there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They’re </span>
<em>
<span>fine</span>
</em>
<span> now though—she told Wanda that, but she’d still insisted.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>So that’s how Rio found herself sitting on Wanda’s sofa with a homemade, almost barista level cappuccino warming her hands, Señor Scratchy snuggled up next to her thigh, waiting for Wanda to get through the egregious small talk she’s making.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once she’s run out of updates on the flowers in Sharon’s garden, Wanda winces, “I actually asked you to come round because I wanted to talk to you about something that we probably </span>
<em>
<span>shouldn’t</span>
</em>
<span> talk about in public.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pauses, “Are you okay? What’s wrong?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda waves a hand, bats away Rio’s concerns and takes a sip of her coffee before continuing, “No, no, I’m fine,” She traces the rim of her mug with a finger, “It’s about you actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me?” Rio says, voice cracking, humiliatingly, “What </span>
<em>
<span>about</span>
</em>
<span> me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, I—” Wanda cuts herself off with a sigh, and Rio watches her face change to resemble something close to pity before she continues, “When we were at the bar the other night… I don’t know if anyone else saw, and I haven’t spoken about this to any—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda…” Rio cuts off her rambling, has a terrible sinking feeling about where this is going.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You had marks on your neck,” Wanda isn’t dissuaded, “Both of you. Listen, you don’t have to tell me anything if you don’t want to, but I’m worried you’ve been going through this big </span>
<em>
<span>thing</span>
</em>
<span> and we all missed it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth opens and closes like she’s a fucking fish, and Wanda scoots closer to her, rests a hand on Rio’s knee in what she imagines a mother’s comfort to feel like.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t a—” She gulps, forces herself to act a lot more nonchalant than she feels, “A big thing. Okay, so we had sex a couple of times when we lived together—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And at the bar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pushes her tongue into her cheek—no need for that, “Yes, fine, and at the bar. But now we’re not. That’s it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead of saying anything right away, Wanda finishes off her coffee as she sits with that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you not ask Agatha about this? She’s living with </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ask Agatha? Are you insane?” Wanda trills, “I don’t have a death wish. Besides, she’d never tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yeah, okay, fair enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It doesn’t matter now anyway. It’s over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda sits with that, leans back from Rio and rests against the back of the sofa. For a minute Rio thinks that’s the end of it, and though it’s exponentially raised her blood pressure, possibly forever, she does feel a little bit of relief that </span>
<em>
<span>someone</span>
</em>
<span> knows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When I came to visit you,” Wanda says, voice cautious, “You said it was your fault—the fight you had.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That embarrassed sick feeling rises in Rio again as she remembers it, and she nods, looks at the empty mug she’s holding in her lap so she doesn’t have to look at Wanda’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m here if you want to talk about it.” Is all Wanda says, not pushing. After a moment she stands, collects Rio’s mug and takes them into the kitchen. Rio follows after a few seconds, feels a little out of her own body as she trails Wanda, leans on the doorframe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda hums to herself as she washes the mugs—she doesn’t seem to know Rio’s there, which is maybe the only reason she’s able to say, “I’m in love with her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches Wanda freeze, washed mug halfway to the drying rack. She recovers, puts it down before turning to face Rio, and it’s evident from her expression that she wasn’t expecting that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s shoulders hunch up by her ears, and she loses all the other words she could use to explain. Wanda doesn’t need them though, she crosses the room and pulls Rio into her arms, just holds her in the tightest hug she’s ever experienced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, on a scale from one to ten,” Wanda says in her ear, “How would you rank the sex?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And they both shake through laughter in each other’s arms then, the fear from someone knowing the truth abating, and Rio doesn’t think she’s ever been happier to have Wanda in her life.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As promised, when Agatha texts her just over a week later, having recently picked up the keys to her new house, to ask her to come out to price up a quote, Rio agrees within five minutes of receiving the message.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Telling Wanda has actually done wonders for her—she no longer feels like a jar filled to the brim with secrets, ready to crack open if jostled too hard, and so having anyone mention Agatha in her vicinity, replying to Agatha’s messages in the group chat, bumping into her in the coffee shop, all no longer fill her with the same body-numbing dread they once did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She heads over there straight after finishing her latest job, still in her work clothes, but she doesn’t think Agatha will mind since she’s planning on redecorating the whole place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>does</span>
</em>
<span> greet her with a stilted </span>
<em>
<span>hello,</span>
</em>
<span> looks her up and down when she opens the front door, but nothing more is said about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately for Rio, Agatha has insisted on following her around the house, pointing out things she wants to change, things she’s excited about, things Jen’s suggested to her. And though she appreciates Agatha’s effort to keep things friendly between them, Rio’s brain is buzzing the closer and closer they get to the bedroom they had sex in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She measures the second bedroom and then, when she gets out into the hall again, looks towards the final door—she’d hoped Agatha would have taken the hint by now, or would have felt the same discomfort running through her veins, but she’s probably not as affected by this as Rio is.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe she’s used to being there now that it’s her house. Maybe the initial unease has worn off. Or maybe she’s just put the whole thing out of her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t know which she would prefer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That one,” Rio points to the half closed door, “That’s about the same size as this other bedroom, right?” She nods her head towards the room they just left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a little bigger,” Agatha pushes on ahead, hand already reaching to crack the door open more, “Don’t you need to measure it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gulps, can see past Agatha into the room, “Well, I can probably just work out the price from what I’ve already got.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks at Rio, and then glances into the bedroom over her shoulder, a look of realization settling on her face, and she bites her lip, nods once and closes the door back over, “Sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a really lovely house, Agatha.” Rio says when they’re back downstairs and she can hear her own thoughts again. She stands on one side of the kitchen island—a literal barrier between herself and Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said it </span>
<em>
<span>felt</span>
</em>
<span> like me,” Agatha says, chin tipped up as though she wants Rio to think she doesn’t really care. Rio feels a little insane with how she knows that now, knows Agatha well enough to know it’s an act, “What did you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I—” Rio’s not sure if there’s a right answer here; whether that’s the one Agatha wants to hear, the truth, or if there’s even a difference, “It’s big,” She starts off with, “You like having space, and you hate feeling trapped.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A curious look passes over Agatha’s face, “Go on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not </span>
<em>
<span>too</span>
</em>
<span> big though, not like your old house. You could probably fill this with all your things and have it feel cozy,” Rio swallows—too late to turn back now, “You’d be close to Wanda and the boys, and I know you’ll pretend that’s a drawback, but we both know that’s not true. It feels like a forever home, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In what way?” Agatha says, walks slowly around the island, drags her fingertips across the surface until she’s next to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s good for you on your own, but,” Rio shakes her head, tries to clear her mind of the images that get shoved to the forefront, “It’s perfect for if you wanna… remarry,” Her eyes snap to Agatha’s, panicked, “Or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches Agatha’s chest heave as she takes in Rio’s words, her eyes roaming all over Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reaches up, touches one of Rio’s cheeks under the tips of her fingers before committing to it, fully cups her face in her trembling hand. Rio, unsure what’s actually happening, stays still and lets Agatha touch her—her thumb coming to brush over Rio’s bottom lip and she exhales shakily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio can feel Agatha’s breath on her own lips she’s so fucking close, and that’s the last thought she has before Agatha’s kissing her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It takes Rio a second to respond, hands grasping Agatha’s hips and pulling her in close. Soft, she thinks—both the kiss and Agatha’s lips. It’s not desperate and confident like the way Agatha is when she touches her. It’s not a lust-filled kiss at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kisses her slowly, thumb brushing over her cheek as she does, breath shaky every time she pulls back for air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What next? Rio’s mind asks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she’s not kissing you because she wants to fuck you, what comes after this?</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s this thought—the understanding that when the kiss ends, Rio will be right back where she was weeks ago, in love with Agatha Harkness and near sick with it, that has her breaking the kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha will </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> let her go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stumbles back, hand wiping away Agatha’s kiss from her own mouth, as she keeps her eyes trained to the floor, knowing if she so much as looks at Agatha again right now, she’ll lean back in again and never be free of this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” She says, voice raspy, “Please don’t do this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, Rio,” She can see Agatha’s feet leave her view as she puts space between them, “I’m so sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“First the bar and now this?” Rio says, tears welling in her eyes, “You can’t just </span>
<em>
<span>kiss</span>
</em>
<span> me, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha’s voice is thick and it’s the only thing that makes Rio look up, watches tears form in her eyes too, “I know I’m being selfish, Rio. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“When all these feelings are involved, </span>
<em>
<span>yes.</span>
</em>
<span> It’s not fair,” Rio pushes a hand through her hair, needs to get it through to Agatha that she can’t keep doing this, “Why won’t you just let me get over you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hears Agatha speak but she’s on a roll now, “Every time I see you it’s like my heart is being ripped out of my fucking chest, Agatha. You can’t just kiss me and expect me to be okay with it,” Rio’s voice rises, and she’s aware she’s on the verge of shouting but she doesn’t fucking care, “What was it you called me? A dog? No. I’m not gonna let you just yank me around like this. You can’t just </span>
<em>
<span>play</span>
</em>
<span> with me like I’m a toy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Agatha,” She holds a hand up, needs to get out of here before she inevitably hands control over to Agatha, “I can’t let you do this to me again.” And she leaves, door slamming behind her before Agatha can even get her legs into gear to follow her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time, leaving doesn’t feel like running away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She doesn’t hear from Agatha for the rest of the day—something that is both a victory and a worry all wrapped in one. Agatha doesn’t like to lose an argument—would fight back until she’s blue in the face, even when she knows she’s wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a knock on her door after the sun has set that has her freezing in place, hand inside a cereal box.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda,” She calls, “That better not be you again, I swear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a brief pause, “It’s Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>What the fuck?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio almost chokes. She pulls her hand from the cereal box, wipes her hand on the leg of her pajama pants, “You still have a key, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Again, a hesitation, “I do. But I’d rather you open the door if we’re gonna talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs, adjusts her pajamas before crossing the living room to her front door, “What do you want?” She says when she opens it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The expression on Agatha’s face isn’t one she recognizes and stupidly it’s the thing that convinces Rio to let her in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shuffles in, hands stuffed inside her coat pockets as she looks around the apartment as if Rio could have miraculously changed the entire layout since she was last here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said you wanted to talk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha spins round to face Rio, wide-eyed like she hadn’t expected Rio to address her, “Yes, I—I didn’t know you felt that way about me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio feels her own face scrunch up, “Yes you </span>
<em>
<span>did.</span>
</em>
<span> It’s literally the whole reason you moved out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth drops, “No, I left because I had feelings for </span>
<em>
<span>you,”</span>
</em>
<span> She says like her words haven’t just punched a hole in Rio’s throat, </span>
<em>
<span>“Have.</span>
</em>
<span> I </span>
<em>
<span>have</span>
</em>
<span> feelings for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That… can’t be true.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head, “No you don’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha barrels ahead, “I do, and Rio I was getting over you, I swear I was,” She keeps her distance when Rio backs away, lower back bumping the kitchen counter, “I told myself it wasn’t worth worrying about because it would never work. I’ve always needed perfection, and you are </span>
<em>
<span>far</span>
</em>
<span> from that. </span>
<em>
<span>We</span>
</em>
<span> would be far from that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A little harsh to say to someone you just confessed your feelings for, but it does help Rio remain objective.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My marriage was perfect, Rio,” Agatha keeps talking, fills in the silence Rio doesn’t have the voice for, “We were the perfect couple and we </span>
<em>
<span>still</span>
</em>
<span> didn’t work out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I—” Rio’s voice is weak, “I don’t know what you’re saying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I drove to the beach—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In </span>
<em>
<span>whose</span>
</em>
<span> car?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, please,” Agatha takes a tentative step forwards, “I went there because I couldn’t understand it when you took me. The rock thing. I mean, I was picking out these beautiful rocks, and </span>
<em>
<span>fuck,</span>
</em>
<span> some of them looked like tiny planets, they were that perfect. And that’s what you said you were looking for; the perfect rock.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s beginning to think maybe she’s concussed because none of this is making sense. Maybe this is a dream—maybe Agatha’s not actually here at all, that would explain things.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you know how </span>
<em>
<span>infuriating</span>
</em>
<span> it was when you said the perfect rock isn’t about how it looks, but about how it makes you feel? I thought that was the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard,” Agatha laughs, a hand pressed to her head like the thought has made her ill, “The one you said yes to—I picked it out as a </span>
<em>
<span>joke.</span>
</em>
<span> And that was the one you wanted. You said it was perfect, Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So I drove down there today so I could prove to myself that I was right—that even though I have all these feelings for you, it’s better to let them go because we just don’t understand each other,” She reaches back into her pocket and pulls out a rock—grayish brown, bumpy and covered in algae stains, holds it up to Rio’s face like she’s angry at it, “This rock is so fucking ugly, Rio, and I couldn’t put it down. I can’t—” Her face scrunches up like she’s about to be embarrassed by her own words, “I can’t put this thing with you down.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reaches up, does the only thing that makes sense in the moment, and wraps her own fingers around Agatha’s, still holding the rock. She brings their hands down, keeps them between their bodies. Somehow holding Agatha’s hand feels like the most intimate thing they’ve ever done.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She can’t stop herself, doesn’t </span>
<em>
<span>want</span>
</em>
<span> to stop herself from leaning in and capturing Agatha’s lips in a kiss—less tentative than the last now she knows what she wants.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasps into the kiss, the hand Rio isn’t holding coming up to hold the back of her neck, keeping her close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They don’t pull away until Rio feels her cheek grow wet. She breaks the kiss, confused, pulls back only far enough so that she can look at Agatha, sees a tear streaking down her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sweetheart.” Rio says, soft.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sniffs and wipes away the evidence quickly before Rio gets a chance to, “Shut up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just so we’re clear,” Rio says, thinks it’s important because they’ve </span>
<em>
<span>clearly</span>
</em>
<span> been missing things, “You’re in love with me too, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Too?” Fresh tears well in Agatha’s eyes—cute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I’m so stupid in love with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitches and she nods rapidly, “Yeah,” Her voice is hoarse, “I’m in love with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio realizes the moment a massive grin takes over her entire face when she sees it reflected on Agatha’s—she doesn’t know if it was her’s or Agatha’s first, only that they share it now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tightens her grip on Agatha’s hand and tugs, Agatha following her willingly to her bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>(She wonders whether Agatha will follow her wherever she leads for the rest of her life now—knows it’s true for herself.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>She only lets go of Agatha’s hand to pry the rock out of it, reaches up to her rock shelf and reorganizes it so the original rock Agatha had picked out can sit next to this new one, front and center, pride of place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she turns, catches the look of awe on Agatha’s face before she can school her expression, and pulls her in for another kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, feelings spilled and shared, it’s different—neither of them hold back. Agatha kisses her like she’s desperate, and maybe she is. It’s a needy kiss, open mouthed and restless—it’s a kiss Rio would expect Agatha to give.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She fucking caves to it, pulls Agatha in close, pushes that stupid coat down her arms so she can </span>
<em>
<span>touch</span>
</em>
<span> her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want you,” She whispers against Agatha’s lips, unwilling to really break the kiss now she knows she doesn’t have to, “I want you so bad.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kisses her again, hums into it as she runs her hands up Rio’s body, pulling her t-shirt up along the way. After that it’s a scramble to get their clothes off, lips disconnecting only for the time it takes to get completely bare.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, hands on Agatha’s hips—one of her favorite places for them to be, guides Agatha over to the bed, smiles when the backs of her knees hit the mattress and she falls back on top of it. Rio crawls over her slowly, pressing kisses into her skin from her hips to her soft stomach, her breasts to her collarbones, before she reaches her lips again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha strokes up and down her back, then when satisfied, moves them to her arms, feels the muscles in her biceps as Rio holds herself above Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re so ridiculously hot,” Agatha mumbles, “I’ve always thought it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watches in amusement as her face flushes, “This is doing wonders for my ego.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha growls, fists Rio’s hair and tugs her back down for a kiss—probably to shut her up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” She says, “Be a good boy and get your strap for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio whines, arm muscles weakening instantly, and it takes a lot for her not to just collapse on top of Agatha. She does as she’s told though, shifts off Agatha until she can reach for the box under her bed, “How do you know these </span>
<em>
<span>things</span>
</em>
<span> about me?” She huffs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t answer until Rio’s got the harness on her hips, kneeling on the mattress as she fits the strap in the o-ring. Out of the corner of her eye she sees Agatha reaching for the bottle of lube she’d grabbed, sees her squirt some into her hand before she wraps a fist around Rio’s cock, strokes her gently, grins, “You’re so easy to read, handsome.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes roll back in her head—she’s </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> been more grateful for that stupid night, years back that Agatha learned that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughs, breathy, then hooks a finger into the harness, tugs lightly, “Lie down,” She says, “I wanna ride you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio does as she’s told, hands settling back on Agatha’s hips when she positions herself over Rio, grinds her wet cunt over the length of the strap, just to watch Rio’s face crumble as the visual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t do it for long though, and Rio hopes she’s just as desperate for it. Agatha reaches down, lines herself up, and sinks down—the slick sound of it loud in the quiet of the bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands tighten their grip on Agatha’s hips as she watches her take the full length, and when she’s all the way inside, Agatha exhales, </span>
<em>
<span>“Fuck.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She rests a hand on Rio’s chest as she starts to move, takes Rio’s cock deep inside over and over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets her set the pace at first, happy to watch Agatha take her pleasure, but after a while frustration creeps in, and she thrusts her hips up to meet Agatha’s next move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha collapses with a ragged moan, face hovering over Rio’s, hair haloing around Rio’s head on the pillow. Rio pulls her in with a hand at the back of her head, still fucking up into Agatha, and brings their lips together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s hardly more than a wet groan on Agatha’s part as she steadily rocks her hips down into Rio’s, chases her orgasm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you,” Rio says against her mouth, teeth clashing, “I love you, I love you—”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hearing her words, Agatha shoves a hand between their bodies, arm moving rapidly as she strokes her clit, so Rio gets the hint, doesn’t stop saying it until Agatha comes, forehead dropping onto Rio’s, mouth open in a silent scream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She relaxes eventually, and Rio gathers her hair and moves it out of her face, allows Agatha to properly lie down, bodies stuck together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like this,” Agatha says, after a moment, breathless, “Like feeling you inside me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wraps an arm around her back, holds her close, “I love you.” She says again, just because she can.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t wear it out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Rio grins, “You gonna get sick of hearing it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha grumbles, face hidden in Rio’s neck, “Tell me again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath tickles her neck, and then, “I love you too.” She can hear the smile in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha keeps her awake long into the early hours of the morning after recovering from the </span>
<em>
<span>emotional</span>
</em>
<span> weight of the evening. It takes a lot longer to tire her out physically, Rio’s learned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t think she minds.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Two days later—two days spent wholly with Agatha, they invite their friends for a drink at their local spot. Rio sits with her arm wrapped around Agatha, faces close together so they can speak quietly to each other while they wait for the others to turn up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not hard to know when they do—a squeal rings out over the noise of the bar, and Rio turns to look over her shoulder at all their friends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Erm,” Wanda says when she reaches them, hands on her hips like she’s talking to a couple of her students, “Do you have something to tell us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks at Agatha, and then back to Wanda, shrugs with a toothy smile she can’t hide, “Maybe just a little thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>✦</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Baby?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hums her response, continues chopping up vegetables for tonight’s dinner.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How soon is too soon to ask you to move in?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand slips and she almost cuts her own finger off, “Agatha, what the hell?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha’s grin is sly when she turns to look at her, “It’s been six months, and I’m impatient.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re serious?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When am I not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that even a real question?” Rio laughs, matching Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s going to move in with this woman, she realizes then, she’s probably going to marry her too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thinks she’s really about to enjoy her forties.</span>
