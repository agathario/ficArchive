     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      “If love could save, you would have lived forever, Agatha.”
     </p>
     <p>
      With one of her characteristic chuckles, Agatha shrugged off those words because, “You forget,” She rose from the stairs, feeling her confidence return. “Technically, I’m not dead.”
     </p>
     <p>
      “But my love is.” Death spoke, gesturing for her evergreen garden to brighten up once more, the colours of every flower responding to the command and becoming more vibrant. “And she’s buried here with the heart she took from me.”
     </p>

      Healing isn’t linear, and neither is grief. Some days the sun shines, the grass appears to be greener and the blood in your veins feels warmer. There’s hope, and it's palpable. However there are days where the sun seems to be further away, the grass wilts and your skin feels colder. There is no point in attempting to control such processes, it’s a futile war that will inevitably end with your loss, one way or the other. The only path to survival without letting your heart harden or sink down with the weight is to accept… And allow yourself to feel.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <span>
       “No one in history has ever received special treatment.”
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      These words echoed through Rio’s mind as she made the way down the road. It was true, such a thing had never occurred because she’d never had anyone to break the rules for and yet there she stood, Agatha Harkness, the woman who’d planted a heart in her barren chest, pleading for something she didn’t quite understand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she crossed the broken down gate to enter the long abandoned yard, Rio stood across another reminder of rules she’d broken for love. The flowers and the mushrooms were as colourful as she’d left them, magically bound to be perpetually in bloom, circle of life be damned. With the swiftness a movement that’s been done since the beginning of time requires, she conjured a new flower and placed it over the only patch of green that was free.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Now this is interesting.” Agatha’s voice came from the greenhouse and once she made herself visible to the visitor, Rio’s eyes diverted their look to the ground, focusing on the memories it held and the deal she planned to keep, even if Agatha failed to deliver her end of the bargain. “What are you doing here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      At any other point in time, Rio would’ve snarled back with a witty comeback or some sort of innuendo that could’ve been left to interpretation but in that very moment, words failed her. Instead, there was a lump in her throat that had been formed during their conversation on The Road and would revisit her each time she dared think of what Agatha had uttered there.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What? Cat got your tongue?” Flying across the distance, Agatha stood right behind Rio, close enough to whisper in her ear. “That’s right, you’re afraid of ghosts.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m not afraid of
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       you.
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ” Twirling her wrist, Rio swatted Agatha away with a powerful windblow.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Woof,” Agatha adjusted herself, surprised that such a thing worked under her new existing predicament. “You know, this was much more exciting when I could fight back.” For no more than a few seconds, she awaited a response but got nothing in return, which Agatha took as a twisted invitation to keep pushing. “Those certainly were the days.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Swallowing harshly, Rio continued her ritual as if Agatha wasn’t there. Kneeling down by the line that separated the enchanted garden from the rotten grass, she proceeded to open a small hole and, when Agatha approached her once more, silently this time around, Rio pulled a handful of fresh dirt from underneath her robe, promptly filling the space with it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wha-” Riddled with confusion, Agatha watched closely. “The Green Witch is repotting?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Ignoring the question, Rio moved her hand over the new patch of soil and it immediately turned the same shade of vibrant green from the land it neared. Not only that, but a dandelion began to grow. Simultaneously, she plucked a flower and immediately conjured a dome to protect it from harm in the journey that awaited her for the second phase of this ritual.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re seriously not going to tell me what you’re doing? Because
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       this
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ,” Gesturing around, Agatha carried on despite the fact that her former lover kept avoiding her gaze. “This is weird. It’s bordering on grave digging, which doesn’t exactly look good on you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Okay, I’ll bite.” Accompanying her exasperation, a thunderbolt echoed at a distance despite the seemingly clear sky. “What are you doing here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, Billy’s asleep and I got bored so…” With a shrug, as if she was describing the most normal thing in the world, Agatha carried on. “Decided to visit and I’m honestly surprised the house is still… Like this.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “People believe it to be haunted.” Rio responded, almost immediately, knowing exactly why no one dared to set foot within close proximity of the property.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “As if.” With a cackle, Agatha placed her hands on her hips. “Could you imagine a better waste of my time than binding myself to this place just to haunt it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And yet.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What do you mean?” Turning to Rio with her brow pursed in question, Agatha tried to decipher her expression.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re here. Haunting it.” A pause. “Haunting
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       me
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      .”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is that why you’re here?” With a hand over her chest, Agatha felt a swirl of emotions pulling her in complete opposite directions. The easiest path would be to taunt Rio, tease her just enough, except she didn’t seem to be in a playful mood, which turned Agatha towards the hardest path: allowing this conversation to move somewhere she might not be prepared for.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s the day of the dead.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      “Ah, of course, the day all gates open and everyone gets to visit their lo-” The rest of her sentence got slammed shut inside her pursed lips in such a way it would’ve seemed Agatha had fallen victim to a sudden silencing spell. For the first time since she had arrived, Rio looked at her. The same deep brown eyes that had witnessed every rebirth in the world since the beginning of time were clouded by a mist that, despite Rio’s best efforts, morphed into liquid form through tears. Quiet, heavy and thick, making their way down her cheeks.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Now you know.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just don’t, Agatha.” Forcing herself to regain her posture, Rio shook her head. “You already said too much.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “B-but…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Holding onto her cape, Rio prepared to leave and Agatha was simply too shocked to say or do anything other than watch her. “This is such a typical move of yours.” Rio chuckled, seemingly unable to vanish into the night without speaking all that was weighing her down. “When will you learn to use the gifts you’ve been given?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Taken aback by the hostility, Agatha felt the need to physically get some distance from Rio. “What… What are you talking about?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re a ghost. You’re omnipresent. You could be anywhere.” Thunder clapped at the end of every sentence, serving as a type of supernatural punctuation, all because Rio was getting progressively more aggravated. “Why did you choose to come here?” Noticing Agatha’s response was taking longer than she’d like, Rio nearly barked her new question. “WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE FROM ME?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I didn’t… I don’t…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The one rule, Agatha.” A sick and sordid laughter crawled out of Rio’s lips, burning through her hollow ribcage. “I gave you everything I could and yet… It was never enough. I was never enough. In the end you chose to take from me the only thing I couldn’t give you, why? To save him? To punish me? Why did you do this to
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       us
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With tear filled eyes, Agatha moved backwards, retracting in fear as Rio lunged forward, fury covering her semblance until it turned into her deathly form. “I-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “When will you learn?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A monstrous thunderbolt destroyed the green house behind them and suddenly, with a viscerally primal scream, Rio sent a swirl of dark green magic from her palms all the way to the sky above them. Looking up, Agatha saw rain fall down and each drop touched her skin with a tenderness she hadn’t experienced in a while. In fact, she felt… real, again. Every part of her body felt alive and proof of that was the loud heartbeat thudding in the back of her ears. Truth be told, such sensations felt overwhelming yet a touch on her wrists grounded her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Willingly given,” Rio’s voice was dark, haunting. “Unwillingly taken.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Before Agatha could do anything to stop her, Rio pulled their bodies together, both women writhing in pain as they merged since ghosts are supposed to be the ones in control of who they possess, never the other way around. This time, Agatha had been pushed into a house she didn’t ask permission to enter. This time, Rio wouldn’t let any rules stop her from teaching the lesson that needed to be taught.

      The scene of the crime rebuilt itself during the time it took for Agatha to understand her new whereabouts. There she stood, firmly where Death had been waiting for a choice to be made but not as an active participant, rather a spectator of a show she’d been a pivotal part of. Billy offered himself up for the taking, his young and noble heart speaking in defence of a woman he wasn’t entirely sure he could trust. Within her, Agatha was painfully aware of what happened next yet she was experiencing everything from a whole different perspective this time.

      The sound was muffled and Agatha wondered if that as a direct effect from the energy exertion this recreation was taking on the balance of all things or if it was merely a side effect from Rio reliving her own memory of the events. Regardless, the moment came and Agatha witnessed herself triumphantly march towards death. Her Death. In her mind, she had been so certain of this decision. Yes, she’d driven a dagger through the heart of the only one she’d ever loved by pretty much saying that when the time came, she’d much rather die alone than see her face yet there she was… Ready to die in her arms because all Agatha ever wanted was to crumble in the warmth of that embrace.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, as she watched the passionate kiss of two women who’d longed and yearned for each other over the span of centuries become surrounded by the darkness of all the power Agatha was syphoning out of Death, she felt it. Their hearts beating in unison. The rhythm, the cadence, the pauses and the beats. For a fleeting period of time, they were one and then… A thud in the middle of her chest. Her knees hit the ground with such force that, realistically, they would’ve shattered. There was the most inexplicable emptiness inside her, unlike the calm she experienced when she died. Looking up, she saw herself fall backwards while Rio stood still, frozen, a single tear rushing down her cheek.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Please,” Agatha begged, suffocating on the nothingness within her ribcage. “Stop.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Instead, while her eyes filled with tears, Agatha saw more rules being broken, namely the respect for nature’s timing. Swiftly, her lifeless body was absorbed by the earth to give space for the garden she found Rio visiting and before the morning sun rose, the rebirth circle had already been completed. Agatha hiccupped, only then noticing her violent sobbing despite the absence of a heartbeat. But her lesson wasn’t over just yet. Not bothering to hide behind the façade of her human face, or rather, hiding behind her immortal semblance to avoid revealing her true emotions, Death instructed Billy to leave, removing from his shoulders the weight of the crime he had committed. In the end, someone had taken the fall for him and the balance had been re-established.
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      Agatha watched the teenager leave the battlefield where he’d been both the saviour and the target, understanding he’d merely bought her time, however brief, to make the right decision. Unable to get up, her life force seemingly dissipating with every hiccup, Agatha had no other choice but to witness the rest: a widow holding onto the grief draped over her shoulders before leaving the grave she never wanted to dig.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With the same intensity as before, Agatha was pushed out of Rio’s body with a sense of rejection and emptiness unlike anything she’d ever experienced. Life had been cruel to her, one too many times, yet she’d never felt completely hollow. After Nicky passed, she undoubtedly changed forever and the presence of his absence was impossible to ignore, regardless of how many witches she dried up to fill the space. However, in the dark of the night when the silence overpowered the rest, Agatha could still hear her heart beating, reminding her that she was still alive despite it all.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Here, sitting on the stairs of her former house, while Rio magically brought the timeline back together and settled down the thunder her anger had created, Agatha was hollow. Standing as a tree who forgot to fall despite her insides being destroyed. A shell of a woman, four walls with nothing standing between them. Yet, she waited for Rio to finish her job before saying anything, refraining from making matters worse by saying the wrong thing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What? Cat got your tongue?” Rio asked, swallowing the lump in her throat with a poor attempt at lighting the mood by using the same words Agatha had when she arrived.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is this how you felt?” A pause. “How you feel?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What’s the point of having a heart when there’s nothing else to beat for?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t…” Agatha’s voice was soft, pleading.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rubbing her hands together, Rio opened them to reveal a handful of dirt in one of her palms. “Before our paths crossed, everything was as it had always been. Nothing more, nothing less.” With her index finger, Rio collected a tear from the corner of Agatha’s left eye and gently dropped it in the soil. “But then you arrived and did the unthinkable.” A purple azalea began taking shape from within the palm of Rio’s hand. “There was something strange happening inside me, a beat that wouldn’t quieten, a growth that I couldn’t control. You planted a heart in my chest, Agatha, and it bloomed.” A chuckle. “Love had presented itself to me in so many desperate pleas during the end times that I became intrigued by this transcendent power that every human seemed to carry. As it turns out, I was capable of it as well… Thanks to you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Gently caressing the petals of the purple azalea, Rio plucked one out and dropped it on the dirt that quickly absorbed it while Agatha remained silent, listening to the explanation she never bothered to ask for but secretly craved. “Nature has the innate necessity for expansion and it seemed our love required the same when you planted another heart in your own womb this time.” Where the petal had disappeared, a smaller, more feeble, white azalea grew. “Unfortunately, not every soil is fertile, not every seed is sustainable, not every child is born. Nicky shouldn’t ha-” Rio paused, the lump in her throat returning and Agatha could feel the need to run away from this conversation simmering.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Still, I gave you time.” One by one, the white azalea petals fell on their own while the purple one wilted. “Agatha,” Needing to know that Agatha understood exactly what she was saying, Rio called for her former lover and Agatha nodded in return. “I gave
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       you
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      time.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes, you broke the rules..”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “For
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       you.
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wha-” Before she could finish her question, Rio pointed towards the burial site behind her back. “You gave
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       me
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      time.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a simple nod, Rio continued. “However you chose to spend it with him was entirely up to you and all I wish for is that part of the resentment you have isn’t because you feel it was wasted living in fear for the inevitable. That wasn’t my intention when I granted your wish and it's exactly why I didn’t give you a date. Whatever is to happen will happen regardless of whether you know when it will happen.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Special treatment…” Agatha spoke, barely above a whisper, reminiscing about their conversation on The Road where she’d throw words as sharp as knives at Rio for even thinking, for a second, that what she’d done had been a kindness.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If I had a nickel…” Shaking her head, Rio looked down at her palm where the white azalea had completely fallen down. “After that, I gave you more time to accept what had happened and hopefully understand but instead you decided to turn your grief into a bottomless pit of anger. You didn’t even stop for a moment to consider me, did you?” Tears returned to her eyes as she watched Agatha wipe her own away, nevertheless she persisted. “Each time I’d arrive to finish what you started, it seemed more like a business transaction than… love. Yet I kept giving you time,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       my time
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      , because I loved you. Even when you hid from me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, I needed some ti-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Time away, right.” Rio waved her finger at Agatha, the bitter taste of irony spreading through every corner of her mouth.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nodding, Agatha noticed how the purple azalea had turned black yet maintained the same firmness from the beginning. “You have to understand, you were always there, everywhere I looked.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How could I not when you continued to leave a trail for me to follow?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You would have found me anyway.” Agatha shrugged, meaning it as a throwaway remark but quickly finding that her words took a shape of their own in Rio’s mind when her hand was forced forward, and opened by Rio.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Magick always finds a way, usually through the path of least resistance, but not with you.” With a sigh, both women watched the purple turned black azalea turn into dust, which Rio transferred to Agatha’s palm. “In the end, I learned my lesson.” Pulling the black cloak over her head, Death prepared to return to the ritual that had been interrupted. “If love could save, you would have lived forever, Agatha.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With one of her characteristic chuckles, Agatha shrugged off those words because, “You forget,” She rose from the stairs, feeling her confidence return. “Technically, I’m not dead.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But my love is.” Death spoke, gesturing for her evergreen garden to brighten up once more, the colours of every flower responding to the command and becoming more vibrant. “And she’s buried here with the heart she took from me.”

     Agatha Harkness walked through the dark forest with a feeling of electricity crackling beneath her skin. As a young witch, she was talented beyond her years and despite her coven's efforts to teach within the borders of the appropriate, Agatha had a tendency to venture into the unknown, the forbidden, the mysterious. However, nothing could’ve prepared her for the sensation travelling through her body after absorbing the power of her entire coven. It was new. There were no written texts about such transference, at least none she had access to yet it happened. And it felt…
     <em>
      Good
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Distracted by the sensations in her body and the way her magic would flow from one hand to another in a smoother way, Agatha almost missed the green flame moving through the trees in the opposite direction. In a double take, Agatha looked back and found the torch lighting up the way towards the place she was leaving. Horror crept in, a sudden fear that she’d be found so soon after committing the most heinous of crimes. Albeit in self defence, Agatha had unequivocally murdered a large number of witches and it seemed as though another was about to find them.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Torn between returning and leaving, Agatha decided upon the first option, creating in her head a narrative to offer the passerby about how she merely followed their light as she was lost in the woods. Moving at a faster pace than usual to catch up with the stranger, Agatha arrived at the clearance in the woods to find that… there was no green light, or anyone else standing around other than herself and the corpses. For a split second, Agatha believed to have suffered some sort of hallucination but the post where she had been tied to turned into a giant green flame.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Boo.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Startled, Agatha turned around to find a gentle face smiling at her. Draped in a green cloak, the other youngster seemed to inspect Agatha’s features with care and genuine curiosity. “Did you, uh-” Agatha paused, inexplicably gagged, and pointed towards the flame. “Was that your doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “The bodies? A true tragedy.” Shaking her head, she moved forward to stand beside Agatha and looked around. “People seem awfully afraid of the unknown these days.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I-” Still pointing to the flame, Agatha’s forehead creased in question. “Surely it will pass.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Everyone does.” With a tenderness to her voice, she turned to Agatha and offered a pained smile. “Eventually.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Chuckling, as it appeared the stranger was responding to questions Agatha wasn’t asking while avoiding those she verbalised, the witch decided it was time to retreat. “Well then I shall be on my way.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Were you familiar with any of them?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh,” Flustered, Agatha touched her mother’s locket while attempting to come up with some sort of explanation that didn’t stray too far from the truth. “They’re rather… transfigured.” Buying time, Agatha stepped closer to one of the bodies and shivered. “Oh yes, they were from the neighbouring village.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does that mean there will be others honouring their fall? Tending to them?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I-” Agatha understood the question but instead of thinking about the obvious answer, who would find them and bury them, her mind went immediately to who they left behind: the children. “Of that I have no knowledge.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then what do you know?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh just stories. Rumours, even.” Their betrayal was a fresh wound in her heart and Agatha wasn’t going to succumb to it, rather she’d use it as fuel for the fire burning within. “One of them was said to be a godawful mother.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “How would you be able to measure such a thing?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Merely a maiden myself,” With a hand over her chest, Agatha swallowed harshly. “However, a mother shouldn’t intentionally bring harm to her own offspring, is my belief.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Up until that moment, the stranger had been listening to Agatha with a kind semblance, which drastically changed after those words. “That is…”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Vile, malicious, nefarious, monstrous...” Agatha was numbering, just off the top of her head, all the things her mother had called her in the past and halfway through her list, a cold hand touched her wrist, making her stop.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rotten.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Nodding in agreement, Agatha placed her other hand over the one gently holding her wrist. “Painfully so.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is there more you’d like to share with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I’m-” Quickly moving her hands to adjust her skirt, as if there was any dust that needed to be swept away, Agatha cleared her throat. “Late for supper.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You seemed lost.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am.” It had been the first earnest and truthful thing Agatha said to the stranger in their entire conversation. Raw and vulnerable. “Can you accompany me?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You need only lead the way.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
     “Are you certain this will work?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you believe it will?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wholeheartedly? No.” Agatha chuckled but continued to decorate the broom as she’d been instructed to. “Nevertheless, I trust you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the innate fear of falling, considering they would be miles above the ground should the incantation transform their brooms into flying vehicles, Agatha repeated the words in unison with the voice she’d grown to love. It tickled her brain that she had fallen for someone that remained nameless, after all those years, save for the nickname Agatha had baptised her with. And it wasn’t for lack of questioning, it was just the way it was. The same was true for the limited amount of time they’d get together. Granted she never spent a minute alone whenever she needed most, Agatha would spend every other moment yearning for someone that was always far away. Whenever they were together, however, Agatha felt magick in a different way. Beyond spells, incantations or things of the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They exchanged brooms, as the ritual required them to, and Agatha smiled seeing hers adorned with purple azaleas. “My love.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “After you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And so they flew upwards, into the clear night sky, embellished by the stars and the large full moon. Laughing in a mix of fear and excitement, Agatha looked to her side to find the woman who made her feel worthy of love staring in admiration, her eyes shining with Agatha's reflection. In silence, they crossed the sky side by side, admiring the silver glow of the moon sculpting all that remained on the ground below. It didn’t take long for Agatha to completely lose track of time and allow herself to be fully immersed in the adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha.” The voice of her beloved broke Agatha’s trance and she saw her broom move faster ahead. “Return home.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stay behind, I beg of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Never!”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Unsure how to make her own broom faster, Agatha held tighter and focused on trailing not too far behind. Upon their descent into the ground, Agatha noticed how the back of her lover’s broom turned into the green flame she’d seen years ago, which could only mean one thing: Death.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please, Agatha,” With their feet back on the ground and the brooms on the floor, Agatha watched the green cloak be drawn over the head. “Refrain from following me.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your rules have prevailed, however tonight I will draw the line.” Agatha approached her and placed a hand tenderly over her left shoulder. “Allow me.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What if you’re frightened?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will grow stronger.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What if it wounds you?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will heal.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What if your heart is unable to forget?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will learn to love.” Moving the hand down to her arm, Agatha tugged, as a request for her to turn around. “Again.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is one thing to love the abstract, Agatha,” Slowly, moving at a pace that allowed Agatha the chance to stop before the damage was done, she began turning around. “Another to love what your hands can touch.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And my hands have touched you before.” Reaching her hands, Agatha intertwined their fingers and squeezed. “All that is to touch.” With a deep breath, Agatha waited for her lover to look up and reveal herself fully for the first time. “And my love grew stronger each time, this won’t be any different.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Willingly given.” She spoke, her voice different than before, darker and deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Willingly taken.” Agatha responded, giving her consent. And there she was. Death. The last face every living being sees before crossing over to the other side. “Beautiful,
     <em>
      my love
     </em>

     “What of my personal balance?” Feeling rage reaching a boiling point, Agatha pulled the corset strings a little bit too tighter and while a regular human being would've screamed out in pain, the response was a soft moan instead.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You needn't torture me.” Facing Agatha with a smirk, she continued. “It's futile.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “As are my pleas, it seems.” The electricity from her powers was running wild through Agatha's veins and she wasn't certain how much longer she'd be able to contain her rage.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “On the contrary, the proof that such pleas have a devastating effect on me can be seen from the skies above.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What does that matter if I cannot see the proof you speak of from here?” With her hands on her hips, Agatha looked deeply into the brown eyes that were staring at her with nothing but love in them, which infuriated her even further.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Perhaps you should adjust your sight.” Gently lifting Agatha's chin up with her index finger to lay a soft kiss on the corner of her lips, she continued. “Perception depends on proximity.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “In that case, you might benefit from being further away.” With those words, Agatha smacked her palms against the chest of her beloved and propelled her through the door of their cabin. “If you'd rather leave than stay with me, do so, be gone.” Agatha said as she crossed the threshold to see her lover rise from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You couldn't possibly be more mistaken,
     <em>
      Agatha
     </em>
     ,” They had fought before and Agatha knew they were about to do it again just by the way she said her name. There was something about that tone, almost like a mermaid call, enticing and inviting, practically begging for a response. “If it was entirely up to me,” Green mist formed in her palms and Agatha braced herself. “I would remain beside you until the end of time.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With a double whip movement, green flames sided Agatha to form a corridor leading to the place where her lover stood. Instead of walking there, Agatha clapped and a whirlwind emanated from her hands like a missile. Skilled in combat despite rarely using her tools, Death sent a rapid fire of green projectiles into the whirlwind, dissipating it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And there she is! My mistress!” A joke Agatha had playfully made years ago had somehow become a running gag for them. “This is as much your fault as it is my wife's.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Since when do you have a spouse, Agatha Harkness?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Since she gave me her hand in marriage.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Purple and green flares met each other in the space between the paramours, exploding like fireworks in the night. Aware of the trialling times they lived through, Agatha sought to find a cottage that stood furthest away from any town or farm to protect her identity. Both of their identities, actually. Still, aware that nosy neighbours can find themselves invading spaces they would've never dared to otherwise, she'd repeat the same incantation every morning, protecting the area around their home.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Should I be jealous?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Deeply.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “A question remains, though.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A pause and Agatha, anticipating some sort of trap, continued alert. “Which is?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did she ever say yes?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With a scream, Agatha blasted a powerful attack from both of her palms and it would've killed any other witch but not this one. It would've obliterated any other human but she was different. With her face returning to human form, she walked towards Agatha, the purple beams of light trespassing her chest and becoming pieces of ash falling from her back.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You wouldn't dare say no to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I could.” She spoke while Agatha felt herself losing control and the ability to stop her powers that continued to pierce her lover's chest as she moved ever closer. “The same way you could stop this nonsense.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A tear rushed down Agatha's face from the power exertion and the realisation that, in fact, she could. But before Agatha tried anything else, her palms were already pressing against the chest of her beloved and their lips met. Passionately so, with a fire that Agatha hadn't felt before and that quickly became uncomfortable to the point that Agatha felt her lips were burning.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop.” Agatha pulled away and the smell of smoke was all she could feel.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Quieten your rage, Agatha.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Confused, Agatha looked at her overheated hands and then into their home, where the bed they shared was burning with green flames. “Then stop leaving me.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Absence should make the heart grow fonder.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And it does. Until it doesn't.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Forgive me, my love.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With a sigh, Agatha dropped her hands and all the fires vanished. Rushing inside the house with tear filled eyes, Agatha felt herself be followed and it didn't take long until fingertips were dancing over her spine, crawling their way up.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ask me again.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?” Agatha inquired, turning around to find her beloved picking up the dagger from her belt to draw a line across the palm of her left hand. “Wha-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your wife gave you her hand in marriage, was that not what you said?"
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     “Yo- you bleed?” Shocked at the revelation, Agatha did her best to catch up. “Uh, yes, yes, that’s what I said.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then ask for it again.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will you, uh,” Agatha sniffled, picking up the dagger from the hand of her lover and promptly doing the same in her palm. “Be mine?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “For as long as you’ll have me.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Joining their wounds together, Agatha felt the same energy rush from years ago. A deeply pleasurable sensation spreading through her body and she wondered if what they’d done had been in any way similar to her power absorption because it felt… similar. However, instead of pulling from the source, Agatha saw her hand be lifted to the lips of her beloved and her palm was licked clean. In that moment, Agatha had no doubt that for however much she loved her, Death loved her just as much in return.

     Nature and magick have a long list of similarities, mainly their need for expansion and growth. Attempting to contain them, in whatever form, can cause a level of destruction that goes beyond direct consequences. See tree roots, for example, when they set out to find new sources of water and break through the toughest of concrete. The path of least resistance is usually the most appreciated, and easiest, saving everyone the mess that going through the hard path creates.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Love moves the same way. Naturally meant to grow and bloom, in perpetual expansion, it doesn’t settle for contempt. When the time arrives, the calling is impossible to ignore and it was all Agatha could think about. Aware that witches didn’t need the assistance of men to procreate, and feeling her heart overflowing with love, she knew the next logical step would be to split her heart in two. A child. However when she brought the subject to her partner, something always happened to move the conversation away and it was usually the fact that she had to leave. She always had to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Te veo.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Those parting words were always the same, said with a tenderness that lingered on Agatha’s lips for a moment or two, until the trepidation of her absence became too much. Violent even. Agatha’s need for her partner was suffocating at times and while fighting her about it seemed to deepen their relationship, there were occasions where Agatha didn’t want to have to make up. Through the years, after learning the difference between when it was fair to battle just to kiss it better later and when it was easier to quieten her rage, Agatha developed a method.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     While their cottage stood in the middle of nothingness, there was a path down the hill that led to a river. The water was permanently cold and it didn’t depend on the season or the hour, it simply was. Agatha didn’t know how to swim and, given the stillness of the river, she’d allow herself to go up until the point where her shoulders were submersed. More than that felt life threatening and, even though Death slept in bed with her almost every night, she didn’t want to risk it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The sun was making its downward path when Agatha decided she needed to cool off, immediately. That day she’d spent most of her hours reading about spells and incantations about procreation, none of which seeming adequate to her for a variety of reasons. Crossroads like those were the few and far between instances where Agatha wished to have a coven she could rely on, or elders she could go to for advice. Evanora had never bothered explaining to her how she had been conceived, fearing the day Agatha would try to do the same and bring more evil to the world. The mere reminder of those conversations was enough for Agatha to quickly move past her fleeting desire to ask for help.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With her toes in the cool water, Agatha’s body began to relax, like a pressure cooker blowing off steam. Step by step, she ventured into the river and her mind shifted gears to focus on her body temperature, completely emptying itself of any other thought. “Silence.” Agatha said to herself, bringing water to her head and letting it cascade down her hair. “This is nice.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Minutes passed and, mesmerised by how the setting sun painted everything it touched with a golden coating, including the river, Agatha didn’t notice she was being watched from shore. One of the main reasons why witches didn’t travel alone was because it set them up as easy prey for those who hunted them and while Agatha wasn’t afraid to defend herself, regardless of whoever was the attacker, the fact that she was in the water could’ve been dangerous… If it wasn’t for the fact that the passerby admiring the woman bathing was none other than her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it cold?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Startled, Agatha looked over to where her clothes were to find a smiling woman standing beside them. “Terribly so.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then come out,” She said, tugging at her green coat. “Let us warm up at home.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not before you join me.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Unless you are not able to.” Quickly adding, Agatha furrowed her brow in question. “Can you?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Would you believe me if I said I haven’t tried?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Agatha chuckled, remembering all the inherently human things her beloved had never experienced. “There is earth beneath my feet, if you’re wondering where I stand.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s comforting.” She smiled, removing her clothes before stepping in the water. ”Oh.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Push through, my love.” Agatha encouraged, watching her partner take small steps in her direction. “Remember your prize at the end.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What should that be?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Me, what else?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     quite compelling.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Didn’t take long until their arms were wrapped around each other and their lips connected. Passionately intertwined, they forgot their whereabouts and focused solely on each other. There was no cold water anymore or the possibility of being seen, it was just them, in their own bubble, sharing the same love. As it often happened, the escalation was faster than either could control yet this time their movements were slower, more deliberate, with a purpose. Wrapping her legs around her lover’s waist, Agatha pulled back from the kiss to look into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you searching for?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “On the contrary,” Agatha spoke, a smile on her lips. “I believe I finally found your name.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “River.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like this one?” With a chuckle, and her hands gripping onto Agatha’s back to keep them steady, she pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Similarly, yes,” Agatha nodded, her thumbs brushing over rosy cheeks. “Everything flows through you, does it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio Vidal.” She said, contemplating it. “The river of life.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio Vidal.” Repeating the words spoken in a language Rio frequently used and Agatha was trying to learn, she nodded once more. “I like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I love it when you say it.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio Vidal.” Agatha did her best to elongate every syllable until their lips touched once more. Step by step, they returned to the steady rhythm they had achieved prior the interruption and, as a climax seemed to loom in the horizon, Agatha took it up a notch.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Love turned into hunger and it propelled them forward with such force that the violence of their impact slit through Agatha’s lower lip and chipped one of her teeth. Rather than pull back to assess the damage, they smiled into each other's lips, unaware that the debris of this collision had been absorbed. At the edge of losing control, Agatha deepen the kiss, momentarily dipping them underwater and-
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha!” With horror clouding her face, Rio trembled. “You- you shouldn’t have done that.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?" Confused, Agatha placed her hands on Rio’s shoulders and tried to decipher the reason for such sudden panic. “What did I do?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Covering her lips, Rio continued to stare at Agatha unsure of how to explain that she had pulled something from her. “You broke th- the number one rule.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I-” Before she could say anything else, ask for more explanations or try to excuse herself, Agatha stood frozen in the water, watching Rio practically run away from her. “Tell me what I did wrong, please!” Agatha yelled, a tear running down her face. “Rio!” The newly given name made her stop by their clothes but not long enough for Agatha to catch up. “Please.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Pleading was futile as Rio had already disappeared into the woods by the time Agatha reached the shore. However, there was something else asking for Agatha’s attention and it was the fact that her lip was burning as if salt had been thrown into it. “Strange.” Touching the cut with her fingers, Agatha saw the blood and grew even more confused since Rio had healed many of her wounds before, why not this one? That was when she noticed her chipped tooth and the way her tears were flowing to her lip like a river to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “My blood,” Agatha spoke, looking at the few drops in her fingers. “My tears,” She continued, touching her cheeks and it became abundantly clear what had happened. “My bone.” With both hands gently laying over her lower abdomen, Agatha chuckled. “
     <em>
      My love.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Further into the forest, Rio couldn’t stop running. With the weight of what they’d done becoming increasingly too heavy to keep moving but she felt that she couldn’t stop. Distance wouldn’t fix the situation but it would buy her enough time to figure out what to say to Agatha. Or how to say it. Bumping into a tree, Rio fell on the ground and cried. “Oh Agatha, what have we done?” Through sobs, Rio held her knees against her chest, laying on the grass in fetal position. “He will be half mine, born to die.”

    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha found herself home alone when the pain began. Rio promised she’d be there when the time came yet she was nowhere to be seen. After waiting long enough for her contractions to be closer together, Agatha set out to find the river, knowing it was even further away from people than their house and therefore safer to bring a child into the world. Racing as fast as her pain and heavy belly aloud, she made it to the shore. There was something that plagued her every night before falling asleep during the entire gestation and it was haunting her every breath: the fear that her child would somehow be born with the evilness Evanora said Agatha carried.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As much as she tried to reassure herself, saying he - Rio told her it was a boy near the 4th month - had been a product of the most genuine of loves and couldn’t possibly inherit such an awful cross, the fear still lingered. Biting into the lemon she had plucked earlier that day, Agatha hoped for the best. However, the pain continued, and it only worsened while there were still no signs of Rio. After what felt like an eternity and probably amounted to a couple hours, the pain stopped along with Agatha’s heart. That couldn’t be a good sign. Had she not done enough to help her son make it into the world?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With a heavy feeling in her chest, Rio finally revealed herself. They had spent plenty of years together for Agatha to know exactly what it meant when Rio had the green hood over her head. In fact, she hoped Agatha understood just by looking at her because Rio couldn’t bring herself to explain. Not then, not before, perhaps even not ever. How could she possibly tell a mother that her womb wasn’t fertile enough? How dare she tell the love of her life that their bond wasn’t enough to create life? How vile could she be to destroy them by being… half death?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. No.” Agatha whimpered, seeing Rio stand across from her with a blue flower in her hand, the one she had pledged to bring for their son.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With a lump in her throat, Rio couldn’t do more than shake her head. Words failed her at the very moment where Agatha needed them most.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It cannot be.” Tears rushed down Agatha’s exhausted face.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It must be.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Feeling a type of betrayal she had never expected from Rio, Agatha reverted into the person she became when her heart threatened to harden with anger. “You do this and I will hate you forever.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <em>
      “She didn’t mean that.”
     </em>
     Rio thought to herself, merely nodding and sighing heavily, the possibility of Agatha wanting nothing to do with her until the end of her days had been something Rio thought about constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please let him live.” Broken from all the exertion, Agatha couldn’t hold onto her anger for too long and pleaded instead. “Please, my love!”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     They had been together for so long, a lifetime to so many, that Rio had learned to read between the lines as often Agatha left many things unsaid underneath all that she spoke aloud. Not only that, but Rio had seen plenty of mothers extend the same plea that Agatha was voicing to know that, truthfully, they were asking to be taken instead. While Rio granted such a thing to some, if they were too feeble to survive childbirth while their children were strong, it wouldn’t be possible in this case because she’d never willingly take Agatha’s life, even if she offered, even if it came at the expense of their child. But also… Rio had already made peace with the fact that Nicky had been a gift Agatha got to carry, but not one she could keep. At least… Not for long.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please!” Agatha agonised as the pain returned. “Ahhhh,” She whimpered. “Please. Please!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The decision hadn’t been easy to make as there is always a danger of growing accustomed to what is ephemeral yet Rio couldn’t bear witnessing Agatha’s pain any longer.  “I can offer only time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     “How much time?” The question begged to be answered however when Agatha became distracted with her excruciating contractions, Rio left. “Ahhh… how much…”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>

     Shortly after noticing she had been abandoned, Agatha felt her son be born. Overjoyed and exhausted, she didn’t notice that Rio hadn’t fled but instead retreated to hide behind a tree, watching from as close - and as far - as she could. “I spoke no spell…” Admiring the seemingly perfect baby boy, Agatha continued. “I said no incantation… You… You were made from scratch.”

      As the fast learner she’d always been, Agatha adapted fairly quickly to motherhood and vowed to make any sacrifice necessary to ensure that Nicholas had the best life she could possibly give him. If that meant leaving behind the cabin in the woods where she’d been the happiest, so be it. And if she had to leave a trail of corpses scattered around the country to keep Death occupied then that’s exactly what she’d do… Even if it meant that Agatha would be consumed by the opposing forces of needing her partner beyond words and the fear that the next time she saw her it meant the last time she’d see their son.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Honouring her word, Rio offered Agatha all the time she could, and that included giving her space to enjoy it without the uneasiness of not knowing if Rio was merely visiting her family or if Death had come to collect. It destroyed her to stay away from them, unable to do anything that improved the quality of their lives. However, she couldn’t help but chuckle seeing Agatha realise that when she breastfed Nicholas after draining other witches, when she was her most powerful, his cries would quieten. Agatha had a way to adapt to every circumstance and Rio loved that about her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Days turned into months and months into years, all without ever seeing Rio around yet Agatha never got too comfortable. Constantly on the move, as if that would be enough to hide from the inevitable, Agatha changed in a way that she couldn’t have predicted or prepared for. Despite the fact that Nicholas' food necessities had moved away from her jurisdiction, Agatha would get antsy if she didn’t have her share of witch power at a frequency that became increasingly smaller as time went on. Turning it into a game to keep Nicholas busy rather than preoccupied with their predicament, Agatha kept doing it even after he asked her to stop. Truth be told, as much as she understood the boy’s reasoning that they could possibly be safer living with a community of witches, Agatha couldn’t stop herself. Besides, the last time she had a coven they died trying to kill her and that wasn’t a mistake she was willing to make again.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The years went by and Rio would take care of the bodies Agatha left behind during the day while watching over her family as they slept at night. Sometimes, when Nicholas woke up but didn’t want to bother Agatha, Rio would talk to him. At first he didn’t understand why Agatha had never told him about having another mother, however Rio assured him that it was a secret he’d forget in the morning since their encounters happened right before he drifted back to sleep. It felt torturous, visiting her son under those conditions while knowing that, had she allowed the sacred balance to remain untouched rather than bend it for Agatha, these fleeting moments would’ve never taken place.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha wasn’t a fool and she could tell Nicholas was getting sicker each day that went by. Cursing Rio under her breath whenever he coughed, Agatha grew resentful that she couldn’t heal her son. It was self-inflicted, truly, however the way it weighed on her chest began to darken her heart. Instead of accepting the possibility that the end of their time was near, Agatha continued to keep Nicholas entertained with the song they had crafted together over the years and the stories he always asked her to tell.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Aware the day had arrived, Rio warned Nicholas the evening prior. “Yes, my boy,” She spoke, her voice sharing the same tenderness it used to be reserved only for Agatha. “You must return home as soon as you finish singing so that we can begin our adventure.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What about mama?” Nicholas asked, his eyes almost shut with the sleep he was trying to fight.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh you needn’t worry.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Will you watch over her?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Always.” With a smile, she pressed her lips to Nicholas’ forehead, the warmth of his rising fever bringing tears to her eyes.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Morning came and Agatha moved through the day as they usually did until Nicholas prompted a surprisingly turn of events out of own volition. Without thinking too much of it other than the fact he might be more tired as his coughing had increased in frequency, Agatha softened at the sight of his loving face and didn’t lecture him for denying her the dose of power she’d been aching for. Unaware that their time together was running out like sand on an hourglass, Agatha and Nicholas sang, laughed, embraced. At the end of the day, when the moon took over the sky and Nicholas was sound asleep, Agatha covered him to protect from the cold before allowing herself to drift off.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Making her way through the woods, Rio lit up the green flame, preparing herself for what should’ve happened a long time ago and that she almost lacked the courage to do so now. There it was, the danger of latching onto the ephemeral, getting to her as well. When Agatha was sound asleep, and Rio had managed to keep herself steady enough not to cry in front of her son, she stood across from him as she’d done so many nights. And since she had already broken rules for her loved ones, Rio decided to break another. Despite having the green hood over her head, she chose to present herself to Nicholas the way he’d met her rather than with the face everyone else saw at the end of their roads.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Then, she waited.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And waited.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And waited.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Until Nicholas woke up in her realm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      After that fateful night, Agatha and Rio’s grief took them through completely different roads. While Agatha gave into her anger, succumbing to her ever growing need for power and keeping the memory of Nicholas alive within her by using their song to lure gullible witches, Rio chose silence. Reclusion, even. Doing her job without lingering too long. And there was so much to do, always, all the time, especially with the increasing fallen witches Agatha would leave behind.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A century had gone by since they’d last seen each other, at least directly, given that Rio would steal a glance of her former lover every once in a while and Agatha, when her crime scene begged to be witnessed, stayed behind, waiting for Rio’s reaction. One night, however, after Agatha whipped out two covens within close proximity, it happened. Agatha had lingered near the circle testing the new strength of her powers when Rio arrived to find her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Rio.” Agatha said, adjusting her jacket and strengthening her posture. “To what do I owe the pleasure?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not here for you, Agatha.” There was a small hint of amusement in her voice and it was intentional since Rio knew the witch was proud of this go around the block.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So you haven’t been stalking me all these years?” Toying with purple sparks in her hand, Agatha awaited for the response, still deciding what to do next.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can you imagine a better waste of my time?” Moving through the circle, Rio did her job one witch at a time until she abruptly stopped by the last one, kneeling down beside her. “Is this what brings you joy nowadays?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Joy is rather subjective,” Agatha tapped her chin with her index finger, trying to understand what Rio was doing and why her face had suddenly morphed to normal while she was still on the job. “It gives me power,” A pause. “And a lot of pleasure.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “A way to scratch the itch.” Rio continued to search the witch wondering where the heartbeat she could hear was coming from.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You could say that, yes.” Growing impatient with the interaction and whatever Rio was doing, Agatha gave into her curiosity. “What- What’s that?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There’s life near her,” Looking up to find that Agatha’s facial expression shifted into agony, Rio was quick to reassure her by placing a hand over the fallen witch’s abdomen. “Not here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh,” With a sigh of relief, Agatha returned to her mastered bravado. “I knew that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Of course you did,” Rio lifted the body just enough to find a bag underneath where a little bunny had been trapped. “And I appreciate that.” Left unsaid, however, was the knowledge they both shared that Agatha would never hurt a child or a pregnant woman.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is that a rat?” Nearly jumping from the fright, Agatha squirmed when Rio presented her hands with the small creature. “A bunny.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Señor Scratchy.” Rio chuckled, watching Agatha touch his fur ever so gently. “For when you’re feeling itchy.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Silly name.” With a hint of a smile on her lips, Agatha felt herself drift into the familiarity of their love and, well, the joy of having Rio nearby. “And even worse reasoning.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Would you like to keep him?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can’t you?” Agatha mentally answered her own question. “Right.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “At least until he’s able to return to nature, it'd be wise to find him a home. Not necessarily yours, but…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yeah, I’ll take him.” Gently holding the bunny against her chest, Agatha looked at Rio with a fondness she hadn’t felt in a very long time. “For now.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Thank you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “With one condition.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nodding since she should’ve known there’d be a catch, Rio decided to play Agatha’s game. “Name it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Leave me alone.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A loud cackle crawled out Rio’s mouth. “If you truly wanted that,” Gesturing around the circle, Rio shrugged. “You’d stop.” And as Agatha opened her lips to speak, Rio threw caution at the wind, moving forward to plant a kiss on her cheek. “Te veo.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Too stunned to reply, Agatha watched Rio disappear into the forest and only when she imagined her former lover to be completely out of reach, she whispered. “I love you too.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Over the following years, they kept meeting each other in passing, sharing a few words as Agatha was leaving and Rio arriving. After a while, it became more recurring and the few words turned into playful combat, when Agatha’s itch hadn’t been scratched enough and she needed to test her powers further or… when they craved each others love beyond their ability to contain it. Both grew increasingly aware of the toxic path they were venturing into yet neither wanted to be the one breaking the spell by saying or doing something that destroyed this neutral zone they’d created. Agatha had full control of what type of encounter it would be and Rio gladly followed, as it had been since they met.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For decades, they kept this on and off, hot and cold, push and pull relationship. For decades, they’d destroy entire houses only to fall asleep in each other's arms on broken beds with shattered furniture surrounding them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For decades, Agatha would yell at Rio to never find her again, only to leave a bigger killing trail behind, smirking at the end of it when Death, inevitably, arrived to clean up the mess.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For decades, Rio would tell Agatha that someday a witch would figure out what The Road was truly about and it’d be Agatha’s lifeless body on the ground.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For decades, Agatha felt herself suffocating on all the love she didn’t dare admit was still keeping her heart warm whenever she caught a glimpse of Rio leaving.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And for decades, Rio continued to love Agatha, adapting to whatever she said, because she felt guilty for taking away what she had always wanted.

      Somewhere in Australia the teenager known to some as William Kaplan and to others as Billy Maximoff, was sleeping. The search for his brother had been taking longer than expected, partially due to the fact that Billy’s proximity radar seemed to be broken. In fact, that was the main reason why they had ended up in a land so far from home. After mocking him about this failure, saying only a fool or a toddler gets east and west confused, Agatha softened and reassured him that they could just catch the first flight back to America in the morning.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Besides,” Agatha shrugged, attempting to lighten the mood. “Who’s to say he wasn’t here before, uh?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And I picked up on his trail? Like I’m always one step behind?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “More or less, yes.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is that how Rio would find you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Alright, enough chit chat.” With a clap, Agatha was immediately done with the conversation. While they had spent quite a lot of time together, there were parts of her life that she wasn’t ready to disclose just yet. Maybe not ever. “Go to sleep, Billy.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Although being a ghost certainly had its pros, like scaring random people on the street and letting Billy take the blame for it, Agatha was finding that the list of cons kept piling up. From the inability to use her powers or the perpetual restlessness, she would often get bored and the only solution she found was to travel. Literally anywhere, it didn’t matter. Taj Mahal, Great Wall of China, Big Ben, you name it, she visited them all. One time she even stood on top of Christ The Redeemer and jumped off of it for no other reason than the fact that she could. Nothing would happen, she wasn’t going to die or get hurt. There were no rules and yet Agatha felt the most restricted she’d ever been.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      That night, instead of going big, Agatha went home. What she didn’t expect, however, was to see Rio standing in her yard, tending to the garden her corpse had been turned into. Even worse, Agatha hadn’t planned to have her night - or day - completely destroyed by reliving her death as seen - and felt - by Rio. If she had any powers, that whole experience would be written in every book as the true definition of trauma bond. And what Rio had said afterwards? Completely denying how illuminated Agatha's calculated risk had been? No one in history could possibly brag about being able to trick Death by avoiding the proper channels and becoming a ghost instead. Oh the audacity of saying her love was dead and buried when Agatha was still, very much, within the realms of existence, alive. Unless, of course… What Rio had said meant she didn’t love Agatha anymore.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Furious, Agatha returned to the hotel where Billy slept and waited, rather impatiently, for about five seconds before beginning the process of forcefully waking him up. Since he couldn’t feel her touch, Agatha thought about throwing things to the floor but the room was barren of decoration and, frankly, she was too aggravated to focus on channelling her energy for the task.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Billy.” The annoyance in her voice felt palpable yet she didn’t speak loud enough the first time, hoping it’d be enough. Since it wasn’t, Agatha raised her volume. “Billy!” Instead of waking up, the teen seemed completely unphased. “Don’t make me do this, kid.” Agatha threatened, despite the fact he clearly wasn’t listening. “Billy!” This time, his body moved yet he continued sleeping, his brain processing the sound as part of a dream the same way it often does with alarm clocks. “You brought this on yourself!” With a finger pressed against his temple, Agatha forced entrance into his mind through the connection he had established with her and yelled. “WAKE UP!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jolting awake, Billy looked around the room, in panic, searching for whatever the threat was that had made Agatha use their emergency pathway. When he found nothing other than silence, darkness and Harkness standing beside him with her hands on her hips, his shoulders sank. “Are you kidding me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Look, I tried the easy way, okay?” Offended by his attitude, Agatha watched him pick up his phone. “Just wait until that beau of yours finds out about your bedside manners.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s 5 am, Agatha,” Billy’s voice matched Agatha’s annoyance and she knew that didn’t bode well for either of them. “I understand you no longer have a sense of time and space but some of us still need to slee-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You can sleep when you’re dead now listen to me!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Taken aback by her snapping, Billy sat up in bed. “What’s gotten into you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I saw Rio.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?!” Blue sparks appeared in his palms, his fight or flight instinct immediately kicking in. “Where?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Easy there, tiger.” Waving her hand for him to lose the magic, Agatha began pacing around. “Back home. Well, my house, in Westview.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Confused, since it seemed Agatha was so flustered that she wasn’t giving up any information freely, he asked. “Why did you go there?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I needed more underwear." A pause for Billy to roll his eyes and for Agatha to huff. "What do you think it was, brainiac? I was bored, you were asleep, I went for a walk.” And that was exactly what she’d normally do except Agatha would often choose more exotic locations, she hadn’t returned home since the morning she left with Billy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And what was she doing there?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a deep sigh, Agatha stopped and looked at the boy. “Visiting.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh?” It took him a second or two to do the math for time zone differences. “Right, the day of the dead.” Billy concluded and Agatha responded with her classic nod whenever someone stated the obvious. “Well… she was visiting a loved one, I guess.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ah.” Agatha felt icky and itchy all over, all the same time. Why couldn’t people just accept that she wasn’t dead? She was a ghost, still walking the earth, no one had actually lost her forever.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why does it bother you so much what she does?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It doesn't.” Shortly after she said that, a tiny voice inside her brain questioned the veracity of such statement yet she didn't let Billy know that. “I just… Wasn't expecting to run into her over my own grave.” A shiver went down her spine like a jolt of electricity. “Beautiful garden, though, I have to give credit where credit is due, I mean, she
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       is
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      THE Green Witch after all.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha,” Billy’s voice was earnest and, as he held his knees against his chest, Agatha sat on the edge of the bed waiting for the question that was coming her way. “Do you still like her?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh please!” Despite her first response, physically and emotionally, being complete disdain at the mere suggestion of that possibility, deep down the truth was banging against the vault Agatha had saved it in. Begging to come out, to be embraced, to be told. "Don't be preposterous!"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You can admit it,” Pressuring on without changing his tone, at the risk of scarring Agatha into retreat, Billy continued. “Not to me but at least to yourself.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There’s nothing to admit.” Agatha snapped back, seconds after the last words left Billy’s mouth, leaving no time for the teen to interpret her pauses.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then why did you wake me up in the middle of the night just to tell me you ran into your ex?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Because!” Unfortunately for Agatha, he made a point she couldn’t quite refute. Rio presented no danger to either of them. Death wasn’t knocking on the door to collect. There was absolutely no reason for Agatha’s urgency and yet her inability to process what had happened propelled her to pull Billy out of his slumber. “Ugh.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Exactly.” Rubbing sleep out of his eye, Billy pondered on what to say next and decided upon the facts. “Besides, I was there. I saw… that kiss.” Agatha’s shoulder moved as if she was disgusted, the realisation that having had spectators to something that felt so intimate was giving her second-hand embarrassment months later. “And while I will never advocate for toxic relationships, there was enough love there to, at least, try to make amends.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You saw that?” Agatha settled for the short version of her question while, in her mind, she asked the rest.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       “From one kiss?”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Anyone with eyes could see it.” Noticing the cracks in Agatha’s tough exterior, the reminder that she did have feelings underneath it all, Billy figured that was the perfect opening to tell her what happened next. “Not to mention how she broke at least five or six rules of nature to give you a proper burial.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Right.” Chuckling, in disbelief that she was about to say those words, Agatha spoke. “Special treatment.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Look,” Reaching over the blankets to place his hand has close to Agatha as possible, despite being unable to hold it, Billy tried to comfort his former babysitter. “If she really hated you, I think she would’ve left you to rot.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well,” The memories flooded Agatha with the force of water breaking through a dam to fill a river. “She’s done that before, actually, just ask my mother.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a laugh, Agatha shook her head, letting Billy know that was a story for another day. “Nevermind.” She waved him off, thinking about how she had distracted Death from doing her job with a conversation Agatha never planned to have and upon learning everything about Evanora, Death decided her punishment would be eternal damnation as a ghost. No chance at redemption, no possibility to resolve her unfinished business, no soul recycling, nothing.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Just go talk to her.” The genuine softness of Billy’s voice broke Agatha out of her trip down memory lane and she saw the boy was already moving back into bed, preparing to go back to sleep.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t know where she is,” Agatha’s low tone indicated that she was being earnest, truthful, as if her sad smile didn’t give it away. “And I can’t just summon her anymore. Lost those privileges when I got my hands on the Dar-” In truthfulness, Agatha stopped herself from continuing due to the fact that she’d revealed too much, not because…
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The Darkhold.” Billy said, finishing her sentence. “You can say it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well, yes.” A pause. “That.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then think.” Tucking himself in, Billy closed his eyes. “If she visited you, where else would she go?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “FUCK!”

      Every year, on the same day, and when the sun began to set while golden rays painted the trees, Rio Vidal took a stroll through the woods. Sometimes she would allow herself to be seen as a mere passerby, others she would move through the shadows. Regardless of whoever bore witness of her presence, she walked silently. Halfway through the path, her hands replicated the same movement she had been doing for centuries, conjuring the only flower in her evergreen garden that was reserved for the one she was visiting.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Blue, for a boy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      However, as she got closer to her destination, Rio sighed with the heaviness that accompanies the destruction of a tradition, for better or for worse. This year there would be no special blue flower, freshly plucked moments before being offered. Instead, hidden in the depth of her robe, protected from any harm, there was a purple azalea. With a slow hand wave, announcing her arrival to the trifoliate orange hedge tasked to guard that sacred ground, Rio paused for a moment to look over her shoulder.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      It didn’t feel right, none of it did. The fact that she was about to do what she had set out to do and that Agatha had chosen to visit Nicholas' resting place for the first time not by choice but as a consequence. Rather than announce her awareness of Agatha’s presence, Rio proceeded as if she was still alone in her grief. Swiftly, as to not disturb the balance of nature surrounding the area, she planted the purple azalea from Agatha’s garden in the centre of the ground protected by the thorny hedge. Taking a step back to allow magick the space needed for transformation, Rio watched as the new habitant of that small ecosystem inspired the dormant lavender to bloom again in a time of year where it shouldn’t have.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Pulling out her dagger, Rio grabbed onto the singular branch where a yellow coloured orange had grown and cut it off. Anyone else would’ve had their palm pierced by the thorns but they didn’t pose much of a threat to the Green Witch herself. Carefully, as to not break the branch, Rio moulded it to form a crown and held the fruit in her other hand. Did she deserve what Rio was going to do? Absolutely not. However, regardless of the fact she had already told her there was no longer a heart beating in her chest, Rio was touched to see Agatha had finally decided to visit.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That lavender is yours.” Rio spoke as she turned around to face the spot where Agatha stood, holding onto the invisibility she had learned how to use.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a sigh, aware she’d been caught, Agatha revealed herself. “Why did you keep it alive?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I didn’t.” Shrugging, Rio continued. “He did.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t talk about him.” Agatha’s voice trembled, a mixture of sadness and anger.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why?” Walking the distance between them, Rio felt a lump in her throat yet it didn’t deter her from pressuring. “Does it hurt you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t.” Although she could merely go anywhere else and abandon the conversation, Agatha was simultaneously stuck to the ground because… She’d never been there before. She hadn’t been there in centuries. All because she couldn’t face Nicky, not even his grave.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a chuckle, Rio shook her head. “Has it ever occurred to you that, perhaps, he might resent you more for letting people believe the lies instead of telling the truth?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And what would the truth be?” Gesturing dramatically, Agatha felt a swirl of emotions pull her into the eye of the hurricane she’d done everything to avoid. “That my son was pure and good and I took him through all the wrong paths? That I couldn’t stop myself no matter how many times he asked me to? That I took his song and I- I defiled it? That I couldn't sav-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Smiling, Rio watched as a tree branch lowered itself down to touch Agatha’s shoulder, stopping her from talking. “Keep going.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What are you doing?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Nature is healing.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Stop it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Bind me and you’ll see how this is out of my control.” Presenting her wrists forward, Rio waited for Agatha to make her choice.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I don’t have any powers.” Agatha placed her hands on her hips, looking between the branch laying on her shoulder and Rio at a speed that would soon make her dizzy. “You know that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You never needed them to hold me.” A pause. “You know that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why must everything come in absolutes for you, Agatha?” Rio readjusted her grip on the crown and the fruit, still uncertain if she should do it. “All or nothing?” Blinking tears away, she saw in Agatha’s eyes the pain that desperately wanted to be released. “That’s… my job. It was never yours.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What would you have me do, uh?” Tears burnt their way down Agatha’s cheeks and, miraculously, she felt them. “I was the one who condemned him to a life of borrowed time.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And I was the one who granted it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A sob made Agatha, the hiccup stuck in her throat and she saw every ounce of the hurt she felt mirrored in Rio’s eyes. “Does he… Did he know?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “He did.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh...” Agatha held onto her chest, as if that would stop her from collapsing onto herself like a dying star turning into a black hole. “What did
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       we
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      do?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We loved, Agatha.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Propelled by a force stronger than herself, Agatha launched forward and wrapped her arms around Rio, crying onto her shoulder. It took a second to register, similarly to how it had that night in Agatha’s yard, but Rio held her former lover back. Tightly, as if she was trying to keep Agatha from splitting in half with the force of centuries old repressed grief finally catching onto her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Slowly pulling back from their embrace, Agatha pressed her forehead against Rio’s, taking a moment to recenter herself. “What, hum, what’s the crown for?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Curiosity killed the cat, never heard of that?” Rio chuckled and moved away just enough to look into Agatha’s eyes while she kept her hands firmly on Rio’s shoulders. “It’s for you, if you’re ready.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “For what?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “To talk to him.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I can’t.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You could.” Handing the crown to Agatha, Rio continued. “You already did the hardest part today.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Coming here?” With a sigh, Agatha’s shoulders dropped and she felt compelled to tell the truth. “I- I came after you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Now who's pursuing who?” Amused, Rio admired how earnest Agatha was allowing herself to be. It was refreshing, truly, but most of all she was glad they weren’t fighting in the ground Rio wanted to remain peaceful. “Good thing I was here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Thank you, Billy.” Rolling her eyes, Agatha spoke barely above a whisper, hating the fact that she needed the teenager to give her this push.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Who knew that abomi- boy had any value after all.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Please.” Agatha gave Rio a knowing look, fully aware that her former lover felt threatened by his presence on Earth simply due to the lengths his magic could go and the things he could do.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What matters to me is that you came here and,” With a deep breath, Rio held the crown up. “If you choose to wear this, you’ll see the world in a different way and it will give you temporary access to him.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Where is he?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Liminal space.” Given the look of confusion on Agatha’s face, Rio divulged the easiest answer. “He’s everywhere and nowhere, all at the same time. He’s the cycle of life and death. He’s with me and he’s with you. Today he’s here, where you can visit him.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And what if he doesn’t want me to visit?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then he wouldn’t have made a key.” Presenting the fruit in her hand, Rio held it in her palm for Agatha to see. “When you asked if I was repotting, I didn’t know if you would understand but I think you might now.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Understand what?” Agatha took the fruit from Rio’s hand to inspect how it seemed like a lemon yet smelled like an orange.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That I needed a part of you to grant access to him.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “He is my blood, my tears and my bone,” With pursed eyebrows, Agatha tried her best to understand why that wouldn’t be enough to see her son in whatever realm he was in now that she could freely travel through them. “Why did you need more?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Since you’ve never been here to give him proof of life,” Rio sighed, hurt that she even had to say such a thing and even more so that it was, unfortunately, the truth. “I needed proof of death.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And now I can visit him?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You can.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha pondered and Rio watched.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha lifted the crown and Rio watched.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha held onto it, feeling the thorns in her palm, and Rio watched.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is there no other option?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re such a coward, Agatha.” Chuckling, Rio decided to feign walking away, actively turning her back on Agatha and taking a couple steps in another direction. “There’s only two options,” Rio said, raising her voice enough to make sure Agatha heard her. “Together or alone.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Together or alone.” Agatha repeated under her breath and, holding the fruit tightly in her left hand, she placed the crown on her head. Suddenly, as Rio had promised, the world shifted. The green was more vibrant, the smells of nature were fresher, the sound of the nearby river was cleaner.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Feeling the shift, Rio stopped in her tracks and turned around to see that Agatha had actually done it. For a moment, she had regained human form and Rio smiled watching her feel the fullness of her shape again. However, it didn’t last very long since Agatha removed the crown as soon as Rio heard giggling. Through the corner of her left eye, Rio saw Nicholas standing at the entrance of his portal and winked at him while Agatha covered her eyes to cry, immediately dropping the crown onto the ground as if it was burning her skin.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I couldn’t.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But you tried.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Raising her face from her tear covered palms to see Rio standing further away, Agatha felt her shoulders sink. “Did he see me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “He did,” Rio’s smile widened and she decided, then and there, to reward Agatha for what she’d done, even if it had been just dipping the tip of her toes on the pool. “And he wants me to tell you something.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That you should try again next year.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Together or alone?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “However you prefer,” With a shrug, Rio continued. “But you know when I'll be here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Thank you.” Looking down at the ground, Agatha noticed that the crown had already blended into nature, returning to itself and continuing the cycle. Once she looked up, Agatha saw Rio wave in the direction of Nicholas' grave and the most amazing thing happened: the thorny plant involved the patch of lavender, as well as her purple azalea, in a protective embrace.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh and one more thing,” Rio spoke and Agatha quickly shifted her attention towards the green witch. “The boy is in Los Angeles.”

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Standing on opposite sides of the room where they had clashed in a variety of ways through the night, Agatha and Rio got dressed in silence. They had done this kind of dance so many times that there wasn’t any awkwardness; however, from where Rio stood, the air felt charged. While curiosity could get the best of her often, especially when it came to Agatha’s nonsensical plans to lure gullible witches into her traps, Rio felt there had to be something else afoot. Agatha was antsy, to the point she fumbled with her belt repeatedly, propelling Rio to intervene and buckle it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Someone is in a rush.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well,” Agatha adjusted her hair and looked out the window, avoiding Rio’s gaze. “You know,” Noticing where her coat had landed through their frenzy, Agatha moved away from Rio to pick it up. “Places to be.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Witches to kill.” Concluding Agatha’s sentence, Rio searched the room for her dagger to find that it was stuck on a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know me.” Reaching for the front door handle, Agatha took a deep breath, the severity of what she had set out to do becoming almost too much to handle.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not well enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning around to face Rio with a speed that left her immediately dizzy, Agatha tried not to look too inquisitive, or offended. “What does that mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “There’s always new things to learn, Agatha.” Planting a gentle kiss on her cheek, Rio placed her hand over Agatha’s and, together, they opened the door. “I will never fully know you and vice versa.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe it’s best that way.” Agatha spoke with a certain assertiveness, watching Rio cross the threshold to stand outside. “Keeping the mystery alive.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With a chuckle, Rio nodded. “Te veo.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha waited until Rio was completely out of her sight to whisper a response. “No.” She paused, touching the brooch that never left her. “You won’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Over the years, Agatha had allowed, and created, rumours about herself to ensure others perceived her through a narrative she could control. Neither story running through the witches world, moving from one coven to the other, was true or, at least, 100% correct. The biggest lie of all, and the one Agatha held onto like a flag, was that she had exchanged her son for the Darkhold. It kept the worst kind of witches at arms length, fearing what she’d do to them with such power, and it served as the perfect bait for those curious enough to want to learn more. In the meantime, Agatha was, in fact, actively searching for the forbidden book and those who had real answers about its whereabouts met the same fate as those who didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Through many miles of tricks and trials, Agatha got simultaneously closer and further away. There were instances where she could feel the darkness pull her, as if it had been made aware of her pursuits and signalled in order to be found. Yet there were moments where Agatha would double, even triple, the body count she’d leave behind out of sheer frustration for how long it was taking. When those sprees happened, she’d make up the most deranged story for Rio, who would listen so attentively that it infuriated Agatha even further. How could she possibly continue to love her this way when Agatha felt adoration and hatred in equal measures, battling for dominance inside her every single day. It was exhausting and Agatha needed a break. From her thoughts, from her feelings, from them.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     That morning when Agatha woke up, she watched Rio, memorising every feature and when a tear rolled down her cheek, landing on Rio’s chest, Agatha closed her eyes. For so long she had avoided the conversation and, instead, consistently punished Rio for what she’d done by controlling their relationship, morphing it into a monster that was consuming both of them. Rio barely used green anymore and Agatha knew it was her fault. She was sucking the life out of her but how could she be any different? The woman she loved most in the world was the same entity that took their child away. It wasn’t fair.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Determined to end both of their sufferings with one blow, Agatha set out to follow the lead she had for the day. It took her to a sketchy bar, in a town she didn’t bother to memorise the name of. None of the patrons seemed to notice her presence and the witch she had agreed to meet explained they were all part of the same incantation, serving as decoys for her own safety. Pretending to be a mere student of the dark arts, Agatha listened to all the information the other witch was willingly sharing with her and only when she grew impatient did she ask for proof.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me, Agatha Harkness, if I was to search for your most precious belongings, where would they be?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Inspecting the room, Agatha tried to get under the witch’s skin and figure out what would be her hiding place; however the clues didn’t make much sense at all. Feeling the electricity of her frustration cackling between her fingertips, Agatha gave into her first instinct and walked towards the old crib at the far end of the room, covered in complete darkness. The closer she got, the more her powers became unable to contain, burning her palms yet Agatha persisted and lifted the white blanket to find what she’d long searched for. The Darkhold. And it was calling for her, begging her to touch it, to hold it, to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Before the other witch could do anything to stop her, Agatha picked up the book and it felt better than when she’d taken a little bit of Rio’s power many moons ago. More satisfying than any coven she could dry up. More pleasurable than vanquishing her own coven. Oh, Agatha felt like a God and when the witch blasted her, hoping it would force Agatha to drop the book, what happened was life changing. Holding the Darkhold against her chest, Agatha took that witch's power in its entirety, including the incantation that kept the patrons at the bar. Walking through the corpses, Agatha let out a cackle with a renewed sense of joy,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Goodbye, my love.” Blowing a kiss at the grotesque scene, Agatha magically opened the book in the right page and read aloud the words that promised to keep her hidden from any force that attempted to find her, covered in a cloak of impenetrable dark magic.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was supposed to be a clean cut yet, while she was doing her job in another part of the world, Rio felt something awful right in the middle of her ribcage. It was less like a missed beat and more like someone had reached inside to squeeze her heart until she had no choice but to crumble to her knees. It was suffocating, crippling, dilacerating. It was too much and Rio didn’t know what to do other than panic because it could only mean one thing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Falling to the ground, Rio gripped onto the patch of grass near her left hand while repeating her lover’s name and allowing nature to do what she didn’t seem able to. The grass grew around her hand, wrapping itself around her wrist, moving all the way up to her elbow and then began pulling her. Slowly but surely, Rio was absorbed by the earth and, through the branches of her realm, searched for Agatha. There was no heartbeat anymore, neither up or down.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “AGATHA!” Death screamed, the repercussions of such action causing earthquakes over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Moving from place to place as fast as she could, completely disregarding her own rules and abandoning her job, Rio searched frantically through all the corpses she found without properly handling them. There had been many times where, jokingly, Rio had told Agatha that one day she’d be happily collecting her after a failed trip down The Road but the possibility that it had actually happened was… Overbearing. Growing more and more impatient, Rio used her green witch status to summon the elements and order them to find Agatha while she’d go down to question those that hadn’t left yet.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn’t take long until the whispers and the rumours circling around her realm painted a horrifying picture. All those things Agatha had allowed people to believe about her, somehow, turned into ideas in her head and propelled her to truly find the Darkhold. If she had the fame already, it wouldn’t hurt from having the real thing as well. Furious with the fact that Agatha hadn’t been truthful to her during this pursuit, Rio returned to Earth determined to find her fearing the worst had already come to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon setting foot on land, Rio was informed about the path Agatha had taken and rushing through it, she quickly arrived at the bar. Forcing her eyes shut to keep the tears inside, Rio harnessed all the strength in her body before entering the establishment. However, the burned down door caught her attention and Rio noticed there was no sign of ashes on the floor, which could only mean… Looking up at the white stone standing above the entrance, Rio saw a dark inscription. Reaching up to touch it, as if she needed anymore confirmation, Rio found that it was, indeed, Darkhold magic.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha…” Her voice was weak, heavy with the pain of being rejected in the worst possible way after centuries of accepting Agatha’s grief. “What have you done?” Touching the inscription once again, Rio was able to see Agatha making it and heard her voice bidding adieu.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Devastated from the betrayal Agatha had inflicted on her, Rio allowed the anger to take over the reins and, through tears, closed her eyes to the destruction it caused. Unbeknownst to her, Agatha was standing near enough to see the sky turn into a sick shade of green and a hurricane forming from black clouds, powered by thunderbolts that almost blew her eardrums off. With a primal scream, Rio’s clothes disintegrated and from the crater that had opened up where the bar used to be, Agatha saw lava crawl upwards. Part of her wanted to intervene, to do something, yet all she did was watch as the lava turned into thin lines that moved through Rio’s body, forming a dress, as well as a cloak. Picking up a handful of lava from the floor, Rio held it over her head and a lightning bolt hit it, shattering the mass to transform it into a crown.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     In a swift motion, when she was done damaging the sacred balance, Rio cleared the skies and closed the crater. Out of life, death. Out of love, loss. Out of joy, pain. What had started as a day like so many others had turned into the second worst day of Rio’s life yet, as  nature would have it, she was transformed by it. Checking out her new outfit, Rio chuckled heavily with the irony that not long ago someone had told her that she was too chippy for a widow and there she stood.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Death.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The widow.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     In all black.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The same colour her heart had turned inside her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, with a hand to the ground, Rio made sure to allow flowers to grow before she left. Crushed with the knowledge that she wouldn’t be able to find Agatha anymore unless she was either stripped of the Darkhold or willingly gave up on it, Rio covered her head with the cloak and Death opened a portal to her realm. Taking one last look at the place where Agatha had chosen power over them, she sighed and entered the portal without hearing, from not too far away, Agatha saying…

      After convincing Billy that Rio would never lie to her, especially about something as important as Tommy’s whereabouts, they set out to Los Angeles. Finding him was easier than expected and explaining their predicament was, somehow, even easier. As it turned out, Tommy remained the same kid Agatha met in his youth: a permanently hungry airhead. It was endearing, to a degree. Between Billy’s constant overthinking and Tommy’s escapades to the nearest candy shops, Agatha had her hands full. Nonetheless, she continued to help them in whatever way she could as their spirit guide or whatever name Tommy decided to call her and the list was growing, from Nanny McSpooky to Ghostha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As time went on, Billy grew more well versed in using his powers and Tommy continued his pursuit of getting faster. Between training sessions, the trio would get up to some adventures yet when the boys went to sleep, Agatha felt lonely. Trapped. Watching Billy play with magic so freely made her wish to have powers of her own and she would even settle for the starter pack. That’s how desperate Agatha was, willing to have just enough to get by. And since that wasn’t torture enough, she would find herself thinking about Rio…

     <em>

    <p>
     <span>
      Months went by, and then a few more. At some point, Billy managed to arrange a meeting with Jen and introduce Tommy, who she described as “a teenager on steroids, the scariest being in the world” which, in retrospect, wasn’t the best choice of words because… Agatha waited until Jen was completely off guard to surprise her with the ghost reveal, obviously causing Jen to go into a screaming fit. While Billy looked concerned and tried to find solutions to help Jen calm down, Agatha and Tommy found her reaction to be the most hilarious piece of entertainment in the world.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      July came around and… Still no signs of Rio. Not as a mere accident on a random Tuesday or as ships passing in the night. Nothing. In fairness, Agatha had told her that after she died, she didn’t want to see her face ever again but they had met after that. Had their encounters not made it clear that Agatha did want to see her again? Had it not been enough to mend the wounds her words may have caused? Was the case so severe that Agatha had to be the one finding Rio and making herself vulnerable? As she sat on the empty bleachers of a stadium where the boys were training, with Billy creating hurdles for Tommy to evade, Agatha looked up at the moon. Blood phase, when the veil between the living and the dead is at its thinnest.

      “He’s fast.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Chuckling softly, Agatha closed her eyes, believing herself to be missing Rio so much that she was hallucinating her voice. Oh and how sweet it sounded, melodic even.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      As she got closer to her former lover, Rio smiled seeing Agatha so absent minded and decided not to disrupt, merely sitting down beside her, waiting until Agatha noticed her presence. It was genuinely impressive seeing Billy magically conjure objects out of thin air and placing them in the path of his speedster brother who managed to dodge them with the skill of someone who had been practising for such a thing his whole life. Did that mean she was sold on having allowed the sacred balance to be upset by their two for four combo? Absolutely not, but Rio could see the appeal.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a heavy sigh, Agatha opened her eyes and nearly jumped when she realised that Rio’s voice hadn’t been a product of her deprived imagination but a sound coming from beside her. Where Rio was. Eating a bucket of popcorn. “You- you’re here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I am.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But are you-” Agatha paused, stopping herself from reaching over to Rio’s arm and touching it just out of sheer muscle memory. “Here here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That hasn’t happened in a while.” Throwing a popcorn into her mouth, Rio tried not to think about the last time she’d been fully with Agatha without being elsewhere at the same time, doing her job.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can you still do it?” The question seemed simple yet, for Agatha, it was loaded with double meaning for what she couldn’t bring herself to say.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Of course.” Biting her tongue, Rio pondered about responding exactly what she was thinking, that all Agatha needed to do was ask and she’d be there, entirely.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you- Do you miss that?” Clearing her throat, Agatha looked at the boys before turning back to Rio. “Being in one place at a time.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Munching on her treats, Rio tried to decipher Agatha’s expression and it felt as though they were both holding back while trying to extend peace offerings. “I do.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh.” Nodding, Agatha swallowed harshly, hoping Rio had meant what she thought she had. “Is that why you’re here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Because I miss being anchored?” Another popcorn found its way into her mouth as a way for Rio to buy some time and think the answer through. “Maybe.” Deciding that was the best path available, she turned her attention to the twins. “Or maybe I was just curious.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You want to meet them?” With a laugh, Agatha felt disbelief at first but when the realisation struck that Tommy would probably be fascinated by Rio, her expression turned more serious. “You’re not here to take them, are you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No, my love,” The words slipped out of Rio’s mouth like air, right through her teeth without giving her the faintest chance to lock them inside. Momentarily gagged by her own mistake, Rio cleared her throat. “They will die eventually but not now.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha couldn’t hide the smirk on her lips and she was thankful that Rio seemed to be entertained enough by Tommy’s gear shift to notice that she had heard those words.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       My love
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      . Rio said them and Agatha heard them, which in turn made her chest feel warm again. Could it be? Could she be… Falling for Rio? Again? Unsure what to respond, Agatha remained silent, mesmerised by how attentively Rio was watching the twins.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Has the speedster ever tried to run on water?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh he’d drown.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Snorting, Rio turned to Agatha with her brows pursed. “With that speed?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “His little legs are fast but up here?” Looking at Rio, she tapped her temple twice to emphasise the point. “Runs on coal.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is that why you keep him running loops on himself?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “None of this is up to me,” Agatha gestured to what was happening in the field and sighed. “If it was, I wouldn’t even be here.” A pause. “Or I would but, I’d at least be making both of their lives miserable with real hurdles rather than whatever kid friendly obstacles Billy is making.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha,” Using a more serious tone, Rio waited until Agatha’s gaze met hers. “Are you happy?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       is
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      happiness, really?” Attempting to divert the conversation, Agatha huffed and puffed. “Is anyone ever happy?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I was,” A sad smile drew itself across Rio’s lips. “A long time ago but I was.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I-” Agatha thought about how to get out of the rabbit hole they were about to hop into yet she was too tired of being consumed by grief, loneliness, powerlessness, everything. “No, I’m not happy.” With a heavy sigh, Agatha looked up at the sky, hoping the tears wouldn’t come and her throat wouldn’t try to close. “I get it now, why you let my mother rot. This… This isn’t living. It’s a prison and I feel stuck. I feel trapped. I feel…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Restless?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes.” Nodding, she faced Rio once more and saw the same tenderness from so many times before. The attentive listening, the consideration, the love. “And it’s not like I want to sleep, I just…” A grunt erupted, paired with rubbing her hands together and turning them palms up, with nothing coming out. “I want to do things and I can’t.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Was it worth it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha held the tears for as long as she could but Rio’s question broke the gates and allowed the flood. “Yes… And no.” Despite her lower lip trembling, Agatha continued. “But you left me no other choice.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Don’t.” Immediately launching herself forward, Agatha gripped Rio’s free hand with both of hers. “Don’t do that.” Moving her head from side to side, Agatha knew she had to be completely honest or she’d lose Rio again, for good this time. “I didn’t mean it like that.” Bringing Rio’s hand up to her lips, Agatha kissed her knuckles. “This wasn’t your fault and I’m not blaming you for this. It was my choice. I was the one who took from you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Stunned with Agatha’s honesty while simultaneously proud that these months away as she experienced life as a ghost had been enough for Agatha to learn the severity of her actions, Rio put down the popcorn bucket and offered her other hand for Agatha to hold as well. “It wasn’t the first time though.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But the first time it was…” With a smile on her lips, Agatha reminisced about that day in the river. “Beautiful.” Agatha watched as Rio smiled in return, although her eyes were sad, and brushed a few strands of hair away from Rio’s forehead. “He- he looked so much like you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You think so?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh I’m sure.” With a chuckle, Agatha touched Rio’s chin to lift her head up and admired all the ways in which Nicholas resembled her. “There was no denying he was yours.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is that why you didn’t want to look at me anymore?” Silently nodding, Agatha pursed her lips and Rio pulled her in for a tight embrace. “Forgive me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Agatha pulled back and cupped Rio’s cheeks. “Only if you forgive me,” Smiling, with her shoulders dropping from all the weight being lifted off of them, Agatha finished her sentence. “My love.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is there a catch to this?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Have I tortured you that much? That you don’t trust me anymore?” Agatha’s eyebrows pursed together and she could see by the look on Rio’s face that the answer was yes. “How can I prove to you that I want nothing in return? Just say it and I’ll do it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Pondering for a moment, Rio chuckled, realising that this time she was the one that wanted more than forgiveness. “Do you remember this?” Placing her left hand between them, Rio watched as Agatha touched the line across her palm. “What this meant?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How could I forget?” Although her hand was translucent nowadays, Agatha had learned how to make it a little less so and it was enough to see her scar was there as well. “Matchy match, as the kids say.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No one says that, Agatha.” Laughing, Rio shook her head. “I miss it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Me too.” Agatha’s voice was small but her feelings were large, occupying her whole ribcage. “You asked if there was a catch and maybe this is it. Maybe my catch is that I want to have this again.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And by this you mean…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Us.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A loud bang in the middle of the field caught both of their attentions and Agatha rose from her seat. “WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING DOWN THERE?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I didn’t do anything.” Billy’s voice echoed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What’s it called when something just blows up in your hands?” Tommy stood by Agatha’s side, eating off of Rio’s popcorn bucket. “Who’s the lady?” As Agatha opened her mouth to respond, Tommy spoke. “Wait, are you Rio?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She is.” Agatha nodded as Billy flew in to join them. “And this is Toby.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Tommy.” Both teenagers, and Rio, said in unison.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It’s so nice to finally meet you,” Tommy stretched his hand for Rio to hold and she merely looked at him with a raised eyebrow. “I’ve heard so much about you.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “All bad, I hope.” Moved by her conversation with Agatha, Rio decided to shake the boy’s hand while looking at Billy.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And all true.” Billy replied, fearing this encounter was bad news for them. “What are you doing here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh you know,” With a shrug, Rio shoved her hands in her pockets. “I was in the neighbourhood.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Classic.” Tommy laughed as he finished the popcorn bucket. “Was this yours?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “For a moment, yes.” Everyone except Tommy understood that she was talking about more than just the bucket, namely the body his soul had claimed, but only Billy tensed up. “But now I’m glad you had it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh man, I can just run and get you another one, you won’t even notice I’m gone.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Another day.” A pause and Rio turned to Agatha who nodded with a smile before beginning to walk away.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Wait,” Billy spoke, stopping Rio from leaving. “I need to ask you something.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And what’s that?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Can…” Seemingly unsure of how to voice his question, Billy tried to send it through brainwaves yet Rio didn’t seem to be getting the message.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh you’re trying to,” Gesturing between their foreheads, Rio shook her head. “Not available to you, buddy.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is it what you told me the other day?” Tommy asked and Billy nodded. “He wants to know if we can make Agatha human again.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “BILLY!” Agatha tried to smack the teenager’s arm, which obviously would’ve never worked. “Why would you put those thoughts in your brother’s head?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I didn’t!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I was the one that asked because like,” Running through Agatha’s body at superspeed enough times until he thought he’d proven his point, Tommy quickly noticed that no one was catching his drift, only Rio. “See what I mean?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I do.” Rio crossed her arms over her chest, impressed that Agatha hadn’t requested such a thing during their conversation yet the boys seem to want that for her. “And I agree with you, it’s not fun.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Knew you’d understand.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There might be a way.” All three looked at Rio with different levels of curiosity and she chuckled. They might be children of another mother yet time spent together is always more than enough to leave familiar imprints. “But only if this is what Agatha wants.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I-” With her hands on her hips, Agatha’s mind felt as though it’d gone completely blank.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well,” Looking up at the moon, Rio touched the scar on her left palm. “A month from today I’ll be travelling and if you can remember where it is I’m going, you can meet me there.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Should we go as well?” Billy asked.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You must.” With a nod, Rio turned her attention to Tommy. “Have you ever thought about running on water?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Water.” Agatha whispered to herself and her eyes widened with the realisation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Te veo.”

      Granted they hadn’t agreed on a specific hour for this potential life changing encounter, Rio didn’t rush to it as she would have many moons ago. Instead, she spent the day fulfilling her duties to the sacred balance of the universe and ensuring the cosmos would remain unscathed with her choice. Or rather, Agatha’s choice. Everything depended on what Agatha Harkness truly wanted to do now that she was fully aware of the consequences. Despite having offered the possibility of rebirth, Rio didn’t confirm it was viable as she wasn’t entirely sure herself either. However, if Agatha was willing to risk it all for a kiss of death, Rio would do the same if it meant bringing her love back to life.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>

      As she walked through the familiar woods when the sun was beginning to set, Rio couldn’t help but smile at the thought that, in a few hours, there would be a heart beating in her chest once more. Telling Agatha she no longer had one and it was all Agatha’s fault had been one of the most painful things Rio had ever said to her, however true it might have been. Still, each moment Rio would steal a glance of Billy and his spirit guide over the past months, she always found herself craving for the emptiness in her chest to be filled again. While taking Nicky’s hand that night had shattered her, losing Agatha had left her completely hollow and Rio wanted to be whole.

     <span>
      Science says that water never forgets where it's been and magic works in a similar way. Once touched cannot be untouched. With her palm pressed against the tree that held Agatha as she welcomed Nicholas into the world, Rio closed her eyes and conjured a spell that only the Green Witch could. From her hand, ivy began to bloom and wrapped itself around the tree, going all the way up, covering the brown trunk with a mix of green, purple and blue. Satisfied with her creation, Rio walked closer to the river and took her cape off since it was summer, after all. With her back exposed, Rio felt a gush of wind moving in the opposite direction of what nature was doing and raised her left arm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Hey!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you know how to swim?” Rio asked, turning to her left side to see that Tommy had respected her silent restrictions and stood behind her arm.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ah, not really.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then wait for your brother.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why? If I just run really fast, maybe I can-” Stopping himself from continuing, Tommy saw how Rio gave him a sterner look as she removed the guard. “Wait.” Looking at the large stream of water in front of them, Tommy felt a sudden uneasiness in his chest. “Is this how I- how he died?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you want the truth or a lie?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That… kind of already answers it…” Tommy sighed and lowered to pick up a rock near his foot. “Was it bad?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Pondering about what would be the best approach to take, Rio considered telling him the truth in excruciating detail just how Billy had felt it. However, as much as she enjoyed the occasional torture, there was something about Tommy’s naiveness and genuine curiosity regarding the way the world works that compelled her to be softer towards him. Even if, deep down, she couldn’t yet let go of the fact that he was part of a massive breach between the realms.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If I told you to jump in the water right now, would you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I mean, I don’t really know how dee-”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No.” Rio’s tone was serious, matching her facial expression and she approached the boy. “Don’t overthink this like your brother.” Placing a hand over his chest, Rio watched as he looked at the river. “It’s a yes or no question.” With his heart beating against her palm, Rio asked once again. “If I told you to jump in the water, would you?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Because I don’t feel safe.” As he said those words, Tommy turned to look at Rio and he had a sad smile on his face. “Even if I knew you’d be the one to greet me on the other side.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh.” Rio was taken aback by that statement, unaware a boy she’d barely known would find comfort in that. In fact, his serenity confounded her so much that she removed her hand from where it laid over his chest and merely stared at him, words failing her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “They told me about you.” Tommy threw the rock across the water and it skipped two times before sinking. “And I don’t think you’re all bad.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I am what people need me to be.” Picking up a rock from the ground, Rio mimicked the teen and it skipped four times, going underwater on the fifth. “The good, the bad,” Looking over at Tommy, she watched as his expression remained calm and loving despite looking Death in the face. “The ugly.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That does not look ugly, dude,” Moving a little closer to inspect Death’s features, Tommy was mesmerised. “Damn, you’re cool.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a chuckle, Death bent down to pick up two more stones and Rio handed one to Tommy, as a way to spend the time while they waited for the others to arrive.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you sure this is the way?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If you’re not here to help, keep quiet.” Agatha nearly barked at Billy for questioning her navigation skills for the hundredth time in less than ten minutes. There had been a couple centuries since she’d walked that particular road but Agatha still knew the path like the back of her hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s actually something else I wanted to address…” Even though she was a ghost, Billy was constantly being left behind by Agatha who kept speeding up the pace. “I’ve done some research and…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What, Billy, what?” Fully stopping, Agatha placed her hands over her hips and gave Billy an inquisitive look.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There’s nothing written about someone coming back to life without, at the very least, one of the infinity stones.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So?” Waving dramatically, Agatha gestured around them. “All of this exists without those glorified marbles.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Sure but that’s nature.” Billy picked up a fallen leaf and showed Agatha how half was still green while the rest was already decaying. “It basically runs on itself. Blooms, grows, dies, blooms again.” Throwing the leaf away, Billy sighed. “We don’t do that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Well,” Agatha started walking again and the sound of laughing seemed to travel through the forest. “If she says there's a way then there must be a way.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But why would she need us here for it?” Hearing the laughter Agatha had already picked up on, Billy thought, for a moment, they were in some haunted woods but that didn’t last very long since Tommy’s cackle was easy to identify even in the middle of a crowd.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You built a whole other realm with your Maximoff neurons so,” Agatha couldn’t be bothered trying to rationalise this when she was standing on the verge of panic. “Maybe she needs your magic to power me up.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Won’t that kill me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “If it didn’t kill you before, it won’t now.” Even though that’s what she told the teenager as a poor attempt to smooth over his worries, Agatha was having a hard time convincing herself of such now that the idea was in her head. What if that was Rio’s plan? The only reason Billy was allowed to walk away from her yard that morning was because Agatha paid her own dues, which were more than enough to cover for him as well. What if Rio had lured them to a place that was so special only to rewrite history? Where a boy was born, another boy would die?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The doubts kept piling up in Agatha’s mind yet she marched forward, her chest feeling lighter with each step closer to where the sound of pure joy was coming from. To her surprise, as well as Billy’s, they saw a tree covered in the most gorgeous and colourful flowers. While for Billy it was just another demonstration of power, to Agatha it was a love letter for their child and it moved her to tears. As if that gesture hadn't been enough, they finally found the source for such audible jubilation: Rio and Tommy were throwing stones at the river, one at a time, but while Rio had managed to get up to ten skips, Tommy couldn’t do more than the odd four.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re cheating so hard right now.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then why do you keep laughing?” Rio teased, picking another rock from the pile she’d magically created and throwing it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Because cheating is for losers.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Excuse me?” Faking a level of offence that couldn’t be furthest from the truth, Rio looked at Tommy with her hand over her chest, which only made him laugh more. “Has no one ever taught you to respect your elders?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh I’ve tried,” Agatha spoke, fighting away the tears but fully accepting the smile that only grew when Rio smiled in return. “Trust me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Children these days.” Waving her finger accusingly at Tommy, who was trying to de-escalate his laugh, Rio shook her head. “One day you’ll learn.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But for now I need you to do something for me, Toby,” Aware that she’d called him by the wrong name, which had become more of a running gag than a cheap insult, Agatha placed her hands over his shoulders. “Fetch me the hardest liquor you can find and while you’re at it, get yourself something to eat.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But I don’t wanna miss it!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’ll get here just in time.” Rio pitched in from behind Agatha and mouthed a silent
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       “Go.”
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With a salute, Tommy ran off for his mission leaving the other three behind and Agatha was the one that broke through the silence. “Now what?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you certain this is what you want to do?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What will it cost?” Billy interjected, his anxiety getting the best of him, causing both women to stop looking at each other and turn to him instead. “Is that why you sent Tommy away? So he wouldn’t stay here to watch me be sacrificed?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU SAYING??” Agatha yelled out while Rio couldn’t help but snort, completely incredulous. “I just thought maybe I’ll need a stiff drink to know I’m alive, why would you think that??”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You might not know this, boy,” With a calm yet solemn voice, Rio addressed Billy directly. “But you’re standing on sacred ground right now. There are others who dabble in sacrificial rituals but that’s not me and certainly not here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I-” Looking at the dirt beneath his feet and back at the flower covered tree, Billy figured something special might’ve happened and it’s why Rio brought them there. “I’m sorry for what I said, I didn’t know.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You had no way of knowing,” Giving Agatha a raised eyebrow, which got a complete eye roll in response, Rio continued. “And that’s why you’re forgiven.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why do you need me then?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Simply put? I need your magic since I will be,” A pause, to find the right words and to scan Agatha from the bottom to the top. “Occupied, taking care of the rest.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And will it work?” Billy asked and Rio shrugged.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Another calculated risk, great.” Agatha sighed, however the uncertainty didn’t discourage her. At this point, she would rather die than spend another minute as the sole prisoner of her own choices. “Let’s do this.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you sure?” With a nod as response, Rio took a deep breath. “Okay.” Turning to Billy, who seemed incredibly nervous, Rio instructed in the most serene tone she could offer him. “You will know when but all I need you to do is blast her with the right intentions, you hear me?” Looking deeply into his eyes as if she was trying to search for his soul behind them, Rio continued. “You can’t do it out of hatred or fear or anything else, Billy. I need you to hit her with everything you got but it has to come from a good place inside you so find it and find it fast.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What if I can’t do it?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Your brother saw
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       me
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      while we waited for you and he didn’t cower away, he wasn’t afraid, he just… embraced it.” Rio could see from the corner of her eye that Agatha was in shock with the revelation and she knew there would be some explaining to do later. “Find that place within you that doesn’t hate Agatha, doesn’t resent her, and embrace it because if it didn’t exist you wouldn’t be here.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Nodding as if he’d been yelled at by his mother for misbehaving, Billy swallowed harshly and tried to focus. “I will do my best.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That’s all I need.” Turning around, Rio walked towards Agatha, picking up the dagger from her belt. “Are you ready?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Following Rio into the river, Agatha walked beside her until their legs were fully submerged with the water reaching their waists. “Are we…” Clearing her throat, Agatha lowered her voice. “Are we really doing this in front of him?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not that.” Rio responded with a chuckle, Agatha’s reaction confirming that she’d thought they were about to recreate their last time at the river. “But I’ll do yours if you do mine.” With her left palm turned upwards and handing the dagger to Agatha, Rio waited to see if her offer would be accepted.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is there anything I need to say?” Picking up the dagger, Agatha lowered to kiss Rio’s scar in reverence before placing the tip of the blade over the line’s starting point.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Willingly given.” Rio spoke, her eyes closed, and Agatha reopened the wound, blood immediately pouring out as it had happened centuries ago.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Will it work on me?” The question was genuine as Agatha’s current living condition abided by different rules of existence.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yet to find something this won’t cut through.” With a shrug, Rio held her dagger and touched Agatha’s hand.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Willingly taken.” Agatha concluded the spell, feeling the blade run through her palm in a way that made her question if, somehow, that part of her body was already human again just by starting the ritual.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      In a swift motion, Rio held Agatha’s hand, wound to wound, and pulled the love of her entire existence into a kiss. Forcing their palms together to remain attached, Rio used her free hand to hold the back of Agatha’s neck and, out of sheer muscle memory, Agatha gently cupped Rio’s cheek. Despite both wanting to hold and touch and grip onto each other as if their very presence on Earth depended on it, neither dared to move their hands away. Their kiss, however, escalated quickly into the level of intensity their mutual yearning begged for. It didn’t take long for Rio to feel a pulse beating, at a steady pace, between their joined palms and Agatha almost pulled away when she felt it spread through her body.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      From shore, Billy watched as Agatha’s body seemed to be moving away from the translucent he’d grown accustomed to into something more human. Taking that as his cue, he focused on all the good moments they had spent together. Every laughter they shared, every advice Agatha freely gave, every occasion where she’d allowed herself to be vulnerable, softer, kinder. With only good thoughts in his mind, Billy blasted Agatha with all of his magic. The shock from the hit propelled Agatha away from Rio’s lips but their hands never let go of each other, Agatha matching Rio’s grip as she felt herself growing stronger.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “There she is.” Rio cackled and a thunderbolt echoed at a distance. “Agatha Harkness, in all her glory.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “My river of life," Agatha said with tear filled eyes, stepping forward to caress Rio's face before diving in for a tender kiss. "My Death," Smiling at the face so many feared to see as she had presented herself to finish the ritual, Agatha moved for another kiss, on the forehead this time.
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       "My love."
      </span>
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      With those words, Rio returned to herself by letting go of Agatha’s hand, gesturing at Billy to stop before hitting Agatha’s chest with both of her palms, sending her underwater. A chilling silence surrounded the scene, just as Tommy arrived at the shore with a bottle of liquor and a half eaten hotdog. Billy felt himself frozen to the ground, in shock, wondering what the hell was happening and why was Rio walking out of the river all by herself.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Did I miss anything?” Tommy’s words sliced through the stillness like a freshly sharpened knife would smoothly run through a piece of paper. “You promised I would get here in time.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Patience is a virtue, speedster.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But you pushed her into the water!” There was a coat of anger on Billy’s tone and he balled his hands into fists, bracing himself for a potential confrontation. "Why would you do that?"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So much magic and so little knowledge in that big brain of yours,” Rio mocked the teenager, which only seemed to infuriate him further as there were blue sparks flying around. “What’s the first signal that a child is ready to be born?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Thewaterbreaks.” Considering his mouth was full, no one understood what Tommy said and he swallowed before repeating. “The water breaks, that’s what happened in the movie we saw yesterday.” Rio didn’t need to respond since, from behind her, a flying Agatha Harkness emerged out of the river. Her cackling echoing around the forest, travelling from tree to tree as a way to spread the message that she was alive once again. “What is she wearing?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Raising one eyebrow, Rio looked at Billy before turning around to find Agatha had a completely different outfit from what she’d usually wear. “What did YOU do?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I-” Billy panicked, watching Agatha play with her magic in the air. “I modernised her, I guess?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “A thigh gap?” Rio asked, her hands on her hips.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “It kind of looks like your dress, dude.” Tommy pointed out, making Rio look down at herself to find that, in fact, their skirts had a similar cut. “But I dig it. And the white streak on her hair, that looks fun.” Handing Billy the bottle, Tommy got closer to the river. “AGATHA! IF I RUN REALLY FAST ON THE WATER, DO YOU WANNA TRY TO GET ME?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re a fool for thinking I won’t hit you, kid.” Agatha would never say no to a challenge and proof of that was the way she was already creating a ball of purple between her hands. “Run.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For a little while, Tommy and Agatha played this wicked game of catch, The speedster learned he could run on water, as Rio had suggested, and Agatha found the reach, as well as the strength, of her newly acquired powers. From the shore, Billy and Rio watched them as they stood side by side, without saying a word, feeling that a bond had been formed.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "She's right," Rio finally spoke without taking her eyes away from Agatha, the witch’s laughter as contagious as the one of a child trying out her brand new Christmas toys. "You remind me of him." A pause. “Both of you do, in separate ways.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Who?" Billy realised the answer as soon as he asked the question. "You knew Nicky?"

      I walked across an empty land
      <br/>
      I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
      <br/>
      I felt the earth beneath my feet
      <br/>
      Sat by the river and it made me complete
      <br/>
      Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
      <br/>
      I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
      <br/>
      So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
      <br/>
      I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
      <br/>
      I came across a fallen tree
      <br/>
      I felt the branches of it looking at me
      <br/>
      Is this the place we used to love?
      <br/>
      Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
      <br/>
      Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?

      And if you have a minute, why don't we go
      <br/>
      Talk about it somewhere only we know?
      <br/>
      This could be the end of everything
      <br/>
      So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?

      “No one in history has ever received special treatment.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And what makes you think you did?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re joking, right?” Agatha crossed her arms over chest as she stood across from Rio, the only thing separating them being the evergreen garden that remained in her yard. “What is this?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “This is,” With a shrug, Rio looked down at the permanently blooming flowers and smiled. “A painting.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh so you’re an artist now.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “One does what one has to do.” Holding out her hand to the side, Rio picked up the glass of water that Tommy had raced into the kitchen to get for her. “It’s called keeping up with the times, you should look into it.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What is that supposed to mean?” A scoff. “Billy, get over here!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are they always like this?” Jen asked, walking beside Billy as they crossed the door that led into the yard.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “This is nothing compared to when they fight.” Billy responded with a full eye roll. “Did you summon me?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Am I not modern?” The look on Agatha’s face was daunting, a clear notice that there was only one correct answer and it had to be in full agreement with her. “Did I do a poor job at blending in through the decades?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “From what I've seen, your fashion sense has always been on point,” Billy started.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “But your mentality is way too old fashioned.” Jen concluded, forcing Billy in a very awkward laugh. “Sorry, had to be said.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Remind me, who invited you here?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You did, Agatha.” Snapping back, as was customary between them, Jen stared at Agatha with the same intensity that was being directed at her. “Olive branch, was what you said.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “See? Further proof that I’m letting go of the old, in with the new.” Dramatically gesturing, Agatha walked around the garden to pick up the water glass that Rio was holding and took a sip from it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Then why don’t I believe you?” The question might’ve been made without the intent to offend but it prompted Agatha to do a full assessment of Jen. “How many witches have you bound since you came back to life?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh please, Kale.” Chuckling, Agatha looked at Rio who had the wickedest smirk drawn on her lips before waving her fellow witch off. “Stop living in the past.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “One hundred years, Agatha.” Jen stated with the firmness of someone who had missed a big chunk of her life for no other reason than a few coins. “You barely made it to one year as a ghost.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is it fair to compare those two things?” Tommy asked, sitting in the stairs, looking down at his half empty bucket of popcorn. “Because they’re on different plates but definitely not on the same scale.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Someone's been hanging out with Rio too much.” Barely above a whisper, Billy tapped his brother’s shoulder before sitting down beside him.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She has a point, though. There needs to be balance and you can’t just compare water with fire.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “The boy is right.” It was Rio who spoke yet the way Agatha was nodding would have led someone else to believe she’d been the one attributing Tommy with the wise words. “Time isn’t linear and what is overbearing for certain people is nothing more than a regular Tuesday for others.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Time isn’t linear,” Jen repeated with a chuckle, placing a hand over her chest. “Lilia.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I miss her too.” Billy reached up to give Jen’s hand a small squeeze. “And Alice.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Taking the sombre silence that seemed to spread across the yard like a low fog, Agatha tugged on Rio’s sleeve to get her attention before speaking close to her ear. “Should we?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes,” Rio nodded with a small smile perking up the corner of her lips. “Don’t want to be late.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “You’re never late.” Biting her lip, Agatha felt herself getting lost in the love she had allowed her heart to feel for Rio. No more walls, no more buts, no more ifs. Just love. Pure, raw, unconditional.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sneakingly pressing a kiss to Agatha’s cheek, Rio spoke in a low tone. “Part of the job.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you two together?” The shock on Jen’s voice broke the lovers out of their bubble and Agatha nearly dropped the water glass on the fresh grass.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “No.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Yes.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh boy,” Holding onto his bucket, Tommy joyfully braced himself for what was coming.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Here we go.” Billy said, pinching the bridge of his nose in exasperation.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Agatha,” With green sparks emanating from Rio’s palm, she took a few steps backwards. “Did you say yes?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Why did
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       you
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      say no?” Harnessing her purple, Agatha took on a fighting stance, ready for the duel.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Because I was never asked anything.” Walking around in a circle, Rio smirked at how smoothly they had returned to old habits. The good ones only, like this dance.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Do you need a royal degree, your highness?” Taking a bow, Agatha licked her lips, the sweetness of this teasing game being almost too much to handle after having gone so long without it.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “What happened to being more modern,
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       sweetheart
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      ?” Sending a warning shot across the yard, Rio cackled with the way it seemed to startle Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Throwing two balls of purple rage from her palms, Agatha laughed when Rio turned sideways in order to avoid the hits. “If you truly kept with the times, you’d know no one asks anything anymore.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh but I’d love to see you,” With a clap, Rio conjured a thunderbolt that hit the recently reconstructed greenhouse and to shield herself from the glass shards, Agatha lowered. “On your knees.” In a swift motion, Agatha’s outfit morphed into her new combat clothing and Rio shook her head. “Aren’t you a little old for a thigh gap?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Shouldn’t you be acting your age?” Agatha threw a purple attack that Rio smoothly deflected.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I’m the natural order of all things, baby,” A green projectile flew out of Rio’s palms, clearly meant to miss Agatha by flying over her left shoulder. “And you love me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “BUT SHE WILL NEVER ADMIT IT.” Tommy spoke from his seat on the stairs, causing the two battling witches to laugh while Billy and Jen gave him a more concerned look. “What? I like it when they fight, free fireworks.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Is that right, Agatha?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Make me!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Their back and forth didn’t last very long since their presence was required elsewhere. Without really saying goodbye other than a quick wave, Rio and Agatha entered a portal that would take them directly to where they needed to be. Truth be told, that had been the first time Agatha had travelled through Rio’s realm and while it was a faster, more direct, path, she didn’t arrive unscathed. A little dizziness or some motion sickness was to be expected, as per Rio’s explanation, and both side effects were experienced by Agatha.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Suddenly they were standing by Nicholas' resting place, precisely under the same tree where they had been a full year ago. The sunlight was hitting the leaves in a similar way and yet Agatha felt beyond changed. The past twelve months had taught Agatha a variety of lessons, some more painful than others, but all of them forced her into a stage where she hadn’t allowed herself to be before: acceptance. Of her circumstances, of Rio’s existence, of Nicky’s limitations. Everything had become abundantly clear through the prism of her translucent spiritual journey.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Still, as she watched Rio magically announce their presence to the trifoliate orange hedge guarding their son, Agatha was afraid. Less about Nicky’s reaction and more so about her worthiness of being in his presence. For centuries, she’d done everything he wouldn’t have wanted her to and while, yes, she had already dried a handful of witches since returning to the realm of the living, Agatha had made a point to only do that to those who deserved it. Rio said it truly didn’t bother the balance of the universe one way or another however she helped Agatha select those who would make less of a difference should they simply… disappear.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      In fact, Rio was the happiest she had been in a very long time. It didn’t bring her any pleasure or personal gain to see Agatha take down witches but she was fully aware it was needed for Agatha to stay alive. To
     </span>
     <em>
      <span>
       feel
      </span>
     </em>
     <span>
      alive. If doing it exclusively to those who warranted a more cruel demise, so be it. Besides, it seemed to make Billy feel more ethical in his own choices, which in turn allowed Agatha to believe her actions were justified and, as a snowball effect, it made Rio happier. The system was working for everyone involved and for as long as that was possible, Rio would play her part.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Contrary to what had happened over the many years Rio had been the sole visitor of that sacred ground, the hedge produced a large number of fruits. Exchanging a smile, Agatha and Rio left unspoken that it was a clear sign they should’ve been doing this together all along. Recreating the crown she had crafted the previous year, Rio handed it to Agatha and, instead of taking it, Agatha lowered her head for Rio to be the one crowning her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “How do I look?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Like my wife.” Rio’s tone was tender, wrapped with the emotion that almost clouded her eyes with a mist of tears. “Beautiful.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Trying to hold her own tears back, Agatha smiled sheepishly. “So we are together, after all?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “For as long as you’ll have me.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That will be a long, long, long,” Agatha lingered on the pronunciation of the forth “looooooooong” and held Rio’s hands. “Time.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Are you sure?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Never been more certain.” Pressing her lips to those belonging to the love of her life, Agatha quickly pulled back to add. “Or ready.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I love you.” The words flew out of Rio’s lips like the breeze on a warm summer day, freely and comforting.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I love you too.” Agatha smiled, her chest filled with love and a beating heart. “Shall we?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Lead the way.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      From one of her pockets, Agatha retrieved the bell that Nicholas had stolen in Salem and that she used as the starting point for every chant. With a bang that echoed through the forest, from tree to tree, Agatha took a deep breath, reassured in the loving way Rio was looking at her.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Seekest thou the road to all that's foul and fair
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Gather sisters fire, water, earth and air
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Darkest hour, wake thy power, earthly and divine
     </span>
    </p>

      Burn and brew with coven true and glory shall be thine.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Closing her eyes, Agatha handed the bell to Rio, who safely stored it inside her cloak before joining Agatha in her singing, their voices merging together in the same unison of their heartbeats.
     </span>

      Not too far from where they stood, Nicholas' portal began forming yet Rio was the only one who witnessed it since Agatha’s eyes remained shut.

      “Marching ever forward 'neath the wooded shrine
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      I stray not from the path, I hold death's hand in mine.”
     </span>

    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Rio held Agatha’s right hand, which made her present forth the left one as well, believing Rio wanted to close the circle. However, Rio kept her left hand away from Agatha’s reach.

      “I still don't understand how Agatha is alive again.” Since they’d been left with dish washing duty, Jen handed Billy a wet plate for him to dry.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Despite having been there, Billy wasn’t entirely certain how it was possible either. “She just is.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “And she's technically immortal now.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “WHAT?!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Oh no.” Tommy looked between the two witches staring at him as if he’d confessed a heinous crime. “Oh no I shouldn't have said that.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Spill the rest or I'll read your mind!” It was mostly an empty threat since he would never force information out of his brother’s head without permission, that was a line Billy refused to cross. However… He simply needed to know.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “She is going to kill me…”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “We'll find you a protection witch,” Jen smacked both hands on the kitchen counter that physically separated her from Tommy. “Now talk!”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Ah…” With a pained look on his face, and seeing how his brother wasn’t going to help him out of this one either, Tommy conceded. “Agatha is... part Rio now... Sort of... Kind of…” Shaking his head, Tommy scratched the back of his neck. “I don't really understand how it works but basically Agatha is immortal until she decides otherwise and then…” A pause and a deep sigh. “Rio dies with her.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “That doesn't make any sense.” Jen looked at Billy who seemed just as confused as she was. “Death can't die.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Not Death.” Tommy clarified. “Rio, as we know her, will die with Agatha. Death will just.. become someone else. Or something else.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “So they're... one?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “I guess?” With a shrug, Tommy exhaled dreamingly. “Man, I can't wait to fall in love.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      “Some role models you have…” Jen shivered despite there being no cold breeze inside the house. “Does anyone hear singing?”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>

      “Blood and tears and bone

      Maiden, Mother, Crone.”
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      At last, Agatha opened her eyes and met Rio’s gaze, their singing moving into a whole other level of intensity.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>

      “The road is wild and wicked, winding through the wood
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Where all that's wrong is right and all that's bad is good

      Gesturing to the side with her head, Agatha followed Rio’s cue and saw a portal standing over Nicholas' grave. The eminence of their encounter made Agatha’s heart beat faster and Rio gave her hand a gentle squeeze, reassuringly. Without stopping the song, Agatha watched as their son walked out of the portal, smiling.

      “Follow me, my friend,” Singing on his own, Nicholas held Rio and Agatha’s hands, closing the circle the way it had always been meant to: as a family. “To glory at the end.”

      Healing isn’t linear, and neither is grief. Some days the sun shines, the grass appears to be greener and the blood in your veins feels warmer. There’s hope, and it's palpable. However there are days where the sun seems to be further away, the grass wilts and your skin feels colder. There is no point in attempting to control such processes, it’s a futile war that will inevitably end with your loss, one way or the other. The only path to survival without letting your heart harden or sink down with the weight is to accept… And allow yourself to feel.
