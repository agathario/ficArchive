<blockquote>
<p>
      This is a rough short story, that I want opinions on!! I definitely rushed it a bit wanting to get it done for today!
     </p>
<p>
      After I’m back from my holiday and have finished one of my other WIP’s, I think I’m gonna turn it into a fully fleshed out 30+ chapter story, if you lot think it’s one I should do?

<div>
<p>
     Moonridge never slept. Its sky glowed with eternal twilight , a strange mix of violet dusk and ash-coloured mist that blanketed the city’s spires. Magic was thick in the air tonight, clinging to skin like perfume and sweat.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha strode through the Atrium of Thorns, hips swaying beneath her sculpted black velvet coat, the slit revealing the curve of her thigh with every step. Her magic pulsed beneath her skin; dark, alive, watchful. She was already on edge.
    </p>
<p>
     The news had reached her hours ago.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio. High Enchanter.
    </p>
<p>
     The word made her stomach turn,
     <span>
</span>
     not because she didn’t think Rio deserved it. No, Rio had always been brilliant. That was the problem. She deserved it too, and they had chosen only one of them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had poured decades into the Circle. She’d orchestrated victories no one else had dared attempt. But in the end, it was Rio the council anointed with a kiss of gold light and whispered oaths.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course it was.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     The voice was unmistakable, honey-drenched, smoky. Enough to break her stride.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned. There, standing at the top of the obsidian staircase like a goddess freshly conjured from starlight, was Rio. Her ceremonial robes shimmered with arcane embroidery, emerald green laced with silver constellations. One shoulder was bare. Her curls were wild, eyes shadowed with kohl. Her mouth, soft and knowing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched. She hated that Rio still did this to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You missed the ceremony,” Rio said, walking down slowly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wasn’t in the mood to watch them crown someone less dangerous,” Agatha said smoothly, but her words came out too fast. Sharp. Jealousy was already dripping through her voice like poison.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stopped one step above her. “You mean someone less you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s lips curled. “Don’t flatter yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re the one who’s trembling.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I never tremble.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head. “Then prove it.”
    </p>
<p>
     The moment snapped. Agatha surged forward, her gloved hand grabbing Rio by the waist, pulling her flush against her body. Their mouths crashed together in a kiss that was all teeth and fury and history.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gasped, but didn’t pull away. She gripped Agatha’s hair and twisted, forcing her head back. “You’re still furious,” she murmured, breath hot against her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re still insufferably perfect,” Agatha spat, nails dragging down the exposed flesh of Rio’s back, leaving faint red trails.
    </p>
<p>
     They stumbled backward into the private sanctum, Agatha slamming the door shut with a flick of her hand. The wards shimmered around them, soundproof, lightproof. Sacred space.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shoved Agatha back against the wall, hard enough to knock the breath from her lungs.
    </p>
<p>
     “You think I didn’t notice?” Rio whispered, sliding a hand up Agatha’s thigh. “The way you’ve been watching me. Watching her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tensed. “Lira?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s fingers ghosted over her inner thigh, then cupped her heat — silk and lace soaked through. “You hate that I talk to her. That I smile at her. You want to mark me, don’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha growled. “You’re mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then act like it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha spun them, pressing Rio against the wall, mouth devouring her collarbone, biting down hard. Her fingers worked fast, tugging open Rio’s robe to expose dusky skin and the swell of her breasts, nipples already tight from the cold, or the fight. She sank to her knees.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hissed as Agatha yanked her robes lower, baring her completely. “You think this will make me forget what you said?” Rio asked, voice trembling.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha murmured. “But it will make you remember who you belong to.”
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed her mouth between Rio’s thighs, tongue firm, deliberate. No teasing. Just raw, possessive need.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moaned. Not delicately, but like something broke loose inside her. One hand braced against the wall, the other tangled in Agatha’s dark hair, pushing her deeper.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s tongue moved in slow, devastating strokes, circling, pressing, flicking, until Rio’s legs began to tremble. She slid two fingers inside her at once, curling them just right, stroking her with ruthless precision.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck,” Rio gasped, her hips rolling. “Don’t stop. Don’t you dare…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t. She sucked hard, and Rio shattered.
    </p>
<p>
     Her cry echoed through the sanctum, muffled by the wards, as her body bucked and clutched around Agatha’s fingers. It was messy, loud, and completely unrestrained. Her pleasure burned like lightning down her spine, and Agatha drank every ounce of it.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio’s legs finally gave out, Agatha caught her.
    </p>
<p>
     But the fire between them hadn’t died.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled Agatha up, grabbed her by the throat, and kissed her with feral hunger. Her taste was still on Agatha’s lips, salt and sweetness and power.
    </p>
<p>
     “Take off your clothes,” Rio growled.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked, letting the velvet fall away. Underneath, she wore nothing but black thigh-highs and a look of hunger.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shoved her down onto the altar; a stone slab covered in soft black furs and etched runes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Touch yourself,” Rio whispered, climbing over her. “I want to watch you fall apart for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha obeyed. One hand between her legs, the other gripping Rio’s thigh. Her fingers moved in slow, slick circles, breath hitching.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her neck, bit her shoulder, whispered spells in forgotten languages that made Agatha tremble.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me who you belong to,” Rio whispered against her ear, licking the shell of it.
    </p>
<p>
     “You,” Agatha gasped. “Always you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio straddled her, sliding down onto her slowly, deliciously, until they both cried out. The rhythm they found was primal, hips grinding, breasts pressing together, nails scratching skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Magic sparked at every point of contact. Runes on the altar glowed. Their combined power flooded the room.
    </p>
<p>
     They moved in tandem, breathless and greedy, chasing the edge together.
    </p>
<p>
     And when they fell, they fell hard. Agatha’s magic exploded in a flare of violet light. Rio’s followed in a pulse of green flames.
    </p>
<p>
     They collapsed into each other, tangled and slick, shaking from the power they’d unleashed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lay back, heart pounding, watching Rio’s chest rise and fall. “You should have told me,” she said quietly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t know how,” Rio replied. “I wanted you to be proud of me. Not… this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked away. “I am proud. I just wish you hadn’t left me behind.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio curled closer, resting her head on Agatha’s chest. “You’re not behind me, Agatha,” she whispered. “You’re the storm I walk through every day.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha closed her eyes. The storm wasn’t over. Not by far. But tonight, for a moment, they were still bound by more than jealousy.
    </p>
<p>
     They were bound by want. And want, Agatha knew, was just another word for power.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<br/>
     They were watching her again.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could feel their eyes: sharp, hungry, masked in the polished manners of Moonridge’s elite. Behind every arched brow and jewelled grin was a question none of them dared voice aloud.
    </p>
<p>
     Why wasn’t it her?
    </p>
<p>
     She let them wonder.
    </p>
<p>
     Her return to the Council Chambers was timed precisely, not too early to seem desperate, not too late to look defeated. She wore crimson red tonight, a dangerous contrast to her usual black or deep purple, the colour of spilled wine and sacrifice. It clung to her body like blood might cling to a dagger.
    </p>
<p>
     She made her entrance alone.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was already seated among the High Circle, her new robe glittering with woven glyphs of status. She sat straight-backed, powerful. Stunning. Her expression barely shifted when Agatha entered, but Agatha saw the flicker.
    </p>
<p>
     She always saw Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The meeting was a formality: welcoming new inductees, assigning magical rotations, congratulating the favoured. Agatha tuned it out, until a name cut through the drone like a blade.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lira Moren,” said High Magus Verit, gesturing toward the girl in the second row. “A gifted aether-sculptor. Rio will be taking her under wing for the next cycle.”
    </p>
<p>
     Applause. Chatter. Smiles. Agatha felt it like a slap.
    </p>
<p>
     Lira stood to acknowledge the appointment, tall and eager, her robes barely tailored, eyes wide with ambition and admiration,
     <span>
</span>
     and fixed solely on Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio… smiled back. Not intimately. Not possessively. But with pride. Encouragement. It was worse than flirtation. It was hope. Agatha’s knuckles whitened around the glass in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     The halls were quieter after dusk. Only a few candle-spirits lingered in the east wing, and Agatha followed their flickering trail until she found Rio’s quarters. She didn’t knock.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nice of you to attend,” Rio said without turning around. She stood at her mirror, unbraiding her hair. “I wasn’t sure if you’d crawl out of that lair of yours.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped inside, locking the door behind her. “Mentoring, Rio? That’s what you call it now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio caught her gaze in the mirror. “Lira is talented. I don’t pick favourites.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha circled her like a predator. “No? You smiled at her like you knew her. Like you wanted her to thrive. I’ve seen that look before, in bed, under moonlight, before you bite down.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned slowly. “Don’t do this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha got closer, breath hot against her skin. “She’s not ready for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not yours to warn off.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hands gripped Rio’s hips, pulling them together with a hard snap. “No,” she hissed, “but you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grabbed her by the chin. “Is that what this is about? You think if you fuck me hard enough, it’ll scare her away?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s grin was vicious. “If she ever heard the sounds you make for me, she’d burn.”
    </p>
<p>
     And then they were kissing - no, devouring. Tongues clashing, teeth scraping. There was no gentleness in it, only hunger and fury. Agatha shoved Rio against the wall, her fingers already at her robes, tugging, tearing, discarding.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t resist. She clawed at Agatha’s thighs, yanked her skirt up, growled when she found bare skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dropped to her knees, but this wasn’t worship. This was claiming. She pushed Rio’s legs apart and used her tongue like a spell, ruthless and deliberate. She didn’t care about finesse tonight. She wanted Rio undone. Loud. She wanted to leave her marked with orgasms and bruises, stained with proof that she belonged to no one else.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cried out, hands fisting Agatha’s hair, riding her mouth with brutal rhythm. “Harder,” she gasped. “Fuck, don’t stop…!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha obeyed. She added fingers, curled them deep, sucked hard, until Rio came against her tongue in a cry so raw it echoed through the wards.
    </p>
<p>
     But she didn’t stop.
    </p>
<p>
     She kept going, pushing Rio into another, and another, until she was sobbing and twitching, her thighs shaking uncontrollably.
    </p>
<p>
     Only then did Agatha rise, licking her lips, eyes feral. “Still think I’m jealous of her?” she asked, voice ragged.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grabbed her, dragged her onto the bed, and flipped her beneath her in one practiced motion. “No,” she snarled. “I think you’re terrified of not being enough.”
    </p>
<p>
     She shoved Agatha’s thighs apart.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moaned, head thrown back. “Then prove I’m wrong.”
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio did. She ate her like a woman possessed, fingers inside her, tongue circling her clit with merciless focus. She bit. Sucked. Stroked. Agatha writhed, cursed, clawed at the sheets.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t stop,” she begged. “Make me forget her name.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You never knew it,” Rio whispered, and thrust deeper.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha screamed as she came, her magic flaring and cracking through the room in jagged, violet lightning.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They lay there tangled in silence, skin flushed, sheets wet and half-burned from magic backlash.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned on her side. “You don’t trust me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at the ceiling. “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     A pause. “Why?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s voice was quiet now. “Because they’ll take you from me the moment they see you shine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pressed a hand to her chest. “I’m already yours. They can’t take what I gave.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wanted to believe her. But the seed of jealousy was already blooming, curling dark roots around her heart.
    </p>
<p>
     She rolled away.
    </p>
<p>
     And somewhere, in the shadows outside the sanctum, a candle-ghost flickered, and whispered Lira’s name into the listening dark.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t meant to spy. That’s what she told herself, anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t meant to follow the shimmer of Rio’s signature through the wards. She hadn’t meant to slip into the hidden sanctum through an old glamour door she’d warded herself, years ago, when they used to come here together. When Rio still let her touch her under the lowlight of ancient spell-fire.
    </p>
<p>
     But now she stood behind a veil of mirrored shadow, one-way glass humming with enchantment, and she watched. The sight made something curdle in her gut.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood at the center of the Mirror Sanctum, surrounded by floating glyphs and dancing lines of blue fire. Lira was with her, younger, too eager, her robes slipping from one shoulder as she mimicked Rio’s gestures. Aether magic bloomed between them, raw and beautiful.
    </p>
<p>
     But it wasn’t the spell that made Agatha’s lips tighten. It was the look in Rio’s eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Gentle. Encouraging. Proud.
    </p>
<p>
     That look used to belong to Agatha. She wore it like a crown, a reward for surviving everything they’d done together. Now Rio gave it away like a gift. Like trust.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath fogged the mirrored wall.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hands rose, guiding Lira’s own.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let it bloom slowly,” Rio said softly. “Feel it rise from the root. You can’t force it open, you have to invite it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s nails dug into her palms. That’s how you guided me. With those same words.
    </p>
<p>
     Lira bit her lip, focused, and the aether responded. A glowing rose unfolded in the air, petals made of glass and lightning.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled. “Beautiful.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lira flushed with pleasure. “Only because you…”
    </p>
<p>
     And then… she reached for Rio’s hand. Just a brush. But too long. Too warm.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart slammed in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t pull away.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Hours later, when the sanctum emptied and Rio left with Lira still asking questions, Agatha stepped into the heart of the room. The echoes of the aether rose still lingered in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     She reached up, fingers trembling not with fear, but cold calculation.
    </p>
<p>
     The spell crystal Rio had left behind pulsed softly, a storage glyph containing today’s memory. A gift for Lira to study.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha whispered a counter-rhythm.
    </p>
<p>
     The crystal flickered.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t erase the memory, no, that would be too obvious. Too direct. Instead, she corrupted it, just slightly. She altered the flow. Unwound the spell sequence mid-cast. Made it unstable. Just enough that if Lira tried to recreate it unsupervised…
    </p>
<p>
     It would backfire. Nothing fatal. But painful. Embarrassing. Shattering to a reputation so freshly built.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tucked a strand of silver hair behind her ear. “You’ll burn, little flame,” she whispered. “And she’ll run back to me.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She didn’t return home.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she descended even deeper to the hidden Mirror of Laevis, the Oracle Glass. A cursed artefact they’d sealed years ago. It never lied, only reflected. Not the truth of the world, but the truth of the soul.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared into it. The image showed her Rio, naked, radiant, gasping as Lira kissed her neck. Rio laughing. In Lira’s arms. Rio in a white veil. Lira kissing her hand. Agatha, alone. Cold. Watching through glass.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha growled, and magic surged from her palms, striking the mirror.
    </p>
<p>
     It cracked in spiderweb fractures, but did not break. Instead, the next image it showed was one she’d never spoken aloud.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio. On her knees. Begging. Rio, eyes wide with tears, whispering Agatha’s name in apology. Agatha swallowed. Her thighs clenched. She didn’t look away.
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped forward, unable to stop herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Her fingers moved to her belt. Then lower. Through the slit in her gown. Skin already slick with anticipation.
    </p>
<p>
     The mirror showed Rio again, bent over Agatha’s altar, screaming her name, marked with runes. Agatha inside her, relentless. Dominant. Worshipped. Agatha moaned, breath stuttering.
    </p>
<p>
     She slid two fingers between her folds, slick and hot, thrusting hard as the mirror showed her power returned, Rio caged in velvet ropes, sobbing, begging not for release, but for punishment.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re mine,” Agatha gasped. “You’ll always be mine…”
    </p>
<p>
     She came, hard, knees buckling, pleasure ripping through her like a storm. She bit her lip to keep from screaming. Blood bloomed.
    </p>
<p>
     When it ended, she was shaking, bent over the pedestal, the mirror cracked but still glowing.
    </p>
<p>
     And her reflection… wasn’t her.
    </p>
<p>
     It was Rio, staring back with hollow, golden eyes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Back in the council wing, Lira studied the crystal.
    </p>
<p>
     She hesitated, lips pursed, something felt wrong. The aether flowed strangely. But she wanted to impress Rio. Wanted to earn that smile again. So she cast it anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     The explosion was small, but violent. It left her robe scorched. Her hand burned. The rose shattered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio burst in seconds later, wide-eyed, arms around her. “Who taught you that rhythm?” she demanded.
    </p>
<p>
     Lira whimpered. “You… you did. It was from the crystal you gave me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at the shard. Confused. Alarmed.
    </p>
<p>
     And far, far away, Agatha stood on her balcony, watching the stars. A cruel smile on her lips. She whispered, “One petal at a time.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<br/>
     The wards flared the moment Rio stepped into the sanctum, reacting to her magic like a challenge. Agatha didn’t turn. She stood at the far end of the room, back to the door, hands clasped behind her. The ritual circle at her feet flickered, incomplete, interrupted.
    </p>
<p>
     “You went behind my back,” Rio said, voice low.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha said nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     “The glyph-work. On Lira’s anchoring charm. You rewrote it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Still silence.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped forward. “You didn’t even try to hide it. Not really.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned slowly, her face carved into calm. Too calm. Her eyes, however, were hot with something wild. “I corrected it,” she said. “It was unstable.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You hijacked her anchor. That wasn’t your decision to make.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s dangerous, Rio. Eager. Too eager. She leans into magic like it’s seduction, not study. Like she thinks it will bend to her just because she wants it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio folded her arms. “That sounds familiar.”
    </p>
<p>
     A beat of silence was broken as Agatha laughed, bitter and sharp. “Cute. You still know how to stab with a smile.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not here to hurt you, Agatha. I’m trying to hold you accountable.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped closer, voice dropping. “She looks at you like you hung the stars. She copies your gestures. Finishes your spells. You don’t see it, but I do.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s a student.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s an echo.” Agatha’s voice cracked. “And you… you’re forgetting the original.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s tone sharpened. “So this is about me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha flinched. “It’s always been about you.”
     <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     There was a silence between them that used to mean comfort. Now, it bristled.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re consumed,” Rio said. “And not just with her. With losing. You can’t stand not being the most powerful, the most wanted. So you turn everything into a battlefield.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped back like the words were a blow. “I’ve never competed with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you’ve always tried to control me.” Rio’s voice wavered now. “Even when you loved me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s lips parted. But no defence came.
    </p>
<p>
     So Rio gave her the final truth: “I loved you, Agatha. Not for your magic. Not for your brilliance. For your humanness. And you’re smothering it. You’re letting jealousy rot what we built.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then maybe you should go.” Agatha’s voice was cold, but her eyes burned.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t hesitate. She turned, but at the door, she paused.
    </p>
<p>
     “When you’re ready to stop being scared of being seen without power, I’ll be where I’ve always been. Real.”
    </p>
<p>
     The door closed with a soft click. Agatha collapsed to her knees and wept.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     That night, in the ritual chamber lit only by dying candles, Agatha stood before her reflection in a silvered scrying bowl. She whispered a simple incantation, one meant to numb joy, not grief.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let sweetness fade. Let light dull. Let longing sleep.”
    </p>
<p>
     The magic flowed over her like ice. It didn’t soothe. It stole. She felt her laughter dim in memory. The mornings with Rio, half-asleep and smiling into her shoulder, blurred. The scent of summer wine on Rio’s skin. Fading.
    </p>
<p>
     But the ache stayed. And the next time she saw Rio’s name etched on her grimoire’s margin, she burst into tears anyway.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t left the catacombs beneath the Tower in five days.
    </p>
<p>
     Above, life carried on. The Circle deliberated over seasonal rituals, apprentices recited chants in courtyard alcoves, and Rio’s voice could sometimes be heard echoing through the halls, instructing her new students.
    </p>
<p>
     But Agatha? She had become a shadow in the archives, an echo herself. She hadn’t meant to steal the relic. Not truly.
    </p>
<p>
     It had called to her when she’d stumbled into the forbidden reliquary two nights after Rio left. Her hands moved before her conscious mind could stop them, pulling the sliver of obsidian from its binding runes, slipping it into her cloak pocket like a secret.
    </p>
<p>
     It had whispered then, soft as silk, “You were never enough for her.”
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t even remember whispering the binding invocation. Only that when she woke hours later, her hands were burned with sigil marks, and the relic pulsed softly beneath her pillow like a heartbeat.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     At first, the changes were subtle.
    </p>
<p>
     A memory resurfaced of Rio laughing with Lira during a shared spell exercise. They’d smiled at each other, nothing inappropriate, nothing intimate, but the relic twisted the memory. It fed Agatha a new version, one where Rio brushed Lira’s wrist, let her fingers linger, whispered her approval in a way she hadn’t done with Agatha in years.
    </p>
<p>
     “Familiarity,” the relic hissed. “She craves comfort. You stopped being comfortable.”
    </p>
<p>
     She tried to ignore it. She told herself it was paranoia, not magic. But when she walked past a mirror the next evening, her reflection didn’t follow her. It stayed behind. Smiling.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hallucinations weren’t only visual. They became immersive spell, illusions that bound sight, sound, and memory.
    </p>
<p>
     She found herself waking in strange rooms. Walking corridors that shifted while she moved. Books screamed when she touched them. Ink bled from pages with messages like:
    </p>
<p>
     “You were her phase.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Power is companionship. You lost both.”
    </p>
<p>
     She tried to call for help once, opened a scrying window to Rio’s office, but what she saw made her stumble backward in rage.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat at her desk, hair loose, robes open at the throat. Lira stood behind her, laughing, whispering something into Rio’s ear. They kissed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha screamed. The sound shattered the scrying bowl.
    </p>
<p>
     Later, when she forced herself to look again, the vision wasn’t there. The room had been empty. The kiss had never happened.
    </p>
<p>
     Or had it?
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s more real?” the relic purred, “The world they show you, or the one they hide?”
    </p>
<p>
     She stopped eating. She lived on warded tea and old grief.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The first time she saw the doppelgänger, it was in the reflection of her cauldron. It looked like her, almost. But the eyes were too wide. The smile too calm. The hair was streaked with unnatural silver.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re afraid she’ll forget you,” it said, mouth not moving. “But don’t worry. I’ll remember you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha recoiled. The relic burned her palm again. A sigil had appeared, an old one, predating Circle grammar. It meant desire made flesh. She began to suspect, the relic wasn’t whispering anymore. It was growing. Feeding off her.
     <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     By the tenth day, she no longer knew which thoughts were hers. Sometimes she would begin to write a spell and halfway through find a different hand guiding the quill, handwriting curled with rage and elegance that wasn’t hers.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d begun composing letters to Rio. Letters she never meant to send.
    </p>
<p>
     “I forgive you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was your foundation. Without me, you are nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll show them what loyalty costs.”
    </p>
<p>
     Each letter ended the same way, with a circle drawn in blood. She wasn’t sure where the blood came from.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     In her final descent, Agatha prepared a ritual she told herself was for clarity, to sever the bond the relic had built between her and the illusions. She lit thirteen candles. Drew seven glyphs of remembrance and loss. Burned pieces of Rio’s old notes in a silver bowl. But the moment the incantation began, the relic pulsed. The flames surged, and in the circle stepped Rio and Lira; naked, entwined, laughing at her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You never satisfied me,” Rio said, eyes cold. “I only stayed because I pitied you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You always knew I was better,” Lira whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha collapsed to her knees, sobbing. The fire grew wild.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let it burn,” the relic said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Burn what was. Forge what must be.”
    </p>
<p>
     And when the vision faded, the chamber around her was scorched. Her hand was blackened. The blood circle was complete.
    </p>
<p>
     She whispered to herself in the dark, trembling, “This isn’t me.”
    </p>
<p>
     But the echo in the chamber replied, “No, Agatha. This is exactly who you are becoming.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The Great Hall of the Circle was alive with light.
    </p>
<p>
     Dozens of witches in formal robes stood beneath a suspended lattice of flame and starlight. Crystalline chandeliers swayed with humming energy, pulsing with the cadence of the Equinox Chant. On the raised dais, members of the Circle arranged themselves according to rank, an old tradition, one steeped in ancient magic and rigid hierarchy.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood alone, farther back than she had in years. She wore her rank. The silver thread in her cloak shimmered, but her face was pale. Gaunt. Her fingers twitched slightly where they clutched the sigil staff. No one saw it, or if they did, they said nothing. Her eyes never left Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood just ahead, radiant in deep green. She led the rites this year, flanked by two apprentices, one of whom was Lira, glowing, composed, her braid woven with floating runes. Her smile, if innocent, was unbearable to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The crowd began to chant. In Agatha’s mind, the chant became a threat. She took her place. She took her power. She took her.
    </p>
<p>
     As the ceremonial circle was drawn in light, Rio stepped forward to bless each apprentice.
    </p>
<p>
     Lira knelt, and that’s when Agatha moved.
    </p>
<p>
     It happened faster than most could process. A slash of her staff, a whisper in dead language, and a jagged arc of spell-fire tore across the marble floor toward Lira, splitting the ceremony in two. The crowd gasped. Someone screamed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s shield flared just in time, wrapping around Lira in a dome of violet sigils. The spell hit it, hard. The crack of magic-on-magic rang like thunder. Sparks showered the hall. Silence fell.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, Rio’s voice, horrified. “Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood panting, her hair disheveled, eyes wild with magic. “She doesn’t belong here,” Agatha hissed. “She’s poison in this Circle. And you…” she pointed at Rio, voice breaking, “…you put her there.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lira stared, shaken but unharmed, one hand trembling at her side.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped down from the dais, fury radiating off her like heat. “You just attacked an apprentice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s not innocent!” Agatha shouted. “She’s manipulative, she’s… she’s… ” Her voice cracked. “She’s everything I was before I became yours.”
    </p>
<p>
     That stopped Rio cold. Gasps moved through the gathered witches.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s voice was quiet now, devastating in its clarity. “I don’t know what’s happened to you. But this… this is not the woman I loved.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I did it for you,” Agatha said, chest heaving. “To protect us.”
    </p>
<p>
     “There is no ‘us’ anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped back like struck, and Rio gave the order.
    </p>
<p>
     “I move that Agatha Harkness be stripped of her Circle rank pending full council inquiry into magical assault and misuse of spell-craft.”
    </p>
<p>
     Someone protested weakly, but no one truly defended her. Not after what they saw.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened her mouth, but no sound came.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned. “I loved you, Agatha.” A beat of deafening silence. “But not like this.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They took her staff. Her sigil ring. Her seat on the Circle dais. Agatha stood motionless as the ceremonial wards severed her connection to the spell lattice of the Tower. It felt like losing a limb. A marriage. A life. As they led her down the hall, she looked back only once, not at the council, or her peers, or even the place she’d once held.
    </p>
<p>
     But at Rio, who didn’t look back at all.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The wind here never stopped.
    </p>
<p>
     It moved through the bones of the old coven like a voice unfinished , through broken rafters, charred arches, moss-cloaked altars. Briarhold had been abandoned for over a century, left to rot after the Fire Trials devoured the witches who once lived within it. Only fools or ghosts came here now.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was both.
    </p>
<p>
     She crossed the overgrown threshold without ceremony, dragging her tattered cloak through the ivy. Her boots were caked in dried blood and ash. Her face, thinner, older somehow, didn’t flinch as the wards scratched at her skin. She no longer carried a sigil. She no longer had the right.
    </p>
<p>
     She sat where the central fire pit used to be, staring into nothing. The relic pulsed at her hip.
    </p>
<p>
     For three days, she didn’t speak. Didn’t cast. Didn’t cry. She just existed, a ghost in a hollowed house, surrounded by the echoes of spells once spoken in sisterhood. The quiet was complete. No acolytes. No apprentices. No Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Only her thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     And the relic, ever murmuring.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “They betrayed you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “She loved your power. Nothing more.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You were never meant to be second.”
    </p>
<p>
     But the voice no longer filled her with rage. Only sorrow. Because in the dark, Agatha had begun to remember things differently. Not the betrayals, but the kindnesses.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio, pressing her fingers to Agatha’s chest, whispering “You don’t have to impress me.” Rio, defending her once before the Circle. Rio, curling into her arms after a battle, whispering “Thank the stars for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     She had been loved, she had been needed. The terror had come when she felt one slipping without the other.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha whispered into the wind, almost inaudible, “What if I was never loved for me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, the answer rose, not from the relic, but from herself. “What if I never let myself be?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     That night, the hallucinations returned.
    </p>
<p>
     She saw Rio again, not kissing Lira, not condemning her, but kneeling beside her, young, hopeful, her hand reaching.
    </p>
<p>
     “I wanted you to stay,” the vision whispered. “But you always thought you had to earn love.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned away. “No,” she said. “You’re not her.”
    </p>
<p>
     The vision twisted, eyes blackening, mouth widening into something cruel.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am her. I’m the part that judged you. That pitied you. That left.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood. “You’re the curse.”
    </p>
<p>
     The relic screamed in her satchel, hot and pulsing. Her veins glowed green, the mark on her palm erupting again.
    </p>
<p>
     But this time, she didn’t recoil. She opened her palm. Called to the rawest kind of magic, older than spells, older than language.
    </p>
<p>
     “Take back what you gave me. And leave nothing behind.”
    </p>
<p>
     The relic burst into black flame. It fought her, her memories twisted, her pain magnified, but Agatha held her ground, her voice rising above it all.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t need to be adored. I don’t need to be obeyed. I need to be real.”
    </p>
<p>
     With a cry that broke skyward, she slammed the relic against the stone altar. It shattered into dust and ash.
    </p>
<p>
     Magic erupted in a wave, not pure, not cleansing, but honest. It knocked her flat. Her heart stopped for a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Silence, stillness.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha woke the next morning with frost in her hair, blood on her sleeve, and warmth in her chest for the first time in months.
    </p>
<p>
     The jealousy hadn’t disappeared, but it no longer steered her.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked down at her burned hand, the sigil of the broken ring had faded. In its place was a simple scar. She smiled. Faintly. For the first time in a long time, it reached her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
<br/>
     The trees were brittle with frost. The wind carried the scent of smoke and salt, even this far from the sea. And at the edge of a crumbling forest path, Rio found her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lay in a shallow hollow near the ruins, curled like a burned leaf. Her cloak was torn, hair matted, blood caked around one temple. Her pulse was weak, her magic flickering like a candle about to go out.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knelt, breath catching.
    </p>
<p>
     For a long moment, she didn’t speak. Just looked at the woman she had once loved, still loved, maybe, and barely recognised. Not because of her ruin, but because of something quieter, something… gentler. As if whatever had haunted Agatha had finally passed through her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course you’d come here,” Rio whispered, brushing ice from Agatha’s cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha stirred, her voice was a rasp. “Are you real?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think so.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You shouldn’t be here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And yet I am.”
    </p>
<p>
     The Circle had been clear: exile was exile. No retrieval, no mercy.
    </p>
<p>
     But Rio broke the law. She wrapped Agatha in every protection spell she remembered, gathered her frail body in her arms, and walked, days through woods and hills, through bitter cold and fading light, until they reached the outskirts of the city.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t bring her to the Tower, she brought her home. To the cottage outside the walls. The one with the blue door. The one they had once shared, long before power twisted things.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha slept for three days. When she woke, Rio was beside her, pouring broth, offering no questions.
    </p>
<p>
     The days after that were quiet. No magic. No Circle. No apologies forced or demanded. Agatha watched birds from the window. Sat in the garden, saying nothing. Sometimes, she wept without knowing why. Other times, she laughed mid-sentence, startled by the sound.
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio? She stayed near, never pushing, never prying.
    </p>
<p>
     One afternoon, Agatha spoke, “I still feel it sometimes. That pull. The need to prove I matter.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked up from the herbs she was trimming. “Do you know where it comes from?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hesitated, then nodded. “Not from you. Not from Lira. From… me. From a place that thought being needed was the only way to be loved.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled, soft, careful. “You were wrong, but not unforgivable.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They didn’t share a bed at first. Didn’t wear sigil rings or speak of “us.” They shared tea. And silence. And a thousand broken pieces stitched together with time.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha learned to live without certainty. Without control. Without needing to be the center of the spell. She helped villagers ward their homes. Brewed harmless charm-soaps for market. Sometimes, she read while Rio wrote. Sometimes, they sat on opposite sides of the hearth and said nothing for hours.
    </p>
<p>
     And sometimes, just sometimes, they reached for each other’s hands and didn’t let go.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     On the first spring night warm enough to keep the windows open, they sat on the porch beneath a sky ribboned with stars. Agatha stared out at the dark. “What if I break again?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t answer right away. She reached over, laced their fingers together. “Then I’ll be here to remind you who you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned to her, tears brimming, her voice a whisper, “I don’t know who that is anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio, without hesitation, “I don’t need you to be perfect, Agatha. Just… real.”

     Agatha’s POV
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Westview was quiet again.
    </p>
<p>
     Not the unnatural, TV-static stillness it had once endured under the Scarlet Witch, but a genuine sort of suburban hush: the kind of peace that meant nothing was exploding or screaming or being rewritten at a molecular level. It made Agatha’s skin itch. She missed the chaos, if she was honest. Not Wanda’s psychotic break, or the binding of her powers when everything went wrong, necessarily, but the hum of it. The energy of something powerful and dangerous vibrating just below the surface.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, the only thing vibrating was her half-functional sigil board, which was refusing to stabilise. Again.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness sat cross-legged on the scuffed floor of her front room, muttering to herself as she etched the correction runes by hand, the tuning fork at her side humming in minor protest. Her wild hair was tied up haphazardly, smudges of ash and powdered bone on her forearms like war paint.
    </p>
<p>
     This was what house arrest looked like when you were a witch.
    </p>
<p>
     The magical dampeners Wanda had wrapped her in at the end were still mostly intact, anchored by the town’s remaining hex-shell. They pulsed faintly when she tried anything too fun, like summoning a familiar or lighting the mailman on fire. Little joys. So instead, she tinkered. She plotted. She waited.
    </p>
<p>
     And then came the knock.
    </p>
<p>
     Three sharp raps. Even. Confident. Not police. Not a nosy neighbour. Not anyone from Westview, she’d ensured no one on her street remembered her clearly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha froze, brow twitching. A faint prickle ran down her spine, the old witch-sense stirring like a cat in the sun. She stood, wiped her hands on her skirt, and flicked her fingers toward the door.
    </p>
<p>
     It creaked open.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman who stepped inside was tall, all sinew and shadow, dressed in dark leather and darker intentions. Her dark hair framed a face that might’ve been chiseled out of quiet fury. Agatha recognised her instantly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio Vidal,” she drawled. “Well. Aren’t you a sight for sore hexes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped over the threshold like she belonged there, which was fitting. Decades ago, before everything between them fell apart, maybe she had.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio said. No warmth. Just fact.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smile didn’t waver. “To what do I owe the pleasure? Come to throw another binding charm on me, or just catching up with your favourite war criminal?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Someone might be dead soon,” Rio said flatly. “If you keep bending the edges of your leash.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pouted. “I’ve been good. Relatively. Unless you’re here about the basilisk egg, in which case I can explain.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m here because the Council’s watching you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I assumed as much. I’ve been flashing my ankles at their scrying mirrors for weeks.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s expression didn’t change. “There’s a sanction. Your magic’s still bound. But there’s a loophole.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smile widened, catlike. “I love loopholes.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s POV
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There were three things Rio Vidal hated more than anything: bad intel, sloppy spell-work, and Agatha Harkness (at least she told herself the last one was true). They were not necessarily in that order either.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood in the middle of the too-charming living room, arms crossed over her chest like armour, watching Agatha with the same expression she’d use to study a live grenade. The other woman looked disheveled and effortlessly smug, like she’d just hexed a bureaucrat and baked a pie about it.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course she looked like that. Agatha always did.
    </p>
<p>
     “So,” Agatha said, circling her like a cat. “Marriage. Is that your way of proposing, Vidal? Because I have to say, I expected more flowers. Maybe a dragon.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not a proposal,” Rio said through clenched teeth. “It’s a tactical workaround.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Such romance. I might swoon,” Agatha said dramatically, putting a hand to her forehead and pretending to faint.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re under Council sanction. You know that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m aware. Every time I sneeze, a rune lights up and tells me I’m a naughty little witch.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ignored the bait. “We’ve hit a limit. Your bindings are too unstable to maintain long-term. But magically speaking, if your power is shared, within the bounds of a committed arcane contract, there’s an opening. Not full freedom. But movement.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised one brow. “You’re telling me the Witches’ Council created a magical clause that basically says marry a coworker, get better benefits?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m telling you we use what exists. The bond of marriage is ancient. It predates most binding circles. There’s trust inherent in it. Intimacy. Power transfer.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you trust me, do you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio said. “But I’m not here to trust you. I’m here to contain you. This makes you someone else’s responsibility. Mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment, neither of them spoke. The silence stretched long and thin, taut as thread between them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s lips parted like she might say something sharp, something real. But she didn’t. She just clicked her tongue and turned away, brushing ash off a nearby candleholder.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know,” she said idly, “if I’d known we could just play house to skirt international magical law, I would’ve tried this ages ago. I do make an excellent wife.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled, slow. “This isn’t a joke, Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.” She turned back, eyes bright with something unreadable. “But if I don’t laugh, I might cry. And wouldn’t that be undignified.”
    </p>
<p>
     There was a beat of silence before Agatha broke it. “I accept.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped forward, voice lighter now. “Let’s do it. Fake marriage. Ritual bond. I get a little power back, you get to babysit me up close, and the Council gets plausible deniability.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t want to ask more questions? Consult your little necromantic journal club?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I know a trap when I see one. And I’m still saying yes.” Her voice dropped. “If there’s even a sliver of power I can access, I want it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio studied her. It should have been simple. It was simple. The ritual would be binding, but not in any romantic sense. Legal and magical, not emotional. She’d done contracts like this before, protection bonds, blood oaths, shared, circle compacts. But this felt different. Because it was Agatha. Because it had always been different with her.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The room was dim, lit only by floating candles and the golden outline of a circle etched into the floor. Runes flickered around them, soft, ancient language humming under the surface of the air.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood opposite her, barefoot, hands clasped loosely in front of her. She looked older in the candlelight, somehow, more tired. But her gaze was steady.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt something clench in her chest. She ignored it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ready?” she asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Hit me with your vows, tiger.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio resisted the urge to roll her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     She raised her hand, and magic flowed up her spine, warm and old and heavy. “I, Rio Vidal, bind myself in arcane matrimony to Agatha Harkness. Under Article XIII of the Witches’ Accord, I accept the magical consequences of this union. I share in power, burden, and responsibility until such time as the bond is dissolved.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tilted her head, then stepped into the circle.
    </p>
<p>
     “I, Agatha Harkness,” she said, voice lilting and calm, “accept this totally ridiculous but legally valid union. I pledge sarcasm, occasional usefulness, and limited domesticity until further notice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes narrowed. “Say it right.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed. “Fine. I bind myself, under the Accord, to you. Power shared, consequences mutual, blah blah eternal doom, et cetera. Happy now?”
    </p>
<p>
     A pulse ran through the floor, golden and thrumming. The sigils glowed bright, then sank into their skin like warm ink. A mark bloomed on Rio’s palm, a simple circle overlaid with two mirrored runes. She saw its twin form on Agatha’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     They were bound.
    </p>
<p>
     The circle extinguished itself. The candles flickered out.
    </p>
<p>
     In the sudden darkness, Agatha whispered, almost too quietly to hear, “Well. That was the most romantic night I’ve had in centuries.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t answer. She didn’t trust herself to.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s POV
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The house didn’t like Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t dramatic about it, no slamming doors or weeping walls, but Agatha could feel it in the slow sullen way the floorboards creaked beneath her new “wife’s” boots. The wards blinked sleepily when Rio passed, unsure whether to recognise her as friend or intruder. The tea kettle no longer sang.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sympathised. She wasn’t sure how to feel about Rio being there either.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood at the kitchen counter the morning after the binding, stirring an enchantment into her coffee with a lazy flick of her index finger. The spell fizzled halfway through. Again. Wanda’s curse was still holding firm, but weaker now. Frustratingly, tantalisingly weaker. The bond had worked. She could feel it in her fingertips, in the way the air responded to her again. Not obediently, not yet, but with a certain grudging familiarity, like a pet that hadn’t quite forgiven you for going on vacation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio emerged from the hallway in a tank top and loose sweats, her hair still damp from a shower. Agatha’s gaze flicked up and down before she could stop it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Careful,” Rio said without looking at her. “Your eye’s twitching like you’re about to combust.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, darling,” Agatha said, sipping. “If I combusted every time a woman walked into my kitchen in pyjamas, I’d have burned down half of New Jersey.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t smile. Of course she didn’t. She never did when Agatha was trying to get a reaction, but the muscle in her cheek twitched. Agatha took that as a win.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They had laid down ground rules the night before, as begrudging cohabitants:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
      No real touching unless required.
     </li>
<li>
      Public displays of affection limited to Council-related events or emergency deception.
     </li>
<li>
      One shared magical bond, two separate rooms. Non-negotiable.
     </li>
<li>
      No talking about their past.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had broken three of those rules before breakfast. Not that Rio knew. Yet.
    </p>
<p>
     The bond between them thrummed low and steady, like a heartbeat just under her skin. Agatha could feel Rio’s presence in every corner of the house now, her energy, her tension, her too-bright discipline. It wasn’t invasive exactly. Just there. A background note in a key Agatha hadn’t realised she’d missed.
    </p>
<p>
     She had always preferred chaos over harmony. But maybe, she thought, sipping her half-spelled coffee, harmony wasn’t the enemy. Maybe it was just another kind of spell.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Outside, Westview looked normal again. That was the trick of it. The sitcom haze was long gone, but Wanda’s magic hadn’t fully dissolved, it had simply receded, like floodwater beneath the floorboards. Things grew strangely in this town. Dogs barked twice. Mail came on Mondays, Thursdays, and days it rained. Memory skipped like a scratched record.
    </p>
<p>
     Most people didn’t notice. But Agatha did, and so did Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s a fracture line under the church,” Rio said that afternoon, standing with her hands in her pockets as they surveyed Main Street. “Residual chaos energy. If it’s not siphoned off properly, it could rip the fabric open again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, please,” Agatha scoffed. “You’re acting like Wanda invented magical catastrophe. You should’ve seen the Boston coven in the ’30s. They tried to open a portal to Arcadia using a wedding cake and a goat. That was a mess.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shot her a side-eye. “So what’s your plan for fixing this one?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned. “Well, I was thinking we make out in front of the ley line and hope it stabilises.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re impossible.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And yet legally bound to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled slowly, as if trying to expel Agatha’s entire existence with her breath. “We’ll need to submit a field report to the Council. They’ll want updates on how the bond is affecting your power.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Should we include my mild flirtation and the fact that I dreamed about you stabbing me with a heart-shaped dagger?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio froze. “You dreamed what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked innocently. “I said nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     By twilight, a raven arrived at the window with a small scroll tied to its leg. The message glowed faintly in the shape of the Council’s seal; a circle of moons, a flame at the center. Agatha unrolled it lazily while Rio sharpened a knife at the table.
    </p>
<p>
     “They want us to appear at the next Conclave,” she said, sighing. “Apparently our sacred union is the scandal of the week.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You mean they’re watching us.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Same thing.”
    </p>
<p>
     The Witches’ Council wasn’t a single body, not really. It was a federation of old covens and arcane collectives, a mix of bureaucratic nonsense and ancient ritual. Political as hell. Power-hungry. Hypocritical.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had served it, skirted it, and mocked it more times than she could count. Killing the Salem coven however, pushed her out. They still kept their eye on her. Rio, though… Rio still played by its rules. For now.
     <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     That night, Agatha dreamed in colour again.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been decades since her dreams weren’t just static and screaming. But now she dreamed of Rio’s hand in hers, of magic spinning between them like thread and light. She dreamed of battle, of fire, of teeth, of kisses she pretended she didn’t want. Their past she wished she could forget.
    </p>
<p>
     She woke sweating, heart pounding, and her power tingled faintly in her fingertips. The bond was working.
    </p>
<p>
     Too well, maybe.
    </p>
<p>
     She rolled over in bed, listening to the silence of the house. But somewhere in the distance, through the walls, through the bond, she could feel Rio awake, too. Neither of them slept well that night.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s POV
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The Council wanted an update. Of course they did.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at the blank parchment on her desk, ink pen suspended over it like a blade she didn’t want to drop. She had begun this report three separate times. Each version had somehow turned into an indictment of her own poor decision-making.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio paused. She should add “and also making this significantly more difficult than it needs to be.” Instead, she leaned back in the creaky wooden chair, rubbed at her temple, and exhaled through her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     Something was changing. She could feel it. The bond, it wasn’t supposed to grow. It was meant to be functional. Bureaucratic. A controlled channel to allow Agatha’s power to stabilise without threatening the fabric of reality. Not… This.
    </p>
<p>
     This pull in the air when Agatha walked past. This faint hum under her skin when they were near each other. This sense of her presence when she wasn’t even in the room. Rio had been bonded before. Protection pacts, coven war vows. She knew how they felt. This was different.
    </p>
<p>
     This was personal. And that was dangerous.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The letter arrived by portal fire midmorning. An elegant scroll inked with shifting gold script, sealed with the High Sigil. Rio knew the moment she touched it that this wasn’t just another formality.
    </p>
<p>
     “Council trial,” she said aloud.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, sprawled upside down on the couch in a robe that did not belong to her, blinked lazily. “Trial trial? Or trial in the ‘let’s-see-if-we-can-make-the-wives-squirm’ sense?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio snapped the scroll open. “They’ve invoked the Veritas Rite.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat up fully, brows lifting. “Oooh. The truth spell one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a compatibility and integrity test.” Rio’s voice was grim. “Designed to detect fractures in magical partnerships. If we fail it, the bond will collapse. And they’ll rebind you the hard way.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha whistled low. “They’re really not sold on us, huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re not sold on you. I’m just guilty by proximity.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood, walked over, and gently plucked the scroll from Rio’s hands. Their fingers brushed, just for a second, and the magic between them shivered.
    </p>
<p>
     They both felt it, neither commented.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha read. Her lips quirked. “We have to answer three questions. In sync. Aloud. With no shielding. While holding hands. In the middle of a consecrated circle.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     She looked up. “Do you trust me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio paused. “Not yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Fair.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They stood in the center of the old ritual chamber beneath Agatha’s house, a place reclaimed after Wanda’s spell unraveled, thick with residual magic. Sigils lined the stone floor in concentric circles, flickering faint blue under the runes Rio had carved by hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s fingers were cool in hers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t lie,” Rio murmured. “If you do, it’ll shatter the bond.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t lie,” Agatha said sweetly. “I embellish.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her a withering look.
    </p>
<p>
     The magic surged.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Question One: What do you want from her?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s pulse spiked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha spoke first. “Access. Leverage. Power. Proximity.” She grinned, but it faltered halfway through. “And… something real. Even if I have to fake it first.”
    </p>
<p>
     The air vibrated.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed hard. “Peace. Clarity. And…” she hesitated “…answers.”
    </p>
<p>
     The circle glowed brighter. Still holding.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Question Two: What are you afraid of?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Being forgotten, of losing the one thing I love again,” Agatha said without hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her. “Seriously?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t smile. “Completely. Utterly. Left behind when the world moves on, with no one left to remember me or continue my legacy.”
    </p>
<p>
     The words weren’t flippant this time. They were stripped down. Almost raw.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a breath. “Losing control.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of me?” Agatha asked, softly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of myself.”
    </p>
<p>
     The magic rippled again.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Final Question: Is there love here?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mouth opened. Then shut. She looked away. Rio didn’t speak either.
    </p>
<p>
     For a long moment, they stood in silence, their hands still joined.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, softly, quietly, Agatha said, “Not yet, not this time.”
    </p>
<p>
     The circle burned white-hot for a single blinding second followed by silence. The glow receded. The floor cooled.
    </p>
<p>
     They had passed. But Rio’s heart was beating far too fast. Because that wasn’t the answer that scared her. It was the truth that one day… it might not be a lie.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s POV
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There was something exquisitely hilarious about the Witches’ Council asking her to go on a retrieval mission. It was like asking a cat burglar to babysit a jewellery store. But they wanted her “in the field,” bonded, observed, and preferably not setting anything on fire.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had agreed, of course, with a smile and a dramatic hair toss. Rio had looked like she was re-evaluating every life choice that led her to this exact moment. Typical.
    </p>
<p>
     Now they stood outside a rambling, ivy-choked estate in the Scottish highlands. The place buzzed with old magic, feral, sleep-deep, and hungry.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is the Wyrmwell estate,” Rio said, reading from the briefing scroll. “Sealed for nearly eighty years. A cursed heirloom, the Heartglass,
     <span>
</span>
     was left behind after the family imploded. Anyone who touches it goes mad with grief. Council wants it extracted, cleansed, and stored.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned. “So basically: house of ghosts, grief crystal, and we’re here to spring-clean.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t respond. Just adjusted her blade belt and murmured a ward under her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     They approached the gate together, their magical bond pulsing faintly between them. The closer they got, the more agitated it became.
    </p>
<p>
     “I feel like this thing knows we’re fake,” Agatha muttered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t look at her. “Then don’t be.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The house had teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     Not literal ones, but the bones of it were wrong, too many corners, doors that changed when you weren’t looking, whispers behind wallpaper. This was deep chaos magic. A house built on grief and never allowed to grieve properly.
    </p>
<p>
     “It feeds on pain,” Rio said, setting down a beacon stone. “That’s why the bond matters. Couples who love each other can move through it. Anyone else gets swallowed whole.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a sidelong glance. “So we’re honeymooning in a hell dimension. How romantic.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just stay close,” Rio said. “And pretend to mean it.”
    </p>
<p>
     That line shouldn’t have made Agatha’s breath catch. But it did.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They reached the main ballroom after two near-possessions and one unfortunate wall that tried to bleed on them. In the center stood a pedestal. On it, a crystal, deep crimson, faintly pulsing, as though with a heartbeat. The Heartglass.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha approached carefully. The magic was thick. Grief-sticky.
    </p>
<p>
     “The wards are keyed to emotional resonance,” she said. “One wrong thought, and it’ll trap us in our worst memories.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand brushed hers and Agatha blinked. The bond surged.
    </p>
<p>
     “It wants proof,” Rio said quietly. “Real emotion. Something the house can’t mimic.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned to her. “So what? You want to give it a tender speech?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I want you to trust me.”
    </p>
<p>
     And then, without warning, without a plan, Rio kissed her. It wasn’t soft. It wasn’t fake.
    </p>
<p>
     It was heat and steel and tension snapping loose, weeks of unsaid things and looks held too long and hands not touching when they wanted to. Agatha’s body lit up like magic under her skin, the bond flaring gold-hot between them. Agatha’s mind was flooded with memories of their past, the first time they fell in love, the way her lips remembered the dance between them, like it was only yesterday.
    </p>
<p>
     The Heartglass cracked and the room screamed. Reality folded, just for a second, ghosts howled and glass shattered and time twisted…
    </p>
<p>
     Then silence.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled away, dazed, blinking. Her hand was still gripping Rio’s coat. The Heartglass lay dark. Dormant. They’d passed. Rio looked at her like nothing had happened. Agatha’s heart was pounding loud enough to hear in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Back at the safe house, hours later, neither of them had mentioned the kiss. Rio had stripped off her coat, rinsed blood from her arm, and started cataloguing cursed residue like nothing had shifted.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     But everything had. The bond between them wasn’t humming anymore. It was singing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood by the window, fingers to her lips. It had been a kiss meant to convince a house of grief that they were in love.
    </p>
<p>
     The problem was… Agatha wasn’t sure it wasn’t real anymore, and that was the most dangerous magic of all.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s POV
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had survived eldritch beasts, magical coups, and the death scream of a collapsing coven. But she had never in her life been more off-balance than she was now. Because Agatha had kissed her back.
    </p>
<p>
     Not for show. Not because the mission needed it. But with teeth and heat and hands curling into her like she meant it.
    </p>
<p>
     And now? Now Agatha hadn’t said a word. She was too quiet. Too careful.
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio, who had spent years perfecting the art of emotional compartmentalisation, suddenly couldn’t stop feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     The bond between them had changed. She could tell. It wasn’t a leash anymore. It was a thread. A living tether. It didn’t hum, it ached.
    </p>
<p>
     And worse, Rio didn’t hate it.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The Conclave chamber smelled like aged parchment and judgment. Seven high witches sat in a crescent arc, hoods up, their eyes glowing faintly behind runes.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood beside her, arms crossed, jaw sharp. Regal in the way wolves were regal, lethal, patient, beautiful.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your report,” one Councillor snapped. “We heard about the resonance spike. The Heartglass should not have responded unless the bond was…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Genuine?” Agatha offered sweetly. “Oh, it was very genuine. Tongues and everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Magic of that level,” another Councillor said, more cautiously, “evolves. The Veritas Rite was meant to gauge strength, not accelerate intimacy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then maybe,” Rio said coolly, “you shouldn’t tamper with things you don’t understand.”
    </p>
<p>
     The chamber fell silent. Because the magic in the room, the bond, was thrumming visibly now. Green and violet filaments crackled in the air around them, connecting them. Living proof.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled. “You tried to control her. You used me to do it. And now you’re afraid it worked too well.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And you?” the lead witch asked. “Are you afraid?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t hesitate. “Yes.” She paused. “But not of the bond.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Back at Agatha’s house, their house, though Rio still wasn’t ready to say it, night had folded around the town like a velvet curtain. They didn’t speak for a long time.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat at the window, one hand curled around a cup of wine, the other glowing faintly with magic. She looked tired. More honest than Rio had ever seen her.
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought,” Agatha said finally, “if I faked it long enough, it might become real.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned against the doorframe. “And?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up. “I can’t tell where the faking stopped.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio crossed the room and sat beside her. “No more Council,” she said softly. “No more rituals. No more pretending.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced at her. “You sure?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “I choose this,” she said. “I choose you. Fuck Aggie, I’ve missed you.”
    </p>
<p>
     She kissed her. Slow, certain, nothing performative about it. No ritual. No audience. Just the weight of want, and the terrifying relief of meaning it.
    </p>
<p>
     When they finally pulled apart, Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s. “Wife,” she whispered. “You’re going to be the end of me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good,” Rio murmured. “That makes two of us.”

<p>
</p>
<p>
     The moon hung low over Salem like an eye cracked open. Agatha Harkness walked alone, shadows curling around her heels. She wasn’t hiding, Agatha never hid, but tonight, the dark pulsed with old magic. She could feel it in her bones, an ache deep in the marrow, something had returned. Or someone.
    </p>
<p>
     The club had no name. No need for one. Salem’s monsters knew where to go when the hunger struck. Inside, the bass throbbed like a heartbeat. Candles flickered from chandeliers made of vertebrae. Witches danced with demons. Vampires toyed with mortals. And on a blood-red chaise at the center of it all sat Rio Vidal.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stopped in the threshold. She could taste it, taste her. Not perfume. Not even blood. But Rio, cedar smoke, dark wine, and death.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t seen her in years. Not since Rio went rogue and disappeared into the Underworld, chasing forbidden rites. Not since she’d kissed her in a rainstorm and told her never to come back. But now she was here. And she was changed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” Rio said, rising from her seat like a lioness waking from a dream. Her voice was deeper now, like velvet over a blade. Her skin glowed pale, her eyes molten silver.
    </p>
<p>
     “You shouldn’t be alive,” Agatha said flatly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s fangs caught the candlelight when she smiled. “Technically, I’m not.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped forward, slow and controlled. “You let them turn you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I chose it,” Rio whispered. “You left me no other way.”
    </p>
<p>
     Their faces were inches apart. The music faded, replaced by silence charged with centuries of lust and war.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s fingers grazed the edge of Rio’s jaw. “You smell like death.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Isn’t that what you always wanted?” Rio’s lips brushed hers. “Something you couldn’t kill.”
    </p>
<p>
     Their mouths collided. It wasn’t a kiss, it was an act of violence. All tongue and teeth and fury. Agatha shoved Rio back against the chaise, straddling her, riding the wave of lust and loathing she’d buried for far too long.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hissed when Agatha bit her lower lip, hard enough to draw blood.
    </p>
<p>
     “Still hungry?” Agatha growled.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “Always.”
    </p>
<p>
     The chaise creaked beneath them, leather sticking to sweat-damp skin. Rio’s hands roamed under Agatha’s cloak, fingers trailing the curve of her spine like she was memorising her all over again. Agatha’s pulse throbbed in her throat. She wasn’t weak, never had been, but Rio tasted like temptation and old magic, and it was dangerously easy to let go. Her magic sparked where Rio touched her, wild and untamed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I should rip your heart out,” Agatha whispered, grinding her hips down against Rio’s thigh. “And feed it to your sire.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio arched, lips grazing Agatha’s neck. “Do it. But you’ll come first.”
    </p>
<p>
     Their mouths met again, sloppier this time. Rio’s tongue was cold, her bite colder, but it only made Agatha burn hotter. She pulled open Rio’s shirt, buttons flying. Rio groaned as Agatha’s nails carved red down her chest, releasing blood that shimmered black under candlelight. Agatha licked it clean. Power surged through her like fire through dry wood. Ancient, intoxicating. Vampiric blood carried more than lust. It was spell fuel, especially hers.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve been drinking from witches,” Agatha said, eyes flashing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s smile turned into a smirk. “Only the ones who begged.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slammed her down harder. “You’re playing with something you don’t understand.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I understand perfectly,” Rio said, her voice lower now, more guttural. “You’re the last piece, Agatha. You don’t even know what you are to them.”
    </p>
<p>
     “To who?”
    </p>
<p>
     “The Tribunal. The vampiric conclave. They want your essence. Your magic. Your blood. You’re the final rite.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha froze. “You knew they’d come for me,” she said, fury rising like a tidal wave. “And you brought them here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I came to warn you.” Rio cupped her cheek with blood-slick fingers. “But I’d be lying if I said I didn’t also come to taste you one more time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shoved off her, breathing hard.
    </p>
<p>
     “You still love me,” Rio said softly.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha whispered. “I remember you. That’s not love.”
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t leave. Instead, she turned, cloak swirling, and cast a sigil midair. The walls around them shimmered, revealing a hidden sanctum. Bone chandeliers, books bound in flesh, and at its center, a black marble altar. The real Agatha’s domain.
    </p>
<p>
     “If they want my blood,” she said, looking over her shoulder, “they’ll have to take it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped into the sanctum like she belonged there. “And if I want it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s lips curved into a cold smile. “Then you’ll beg.”
    </p>
<p>
     The sanctum thrummed with energy. Rio stood near the altar, unbuttoned shirt hanging off her shoulders, skin pale as moonlight and slick with blood. Her eyes locked on Agatha, not with hunger, but with reverence. The kind that bordered on obsession.
    </p>
<p>
     “You should’ve killed me in Madrid,” Agatha murmured, drawing a chalk circle around the altar with one hand, her other lighting black candles with a twitch of her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     “You begged me not to,” Rio said, smiling faintly. “You were on your knees. I remember.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s smirk was razor-sharp. “You’re confusing mercy with strategy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped closer. “And you’re pretending this isn’t turning you on.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t deny it. She gestured, and Rio was pulled forward by invisible chains of energy, dragged onto the altar. The chalk circle ignited in cold violet flame.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s this?” Rio asked, breathless.
    </p>
<p>
     “A binding rite,” Agatha said. “I’m going to learn exactly what the Tribunal did to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio licked her lips. “You could’ve just asked.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped between her legs and leaned in, whispering at the shell of her ear, “But this way’s more fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed her palm to Rio’s chest, over her unbeating heart, and murmured the incantation. The marble beneath them pulsed, and the flames rose higher.
    </p>
<p>
     Then came the flood. Visions poured into Agatha’s mind; Rio on a stone table in a castle crypt, her wrists slit wide, surrounded by ancient vampires chanting in tongues. A crown of thorns pressed into her scalp. Her soul carved open, rewritten. Bound. Owned.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ripped her hand back, gasping. “They branded you,” she said. “With a compulsion spell.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, eyes burning. “I can’t defy the Tribunal unless I break the blood oath.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And the only way to break it…” Agatha trailed off, staring at her lips. “…is through a new rite.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Blood for blood. Magic for magic.” Rio’s voice dropped. “Witch and vampire. Body and will.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped back, considering. “You’ll be mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I already am.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hands moved like knives, cutting the laces of her corset, letting it fall. She straddled Rio again, this time naked, flushed, and charged with spell work.
    </p>
<p>
     “What kind of rite is this?” Rio asked, voice hoarse.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned wickedly. “A dominance seal. You’re going to surrender to me, completely. If your blood obeys me, so will the compulsion.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then take it,” Rio breathed. “Take everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bit her lip, then bent low and sank her teeth into Rio’s neck, sharp, deep. Rio gasped, back arching, nails scraping against the altar. Her blood flowed warm and thick, laced with ancient sigils.
    </p>
<p>
     The magic exploded between them. Raw. Wild. Erotic. Agatha moaned against her throat, drinking deeply as her fingers slid between Rio’s legs, already wet and needy. Power circled them like a storm.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s fingers teased at Rio’s entrance, liquid heat pooling on their tips. Rio’s head tipped back with need as her hips thrusted forward in an attempt to get Agatha inside her.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha just smiled. “I’m in control here,” she whispered into Rio’s ear before thrusting them inside the awaiting core.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio mewled at the intrusion, delighted at feeling Agatha inside her again for the first time in what seemed like forever. Agatha’s fingers curled in a bicycle motion, hitting the spot she knows would cause Rio’s undoing with adept precision, as her mouth moved back to Rio’s neck. Agatha licked up a line from her collar bone to her ear, cleaning up the drying blood in its wake.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s fingers continued plunging in and out of Rio’s pussy, claiming her as her own. It didn’t take long before Agatha’s mouth joined in with the pleasure. She knelt down and as she moved her head closer, she could smell the musky scent of one of her favourite things to eat.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Her tongue darted out and flattened as she licked from Rio’s filled entrance, up to her clit. Rio jolted as Agatha made contact with the bundle of nerves which caused Agatha to smile against the sopping cunt. Her tongue joined in on dominating and claiming her now undead former lover, swirling circles around the nub as the body it belonged to shook with pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who do you belong to?” Agatha mumbled as she took a breath, voice holding a controlling lilt.
    </p>
<p>
     “You Aggie, fuck I’m yours. I always have been,” Rio moaned, breathless, voice laced with need and desperation.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Good girl,” Agatha responded, before attaching her lips back to Rio’s clit and fucking her fingers into her with more power, only one clear goal in mind now.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio came with a cry that cracked the candles in two, hips bucking against Agatha’s hand as the spell branded her soul anew.
    </p>
<p>
     The circle dimmed. The chains vanished. And Rio lay there, gasping, freed, utterly wrecked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha licked the blood from her lips. “You’re mine now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Always,” Rio whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood at the window of the sanctum, wrapped in a silken robe, fingers idly tracing symbols in the condensation. Salem slept below, unaware that blood would soon be spilled on its soil again. Behind her, Rio stirred on the altar, sore and glowing from the ritual. The compulsion was gone. But something else lingered in the air. Premonition.
    </p>
<p>
     “I felt it,” Agatha said quietly. “A tear in the veil. Someone crossed over.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat up, face pale but fierce. “They know I’m unbound.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Then they’ll send one of the Elders.” Agatha turned, her magic crackling in the air like a live wire. “Maybe Vex. Or Thorne.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s lip curled. “If it’s Thorne, I want to be the one to burn him.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped between her legs again, kissed her slow and deep. “You can have him. But leave me the pieces.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The assassin came at dawn.
    </p>
<p>
     He was tall, cloaked in ash and bone, with eyes like frozen oil. A death walker - Thorne’s personal enforcer. He entered the sanctum without sound, already drawing a blade etched with sigils designed to pierce witches and vampires alike.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha met him with a smile. “Didn’t your master teach you to knock?”
    </p>
<p>
     The blade flew, but so did Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She caught it midair with a flick of her wrist and shattered it with a pulse of raw force. The assassin lunged, inhumanly fast, but Rio was faster. She tackled him mid-strike, fangs bared, ripping into his neck with a snarl that sounded more beast than woman.
    </p>
<p>
     Blood sprayed across the sanctum wall. The death walker screeched and twisted, impaling her thigh with a hidden stiletto. Agatha screamed, not in fear, but fury, and unleashed a wall of violet flame. It didn’t burn with heat. It burned with memory.
    </p>
<p>
     The assassin dropped, writhing in agony, hallucinating his own death across all timelines. Rio dragged herself up, face slick with blood, her leg pouring crimson.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dropped beside her. “You’re hurt.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve had worse.” Rio looked down. “But I think he was just the warning shot.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes darkened. “Let them come. I’ll burn this city to cinders before I let them touch you again.”
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed her hand to Rio’s wound, chanting low. Magic stitched flesh. Rio moaned softly, half pain, half arousal.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know,” she said, biting back emotion. “We don’t have time. But if we don’t say it now, we may never get to.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached up, bloodied fingers brushing her cheek. “You were always the only thing I couldn’t let go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned in, pressing their foreheads together. “Then don’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     They kissed again, not hungry this time, but aching. Tired. Real.
    </p>
<p>
     They arrived cloaked in shadow, walking side by side into the belly of the Tribunal’s lair—a cathedral carved into the ribs of a fossilised leviathan, somewhere deep beneath Transylvania.
    </p>
<p>
     The Bone Court.
    </p>
<p>
     Pale fire flickered from skull-lanterns. The air smelled of incense, rot, and judgment. Stone pews flanked either side of a jagged path, where ancient vampires sat in silence. Watching. Waiting.
    </p>
<p>
     At the throne’s apex, robed in gold-veined obsidian, sat High Lord Thorne, Rio’s former sire and Agatha’s oldest mistake.
    </p>
<p>
     “Welcome home,” he purred, lips curling around a mouth full of knives.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand tensed around Agatha’s. “Don’t speak to me like I belong to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You always will.” His voice slithered like oil over ice. “Even if she fucks the rebellion into your blood.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped forward. “You bound her without consent. You enslaved her soul. That makes you nothing but a coward in velvet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Thorne rose, slow and graceful, and the court fell silent.
    </p>
<p>
     “She chose power,” he said. “She just didn’t realise the price.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio spat on the bone tiles. “I’m choosing differently now.”
    </p>
<p>
     A murmur spread through the Court like disease.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re traitors, both of you,” Thorne said. “But I’m feeling generous. Return Agatha to us. Her magic, her blood, her heart. And I’ll let you walk away.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed, low and lethal. “My heart isn’t hers to give. It’s mine. And I’ve already chosen where it belongs.”
    </p>
<p>
     She reached for Rio and kissed her there, in front of them all. It wasn’t gentle. It was a show of ownership. Their bodies pressed tight, Agatha’s hand in Rio’s hair, Rio’s thigh pushing between Agatha’s legs. Magic lit the space around them in spiralling tendrils of violet and green. A kiss like a declaration of war.
    </p>
<p>
     The Bone Court erupted.
    </p>
<p>
     A spell-blade shot through the air. Rio ducked, pulling Agatha into a dive. The first Elder lunged, claws out, but Agatha was faster. She snapped her fingers, and his skeleton ripped out through his skin, dancing in midair like a marionette.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grabbed a torch and shoved it into another vampire’s throat. Blood sprayed and s creams echoed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ritual seal!” Agatha yelled, drawing a circle mid-battle. Rio joined her, their fingers slicing the air in mirrored sigils. Together, they formed a binding glyph, not to contain, but to unleash.
    </p>
<p>
     From beneath the cathedral, something answered. A roar. A shape. A creature they’d buried a long time ago.
    </p>
<p>
     Thorne backed away, suddenly unsure. “What did you do?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes glowed like twin eclipses. “We bled for each other. Now the dark answers to us.”
    </p>
<p>
     The glyph cracked. Shadows poured from it like smoke with teeth. The Tribunal was screaming now, some disintegrating, some fleeing. Thorne tried to vanish into mist, but Rio caught him by the throat.
    </p>
<p>
     “You took everything from me.” Her fangs pierced his jugular. She drank deep, and when she was done, she didn’t look satisfied.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked free.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha approached, face smudged with blood, dress torn, but eyes blazing. “Are you ready?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wiped her mouth. “For what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached out. “To burn the rest of it down.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Burn it they did. Ash rained from the cavern ceiling like snowfall. The Tribunal was shattered, its elders dead or vanished, its throne broken in half. The cathedral’s ribs glowed with residual power from Agatha’s spell, still humming, still hungry.
    </p>
<p>
     “Something’s wrong,” Agatha said, swaying on her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio caught her, arms wrapped tight. “You’re bleeding.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No. It’s… the spell.” Agatha’s lips were pale. “It’s not finished.”
    </p>
<p>
     She turned slowly, eyes dark with realisation.
    </p>
<p>
     “It wants one last offering.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s voice trembled. “What kind of offering?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up at her, and for the first time in centuries, she looked afraid.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The ritual hadn’t just bound them. It opened a door between realms, between magic and undeath, between blood and soul. By destroying the Tribunal, they’d unchained something deeper. Older. And now it wanted to feed.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was always going to want a price,” Agatha said, tracing Rio’s cheek with shaking fingers. “That’s the rule.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gripped her harder. “No. No, you don’t get to leave me again. Not after everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled through the ache. “I’m not leaving. I’m choosing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes filled with red tears. “Then I’ll go with you. We’ll die together.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her. Soft and final, like an unspoken goodbye. “You’re not going to die,” she whispered. “You’re going to live. For both of us.” She stepped back, naked in blood and magic, and raised her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     The shadow-creature pulsed in the rift behind her, writhing, skeletal, its tendrils made of screaming souls. It smelled her power, her pain.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chanted the last words of the spell. Her veins lit up like constellations. The sacrifice was accepted. The cathedral imploded in silence, not with an explosion, but with an absence. A vacuum. A blink.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio landed hard outside the ruins, coughing dust, eyes wide.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was gone. All that remained was her pendant, glowing violet, warm in the ash. Still humming with power. Still hers.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     One Year Later – Salem
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The bookstore had no sign. But the bell over the door rang with magic. Rio ran it now, fingertips ink-stained, fangs hidden, hair longer. She still dreamed in violet fire. Still heard Agatha’s voice in spell-echoes and thunder.
    </p>
<p>
     On quiet nights, she slept with the pendant around her neck, pressed against her skin like a second heartbeat. Sometimes, when she closed her eyes, she swore she felt hands on her waist, a voice in her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     “I told you. I’m not leaving.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood barefoot in the center of a circle carved into the bookstore’s basement floor, now transformed into a ritual sanctum. Shelves of cursed grimoires lined the walls. Candles dripped black wax into bowls filled with bone dust.
    </p>
<p>
     In her hand, the pendant pulsed. Agatha’s final trace.
    </p>
<p>
     She had spent a year gathering the components:
    </p>
<ul>
<li>
      The ashes from the Bone Court.
     </li>
<li>
      A lock of Agatha’s hair—found fused into the sigil stone.
     </li>
<li>
      Her own blood, offered nightly, collected lovingly. Obsessively.
     </li>
<li>
      And one final thing: a spell Agatha had hidden from even herself. A resurrection rite. One that defied the natural order and tethered the soul to desire.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Tonight, Rio was done mourning. Tonight, she would unmake death.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood naked in the chalk circle, arms raised, voice raw with need and magic:
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Blood that bound and blood undone
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Flesh returned to shadow’s sun.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Love not lost, nor sealed in tomb
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Come to me, in violet bloom.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The floor split. The air screamed. And through the breach… she stepped out.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha. Whole. Glowing. Changed.
    </p>
<p>
     Her skin shimmered like dusk, her eyes no longer just blue, but starless void rimmed in violet. She wore nothing but the magic that resurrected her, and her voice was a melody carved from storms.
    </p>
<p>
     “You called me back.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio fell to her knees. “I couldn’t breathe without you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tilted her head, studying her. “You tampered with death.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d do worse.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled. Hungry. Eternal.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love that about you.”
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped into the circle and straddled Rio in one fluid movement, pressing her down onto the cold stone. The kiss they shared was no longer mortal, it was cosmic, dangerous, alive.
    </p>
<p>
     Flesh to flesh, soul to soul, Rio whispered, “Are you still mine?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha licked the blood from Rio’s lips. “I never stopped being.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They didn’t just survive the fire.
    </p>
<p>
     They became it.

<p>
     The Salem Arcane Conservatory stood as a testament to centuries of hidden knowledge, nestled beneath the unassuming facade of an old New England estate. Its stone corridors whispered secrets of ancient spells, and its lecture halls resonated with the echoes of incantations long past. Within its depths, the most promising witches honed their craft under the tutelage of the world’s most formidable magic-wielders.
    </p>
<p>
     Professor Rio Vidal, known for her mastery over elemental magic and her enigmatic presence, had recently returned to the Conservatory after years of mysterious absence. Her lectures on the convergence of natural forces and arcane energies were both revered and feared. Students spoke in hushed tones about her piercing gaze that seemed to see through one’s very soul.
    </p>
<p>
     On a particularly stormy evening, as thunder rumbled overhead and candles flickered against the stone walls, Rio began her lecture on the delicate balance between creation and destruction in spell casting. Her voice, calm yet commanding, held the room in rapt attention.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, the heavy oak doors creaked open, and a figure cloaked in deep violet entered. The room’s atmosphere shifted palpably. Agatha Harkness, a name both legendary and infamous, had returned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Apologies for the interruption,” Agatha’s voice dripped with sarcasm, “but I couldn’t resist revisiting old haunts.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes narrowed, a flicker of something unspoken passing between them. “Agatha,” she acknowledged coolly, “always a pleasure.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sauntered to an empty seat, her presence as disruptive as it was magnetic. The students exchanged nervous glances, sensing the tension crackling between the two powerful witches.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio resumed her lecture, Agatha interjected with pointed questions, challenging theories and offering alternative interpretations. The room became a battleground of intellect and magic, with students caught in the crossfire.
    </p>
<p>
     After the lecture, as students hurriedly exited, the two witches stood alone amidst the ancient tomes and relics.
    </p>
<p>
     “Still clinging to outdated doctrines, I see,” Agatha teased.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you,” Rio retorted, “still revelling in chaos.”
    </p>
<p>
     Their words were sharp, but beneath them lay a history of shared experiences, betrayals, and unresolved emotions.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped closer, the air thick with unspoken tension. “Perhaps it’s time for a refresher course,” she whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s lips curled into a slight smile. “Careful, Agatha. Some lessons are best left unlearned.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The Conservatory was not only a place of learning. It was a crucible. A testing ground for power, hierarchy, and control. And when two professors of their caliber collided, it was only a matter of time before the halls echoed with the thunder of a duel.
    </p>
<p>
     By the next evening, the whispers had grown into outright speculation. Students and faculty alike murmured about the encounter in the lecture hall. The Conclave, the Conservatory’s secretive council of elder witches, formally sanctioned the duel. A show of order cloaked in curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     The venue was the Moonlit Courtyard, a sacred duelling ground encircled by statues of ancient witches who’d founded the school. The sky above rippled with energy as protective wards shimmered into place. Candles and runes flickered with life, forming a circle of raw containment. No tricks, no illusions beyond the combatants’ own power.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood at one end of the circle, clad in ceremonial emerald robes etched with silver glyphs that pulsed faintly in rhythm with her breath. Her hair was pinned back in coiled braids, her eyes calm but alert. She held no staff, no wand, only the language of her hands and the runes etched across her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha entered from the opposite side like a queen returning to her court. Dressed in black silk and violet armour that kissed her curves like liquid shadow, she smiled with unsettling confidence. Her boots clicked like a metronome of intent.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bowed once. Formal. Controlled.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha curtsied mockingly, smirking. “Do try not to be boring.”
    </p>
<p>
     A bell tolled, an old bronze thing hung high in the Conservatory’s tallest tower. The duel began.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved first, drawing a sigil midair that detonated in a cascade of frost and wind, a blizzard meant to disorient and bind. Agatha dodged, lips parting in a pleased sigh, raising a single hand to redirect the cold back with a flicker of chaos-fire, purple and pulsing, licking at the runes on the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     The crowd gasped, a student fainted and the boundary shields buckled. They circled one another like wolves, snarling in Latin, reciting hexes older than paper. At one point, Rio surged forward, catching Agatha by surprise with a burst of earth magic that cracked the stones beneath her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     But Agatha laughed, tumbling backward in a graceful arc, and vanished into a cloud of violet mist. She reappeared behind Rio, close enough to whisper. “Getting a little aggressive, Professor Vidal?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio whipped around, teeth clenched, pushing her palm flat against Agatha’s sternum. Magic flared a red-orange, searing like a wildfire.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let it hit her full force. She grinned through the smoke. Her hair uncoiled around her like serpents. “Mm. I do love it when you play rough.”
    </p>
<p>
     She disarmed Rio with a blink and a twist of her wrist, summoning ropes of shadow that bound Rio’s arms midair, lifting her slightly off the ground in a sweep of spectacle and submission.
    </p>
<p>
     The duel was supposed to end then. But Rio, suspended in Agatha’s magical grip, met her eyes; not with fear, but something else. Understanding. Hunger. Recognition. Suddenly, with a burst of sheer will, Rio shattered the bonds. Not through counter-spells, but raw, unfiltered power. The shadows hissed and dissolved. The wind whipped around her like a chorus. Agatha took a step back, her eyes wide, her lips parted. Not in fear. In thrill. The bell tolled again.
    </p>
<p>
     The duel was declared a draw.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Long after the courtyard had emptied, Rio found Agatha waiting in the duelling ring, seated atop a broken pedestal, her fingers tracing one of the glowing battle sigils.
    </p>
<p>
     “You let me win,” Rio said, voice low.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, darling,” Agatha said without looking up. “I let myself lose. It’s more fun this way.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio approached slowly. “You thrive on chaos, but that doesn’t mean I’ll be another name in your wake.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mm.” Agatha rose, face to face with her. “And you’re used to control, but that doesn’t mean I’ll follow your syllabus.”
    </p>
<p>
     They stood there for a long moment, magic sparking between them like lovers’ breath in the cold.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll see you in class,” Agatha murmured. “Or your chambers. Whichever comes first.”
    </p>
<p>
     Then she vanished again, leaving behind only the scent of lilac and singed ozone.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The Conservatory’s North Wing was built like a cathedral for scholars: vaulted ceilings, flickering witch-fire sconces, and endless rows of arched doors labeled in ancient languages. Professor Rio Vidal’s chambers were located at the very end of the corridor. Warded, sealed, silent.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t hold many office hours. Her students learned quickly: you brought your questions to her lecture, or you kept them to yourself. Her door was not one to be knocked upon lightly. But tonight, she found it already open. Not ajar. Open.
    </p>
<p>
     The scent of crushed lavender and old parchment lingered in the air. Her pulse, usually steady, quickened. Inside, the room was dim. Shelves sagged under the weight of grimoires. A chalkboard still bore yesterday’s equation on spell lattice compression. The embers in the hearth glowed a deep orange.
    </p>
<p>
     And behind her desk, sprawled lazily in her chair, sat Agatha Harkness. “You’ve improved your wards,” Agatha said, sipping from a crystal glass that Rio immediately recognised. “Took me almost a minute to get through.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed the door without a word. She pressed her palm to it, locking it with a spell that slithered over the wood like ink sinking into skin. “You’re trespassing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled slow, feline. “I’m auditing your office hours.”
    </p>
<p>
     She was dressed differently than usual: looser garments, a silk blouse unbuttoned just enough to hint. She looked like temptation distilled into form, but that was nothing new. What caught Rio off guard wasn’t the skin, it was the comfort. As if she belonged here.
    </p>
<p>
     “Get out,” Rio said, walking toward her desk.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t move. “Oh, is that how we greet colleagues now? Cold and commanding? Or are you trying to cover how warm you’re getting, right here…” She placed her palm over her own chest. “When you realised I wasn’t some illusion.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached for her chair, but Agatha caught her wrist. The touch was electric. Literal, almost charged with something neither fully magical nor fully physical. A tension only they seemed to generate. Rio didn’t pull away.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re playing with fire,” she said, voice lower now. Rough.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, darling,” Agatha murmured, rising slowly, still holding Rio’s wrist. “I’m made of fire.”
    </p>
<p>
     They stood chest-to-chest now, the desk between them irrelevant. The hum of magic in the air shifted to something deeper, darker. Not combative. Something older. Resonant.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned in, her mouth close to Agatha’s ear. “What do you want?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched. “You.”
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t seductive, well not entirely. It was too raw for that. A single syllable carrying centuries of repressed need.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her. It wasn’t gentle. It wasn’t practiced. It was a clash of wills made flesh. Lips bruising, teeth grazing, hands already clutching too tight. Agatha’s fingers threaded into Rio’s hair, pulling, gasping. Rio’s hand tangled in Agatha’s blouse, yanking her closer, pressing her to the edge of the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     Clothes came undone not with haste, but with precision, as if they were undoing bindings, not buttons. Each tug, a test. Each shiver, a victory. They didn’t ask permission. They took. They gave. They taught.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted Agatha onto the desk with a grunt and laid her back across it like an offering to something pagan. Agatha’s thigh hooked around her waist, and for a brief, breathless second, everything else - the Conclave, the rules, the war between them - dissolved. The only thing that remained was the scent of ancient wood and sweat, Agatha’s whispered Latin curses against Rio’s shoulder, Rio’s control slipping beneath Agatha’s nails.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t romance. It was alchemy.
    </p>
<p>
     Afterward, they lay entangled atop the papers and spell diagrams, sweat cooling on bare skin. Rio studied the ceiling like it had answers.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, still catching her breath, traced a rune along Rio’s collarbone with one lazy finger. “Lesson one,” she murmured, “you don’t get to win.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her head, meeting her eyes. “I’m not here to win. I’m here to learn.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked. And for the first time in a long time, she was caught off guard. She sat up slowly, brushing hair from her eyes. “Well then,” she said, amused, “Class is in session.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They were careful at first. Meetings were unplanned, and yet perfectly timed. A locked storeroom under the alchemy wing. An abandoned greenhouse, overrun with creeping nightvine. Between lectures. During rituals. Beneath the grand lecture hall’s floorboards, where a buried ley line hummed like a second heartbeat. There, they were teachers still, but teaching each other things no syllabus would ever allow.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha taught Rio how to unbind chaos spells with a touch, not a chant. “You overthink it,” she murmured one evening, her hand guiding Rio’s wrist through a swirl of violet fire. “Magic isn’t all structure. Sometimes it needs to break to live.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, in turn, showed Agatha how to anchor a spell using her breath, her voice, her pulse. “Feel it,” she whispered one night, their mouths inches apart. “Speak like you mean it. Let the incantation own you.” Her fingers had been wrapped around Agatha’s throat, not to silence, but to focus.
    </p>
<p>
     They traded disciplines the way others traded kisses. Their bodies became tomes to study. Every moan, every gasp, was an annotation. Every bruise, a signature. But like all forbidden knowledge, it couldn’t stay hidden forever.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The students were the first to notice. Late arrivals. Lecture delays. A shared smirk in a hallway. A set of matching magical burns that neither of them explained. Whispers began to rise like smoke through the Conservatory’s ancient halls.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s been spending time with Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Didn’t they duel? Wasn’t it a draw?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No one draws with Harkness. You either win or she lets you lose.”
    </p>
<p>
     By the time the rumours reached the Conclave, they had evolved into accusations. Unprofessional conduct. Possible magical entanglement. An alliance that could destabilise the very hierarchy of the faculty.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio found the parchment one morning, sealed with obsidian wax. The script was cold, impersonal:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Summons for a formal review of conduct and magical alignment. Attend. Alone.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She crushed it in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     That night, she didn’t go to her chambers. She went to Agatha’s. Agatha’s quarters were tucked away in the oldest wing of the Conservatory,
     <span>
</span>
     the kind of place students dared each other to enter on solstice nights. The air was always thick with incense and old spells, and the walls dripped with half-finished enchantments that whispered to themselves. Rio let herself in. No wards stopped her anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood by the window, her silhouette lit by a storm rolling in above the protective dome. She didn’t turn around when she said, “I assume they know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They summoned me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “For review?”
    </p>
<p>
     “For judgment.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned then, and Rio could see it in her eyes. Not fear, but fury. Cold and silent.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re scared of what we are,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio said, approaching her. “They’re scared of what we’ll become.”
    </p>
<p>
     Silence stretched between them.
    </p>
<p>
     And then Agatha laughed. A low and rich and almost bitter sound. “Do you remember what I said the night we duelled?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That I was undisciplined?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha stepped close, hand slipping beneath Rio’s coat, dragging nails along her ribs. “I said you were irresistible.”
    </p>
<p>
     They didn’t undress that night. They tore apart their clothes. No spells. No incantations. Just flesh and mouth and sweat, pushing each other to the brink, because it might be their last night in this place, in these roles, in this stolen world.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gripped Rio’s hips and gasped against her mouth, “If we fall, we fall together.”
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio, shaking, undone, inside and out, whispered back, “Then let the gods take us screaming.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They lay in silence. Between them was a single open book: The Codex of Unwritten Bonds. A forbidden text. Banned from syllabi. Considered too dangerous to teach. Agatha had read it cover to cover. Rio had once lectured against it. Now it lay open, face down, beside them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I could leave,” Rio said softly, fingers tracing Agatha’s spine. “Make it easier on you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head against Rio’s chest. “You’d make it duller. Not easier.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’ll come for you too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Let them.” Agatha’s voice was steel. “I’ve survived worse than small-minded scholars.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her temple and murmured, “Then let’s give them something worth fearing.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The Conclave did not meet often. When it did, storms gathered without wind. Candles bent their flames away from the chamber. And students, sensing the shift in air pressure and fate, vanished into libraries and study halls like prey before a predator. The chamber was carved into the bedrock beneath the Conservatory. Its walls bore the faces of every Head Witch for the last five centuries, and tonight, their carved eyes seemed to glow.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood at the center of the chamber, dressed in ceremonial robes. Dark red with a bright crimson trim, signifying a professor under inquiry. The opposite to what she would pick herself. Her posture was perfect. But her pulse thundered like war drums. Around her, the eight seats of the Conclave stood filled. At the edge of the room, veiled in shadow and arrogance, stood Agatha Harkness. Not summoned. Not required. And yet here. She didn’t speak. Not yet.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Elder Calderu, the senior-most member of the Conclave, spoke first. Her voice was all salt and smoke.
    </p>
<p>
     “Professor Vidal, we understand you’ve formed a… proximity-based association with former faculty member Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have,” Rio replied, meeting her gaze. “Though I question why proximity is a matter of concern in a Conservatory that encourages collaboration.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Collaboration is not the concern,” said Elder Kale, adjusting her robe. “Disruption is.”
    </p>
<p>
     Another elder leaned forward. “Since your entanglement began, we’ve seen magical anomalies. Power fluctuations. Emotional instability among students. And a distinct deviation from sanctioned spell-craft methods.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s jaw tightened.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped forward from the shadows then, voice silky. “You’re not worried about deviations. You’re worried about competition.”
    </p>
<p>
     Gasps echoed like flung stones.
    </p>
<p>
     Elder Calderu didn’t flinch. “Harkness. You are not permitted to speak—”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, please,” Agatha cut in, stepping into the center beside Rio. “Let’s not pretend this has anything to do with decorum. You’ve been watching us since the duel. Waiting for an excuse. Well, here we are. Together. Still breathing. Still burning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You bring danger into this Conservatory.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I bring evolution.” Her voice lowered. “Magic doesn’t grow under rules. It grows under pressure.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio placed a hand on Agatha’s arm. Calming. Grounding. But not silencing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Enough,” Rio said. “If you want my resignation, say it. If you want to bind her power again, try it. But I won’t apologise for what we’ve done.”
    </p>
<p>
     The Conclave members murmured among themselves. Their deliberation was layered with enchantments that masked their thoughts, but Rio didn’t need a spell to feel the truth: They were afraid. Not just of Agatha’s chaos. But of what the two of them had become , a new kind of power. Not darkness, not light. A third path. Rooted in lust, in intellect, in magic older than any rulebook.
    </p>
<p>
     Elder Calderu finally spoke. “You are both too volatile to remain unchecked. But too powerful to cast out.” Her tone shifted. Half warning, half in surrender. “You may stay. But be warned: Should the balance tip again, the consequences will not be… political.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave a shallow nod. Agatha, however, smiled. “Oh, we wouldn’t want it any other way.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They walked the halls afterward in silence. The Conservatory buzzed around them, but parted like mist. Students stared. Some with awe. Some with fear.
    </p>
<p>
     At the door to Rio’s chamber, Agatha leaned in. Her lips brushed Rio’s ear. “They’re right to be afraid.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed. “We’ll be watched constantly now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned her head, kissed her cheek. “Let them watch.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached behind her, opened the door, and pulled her inside.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They didn’t rush each other that night. They studied each other like texts under moonlight.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha marked Rio’s spine with kisses, whispering truths only lovers speak: “You ground me. That terrifies me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio replied with fingers tracing ancient runes across Agatha’s hip: “You undo me. That’s why I let you in.”
    </p>
<p>
     They moved like spells cast in tandem; intention, incantation, release. There was no war tonight. No punishment. Only breath, and surrender, and shared reverence for the forbidden knowledge they now embodied.
    </p>
<p>
     Tangled in sweat and half-spoken prophecy, Agatha murmured, “We’re rewriting the syllabus.”
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio, smiling through exhaustion and power and newfound devotion, whispered back, “Then let’s burn the old one.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The Conservatory had changed. Not visibly. The spires still rose like ribs from the cliff’s edge. The students still bent over scrolls and grimoires, muttering hexes beneath their breath. The Conclave still ruled with cold precision, watching, weighing. But beneath it all, in the ley lines, in the murmurs of sentient stone, in the dreamscapes of students who dared to sleep too close to the north tower, something had shifted.
    </p>
<p>
     At the center of that shift stood Rio Vidal and Agatha Harkness. They no longer hid.
    </p>
<p>
     They taught together sometimes. Not officially. But if you were clever, and brave, you could follow the flickering sigils that appeared on classroom walls, the whisper-routes in the astral plane. And if you found them, if you reached that floating glade in the pocket realm hidden beneath the eastern gardens, you could watch magic become something else.
    </p>
<p>
     Not taught. Not commanded. Shared. Rio would lead the ritual; precise, sharp as a blade. Agatha would disrupt it, unravel, tease, coax it into chaos. Together, they became something new. A lesson in balance.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     But not everyone wished to learn.
    </p>
<p>
     One night, long after the last student had left, and the stars had aligned into a sigil no mortal mouth could name, Rio stood at the edge of the Mirror Library. A place only senior faculty could enter, and even then, only with permission.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn’t alone. Elder Kale approached, not cloaked in robes this time, but in honest silence. She held an ancient blade, sheathed in rune-work. Not for use. For ritual.
    </p>
<p>
     “They want you to leave,” she said, quietly. “Both of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t flinch. “Then they should say it aloud.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re too afraid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of her?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of what you are together.” Kale’s eyes softened. “You’ve already changed everything. And they hate you for it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. Then, surprising even herself, said, “Good.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha found her in the observatory, arms crossed, stormlight playing against her hair like living paint. “So it’s come to this?” she asked. “The final act?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned, face unreadable. “They want us gone.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled, slow and sharp. “Let’s give them a show, then.”
    </p>
<p>
     But Rio didn’t smile. Not this time. “No more performances,” she said. “Just truth.” She stepped closer, close enough to feel the heat beneath Agatha’s glamour. She pressed her forehead to hers. “Stay with me. Not in secret. Not in fear. Not in exile. Here. Let them see what legacy really means.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath caught. “Legacy,” she echoed, tasting the word like wine. “Is that what we’re building?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took her hand. “A syllabus they’ll never dare erase.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The next week, a single scroll appeared on every door of the Conservatory. No signature. No author. But the seal was unmistakable: a violet flame wrapped in an emerald braid.

     Students fought to find it. Some were turned away. Some didn’t return the same. But those who stayed… they emerged different. Not just more powerful. More themselves. And over time, even the Conclave could not deny it: What had begun as scandal was now foundation.

     Day 5 - Rio Gets Injured

     Chapter Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Agatha rushed forward, dropping to her knees beside the broken woman. With a trembling hand, she brushed aside tangled hair, slick with blood and sweat.
     </p>
<p>
      “You’re not supposed to bleed,” she whispered, voice tight with disbelief and memory.
     </p>
<p>
      Rio’s lips curled faintly, teeth tinged red. “No one told her that,” she rasped, before her eyes rolled back and she collapsed fully into unconsciousness.

<p>
     The night was unnaturally silent, the kind of silence that doesn’t soothe but warns, pressing in from every shadowed corner of the world. In Westview, the air itself seemed to hold its breath. The trees stood still as statues, leaves frozen mid-rustle as though the wind had forgotten its name. Crickets, cicadas, even the usual nocturnal stirrings had vanished, silenced by a hush too ancient to belong to this era.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness stood at the front steps of her home, a two-story colonial nestled deep within the cul-de-sac that once played host to Wanda Maximoff’s grief-fuelled fantasy. The house looked ordinary. Its siding repainted in muted shades of grey and olive, its modest porch bearing hanging baskets of moonflowers and lavender. It was unassuming. Quiet. But every inch of it, every nail, floorboard, and brick, had been reimagined, not as a prison this time, but as a fortress.
    </p>
<p>
     Reclaimed. Reinforced. Re envisioned.
    </p>
<p>
     To any mundane eye, it was just another suburban home. But the veil of normalcy was paper-thin. Beneath the welcome mat, sigils of concealment pulsed with quiet energy. Carved invisibly into the porch posts were runes of shielding and misdirection. Floating crystals hummed like dormant bees behind the drywall, their arcane energy wired through the entire house like a nervous system on high alert.
    </p>
<p>
     Tonight, that system vibrated with unease.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s gaze swept across the cul-de-sac. The street lamps gave off a sickly amber glow, slightly dimmer than usual, flickering at irregular intervals as if sensing an intruder just beyond their reach. Nothing moved. Not the air. Not the leaves. Even the shadows seemed to be holding still.
    </p>
<p>
     And yet, she felt it. The shift.
    </p>
<p>
     A ripple in the fabric of reality. A distortion that preceded something other, not simply foreign, but foundationally incompatible. Her fingers twitched toward the silver ring on her finger, the incantation coiled tight in her throat, ready to ignite.
    </p>
<p>
     Then came the sound. Footsteps that were slow, uneven, dragging. The silence cracked like glass. Agatha’s eyes narrowed, and a whisper of violet energy curled at her fingertips.
    </p>
<p>
     Out of the dark emerged a figure - slumped, staggering, a silhouette that sent every alarm spell into a frenzy. The wards shimmered on the edges of her vision, but none activated. No attack. No defence. They recognised her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio Vidal.
    </p>
<p>
     The emerald-eyed warden of the threshold. An echo of Death itself, born not of decay but of endings - measured, inevitable. She was supposed to be untouchable. Immutable. Untouchable.
    </p>
<p>
     And yet… she bled.
    </p>
<p>
     Her cloak, black leather and green velvet, reinforced with occult sigils, was in tatters, barely clinging to her shoulders. Blood, black as void and threaded with constellations, trailed behind her like spilled night. Her skin was ghost-pale, her pupils unfocused. She took two more steps, then collapsed like a puppet whose strings had been cut. She landed with a sickening thud against Agatha’s porch steps.
    </p>
<p>
     For one long heartbeat, Agatha didn’t move. Couldn’t move. Every instinct screamed at her to attack, to shield, to deny what she was seeing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t bleed. She didn’t bleed. And yet… She had. She was.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rushed forward, dropping to her knees beside the broken woman. With a trembling hand, she brushed aside tangled hair, slick with blood and sweat.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re not supposed to bleed,” she whispered, voice tight with disbelief and memory.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s lips curled faintly, teeth tinged red. “No one told her that,” she rasped, before her eyes rolled back and she collapsed fully into unconsciousness.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled her inside with a mix of magic and muscle. Her voice was a constant murmur of incantations. Some were in Latin, others Enochian, even a few words in the ancient language of the Wastes. The house groaned around her as its wards readjusted, accepting the presence of Death within its walls but responding like a wary host.
    </p>
<p>
     She laid Rio on the antique velvet couch in the parlour. The Victorian embroidery, once purely aesthetic, glowed faintly as embedded runes activated. Protective sigils pulsed beneath the cushions. Aether crystals in the corners flickered to life, scanning the room like unseen eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Stripping the ruined coat from Rio’s frame, Agatha froze. The wound on Rio’s side wasn’t just deep—it was precise. Carved in a crescent arc, it shimmered with residual energy that stung Agatha’s fingertips.
    </p>
<p>
     She recognised it instantly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Vivienne Morreth,” she breathed. Not a guess. A declaration.
    </p>
<p>
     Vivienne, the exiled thaumaturge, the soul-blood conjurer who had vanished a decade ago after invoking forgotten gods and severing her connection to the Coven she dedicated her life to. A genius. A monster. A woman who had once tried to rewrite death’s definition.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hands trembled. “You stubborn, reckless fool,” she muttered, brushing a blood-matted curl from Rio’s forehead. “You should’ve run.”
    </p>
<p>
     But Rio never ran. Not from danger. Not from gods. Not even from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She worked tirelessly, every healing technique she had mastered over centuries summoned to her side. Lunar water, phoenix ash, silver-thread salves, and powders distilled from dream-spores. She layered protection spells like scaffolding, wove containment glyphs into the air itself. Her fingers were stained in blood and magic. Her voice cracked from repetition.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t performed healing this advanced since Salem.
    </p>
<p>
     And still, part of her whispered, “You’re not doing this just because she’s Death. You’re doing this because she’s Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Days passed, though the word “day” barely applied in Westview, where time bent like light through stained glass. The sun rose and set irregularly. Clocks ran backward. Dreams bled into waking hours.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t leave the house.
    </p>
<p>
     She tended to Rio. Reinforced the wards. Brewed tinctures of clarity and sleep. She whispered songs to the sigils embedded in the walls, coaxing them to stabilise.
    </p>
<p>
     On the fourth morning, if it was morning, Agatha found Rio awake and sitting beneath the lilac tree in the back garden. Her cloak was gone, replaced by a shawl Agatha had once knitted during a century-long exile in Spain. Her hair, once matted, now fell in clean, damp waves around her shoulders. She looked… fragile. Everything Rio shouldn't be.
    </p>
<p>
     “You should be resting,” Agatha said gently, holding out a steaming mug of tea.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took it, her fingers brushing Agatha’s. “It’s not the body that needs rest.”
    </p>
<p>
     They sat in silence. Birds chirped, illusions, mostly, conjured by the house to maintain its cover. Still, the sound was comforting.
    </p>
<p>
     “You came here to die, didn’t you?” Agatha asked softly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I came here to bleed,” Rio replied. “To remind myself I still could. And if I was to die, you were the last person I wanted to be able to see.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded slowly, absorbing the weight of the words. “I buried you once.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s gaze flicked to her. “You don’t bury Death. You just walk away until you need her again.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio regained her strength with alarming speed. Her very presence warped the house’s energies, stabilising spells in one room and shorting wards in another. She couldn’t help it. She was entropy, a walking paradox of purpose and ruin.
    </p>
<p>
     They sparred in the basement that was once a wine cellar, now a duelling chamber reinforced with obsidian-veined stone, glamoured to mortals gaze to look like nothing more than a normal basement. Agatha conjured violet fire serpents. Rio countered with emerald necrotic butterflies made of dusk and memory. Their battles were fierce and intimate, layered with unspoken truths.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re holding back,” Agatha snapped one night, breathing hard.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re pushing too hard,” Rio growled, sweat glistening at her collarbone.
    </p>
<p>
     Their magic clashed. Violet fire and shadowed gold crackling the air, forcing them apart. When the haze cleared, they stood inches apart, electricity dancing between their fingertips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why did you come back?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s voice was low, steady. “Because I needed to know. If I still mattered to you. If you still mattered to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stayed silent, memories of their chequered past swirling in her minds eye. But the love and pictures of their happier times always lingered.
    </p>
<p>
     “You do.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The warning signs came first.
    </p>
<p>
     Plants withered overnight despite enchantments that should have kept them evergreen. Ink in Agatha’s spell books curdled and turned to blood, bleeding through the pages like open wounds. The walls of the house shuddered, their bones trembling with a low, spectral vibration that no mundane ear could detect.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt it in her sternum before it arrived, a tightening, a cold pressure pressing against her wards. The air grew brittle, and the scent of ozone and rot tangled in her throat. Storm clouds gathered, the sky split open with a scream of thunder and every window of the Westview house shattered inward.
    </p>
<p>
     Glass became shrapnel. Wind howled like a tortured beast. Candles blew out all at once, though their flames had been magically tethered. The walls flared with defensive runes, but even they flickered under the weight of what approached.
    </p>
<p>
     In the doorway, backlit by indigo lightning and howling rain, stood Vivienne Morreth. Her silhouette was unmistakable. Coils of shadow writhed around her shoulders like living cloaks. Her eyes, once bright with curiosity, now burned with a madness forged in forgotten realms. She had not come alone. Behind her stood seven acolytes, each a mockery of life: stitched together with soul-thread and bone charms, their mouths sewn shut, their hands glowing with unstable sigil-magic. They shimmered in and out of phase with reality, wrong in ways that made the eye rebel and the stomach twist.
    </p>
<p>
     “You stole from me,” Vivienne hissed, her voice both echo and whisper. Her fingers twitched, and the storm surged at her command. “And I want her back.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved instantly, placing herself between Vivienne and Rio, who had risen to her feet with effort, still half-healed, blood already seeping through fresh bandages. Despite the pain, Rio stood tall. A spectral dagger spun into her hand as if summoned from the dark between stars.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not tonight,” Agatha said, her voice calm but ringing with arcane steel.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s fingers brushed Agatha’s, and in that brief contact, their magic knit together—elemental and cosmic, heat and void. They had fought together before. Once. Long ago.
    </p>
<p>
     The house roared to life. Sigils ignited on the walls, floors, and ceiling, spinning in layered spirals of protection and offence. The foundation groaned as ancient defence wards awoke from slumber. Wooden banisters twisted into spears. Chandeliers dropped and reformed as floating shields of light.
    </p>
<p>
     The storm answered. Lightning struck the roof. Rain hammered the walls. The veil between worlds wore thin and into that breach, battle erupted.
    </p>
<p>
     The first acolyte lunged, its limbs moving with jerky, puppet-like precision. Rio met it mid-air, dagger flashing with starlight. Her blade slid through its chest, no heart to pierce, only tethered memories. With a whisper in a language older than mourning, she severed its thread, and the body collapsed like wet ash. Two more followed, flanking her. They moved fast, too fast, but Rio twisted between them like a flicker in a dying flame. One tried to bind her with entropic thread, but Agatha severed the weave mid-spell with a slicing gesture, her own magic blooming outward in jagged lines of violet force.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped forward, arms lifted. Her voice rose in an ancient tongue, and the air around her became solid, a wall of compressed wind that crushed one of the acolytes against the far wall. Another tried to retaliate, hurling a spear of bone, but the house turned it to dust mid-air.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t have time for your failed creations,” Agatha growled.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dodged a strike and countered with a necrotic ripple of energy that aged the attacker a century in a blink. Its body buckled, crumbled, and dissolved into smoke.
    </p>
<p>
     Vivienne laughed. “You think you can kill what has no soul?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I’ve done it six times already,” Rio spat, blood staining her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     Vivienne raised both arms, and the storm screamed. Bolts of cursed lightning rained down, striking the sigils across the floor, trying to unravel them. The house moaned in protest. The chandelier shields flickered.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grabbed a strand of raw magical current and wove it into a net, hurling it toward Vivienne. It struck, but only for a second. Vivienne phased, her body melting into mist, reforming beside Agatha with a dagger made of cursed bone raised high.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could strike, Rio was there. She didn’t speak, just moved, dagger-first, the two weapons colliding in a shower of sparks and spectral flame. Vivienne twisted, kicked Rio back into a bookshelf, which exploded into splinters. Agatha followed with a kinetic blast that hurled Vivienne halfway through the wall.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, she rose, laughter broken and breathless. “Come now,” she crooned. “Do you think she loves you enough to survive this?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s fury surged. Not just magical, but personal. Vivienne had always known which buttons to push. Always known how to hurt.
    </p>
<p>
     The house responded. Sigils ignited in deeper colours, walls rippling with elemental fury. From the ceiling descended metallic vines wrapped in thorns of molten glass. They lashed at Vivienne and her remaining thralls, tearing through them with unrelenting precision. Rio, battered but unbowed, ran full speed, practically blinking in and out of space, cutting down another acolyte mid-cast. Her blade hummed with the sound of closing doors, of final breaths.
    </p>
<p>
     But Vivienne had been waiting for that move. She stepped forward and drove the bone-blade up beneath Rio’s ribs, right where the last wound had yet to heal.
    </p>
<p>
     Time cracked. Rio screamed, and the world fractured around it. Every candle in the house blew out. Glass cracked again. Even the storm went still.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t think. She felt. Her scream was silent, but her spell was not. She invoked a name lost to time, a word not meant for mortal tongues. The floor beneath her feet ignited with runes of pure unmaking. The magic she cast ripped through language, through thought, through Vivienne.
    </p>
<p>
     Vivienne turned just in time to see her doom. Her face twisted in shock, then defiance, then nothing. Her body came apart mid-word, her essence unraveling, thread by thread, scream by scream. No ashes remained. Just silence.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio fell, the dagger clattering from her hand as she crumpled to the floor, blood pooling too quickly beneath her. Agatha ran to her, dropped to her knees, caught her before her head hit the floor.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Rio healed again, slower this time. Quietly. Agatha rarely left her side. There were fewer spells now. More silences. More truth.
    </p>
<p>
     One night, under a sky filled with conjured stars and borrowed constellations, Agatha brushed Rio’s hand with her own. “Stay, please,” she said.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to her, the moon outlining her jaw. “Are you sure?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s voice was steady. “For the first time… yes. I can’t lose you again, just the thought of actually and permanently losing you after losing him, is too much. I thought I would hate you forever for what happened, but seeing you vulnerable and it being me you wanted despite everything between us, I can’t let you go again. I couldn’t cope.”
    </p>
<p>
     So Death stayed. Not as punishment, not as consequence, but as choice, with the one and only person she’s loved in her centuries of life.

     Day 6 - Soulmates/Soulmarks
    </h2>
<p>
     Chapter Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      In a world where soulmates are tied by invisible threads and find each other when the younger of the two turns twenty-five, Agatha Harkness, witch, eternal cynic, has long believed her thread was broken. She turned 25 nearly fifteen years ago, and no one came.
     </p>
<p>
      Then she walks into a florist’s shop in Westview for an entirely mundane reason (she’s not even sure why) and bumps into a woman with paint on her fingers, tangled curls, and a laugh like spring thunder. Rio. The string tightens. Snaps taut. And Agatha feels it for the first time.

<div>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness stopped believing in the soulmate string at thirty-two.
    </p>
<p>
     The theory was sound. Every person had a thread tied to their soulmate, invisible and dormant until both turned twenty-five. For some, the connection was instant, a spark in the chest. For others, it tugged gently over time, drawing them closer with a persistent ache.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d turned twenty-five fifteen years ago. She waited. She searched. She even tried magic. Spells of tethering, of seeking, of truth. But nothing ever came of it. She decided, eventually, that she must be broken.
    </p>
<p>
     That was until one week, on a Monday that smelled like rain and jasmine, she walked into a little shop in Westview she’d never noticed before. Not for any reason. She wasn’t pulled there. Or maybe she was. It felt like curiosity. Like boredom. Like fate sneaking in the back door.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had no reason to walk into the shop. She’d passed it dozens of times on her quiet walks through Westview. The little storefront with ivy creeping up the side, a painted sign reading “Bloom &amp; Brush” swinging gently in the breeze. It wasn’t a place she had any business in. Too charming. Too bright. Too filled with things that reminded her of what she didn’t have.
    </p>
<p>
     But today, her feet turned toward the door. Her hand reached for the handle before her mind caught up. And the moment she stepped inside, the world shifted.
    </p>
<p>
     The air smelled of soil and citrus, paint and something faintly sweet. Not flowers exactly, but more like possibility. Light filtered through wide windows onto watercolour paintings and rows of potted plants. Somewhere in the back, soft music played; jazzy and warm.
    </p>
<p>
     And then she saw her.
    </p>
<p>
     A woman - no, a girl, no, a young woman, Agatha corrected herself quickly, crouched near a tray of violets, one hand buried in dirt, the other smeared with streaks of lavender-blue paint. She looked up when the door chimed, and time went terribly still.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched. There it was - a sensation like a wire drawing tight beneath her breastbone. Not painful. Not demanding. Just… present.
    </p>
<p>
     The invisible string. For fifteen years, she’d felt nothing. Now, it was unmistakable.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman blinked, and the same realisation bloomed across her face. Astonishment, wonder, recognition.
    </p>
<p>
     “…Do you feel that?” she asked, voice quiet but steady.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Yes.”
    </p>
<p>
     They stared at each other, unmoving. Somewhere in the walls, a clock ticked. The world tilted toward something inevitable.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m Rio,” the young woman said, rising slowly to her feet and brushing dirt from her hands. “Today’s my birthday. I just turned twenty-five.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swallowed. Her voice didn’t want to work. “I’m…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Older,” Rio said, not unkindly, with a half-smile. “But not what I imagined. Not at all.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “What did you imagine?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Someone… louder. More dramatic.” She tilted her head. “You feel like a thunderstorm that’s learned how to be quiet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a surprised laugh. “That might be the nicest thing anyone’s ever said to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned, then hesitated. Slowly, she turned her wrist over, pushing up her sleeve. There, just above the crease of her wrist, was a spiral birthmark. Soft-edged, like it had been there all her life, waiting to mean something. Without speaking, Agatha mirrored the motion. Her own spiral sat in the same place, same size, same curve.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached forward and gently pressed their wrists together. “So this is real.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a slow breath. “Yes. It’s real.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They ended up outside, sitting on a wooden bench behind the shop, the sun casting lazy gold through the tall grass. Rio had brought them lemonade, and Agatha held the cool glass in both hands like an anchor.
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought the thread was supposed to pull,” Rio said. “I always imagined it snapping into place. Some kind of fireworks. But this… it’s warm.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s been quiet for me,” Agatha admitted. “Ever since I turned twenty-five. I waited for years. I thought something was wrong with me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s smile faded a little. “That must’ve been hard.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was,” Agatha said, simply. “But I got used to it. I convinced myself the string snapped, or that maybe I didn’t have one. Magic can’t fix a broken thread.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head. “You’re magical?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a crooked smile. “You said I felt like a quiet thunderstorm.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “Fair point.”
    </p>
<p>
     They lapsed into silence again, but it wasn’t awkward. The kind of quiet that happens when there’s nothing that needs to be said, only the presence of something blooming between them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced sideways. “You don’t have to do anything with this. Just because we’re connected. The string doesn’t decide everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked thoughtful. “I don’t feel forced. Just… curious. Like I’ve spent my whole life humming a note and only just heard the harmony.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at her, startled.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio asked, eyes bright.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just…” Agatha looked down at her wrist, at the spiral mark. “That was a beautiful thing to say.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and looked away, cheeks pink. “I say things like that sometimes. I paint a lot of trees with open doors. I don’t always know why.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned back against the bench. The string between them hummed like a gentle violin note. Not pulling, not pushing. Just there.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d like to see your paintings,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Then come back tomorrow,” Rio replied, voice soft and sure. “I’ll show you the greenhouse too. The violets will bloom by morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Alright.” She said as she stood up from the bench, brushing her coat straight, and paused.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood too. “Will I see you again?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll feel it if I get too far away,” Agatha said, tapping her chest lightly. “But I think I’ll come back just because I want to.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled. “Me too.”
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha walked away, she felt the string loosen -
     <span>
</span>
     not weaken, but stretch comfortably. A tether, not a chain. An invitation, not a demand.
    </p>
<p>
     For the first time in years, she didn’t feel broken.
    </p>
<p>
     And for the first time ever, she wasn’t afraid of what came next.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha returned the next day. Of course she did. She told herself she was just curious. That it was good manners to follow through on a promise. That the thread was warm, not compelling. She didn’t need to come back. She wanted to.
    </p>
<p>
     It was raining softly when she arrived. The windows of Bloom &amp; Brush were fogged around the edges, casting the shop in a cozy, golden glow. Inside, Rio was barefoot, standing on a step stool as she watered a hanging fern, her hair pinned messily on top of her head with what looked like two paintbrushes.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned at the sound of the bell, and her smile lit the room brighter than the overhead fixtures. “You came back.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped inside, brushing water from her coat. “You said the violets would bloom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hopped down, barefoot steps soft against the wood floor. “And they did. Come on.”
    </p>
<p>
     She led Agatha through a curtained doorway at the back, into the greenhouse. It was small, tangled, and alive. Vines reached for the ceiling like they were chasing dreams. A fat orange cat lay curled on a sun-warmed bench, watching them with one eye. The air was thick with the smell of earth, of newness, of magic waiting in roots.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked as her senses adjusted. “You live back here?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “Shop in the front, studio in the middle, home in the back. Everything I love in one crooked building.”
    </p>
<p>
     She knelt beside the tray of violets that were now blooming, their petals a deep, impossible indigo. “I talked to them last night,” Rio said. “I told them someone important was coming. They like to show off.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha crouched beside her, peering at the plants. “I could feel the way they responded to you. You’re not just guessing your way through this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t have a name for it,” Rio admitted. “But I’ve always… known things. Felt the shape of how something wants to grow. Like music under my skin.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tilted her head, considering her. “That’s magic. Not flashy, but real. Old. Maybe even older than mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio met her eyes. “Will you teach me?”
    </p>
<p>
     The question hung in the air like smoke. Agatha’s first instinct was to deflect. Laugh it off. Make a dry joke about witchcraft being more paperwork than glamour. But something in the way Rio looked at her, not reverent, not demanding, just earnest, made her pause.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t teach,” she said quietly. “Not anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Because of what happened?” Rio asked, gently. “Or because you’re afraid of what could?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at her. “You don’t even know what happened.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “I don’t have to. I know the look of someone who built a wall to protect something and forgot how to leave the gate open.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha exhaled. It wasn’t anger. It was awe. And maybe a little fear. “You say things that undo people,” she murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled. “Only the ones I’m supposed to know.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They drank tea in the studio. The air was sharp with turpentine and lavender oil, a strange but not unpleasant mix. Canvases leaned in every corner - some finished, some mid-process. One caught Agatha’s eye: a field of spirals, painted in every shade of dusk.
    </p>
<p>
     “You did that before we met,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “I didn’t know what they were. I just kept dreaming about them. Over and over.”
    </p>
<p>
     She reached for her brush without thinking, and Agatha watched her paint; quick, fluid, with the same kind of confidence the violets had. As if Rio wasn’t inventing the image, but uncovering something that had always been there.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is that how you see the world?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced at her, thoughtful. “I see the world in layers. And when I met you… another one opened.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swallowed. She hadn’t expected any of this. Not the ease. Not the interest. Certainly not the quiet ache of I want to stay longer.
    </p>
<p>
     They didn’t touch. But the thread between them warmed and steadied. Not rushing ahead, just humming in time. Agatha stood to leave as twilight pooled in the windows.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll walk you out,” Rio offered.
    </p>
<p>
     They stepped through the curtain together, into the front of the shop. Agatha paused by a table of small potted herbs: mint, thyme, lemon balm. Her fingers brushed one, and it leaned toward her like a cat asking for affection.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve never seen anyone else do that,” Rio said quietly. “The way plants love you back.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled. “They remember kindness.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her for a long moment. “I hope you come back tomorrow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I will,” Agatha said. Before she could talk herself out of it, she reached out and gently tucked a loose curl behind Rio’s ear. The touch was featherlight, but the thread between them pulsed once, strong and sure.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked but didn’t step back. “That felt like… a yes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, voice a whisper. “It was.”
    </p>
<p>
     She walked out into the rain, heart beating a little faster than before.
    </p>
<p>
     That night, Agatha sat in her kitchen, tracing the spiral on her wrist with her thumb. The string between them was still there. Soft, quiet, real. She didn’t know what it meant yet. But for the first time in fifteen years, she wasn’t afraid to find out.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The third time Agatha visited, she brought a book. Not a gift, exactly. She said she was just lending it. A weathered leather-bound thing with no title on the spine and the smell of cedar and age pressed into its pages. She placed it carefully on the studio table, beside a palette streaked in ochre and moon-gray.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked up from her painting and raised an eyebrow. “What is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t sit down. She leaned against the doorframe like she didn’t quite trust herself to enter the room all the way. “An old text on soulmarks. The kinds. The patterns. The… myths.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked. “You believe in myths?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mouth quirked. “I’ve lived long enough to realise most myths are just magic people stopped understanding.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio flipped open the book gently. Inside were hand-drawn sketches; wrists with twin swirls, shoulder blades marked by mirrored constellations, palms inked with names in unknown alphabets. Rio touched a drawing of a spiral like hers, like Agatha’s, rendered in careful black ink.
    </p>
<p>
     “This one,” she said softly. “What does it mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha finally stepped into the room and knelt beside her. “It’s called the echo spiral,” she said. “It usually appears when soulmates have a connection that spans more than one life. It’s… rare. Most threads only last a single lifetime.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s gaze flicked to her wrist, where the spiral birthmark rested like a secret in plain sight. “And we have it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Identical. Same size. Same angle. Same placement.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio traced her fingertip over the mark, then glanced at Agatha. “Do you remember me? From before?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s expression turned inward. “No. But I’ve had dreams. Not memories, more like impressions. A laugh in a garden. A pair of hands covered in blue. A voice that said, I would’ve found you in any world.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t say anything. She just leaned forward and rested her head lightly against Agatha’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the first time they’d touched since the thread pulsed between them. And this time, it didn’t hum. It sang.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached up, hesitated, then let her fingers curl gently around Rio’s. The room held still, as if even the air wanted to witness the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to be sure yet,” Agatha whispered. “We can let it unfold slowly.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head up, eyes warm. “I’m not afraid of the string.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You should be afraid of me,” Agatha murmured. “I don’t always know how to be… soft.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and pressed her forehead to Agatha’s. “Then don’t be. Just be real.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They sat cross-legged on the floor of the greenhouse, drinking tea that smelled like apples and rosemary. The rain had stopped, and sunset spilled gold over everything. Rio was sketching something, her pencil dancing in wide arcs, looping and spinning in practiced spirals.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her quietly. “That’s the mark, isn’t it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded without looking up. “It keeps showing up in my art. I don’t even notice until I finish. It’s like my hands remember you before I do.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s throat tightened.
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought about tattooing it once,” Rio added, voice gentle. “When I was younger. Before I knew it meant anything. I just… liked the shape. It felt like home.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached out and touched the back of her hand. “You don’t have to prove anything to me. You don’t have to earn this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked up, startled. “I don’t?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “You just have to be here. That’s enough.”
    </p>
<p>
     For the first time since the thread had returned to her chest, Agatha realised she believed it.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha left that evening, Rio reached out and squeezed her hand, and Agatha held on a little longer than necessary. The string was quiet between them now. Not gone, just settled. A breath, not a tug. A choice, not a command. And in the quiet of that stillness, something precious began to grow.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It took three more visits before either of them said the word soulmate aloud. Agatha didn’t like it. The word felt heavy. Too final. Like a door swinging shut behind you before you’d finished packing your things. She had always resisted prophecy, even her own.
    </p>
<p>
     But Rio said it so lightly, almost absentmindedly, one morning while mixing lavender into lemon balm tea. “Well, maybe that’s just how soulmates work,” she said with a shrug. “You don’t have to believe it on day one. You just have to show up.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t answer right away. She just stood at the edge of the greenhouse, watching the way sunlight threaded through Rio’s curls like gold spun into ink. “You make it sound easy,” she said finally.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced back, half-smiling. “It is easy. We’re the ones who make it complicated.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They took to walking together; slow loops around the quiet edges of Westview, where the air smelled of wet stone and blooming honeysuckle. Agatha always kept her hands tucked into her coat pockets. Rio never wore a jacket, even when the wind bit.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re going to catch a cold,” Agatha muttered one afternoon, handing over her scarf with a reluctant twist of fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked, surprised. “You don’t seem like the nurturing type.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not,” Agatha said stiffly. “You’re just reckless.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned and looped the scarf loosely around her neck. “And you’re warm, even when you pretend not to be.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked away. The string between them was soft today. No pull, no pressure. Just presence. It was… unnerving. She’d spent years convincing herself she didn’t need anyone. Not after the pain, the loss, the loneliness that had hollowed her out and left her armour like thick, toughened steel. And now here came this barefoot storm of a woman, twenty-five and too bright for her own good, brushing up against Agatha’s edges like it was nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not just the age,” Agatha said suddenly, stopping mid-step.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t look at her. “It’s the time. What I’ve lived through. What I’ve done. You have light in your hands, Rio. And I’m not sure I know how to hold it without burning it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was quiet for a long moment. Then she stepped forward and took Agatha’s hand slowly, like asking permission. “Maybe you don’t have to hold it,” she said gently. “Maybe we just learn how to shine near each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down at their joined hands. The string between them flickered, not with urgency, but with recognition. As if it were listening.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They sat on Rio’s studio floor surrounded by paints and silence that evening. A storm tapped gently against the windows, and the smell of rain mingled with linseed oil and dried rosemary. Rio painted in silence, her brush sliding in curved lines across the canvas. Agatha watched her for a while, then quietly pulled out a worn notebook and began sketching sigils in the margins.
    </p>
<p>
     After a while, Rio asked without looking up, “Do you want this to become something?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s pencil paused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Or is it already something?” Rio added, quieter now. “And we just haven’t said it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha exhaled. “It’s… becoming. I don’t want to rush what doesn’t need to be rushed.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, her brush still moving. “Okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     And that was it. No declarations. No pressing. Just okay.
    </p>
<p>
     The storm outside thickened. The room grew dim. Neither of them moved to turn on the light. Instead, they let the grey settle over them, the way some people settle into each other. Carefully, gently, with both hands open.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     That night, Agatha didn’t go home right away,
    </p>
<p>
     She stayed until long after midnight, curled up in a chair near the studio window, watching Rio sleep on the couch beneath a half-finished quilt. The cat was curled beside her. A candle burned low. Agatha touched her spiral mark absently, tracing it with her thumb. The thread inside her didn’t feel like a hook or a line. It felt like a breath. Not dragging her forward. Just waiting. Ready.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The kiss wasn’t planned. It wasn’t even a moment Agatha had been expecting, though she’d imagined it; in quiet flickers, in half-dreams, in the stillness of night when her hands rested over her heart and the invisible thread beneath her skin pulsed warm.
    </p>
<p>
     They’d been dancing around it for weeks. A look here. A brush of fingers there. But tonight, the air between them crackled, not with fate or magic or strings, but desire. Honest and human and trembling at the edges.
    </p>
<p>
     It started with laughter. Agatha had made some dry, self-deprecating remark about her cooking, something about turning rice into gravel, and Rio, curled up barefoot on her studio floor in an old paint-stained tee, had laughed so hard she nearly knocked over her tea.
    </p>
<p>
     “You need supervision,” Rio said, eyes bright with mischief.
    </p>
<p>
     “I need a fire extinguisher,” Agatha muttered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned and crawled closer, her movements fluid and unselfconscious. “You know, you’re different when you’re relaxed.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath caught. “Different how?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Lighter,” Rio said softly. “Like the version of you that still remembers how to hope.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t speak. She couldn’t. Rio sat up on her knees, their faces suddenly much too close. Her eyes searched Agatha’s with that quiet, fearless gaze she always wore when she was about to speak truth.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I kiss you?” she asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha froze - not from fear, but from the weight of being asked. The respect of it. The reverence. No thread, no pull, no prophecy. Just choice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” she said. Barely a whisper. “Please.”
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     It was soft, at first. The kind of kiss that doesn’t ask for anything but presence. Their lips touched like a question, then again like the answer. Agatha felt herself melt into it. Every defence, every sharp edge dissolving under the warmth of being wanted. Rio’s hands slid into her hair, slow and reverent. Agatha cupped Rio’s jaw like she was holding something precious, something ancient and breakable and hers. The thread between them pulsed deep and low, humming through bone and blood.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha deepened the kiss, and Rio answered.
    </p>
<p>
     They moved without hurry, like they had all the time in the world, like the string wasn’t pulling them, but guiding them gently toward the place where want met willingness. They undressed each other in slow pieces, the air between them thick with breath and wonder.
    </p>
<p>
     There was no rush. No push for completion. Only skin and mouths and softness. Gasps swallowed in the crook of a shoulder. Fingers mapping each other with reverence.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed the spiral on Agatha’s wrist like it was a promise. Agatha whispered Rio’s name like it was a spell. And when they came together, slowly, deeply, fully, the thread between them lit up inside their chests like a star being born.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t about magic. It was about yes.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They lay tangled in blankets, quiet except for the sound of shared breath. Rio’s head was tucked against Agatha’s shoulder, her fingers lightly tracing circles over Agatha’s sternum.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at the ceiling, overwhelmed in the most peaceful way. “I’ve never…” she began, then stopped.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked up. “Never what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced down. “Never felt this and not been afraid of what it would cost.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her collarbone. “Then let’s not keep a ledger.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed, soft and disbelieving. “Gods, you undo me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Gently,” Rio whispered. “Always gently.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Outside, the world kept turning, but inside, wrapped in warmth and the golden thread of something sacred and slow, two souls chose each other again. Not because fate told them to, but because they could.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t sleep easily. Even on the nights she managed to drift off,
     <span>
</span>
     when her mind wasn’t busy spinning old regrets into fresh insomnia, her body stayed alert. Tense. Coiled like something waiting to be unmade. She hadn’t fallen asleep beside someone in over a decade. Not like this. Not after what they’d shared.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was already asleep. Curled on her side, one hand tucked beneath her cheek, the other still loosely linked with Agatha’s. The soft rise and fall of her chest was rhythmic, grounding. Her hair was a wild halo against the pillow.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had meant to leave. She’d even sat up once, after Rio had fallen asleep; slowly, carefully, so as not to wake her. She’d reached for her coat, still folded over the back of a nearby chair. But the thread had tugged. Not forcefully. Not magically. Just gently. Stay, it whispered. And so she had.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, hours later, the room was quiet. The kind of quiet that only happens in the breath between night and morning, when the world forgets to pretend for a little while.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lay on her side, watching Rio sleep. It terrified her. How peaceful she looked. How easily she had made space for Agatha in her world, in her bed, in her arms, in the gentle hollows of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had lived long enough to mistake love for fire. For hunger. For ruin. This - this slow, steady warmth - was entirely new. She reached down and lightly brushed her thumb over the spiral mark on Rio’s wrist and it responded. Not with light. Not with sound. But with recognition. As if some buried part of herself whispered, Yes. Her. Still her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stirred, not quite waking, but shifting. Her fingers curled more tightly around Agatha’s. “You’re thinking too loud,” she murmured, eyes still closed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath caught. “Sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled sleepily and pulled her closer, tucking her face into the curve of Agatha’s throat. “Stop apologising. You can be noisy in my bed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Noted,” Agatha said dryly, but her voice cracked around the softness.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed the hollow of her neck, lips barely brushing skin. “You stayed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I did.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you going to stay again?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was quiet for a long time. “I don’t know how not to.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened her eyes finally. “I don’t want a fairy tale. I don’t want perfect.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha searched her gaze. “Then what do you want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You. All of you. The careful and the chaotic. The parts still healing. The ones that never will.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swallowed. “That’s dangerous.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her again, this time slower, deeper, and less like an answer and more like a decision. “I’m not afraid of dangerous,” she whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     In the quiet that followed, Agatha felt something inside her finally unclench.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They slept like that… eventually. Twined together, skin against skin, not out of heat but out of need. Out of the new, bewildering comfort of not being alone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha woke once, just before dawn, to find Rio watching her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Didn’t mean to fall asleep,” Rio said softly. “Didn’t want to miss this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled, barely. “What is this?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached up and touched the spiral birthmark at Agatha’s temple - one she hadn’t even known was there until they’d traced it in candlelight hours earlier. “The place where all your pieces start to come back together.”
    </p>
<p>
     They stayed like that until morning. The sun crept through the window in slanted lines, painting their tangled legs in gold. The cat jumped onto the bed and claimed the pillow beside them like he owned the place. Rio laughed. Agatha didn’t shoo him.
    </p>
<p>
     And the thread? The thread didn’t tug, didn’t pull, didn’t tighten. It simply hummed. Content. Still there. Still tethered. But for the first time in either of their lives, it didn’t feel like fate. It felt like choice.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     ***
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The market was bustling again, spring folding over Westview like a bright shawl.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved through the crowd with calm purpose, a basket over one arm and a small, secret smile tucked at the corners of her mouth. She hadn’t told anyone yet. Not about Rio. Not about the thread or the spiral or how, some mornings, she woke up beside someone who made the world feel less broken. But maybe she would. Maybe this time, she wouldn’t be afraid. Because the string between them wasn’t a chain. It was a whisper. A promise. A quiet, steady pull toward something real.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha paused by the flower stall and caught sight of Rio in the distance; laughing, radiant, fingers curled loosely around a bundle of wildflowers. Their eyes met. The thread stirred. Not like a chain. Not like a shackle. But like the softest, strongest tether, pulling them toward a horizon they’d walk together. Agatha smiled wider and stepped forward. Because some things, she thought, are worth following.

<p>
     Light poured in through gauzy white curtains, painting the room in soft gold. The hum of the city was far away, muted by the cocoon of their bedroom. The sheets were tangled around their legs, half-forgotten mugs of tea cooling on the windowsill. It was one of those slow mornings where time thickened like honey.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lay on her side, head propped in her hand, watching Rio read. Her dark curls were a wild halo on the pillow, one hand lazily stroking Rio’s thigh under the covers.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve been thinking,” Agatha said, voice a little too casual to be accidental.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked up. “That’s dangerous.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smirked. But then her gaze turned serious, soft in a way few people ever got to see. “I want to have a baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     There was a pause. Rio blinked. “You… what?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha licked her lips, that small tell she gave when she was uncertain.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean-us. I want us to have a child. One with your eyes, maybe. Or your heart.” She glanced down, suddenly shy. “I could carry. I’d… like to.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat up slowly, the weight of the moment sinking in. “You’d… carry my egg?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.” Agatha’s voice steadied, eyes locking with hers. “Let me bring them into the world for you. For us. I want them to be yours too. Blood of your blood. I want your legacy inside me.”
    </p>
<p>
     The room shifted, it grew warmer, thicker.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha…” Rio reached for her hand. “Are you sure? That’s… it’s your body. It’s a lot.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha squeezed her fingers. “It’s not a sacrifice. It’s a choice. I want something that’s ours. That grows between us.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her like she was watching a star fall just close enough to touch, before closing the gap as she kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     The kiss started slow, tentative at first. Lips brushing like a question. But when Agatha pushed her body into Rio’s, it became an answer. The sheets rustled as she climbed over her, straddling her hips. Rio’s hands came up instinctively, gripping Agatha’s thighs. She was already wet, heat blooming between them like spring after frost.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned in, mouth to Rio’s ear. “You’re going to put your child in me,” she whispered. “Even if it takes a lab and needles and science, I’ll feel you in my blood.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groaned. Her hands slid up under Agatha’s shirt, fingers tracing bare skin. “You’re talking like that and expecting me to stay calm?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t,” Agatha said. “I want you hungry.”
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled her own shirt over her head, revealing bare breasts, dusky nipples already tight. Rio sat up to meet her, mouth closing around one, sucking gently. Agatha moaned, grinding down on Rio’s lap, hips slick and insistent.
    </p>
<p>
     The air smelled like skin and tea and sweat. The taste of want was on both their tongues. Agatha leaned back just enough to reach between them, dragging Rio’s hand down. “Touch me. Right there. I want to come thinking about your baby growing inside me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s breath caught. Her fingers found Agatha’s heat, wet and pulsing. She slid two inside slowly, feeling the way Agatha clenched around her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re already ready,” she murmured, voice rough. “Like your body knows.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha arched into the touch, eyes fluttering. “Say it again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re ready. Open. So fucking perfect. Mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     She pumped her fingers steadily, curling just right as Agatha rocked against her. Her other hand cupped Agatha’s breast, thumb circling the nipple. She licked her lips, then leaned forward and whispered to her belly.
    </p>
<p>
     “One day soon, you’ll grow something here. And I’ll love you more for it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cried out at that. High and wrecked, grinding harder. “Fuck, Rio… don’t stop. Please…”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve got you,” Rio said, fingers moving faster. “Come for me. Let it all go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s orgasm rolled through her like thunder, her body tightening and trembling, gasping into Rio’s neck as everything in her broke and bloomed at once. She collapsed against her, chest heaving. They lay there for a while, tangled and warm, heartbeat to heartbeat.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha traced circles on Rio’s shoulder. “So… are we really doing this?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her forehead. “Yeah, baby. We’re doing this.”
    </p>
<p>
     She smiled. “You’d better pick a cute donor. No weak chins.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “Deal. But only if I get to pick the baby names too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “That’s a stretch.”
    </p>
<p>
     They laughed into each other’s mouths, into each other’s arms, until the morning became afternoon and the first chapter of their family began.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The needle sat on the nightstand like a dare. Agatha stared at it from the edge of the bed, legs curled under her, silk robe half-unbelted. The air was warm, and the soft yellow of the lamp cast their bedroom in the hush of late evening. The world felt far away, the only sound the quiet hum of Rio preparing the alcohol swab.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to do this tonight,” Rio said gently, sitting beside her. “We can start tomorrow. Or the next day. You’re allowed to be scared.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head once, lips pressed tight. “I’m not scared,” she lied.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. “You’re white-knuckling the sheets, Aggie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced down, her fingers clenched so tight in the duvet her knuckles had gone pale. She let go slowly, flexing her hand open, and gave a sharp exhale. “I hate not being in control,” she muttered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio placed a steady hand over hers. “Then let’s make this something we control. Together.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s throat bobbed. “I don’t want this to hurt. Or feel… cold.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It won’t.” Rio moved closer, nudging her knees apart to sit between them. “Let’s turn this into a ritual. Something beautiful. Just us.”
    </p>
<p>
     The words landed somewhere deep in Agatha’s chest. She nodded, barely.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took the syringe and held it like it was delicate, sacred. “Okay,” she said softly. “Just a subcutaneous one. Tiny. Quick. Breathe with me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha closed her eyes, inhaled, exhaled and let Rio lift the hem of her robe. The air on her stomach made her flinch, anticipation crawling like static under her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll count,” Rio murmured. “And then we’re done. One… two…”
    </p>
<p>
     A pinch. A sting. A sharp breath. And then… nothing. Agatha opened her eyes. “That was it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled. “That was it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at her for a beat. “Oh,” she said. Then, slowly admitted, “I was a little dramatic.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A little,” Rio teased. “But you looked sexy doing it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed, quiet, breathy, real. The tension in her shoulders melted as Rio leaned forward and kissed the injection site, then kissed just below it. Then again, lower. She didn’t speak, she didn’t need to. Every kiss was an offering: You did something hard. You’re letting yourself be vulnerable. I see you. I love you for it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hands slid into Rio’s curls, tugging gently. “You always know how to make me feel… safe.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I want you to feel wanted,” Rio said against her skin, her voice low and reverent. “Every part of you. Even the parts that flinch.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha exhaled shakily. “If we get pregnant… if it works… they’ll never understand how much you gave me in these little moments.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s mouth paused just above her navel. “They don’t have to. I’ll know. You’ll know.”
    </p>
<p>
     She laid Agatha back against the pillows, climbing into the bed slowly, reverently. Their bodies met under the sheets, breath to breath, warm hands and warmer hearts. They didn’t rush. That night, the needle wasn’t what left a mark. It was every kiss, every whispered word, every time Rio touched Agatha like she was a holy thing.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The clinic was all white walls and quiet clocks. Agatha sat in the paper gown, legs swinging slightly off the edge of the exam table. Her hands were clasped in her lap, and for once, they weren’t steady. The sterile hum of the fluorescent lights above her was broken only by the rhythmic tapping of Rio’s thumb against the back of her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “They said it’ll be quick,” Rio murmured, leaning close. “But that doesn’t mean it has to feel impersonal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha exhaled a short laugh. “That’s a tall order when I’m dressed in tissue paper.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted her hand and kissed her knuckles. “Let me take care of that later.”
    </p>
<p>
     When the doctor came in, the procedure took less than ten minutes. A flash on a monitor. A tiny flicker of life - just a cluster of cells. And then it was inside her. Quiet. Unseen. Hopeful.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they got home, Agatha didn’t speak. She just walked into the bedroom, slipped off her coat, and sat on the bed in a slow, deliberate motion. Her hand moved to her stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you feel different already?” Rio asked gently.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head, eyes soft with something Rio didn’t recognise right away. It wasn’t fear. It was awe. “I thought I’d feel empty,” she whispered. “But I don’t. I feel… held.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved to her, slowly, like one might approach something holy. She knelt between Agatha’s knees and placed both hands on her thighs. “Then let’s honour that.”
    </p>
<p>
     She stood and kissed her, softly at first, then with rising warmth. Not hunger, not lust. Devotion.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio guided Agatha back onto the bed with infinite care, untying her robe like she was unwrapping something precious. The cotton slipped from her shoulders, revealing the skin of her belly; pale, soft, and already sacred in Rio’s eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re a home now,” Rio murmured, kneeling beside her. “And I want to worship every brick of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed her lips just beneath Agatha’s navel. Not hurried. Not performative. Just there. Warm breath, reverent contact. Her mouth made a slow path around her abdomen, kissing her ribs, the curve of her waist, each hip bone in turn.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hand threaded into her hair. Her voice was barely a breath. “I don’t know if this will work. I don’t know if I can do this right.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You already are,” Rio said. “You don’t have to prove anything. Just be. Let your body carry this in whatever way it chooses. I’ll carry you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes glistened. Her body, normally so guarded, softened in surrender. She lay back completely, opening herself not just to touch but to trust. Rio climbed beside her and curled around her form like a second skin, arms wrapped over Agatha’s belly, lips brushing the curve of her shoulder. They lay there for a long time. Whispering, breathing, being. No demands. No pressure. Just presence.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Later that night, Agatha reached for Rio’s hand and placed it against her stomach again. “Say something to them,” she whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hesitated only a moment before leaning down, voice muffled by skin. “Hi, little one. We don’t know you yet, but we already love you. Your mum is the bravest, strongest person I’ve ever known. And I’ll be here every step, even on the days that hurt. Especially on those.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned her head and kissed her. Salt met lips, one of them had been crying. Neither said who. In that room, lit only by the soft amber glow of a bedside lamp, they let silence take root. It was the kind of quiet you trust to grow into something more.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They called it the two week wait, as if it were something small, a comma in the sentence of becoming a parent. But to Agatha and Rio, it was a lifetime folded into fourteen days. Agatha marked the mornings with tea and silence. She would sit by the window in a thin robe, watching the clouds roll in or the light catch in the neighbour’s ivy. Her hand found her stomach out of habit now, as if feeling for some invisible tether to the life they’d placed inside her. Rio watched her from the kitchen, learning the language of her stillness. She didn’t try to fix it. She didn’t offer platitudes. She simply stayed. And at night, when the quiet grew too loud, they turned to touch. Not frantic. Not needy. Just there.
    </p>
<p>
     On the fifth night, Agatha climbed into bed without a word and lay flat on her back, arms folded over her belly. Her lips were parted, eyes open, distant.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lay beside her and gently reached for her hand. “Talk to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t look at her, but her fingers curled around Rio’s like ivy on a fence. “I keep thinking… what if it doesn’t take? What if I let you down?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You couldn’t,” Rio said, turning on her side to face her. “There is no version of this where you fail me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha finally met her gaze. “But I want to give you something. Something alive. Something that looks like you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned in slowly and kissed her. Not her lips, but her collarbone. The side of her throat. The space just beneath her ear. “You’ve already given me everything,” she whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Their mouths met softly, like rain on dry ground. Agatha’s breath caught when Rio’s hand moved to her waist, resting there with weight but not pressure. She tilted into it, her body humming with need. Not for release, but for reassurance. For grounding.
    </p>
<p>
     “Touch me,” Agatha whispered, the words barely more than air.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hands were slow. Devotional. She let her palm trail down Agatha’s side, across the curve of her hip, and to the soft rise of her belly. Her lips followed, pressing kisses lower and lower until she lay her cheek against Agatha’s stomach and simply… stayed.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you,” she said. “No matter what grows here. Or doesn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked up at the ceiling, her throat tight. “Stay like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     So Rio did. One hand wrapped around Agatha’s thigh, the other cradling her ribs. Their bodies weren’t moving anymore, but their closeness vibrated with heat, with want, with worship. Agatha reached down and threaded her fingers into Rio’s hair, anchoring herself there. They lay like that until Agatha fell asleep, not from exhaustion, but from peace.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The days that followed were much the same. They spoke less. They touched more. In the afternoons, Rio would undress Agatha slowly and guide her into bed, not for sex, but for softness. For skin. For breath. For that hour where their world shrank to the space between collarbones and ribcages and whispered “I love you”s pressed into warm skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Some nights they made love - slow, reverent, almost silent. Other nights they simply lay naked together, legs tangled, fingers tracing meaningless patterns just to say I’m here. I see you. The world had gone quiet, but they were still making music in the dark.
    </p>
<p>
     On the thirteenth night, Rio lit a single candle and held Agatha’s hand over the flame. Not close enough to burn, but close enough to feel the heat.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tomorrow,” she said softly. “We find out.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded, jaw clenched. Her voice was almost gone. “I don’t want to hope. But I do.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Rio whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     They didn’t speak again. Just curled around each other in bed, hearts beating in tandem, breaths matched like prayer. Outside, the city carried on. Inside, they waited, wrapped in quiet love, breathless with maybe.
    </p>
<p>
     The phone call came at 8:43 in the morning.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t touched her tea. Her hands sat motionless in her lap, cold despite the blanket wrapped around her. Rio answered the call with a calm voice she didn’t feel. Her fingers were trembling even before she pressed the phone to her ear. “Hello? Yes, this is she.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at her from across the room, bare legs curled under her on the couch. Her face was unreadable, except for the tight grip she had on her own wrist, white-knuckled, like she might float away otherwise.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes filled before the nurse had even finished speaking. Rio said only three words out loud for Agatha to hear, “It worked, Aggie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio crossed the room and knelt between her knees. “You’re pregnant.”
    </p>
<p>
     The words hung in the air like suspended breath. Agatha didn’t speak. She just placed both hands over her stomach, instinctively, protectively, as if it were already beginning to bloom beneath her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Say it again,” she whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, breath catching. “You’re pregnant. We’re going to have a baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s lips parted, and for a long moment, she just looked at her wife. And then she exhaled all at once and began to cry silent, open-mouthed sobs, not from pain, but from the pure, overwhelming weight of hope becoming real. Rio kissed her, soft and wet with salt. They kissed like they were underwater. Like every breath had to be borrowed from each other.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     They made love without a word that night. Not to celebrate, not even out of joy, but because Agatha’s body felt sacred in a new way, and Rio couldn’t stop touching her like she was carrying a star inside her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     She undressed her with infinite care, kissing each place she uncovered. Agatha lay back, hips arching slightly, eyes never leaving Rio’s face. There was a rawness in her, not hunger, not need. Just openness.
    </p>
<p>
     “I feel… full,” she whispered. “But not just in my body. In my heart.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her collarbone. “You’re full of life.”
    </p>
<p>
     She laid her cheek gently on Agatha’s belly, her breath warm against the skin just below the navel. Her hand rested low across Agatha’s hip, grounding them both.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you think they can hear us?” Agatha asked, half-teasing, half-hoping.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled. “I hope not. I’m not done worshiping you yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s laugh was soft and wet with emotion. Her fingers threaded through Rio’s hair, pulling her closer. “Then don’t stop.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Their movements were slow. Intentional. Rio’s hands mapped every curve with reverence, her touch saying I see you. I thank you. I adore you. She kissed behind Agatha’s knee, down her thigh, along the stretch marks that had started long before pregnancy. Every line told a story. Every inch of her was becoming something more. A vessel, a garden, a home.
    </p>
<p>
     When their bodies joined, it wasn’t about climax. It was about anchoring. About feeling each breath, each rise of skin against skin, as if memorising the moment cell by cell.
    </p>
<p>
     When they lay tangled afterward, hearts pounding in rhythm, Agatha whispered, “I don’t know what I’m more scared of, something going wrong… or all of this going right.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her temple. “Then we’ll be scared together. Every step. I’m not letting go.”
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha drifted off to sleep, Rio watched her with a hand resting lightly on her lower belly. She didn’t need to feel a heartbeat to know it was there. She could see it. In every flicker of Agatha’s lips. In the warmth of her skin. In the curve of her body, now home to something infinitely small and unimaginably precious.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled, kissed her knuckles, and whispered into the hush, “Grow safe, little one. You’re already so loved.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     It began in the middle of the night, not with pain straight away, but with certainty. Agatha sat up slowly in bed, the moon casting pale silver across the sheets, and placed her hand on the swell of her belly. Something had shifted. The deep, patient weight of carrying had tipped into something urgent.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stirred beside her. “What is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down at her with steady eyes. “It’s time.”
    </p>
<p>
     The drive to the hospital was quiet. Not rushed, just full. Like the whole world was holding its breath. Rio gripped the wheel with one hand, the other resting on Agatha’s thigh the entire way. Every red light was a meditation. Every turn, a promise.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not afraid,” Agatha said softly. “But I feel like the ground is moving beneath me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s okay,” Rio whispered. “I’ll be your ground.”
    </p>
<p>
     Labor came in waves. Hours passed like weather; rising, cresting, receding. Agatha leaned into each contraction like a storm she knew by name. She made no sound for the longest time. Just breathed. Just bore it.
     <span>
</span>
     Rio never left her side.
    </p>
<p>
     Between contractions, Rio pressed cold cloths to her forehead. Rubbed her back. Whispered into her hair. You’re doing it, my love. You’re doing it.
    </p>
<p>
     At one point, Agatha turned, sweat-slick and trembling, and said, “Tell me something beautiful.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her knuckles and said, “Your body is making a door. And someone you’ve never met is about to walk through it into our arms.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wept, but she didn’t break.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment itself came not with screaming, but with silence. A silence so complete it rang in the bones. And then finally a cry. Thin, piercing, alive. Agatha collapsed back onto the bed, tears streaming down her face. Her body shook from effort, from exhaustion, from the violent arrival of joy.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cut the cord with trembling hands. The nurses placed a tiny, damp-skinned bundle on Agatha’s chest, and everything stopped. A boy. Their boy. Small, perfect, breathing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down at him, lips parted in awe, as if she couldn’t speak or move. Rio sat beside her, one arm around her shoulder, the other resting lightly on their son’s impossibly small back.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s here,” Agatha whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s ours,” Rio said.
     <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
     They named him Nicholas, Nicky for short. A name that had come to Agatha in a dream and lingered like starlight. He had Agatha’s eyes. Rio’s mouth. A tiny birthmark near his collarbone like a thumbprint from the universe itself.
    </p>
<p>
     When the room dimmed and the nurses stepped out, Agatha leaned her head on Rio’s shoulder. “Do you remember the needle?” she asked. “The first one?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled softly. “I remember everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down at the sleeping child curled against her skin. “All that waiting. All that aching. And he was on his way the whole time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pressed a kiss to her temple. “And now you’re not just my wife. You’re the mother of our son.”
    </p>
<p>
     They didn’t sleep that night. They didn’t need to. They just held each other. And held him. And let the quiet miracle settle around them like breath.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The morning light in their living room was golden and slow, pooling across the hardwood like warm honey. Agatha stood barefoot, a cup of coffee cradled in both hands, watching the small figure waddling from couch to chair with uncertain determination.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky was one year old today.
    </p>
<p>
     His hair bounced with each uneven step. He wore a ridiculous paper crown Rio had insisted on making the night before, glitter glue and all. Agatha thought he looked utterly ridiculous and absolutely perfect.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s going to fall,” she murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     “He always falls,” came Rio’s voice from behind, wrapping arms around Agatha’s waist. “And then he gets back up. Just like someone else I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned into her, letting her head rest back on Rio’s shoulder. “You’re talking about me like I’m heroic. I screamed through thirty-six hours of labor and swore off sex for six weeks.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled and kissed her neck. “Still the bravest thing I’ve ever seen.”
    </p>
<p>
     They stood there for a long moment, bodies aligned, breath syncing like it always did. Through sleep deprivation. Through stretch marks. Through love that had shifted and deepened into something quieter but no less fierce.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned, setting her mug aside, and kissed Rio softly. The kind of kiss that said I still see you, even through the noise. Even through the nappies and late nights. And Rio kissed her back like thank you. For every version of you.
    </p>
<p>
     Across the room, Nicky toppled gently onto his padded bottom and let out a surprised “eh!” that made them both laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “You want me to get him?” Rio asked, already pulling away.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha caught her wrist. “Wait. Just one second.”
    </p>
<p>
     They looked at each other, forehead to forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     “No needles. No tests. No waiting,” Agatha whispered. “Just this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded. “We made it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Together they crossed the room, scooping Nicky up into their arms, wrapping their bodies around him and each other like a cocoon. Their family wasn’t loud or dramatic. It was quiet, and soft, and deeply, achingly real. And it was just beginning.

<p>
     Agatha Harkness didn’t do group activities. She barely tolerated dinner parties and loathed small talk with the intensity of someone who’d spent most of her adult life around people who quoted Camus and smoked clove cigarettes indoors. But she had promised her friend Sharon she would “try something with her hands” that didn’t involve red wine and muttering at books from the 18th century.
    </p>
<p>
     So, here she was, on a Wednesday evening, surrounded by folding chairs, newsprint pads, and the warm, vaguely chalky smell of a community center art studio.
    </p>
<p>
     The room buzzed with the nervous energy of amateur artists; students, retirees, and a couple of hipster types who clearly knew what they were doing. Agatha sat stiffly on a wooden stool in a black turtleneck, rings glinting under the fluorescent lights. She was the oldest in the room by at least a decade, and she suspected the most skeptical.
    </p>
<p>
     A woman next to her turned and smiled. “First time?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha offered a tight smile. “That obvious?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re holding the charcoal like it’s been poisoned.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked down. The tip had snapped. She hadn’t even noticed.
    </p>
<p>
     Then the instructor, a lean man with an overgrown moustache, clapped his hands. “Alright, folks! Five-minute warmup sketch. Our model will be doing short poses to start, then we’ll ease into the long hold. Please be respectful. Eyes on your page, not on their parts.”
    </p>
<p>
     A low chuckle rumbled through the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Then she walked in.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t see her face at first, just the way the robe moved, deep green and plush against the model’s rich tan skin. She moved like water, effortless. She climbed the platform, untied the robe’s sash, and let it fall.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart skipped.
    </p>
<p>
     The model was stunning. Slender but full, body curved like something carved from a dream. Her shoulders were strong, her hips wide and grounded, breasts full without being self-conscious. There was no coyness, no awkward shuffle. She simply existed in the space like she’d always belonged there.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, God, she looked up. Warm brown eyes. Sharp cheekbones. Lips full and slightly parted. She met Agatha’s gaze across the studio and held it. Agatha forgot to breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     “Begin,” the instructor called.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a shuffle of charcoal, paper rustling, and Agatha realised her fingers hadn’t moved. She swallowed. Looked down at her page, lifted the charcoal, well she tried to. But all she could see was her.
    </p>
<p>
     The model shifted into a new pose. It was only supposed to last two minutes, but it could have been an eternity. Agatha didn’t care. She would have sat there for hours just to keep watching her.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman lifted one arm overhead, twisting slightly at the waist, torso elongated, muscles catching the light in places Agatha had never thought to notice on another human being before. One leg was bent just enough to suggest motion frozen mid-breath. Her neck arched, exposing her collarbone like it was offering something.
    </p>
<p>
     Charcoal snapped in Agatha’s hand again. Too much pressure. She swore softly under her breath. But still, her eyes never left the model.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried to draw, really she did, but her hand couldn’t keep up with what she was seeing. No, feeling. It was less like rendering anatomy and more like transcribing reverence. Her lines were soft at first, hesitant, but quickly grew bolder. She shaded the curve of the thigh, the gentle dip at the base of the throat, the sharp definition of the jawline.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman, no, Rio, Agatha caught the name from a list on the clipboard by the door, was watching her too. It was subtle. The flick of an eye. A twitch of a brow. But Agatha felt it as acutely as if Rio had placed a hand on her chest and pushed right into her ribcage, right into something molten and ill-advised.
    </p>
<p>
     They were supposed to keep their focus on the drawing. Everyone else was doing that, diligently sketching forms and checking proportions. Agatha could feel the quiet concentration in the room like static in the air. But she couldn’t stop staring. And Rio, Rio was staring right back.
    </p>
<p>
     Every time Agatha glanced up to measure an angle or shade a contour, she was met with those eyes. Wide, dark, unwavering. It should have made her uncomfortable. Instead, she was buzzing with it, like her body had remembered something primal and important.
    </p>
<p>
     She tore her gaze away, forcing herself back to the page. The drawing was… not precise. Not academic. But it was intimate. Her marks followed the emotion of the body, not the science. The line of Rio’s spine was a river. The shadow under her breast was dusk falling over a quiet street. The curve of her lips, barely parted, was not just sensual, it was a question.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swallowed hard. She didn’t do this. She didn’t look at people this way, didn’t let them look at her this way. But Rio wasn’t just a model. She wasn’t just naked. She was seen, and she saw back. That did something to Agatha’s breath, her brain, her sense of reason.
    </p>
<p>
     “Switch pose,” the instructor called.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved again, slow and unhurried. One leg crossed over the other, one hand resting on her knee, the other lazily dangling off the edge of the platform. She licked her bottom lip - deliberate.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hand trembled. The page darkened beneath her charcoal. Rio’s lips curved. A barely-there smile. She wasn’t just modelling. She was playing. And Agatha was caught in the game.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ten-minute break,” the instructor called, clapping his hands with tired authority. “Stretch your fingers. Get some water. And please, eyes on your drinks, not on the model.”
    </p>
<p>
     Soft laughter rippled through the room. A few people stood, shaking out cramped hands, murmuring to each other about shading and proportions.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t move. She sat hunched forward slightly on her stool, charcoal still clutched in her fingers like a relic. Her page was a storm of motion and shadow, but in the center, an anchor. Rio’s body, caught mid-breath, mid-thought. Bold lines where Agatha hadn’t meant to be bold. Subtle curves that had come from instinct, not study.
    </p>
<p>
     She stared at the sketch, disoriented by what she’d made. It wasn’t just a figure. It was her. She’d captured something intimate, something alive. And she didn’t know how to feel about that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pretty bold for a first-timer,” came a voice, warm and low.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes lifted slowly. There she was, Rio? standing beside her in that same dark green robe, loosely belted at the waist, skin still dewy from the warmth of the platform. Her arms were crossed, and one shoulder peeked bare beneath the plush fabric. She looked amused. And she was definitely looking at Agatha, not just glancing. Studying.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked once, gathering herself. “Is it that obvious?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re holding that charcoal like you’re about to stab someone with it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced down. The stick had splintered. Again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled and took a slow sip from a stainless steel water bottle. Her throat moved in a long, graceful line. “You didn’t blink for ten minutes. I thought you might pass out.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was… concentrating,” Agatha said. “On proportion.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh-huh.” Rio leaned in a little. “You weren’t just looking at my body. You were looking into it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tilted her head, brow arching. “And is that a problem?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s a first,” Rio replied. “Most people either try to avoid eye contact entirely or sketch me like I’m a chair with breasts.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha coughed once, dryly. “Charming.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But you—” Rio gestured down at the sketchbook with a flick of her fingers, “—you drew me like you were trying to solve me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wasn’t trying to solve anything,” Agatha said. “You just… didn’t give me much of a choice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s smile deepened. “You talk like a professor.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Philosophy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “Of course you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha found herself smiling back. It was unfamiliar, this kind of lightness with a stranger. Especially one who had been very naked and very poised just minutes ago. But there was something magnetic about Rio. Not just her body, though that certainly didn’t hurt, but her presence. The way she took up space. The way she knew it.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a beat of silence. The buzz of the studio faded, a low murmur in the background.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m Agatha,” she offered at last.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s gaze didn’t waver. “I know.”
    </p>
<p>
     That made her pause. “You do?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio uncrossed her arms, stepping slightly closer. “I checked the sign-in sheet.
     <em>
      Twice.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched. “So you’ve been watching me,” she said, voice carefully measured.
    </p>
<p>
     “More than that,” Rio murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     Another pause. This one longer. Tighter.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s throat went dry. “More than that how?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes dropped, just briefly, to Agatha’s lips. “I was trying to imagine what your hands would feel like on something warmer than paper.”
    </p>
<p>
     The words landed like heat pooling in her stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swallowed. “That’s very forward.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m a model,” Rio said, one corner of her mouth quirking up. “I’m used to being seen. I’m not used to wanting to be looked at by someone in particular.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t know how to answer that. So she didn’t. Instead, she stood slowly, brushing charcoal dust from her fingers. Rio didn’t move back. Their bodies were close now, closer than was probably appropriate. But no one in the room seemed to notice. Or maybe they just didn’t care.
    </p>
<p>
     “I came here to loosen up,” Agatha said softly, half to herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned in, just enough for Agatha to catch the scent of her, something floral and grounded, like gardenias and skin. “Looks like it’s working.”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could reply, the instructor’s voice rang out. “Alright, folks! Back to it. Twenty-minute pose this time. Let’s find the form, not the fantasy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Too late, Agatha thought. As Rio walked back toward the platform, she paused and glanced over her shoulder. Stay after, her eyes seemed to say. Agatha sat back down, heart thrumming, and picked the charcoal back up.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The room was quiet again. Not silent, there were still the soft scrapes of charcoal, the shuffling of paper, the occasional creak of a chair, but quiet in that charged, reverent way that settles over people when they’re trying to capture something sacred.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took her place on the platform without a word. She didn’t resume the neutral, art-school pose Agatha had seen on the class flyers - the upright posture, arms folded, blank expression. No. Rio chose something far more deliberate.
    </p>
<p>
     She sat with one leg folded beneath her, the other extended, hips tilted at a suggestive angle. One arm braced behind her for balance, the other rested lightly on her thigh. Her torso curved like a ribbon of movement frozen mid-flow. Chin up. Back arched. The robe discarded entirely.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s fingers trembled before they even touched the charcoal.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was radiant in the golden overhead light. Her skin drank it in, turned it into something warm and liquid. The dip of her stomach, the stretch of her thigh, the high, proud lift of her breasts. Agatha didn’t know where to start. Yet, once she did, she couldn’t stop.
    </p>
<p>
     She drew as if possessed. Not by technique, she’d abandoned that entirely, but by instinct. Her hand moved faster than her mind. She didn’t measure. Didn’t check proportions. She felt the lines into existence. Every stroke was a gasp, a heartbeat, a whisper of the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t look away. Not once. There was something unsettling about it, being studied while studying, being known while attempting to capture, but Agatha found herself drawn deeper into it. Their eyes met often. Too often. And neither of them flinched.
    </p>
<p>
     It was electric. Reckless. Beautiful.
    </p>
<p>
     The heat built slowly, like water coming to a boil. Agatha felt it in the back of her neck, the hollow of her throat, the space between her thighs that suddenly ached for attention. Her hand didn’t slow, if anything, it grew bolder. She sketched the soft inner curve of Rio’s knee. The teasing fold of her hip where it met thigh. The weight of her breasts, held in place by posture.
    </p>
<p>
     The model was not being posed anymore. She was posing for Agatha, and Agatha was answering.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t care if the drawing turned out. She didn’t care if anyone noticed her flushed cheeks or the restless energy behind her breath. All she could think about was the way Rio looked at her. Like they were alone. Like they’d already touched, already kissed. Like they would.
    </p>
<p>
     “Five more minutes,” the instructor called.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha startled at the sound. She’d forgotten where she was. Forgotten the others, blurred outlines of people, not even relevant. Rio hadn’t moved. But her lips parted slightly. Her gaze sharpened.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha added one last detail to the drawing; the faintest shadow just below Rio’s navel. Not a sexual mark, but intimate all the same. Something too honest. Too real.
    </p>
<p>
     When the instructor finally announced the end of the pose, Rio didn’t get up right away. She shifted slowly, like waking from a dream.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realised she was holding.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood. Walked to the robe. Slipped it back on. Then she turned toward Agatha, and with deliberate care, mouthed two words: Show me.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s breath caught. She looked down at the page. At the drawing that pulsed with something private and burning. Then back up. She turned the sketchpad toward Rio, careful not to let anyone else see.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s reaction wasn’t loud. She didn’t gasp. She didn’t praise. But her smile faded. Replaced by something quieter. Awe, maybe. Or understanding. Her eyes lifted. Locked on Agatha’s. She mouthed again: Stay after.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     The room emptied slowly. Artists packed up their supplies with the quiet satisfaction of a session completed, some chatting, some sighing about sore hands or smudged lines, but all of it distant noise to Agatha. She sat still, deliberately slow. Like she had nowhere else to be. She felt the weight of anticipation settle over her shoulders like a warm shawl, a hum in her blood that hadn’t quieted since Rio’s last look.
    </p>
<p>
     Around her, stools scraped. Paper rustled. Someone asked the instructor about oil pastels. None of it mattered. Her fingers still tingled from drawing. Her thighs ached from sitting. And her eyes, God, her eyes were hungry.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, she heard the unmistakable soft click of the door shutting. Silence. Real this time.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned. Rio stood near the platform, robe loosely cinched, body still glowing faintly with the heat of posing. Her hair had fallen further out of its bun, dark waves skimming the nape of her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     They didn’t speak.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood, slowly. Her boots clicked against the linoleum as she walked across the studio, sketchpad forgotten on the stool.
    </p>
<p>
     When they reached each other, they didn’t touch, just stood close enough to feel the heat radiating between them, eyes searching.
    </p>
<p>
     “You stayed,” Rio said softly.
    </p>
<p>
     “You told me to.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, but it was laced with something vulnerable. “I wasn’t sure if you would.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tilted her head. “You undressed in front of a room full of strangers. But I scare you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t scare me,” Rio said. “You see me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t know what to say to that. So instead, she stepped forward. This time, there was no hesitance. Her hands found Rio’s waist, sliding beneath the open robe, palms warm against skin. Rio’s breath hitched, then she leaned in, resting her forehead against Agatha’s. There was a heartbeat of stillness.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached out and ran her fingers lightly along the edge of Rio’s jaw. “Tell me to stop,” she whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s reply was immediate. “Don’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     That was all it took. Agatha leaned in, and their mouths met, soft at first, testing. But within seconds, it deepened. Their bodies collided like they had gravity, pulling harder the closer they came. Agatha slid her hands into the robe, across the curve of Rio’s waist, until she was holding bare skin. Rio gasped into her mouth, tilting her hips forward, and the robe slipped free. She was nude again, but this time, it wasn’t for a room. It was for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped back just long enough to look at her. “You’re unreal,” she murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m real enough to make you forget your name if you let me,” Rio said, voice low and full of heat.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha surged forward, kissing her again; harder, rougher. Her hands roamed: over breasts she had drawn but now could finally touch, kneading them gently as Rio moaned into her mouth. She traced the line of Rio’s spine, the arch of her back, the way she trembled under every touch.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grabbed at her shirt and pulled. “Off.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stripped it off in one breathless motion, then the rest, shirt, bra, pants, falling away like paper. Rio’s hands were on her immediately, tracing down her torso, fingers dragging over ribs and hipbones and thighs with hungry precision.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha led her to the model platform. “Lie down,” she whispered, voice hoarse.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio climbed onto the table without question, spreading out like something meant to be worshipped. Her legs parted slightly. Her chest rose and fell in anticipation.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha crawled up after her, kissing her again as she straddled one thigh. Their skin met in hot, perfect friction. She ground down slowly, letting their slickness mingle. Rio whimpered and reached up to cup her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Touch me,” she said. “Please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slid her hand down, past the soft skin of Rio’s stomach, until her fingers found her center - already wet, already aching. She groaned at the feel of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened wider beneath her, her thighs shaking slightly as Agatha slid two fingers inside her with ease. The slick, velvet heat pulled a curse from Agatha’s lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck, Rio…”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s nails raked down Agatha’s back. “Harder,” she gasped. “Don’t be polite.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha obeyed. She thrust harder, curling her fingers just right, watching the way Rio’s mouth fell open in ecstasy. Her other hand found Rio’s breast, thumb circling her nipple until it peaked beneath her touch. She kissed her again, bit her lower lip, then moved down, mouth trailing over Rio’s chest, her stomach, settling between her thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha—” Rio’s voice broke on her name.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t pause. She licked slowly at first, savouring her salty but addicting taste, then faster, letting the pressure build. She worked in tandem - mouth and fingers together, drawing sounds out of Rio that echoed in the high-ceilinged room like music.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio writhed beneath her, hands gripping the edge of the platform, head thrown back. “Don’t stop—fuck, don’t stop—”
    </p>
<p>
     She came in a sudden, trembling wave, legs clamping around Agatha’s head, breath shattering into pieces. Agatha didn’t stop until Rio was twitching, gasping, dragging her upward by the hair to kiss her again. Rio could taste herself on Agatha’s tongue, musky with a hint of sweetness from the woman’s lips. Rio was desperate to get to try more of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio flipped them both over in one fluid motion so she was now on top.
    </p>
<p>
     “You too,” she whispered, sinking down between Agatha’s thighs. “God, I’ve wanted to do this since I first saw you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her mouth was warm, firm, relentless. Agatha cried out, her hips arching upward, fingers tangling in Rio’s hair. The pressure built fast, overwhelming, pushed higher with every flick of Rio’s tongue, every pulse of her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “God—Rio—”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shattered with a cry she couldn’t swallow, her whole body going taut and then slack. Rio kissed her way back up her chest and neck and mouth, then laid her head on Agatha’s shoulder, both of them breathless, sweat-damp, shaking slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     They lay there in silence.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, Rio spoke. “I should model for philosophy classes more often.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed, hoarse. “I think you just gave me a whole thesis.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled against her skin. “Title it: The Study of Obsession.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her temple. “Already begun.”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The studio was still dark when Agatha woke. Morning hadn’t yet reached the high windows. The only light came from a streetlamp bleeding pale gold through the blinds, striping the floor like a painting left unfinished. They hadn’t indented of falling asleep in the studio, but after several rounds and multiple orgasms each over the course of the evening, they were exhausted. The place smelled of charcoal and old paint and sex. Skin on skin. Sweat cooling on canvas. And Rio, still half-asleep beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t move. She simply watched her, hair fanned out across Agatha’s shoulder, an arm draped across her stomach like it had always belonged there. Rio’s breathing was slow and even. There was no tension in her limbs, no careful positioning. Just presence. Just being.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha exhaled slowly, as if the breath had been held all night. They were still on the modelling platform, tangled in Rio’s robe and Agatha’s jacket, a couple of drawing sheets crumpled under one elbow. The absurdity of it struck her: a philosophy professor and a life model sleeping together on the very table where hours before, one had posed and the other had fallen.
    </p>
<p>
     Because that’s what it felt like now. Not just lust. Not just the kind of sex you scribble into your journal and never speak of again. It felt like something had shifted - quietly, profoundly - and she didn’t know yet where it would land.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stirred. She blinked up at Agatha, bleary and beautiful, then gave a lazy smile. “Morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Barely,” Agatha murmured, voice thick with sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmm.” Rio burrowed closer, her leg sliding over Agatha’s. “We should probably leave before someone walks in and reports a crime scene of… intense pleasure and artistic recklessness.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed softly. “It wouldn’t be the worst write-up of my academic career.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head, eyes playful. “So you have had sex on campus before.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No comment.” She reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “But this… wasn’t what I expected from a life drawing class.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifted to look at her, more serious now. “You didn’t just look at me like an artist.” Her hand came to rest over Agatha’s heart. “You looked like someone who wanted to remember me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s throat went tight. “I do,” she said. “I will.”
    </p>
<p>
     They lay there for another minute, silence stretching between them, not awkward, not uncertain. Just full. Full of breath and thought and whatever lived in the spaces between two people when the world went quiet long enough to feel it.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, Rio sat up, the robe slipping slightly. She didn’t bother fixing it. “We should go,” she said, looking around at the scattered sketches, half-dressed mannequins, and lonely easels. “Someone’s bound to need this space.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood too, gathering her clothes with reluctant fingers. Before she pulled her shirt on, Rio stepped forward, gently took Agatha’s wrist, and turned her palm up.
    </p>
<p>
     With a bit of charcoal from the floor, she wrote a number, followed by an ‘R’. Simple. Bold. Like a signature.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled. “Confident.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her, slow and lingering. “Certain.”
    </p>
<p>
     They left together, still quiet, into the still-blue morning. The street was empty. The city hadn’t fully woken. But as Agatha walked beside Rio, their fingers brushing once, then again, and finally lacing without question, she knew something had begun. Something new. Something worth staying after for.
