<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>I am back again on my bullshit. I wrote the first chapter during a single work shift because I simply couldn't stop thinking about this story. It will definitely be longer and a bit more slow-burn than my last fic. Apologies if the characters are a bit OOC, I cannot really fit murderous witches into a rather domestic AU. So, sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the ride that will be watching two idiots struggle to fall in love...again.</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>The town of Westview carries a deep seated flourish to it as the summer comes to a near-end by the time August almost subsides. Sunlight beams down over the New Jersey hidden-gem, coating it to its entirety as the enormous star comes awake after a night of slumber sitting behind the moon. It's bright as townspeople flutter out of their homes, driving off into the sunset while bright yellow school buses make their round to pick students up. </p><p>With the break subsiding, it was time for schools to open back up. Returning students were anything but thrilled of being boxed into classrooms for another semester, but a small, rowdy first grader found himself smiling in the mirror as the day began. He poses silly faces before himself, jumping up and down to make his Paw Patrol shoes light up for the hundredth time. His mother disallows any shoes within the confines of the house, but he is far too excited to care. </p><p>The condo-complex is rather quiet, let alone for the boy who joyfully runs up and down the stairs. School doesn’t begin for another hour, yet his need to finally attend what he deems is ‘big boy classes’ is far too immense to calm down. He slides quickly across the living room and back, crackling his feet loudly as the wooden steps capture them. </p><p>He puts his hands along his forehead as she stares out the window, shielding himself from the bright sun. There is a loud howl of joy as a butterfly sits at the other side of the glass, flickering about with wings painted in green and purple. The boy accidentally knocks on the surface, and to his disappointment, it flies off right as it came. </p><p>“Nicky?” Upon hearing his name shouted from upstairs, the boy pulls back. He wants to stay there, to sit on the couch as he awaits his mother’s descent, but the soft yelps don’t stop. “Nicholas O’Connor, come here!”</p><p>“Coming, mama!” He shouts back. The six-year old rushes up the stairs, this time with an extra pep in his step. He makes his way past his own room, decorated to an almost obsessive extent with Spider-Man and Cars memorabilia, next to his brother’s. And upon reaching his destination, he jumps right on the queen bed dressed in white sheets with gray and yellow lines across it. “Get up! It’s time to go to school.”</p><p>“I can’t wait until you get to high school. You’re going to hate school,” Agatha giggles, only puzzling her son further. </p><p>“But school is the best thing ever!” Nicholas replies obviously. “We get to fingerpaint, go on the playground, and even go on fun trips! School is amazing, mama.”</p><p>“Yes it is, sweetheart.” His mother sits up against the headboard. “Did you get dressed all by yourself?” He nods proudly. “Good job, bubs. I’ll get ready in a second and make you some breakfast. What would the little prince like for his first day of first grade?”</p><p>“Hmm, I’m not sure.” Nick taps his chin as his mother rises from the bed, but never before dropping a sweet kiss atop his forehead and scuffling his wild locks. “Can I have pizza?”</p><p>“No way, kiddo. You need to be at least this tall to get away with that,” she marks off her own height. “Choose wisely.”</p><p>Once his mother is ready for the upcoming day, the two of them waltz down the stairs together. The woman cannot help but shake her head at her son’s whimsy. He pretends to be an airplane as she storms into the kitchen, nearly stumbling over the island chair’s. And while she takes notice of his shoes lighting up as he goes, Agatha refuses to burst his bubble. For once, she lets it slide. </p><p>“Can I have Mickey pancakes and apple slices?” Agatha cannot be more than happy to have a son who actually enjoys eating his fruits and greens. “And chocolate milk?”</p><p>“Hmm, let me think,” Agatha draws out her words as her son pouts. “Sure, honey. Go watch some cartoons while mommy makes your breakfast and lunch.”</p><p>The woman spends quite an intricate amount of time crafting the perfect breakfast, making sure to add extra ingredients for herself and the other young man who, she muses, will not be up until a few minutes before school is in session. From the background, she smiles upon the mixed sound of giggles and Bluey stemming from the living room. She realizes then, she would not give that up for anything.</p><p>Although in her mid-thirties and with no partner in sight, much less her soulmate, Agatha took it upon herself to make quite a life-changing decision. The original plan had been to solely adopt a small child to love and nurture as her own flesh and blood, but as soon as Nick came, so did Billy. The two of them were hers, children which she already had for five years. While the teenager had found it difficult to settle in the house at the young age of 11, with his new mother comforting him through it, he soon was right at home. </p><p>In three separate lunch bags, Agatha packs sandwiches loaded with turkey, veggies, and cheese with chips on the side. The sole difference came from her adding a small candy bar to Nick’s bag and a couple of dollar bills to Billy’s in case he grew hungrier during the day. As he goes through puberty, the young man has truly become a bottomless pit for food. </p><p>“Nicky, can you be a dear and wake your brother up? I’m almost done with breakfast.”</p><p>“I’m up,” an exhausted voice stems from the bottom of the stairs. There stands Billy, his backpack half-open, a complete difference from his brother’s that is neatly-made by the front door. He wears an oversized hoodie, the hood up, and a pair of black and red checkered pajama pants. “Hey.”</p><p>“Good morning, sleeping beauty. I can’t believe you’re up before eight o’clock.” Agatha chortles, but as she turns to the boy, his sleepy, serious face is enough to get her to stop. “Rough night?”</p><p>“I stayed up all night talking to Eddie on the phone. I was too anxious to sleep,” Billy mumbles. “Do I really have to go to school?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, kid.” Agatha places a plate of food before him, making sure to pour glasses of orange juice for the three of them. “You’re halfway through high school. Just two more years and complete your sentence. Besides, you got your license. High school gets a bit easier when you can have some small freedoms like that.” She takes a sip of the juice while standing before him, and eyes his black fingernails. “New color?”</p><p>“I got tired of purple, sorry,” he says, knowing the hue is his mother’s favorite. “I was thinking of doing multi-colored ones afterwards. Eddie found some inspo on TikTok that’s really cute.”</p><p>“I understood maybe three of those words,” Agatha jokes. “Nicky, baby, come eat your breakfast. I need to drop the two of you off before I head to work.”</p><p>She doesn’t want to tell Billy, but she spent quite a handful of hours throughout the week preparing his backpack for him. Ensuring he has enough pencils and pens, garnering binders in neutral colors she knows he will love, and even purchasing little snacks to hide in his belongings for him to munch on throughout boring schooldays. At his age, she knows how awkward such loving interactions may be, so she doesn’t push. Instead, she acts from afar, or sometimes behind curtains, all to make his adolescence a more pleasant experience than her own.</p><p>All that she wanted growing up and never received, she gives to her children. </p><p>“Can’t I take the other car and drive us to school?” Billy wonders. </p><p>Sometimes Agatha truly wishes she had not gotten a second car for the house, which unofficially is her son’s, as soon as she received his permit. And yet the glee it brings him is worth all the sneaking out at night. At least, she muses, he is respectful enough to arrive home at decent times before she begins to worry. </p><p>Nicholas zooms into the room and grabs the chair right beside his brother. While he attempts to hurriedly devour his food, it is Billy who urges him to pace himself and avoid a stomach ache. Being sick on his first day of elementary school would surely put a damper on him. </p><p>“Let me have this. Just for today?” Agatha pouts with raised eyebrows, and although Billy pretends to be annoyed, he accepts. “Thank you. Now, finish up, boys. I want to take pictures before I send you off to jail.”</p><p>“We’re going to school, not jail, silly,” Nick shakes his head. “Jail is for people who act naughty.”</p><p>But his brother, who mutters under his breath, does not share the same sentiment. “Might as well be…”</p><p>Once they have downed their respective breakfasts, the two boys ready themselves before stepping out into the door – their mother quickly follows. They stand in front of the car, hand-in-hand, and Agatha whips out her phone. Their smiles and positions are rather awkward, yet endearing for the matriarch. </p><p>In quick succession, Agatha snaps picture after picture – some with a serious Billy, while others have a silly Nicky making funny faces at the camera. She eyes them all with adoration, and cannot help but feel like the luckiest woman alive. There is a hole in her heart only a partner could fill, but she pushes it to the backburner. With her children by her side, she muses she has just about everything to live a happy life. </p><p>To them, the pictures may be meaningless, but for Agatha, they are a lifeforce. Ever since adopting the two boys, she has made photo albums each year – one of Billy, one of Nick, and another of moments the three of them share. There will come a point where they will both find their own ways. And while Agatha would never hold them back, if anything she would try to set them free for them to enjoy life by themselves, she will forever have the albums as a memento of the years they shared together. Where she takes care of them every feasible second before she abruptly stops. </p><p>It is a bittersweet aspect of life to humor, but part of her is thrilled to reach it – anything for her boys to find themselves in the world. </p><p>The schools are equidistant from her home and workplace. Agatha finds herself dropping Billy off first. As he grows older, his embarrassment only grows for everything related to his life. She understands. Hell, she was that moody teenager at some point. So rather than make a big ordeal, she hands Billy his lunch, squeezes his hand reassuringly, and lets him go. </p><p>“Everything will be fine, sweetheart,” Agatha promises. “Call or text if you need anything ‘kay? I’m right here for you.”</p><p>“Thanks, ma. Have a good day at work,” Billy turns to his brother. “You too, Nicky.”</p><p>Upon his departure, Nick follows suit. With him, Agatha takes her sweet time in dropping him off. She parks by the school, and as soon as she lets her boy free from the seatbelt, he bolts towards the building – his mom quick on his heels. </p><p>The two of them make their way into the school. At the sudden sight of a multitude of people walking across the hallways, Nick leans close to his mother, his hand clutching her own while another pulls his lunch box close to his chest. He is guided across the building, eyeing every small aspect of it, particularly falling in love with the colorful decorations around him, until finally coming to a stop before a classroom.</p><p>“Looks like this is it, buddy,” Agatha says. “Your homeroom. Do you want mama to come introduce you to your new teacher?”</p><p>“Please,” he begs, his hold on her hand only growing stronger. </p><p>Upon entering the classroom, the first sight Agatha catches is that of who she concludes is the teacher. She does not see the image of the woman previously created in her mind. If anything, there was an expectation she would be an older lady much like Mrs. Hart, another first-grader teacher Agatha had met when registering her son for school. But no, the person who stood there wore a loose-fitted black jumpsuit with silver jewelry covering her fingers and ears. The black nail polish, alongside dark eyeshadow, reminds her of Billy. But it is all accentuated by wild brown hair that is pulled back into a makeshift bun thanks to a singular pencil.</p><p>And as they are approached by the mysterious woman, Agatha finds herself at a loss for words.</p><p>“And you are…?” The teacher asks, looking down at Nick with a smile.</p><p>The boy waits for his mother to answer, but when silence comes, he takes it upon himself to speak. “I’m Nick. Uhm, Nicholas O’Connor.” He tugs at his mom’s hand. “This is my mom.” But Agatha doesn’t budge, and she grows quite frustrated. “Mama, where are your manners? Say hi to the nice lady.”</p><p>“Oh, right. Sorry,” Agatha’s head moves from side to side as she snaps out of her thoughts. “I’m Agatha, Nicky’s mom.” Her free hand is out in front of her before she can register the movement. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>“Likewise. I’m Rio. Rio Vidal,” the woman flashes her canines, shaking Agatha’s hand, before turning back to Nick. “But you can call me Ms. Vidal. It’s a pleasure to have you in my classroom this year, Nicky. Are you excited to start first grade?”</p><p>“My mommy says school is like jail,” Nicky states. “Are we in jail, Ms. Vidal?”</p><p>All the brunette can do is stare blankly at the body, all before falling into a fit of laughter. </p><p>“Not quite, cariño.”</p><p>“Sorry, I was joking,” a mortified Agatha reassures. “He’s a bit…impressionable. As any kid his age is, really.”</p><p>“No need to apologize, Mrs. O’Connor.” Rio, who bent down to meet Nick’s eyeline, gives the woman a reassuring nod. </p><p>“It’s Ms. O’Connor,” Nick is the one to correct. “I don’t have a daddy. Mommy says it makes me special.”</p><p>The grimace that appears over Agatha’s features can be seen from a mile away. She lightly pats her son’s back, ignoring the stares she receives from other parents that pile into the room. That had been one of her worries upon sending her children to school. Seeing all other kids having parents who were soulmates while they came home to a single-mother could not be easy. Of all people, Agatha knew that well. But alas, she tries her hardest and darndest to give them the most joyful life a pair of young boys could have. </p><p>All by her lonesome. </p><p>“You sure don’t, bud.” Agatha shields herself from the child as she mutters something to his teacher. “He knows he’s adopted but sometimes feels a bit out of place when he sees all his classmates have two parents. Just a head’s up.”</p><p>And to her surprise, Rio warmly nods with understanding. “Don’t worry, I’ll make sure he feels right at home in this classroom. Now, why don’t you go find your cubby and put your belongings there, Nicky? Make sure you say goodbye to your mommy first, ‘kay?”</p><p>“Yes ma’am!”</p><p>For the sake of professionalism and her son, Agatha throws away any images formed in her mind of the teacher. Instead, he pulls the boy aside, kneeling so she can take a long, deep look into his eyes. Brushing back his hair, the woman cannot help but smile. Five long years had passed since she adopted both of her sons, and she could not believe they had grown up in what felt like seconds. </p><p>“Make sure you eat all your lunch today, hon. And if you need anything, tell Ms. Vidal,. Alright?” He nods with understanding. “Good boy. Now, mommy has to go to work. I’ll be back before you know it.”</p><p>“I’m gonna paint you a pretty picture, mom,” Nick gushes as she throws himself at his mother for a hug she quickly returns. “Love you.”</p><p>“I love you too, kiddo.” A kiss is planted atop his head, but the woman cannot help but linger for a few extra seconds. “Have a good first day, my big boy.”</p><p>Leaving creates a deep seated anguish within Agatha. Another year, another growth spurt. Soon enough, Billy would be off to college and Nick would enter middle school. She blinks, and finds them already becoming fully fledged adults. It hurts, but by the gods does it fill her with contentment to see how far her boys have come. They have so much to offer the world, she realizes, and she will forever be there to have their backs – something her own mother never dared attempt. The cycle ends with her; she refuses to allow it to go any further.</p><p>Climbing into the car, the woman allows herself a second to breathe. Sitting there, she doesn’t have to be a mother, nor does she have to be an accomplished realtor with her own group. She is just…Agatha. With all her flaws, her fears, and loneliness creeping up. She could be weak then, but not with others around – much less her children. For everyone, Agatha needs to be strong with impenetrable skin. For herself, she can be a sluggish mess who can barely find enough strength to squeeze her steering wheel. </p><p>The small tattoo by her waist, in the shape of a crossroads rune, burns as she reaches her reserved spot at work. Most times she ignores it. The sole sight of it brings a wave of disgust she cannot easily push away. Agatha nears her forties, yet there is no soulmate in sight. The girlfriends she has attained through her life are parts of relationships which crumble under arduous pressure. And although she never admits it out loud, Agatha questions if there truly is someone out there for her. With her eyes flickering over herself through the rearview mirror, all that comes are doubts.</p><p>Perhaps she truly is alone in the universe.</p>

<p>There is a questionably busy inkling Westview carries day after day. The roads are packed with drivers urging others to make way to finally return safely to their homes. The rushes come early in the days and late in the afternoons around five o’clock when employees are freed from their duties. By the time individuals reach the safety of their four walls, the exhaustion is far too much as it overtakes them. All their hearts desire is rest before rinsing and repeating the process on the following day. </p><p>In the O’Connor household, as the month of September passes by, a routine is formed. Days where the sun fails to shine upon Agatha’s dampened mind, Billy takes it upon himself to drive his brother and himself to school, allowing her to spend a few moments of silence alone at home. She loves her job, but most importantly, she loves the flexibility it allows her. Unlike other townspeople, Agatha is able to spend her time, more often than not, out of the workplace. And yet, she often dreads going back to it. </p><p>She won’t admit it, but reasoning stems from those surrounding her. </p><p>“It’s almost time to go home,” Jen practically squeals. “What are you gals up to this weekend?”</p><p>The rest of the realtors chatter amongst themselves whenever they inhabit the office simultaneously – an often rare sight. Although her office door is left ajar and she is able to listen in to conversations spewing across the floor. At times she bereates herself for having such a large space for a miniscule amount of people, yet Agatha does her best work in the peace of it. The structure helps her focus. If she were at home, the woman would surely be lost in the comfort of it all to get anything done, and would never dare leave even for showings. </p><p>“How about you, Agatha? Any plans for the weekend?” It is Alice who poses the question. She won’t show it often, but Agatha thanks the other woman under her breath for always being sweet enough to include her. “Maybe a date?”</p><p>“I wish,” Agatha laughs, and as the others’ stares reel her in, she steps out of her office into the wild. “Just another weekend tending to the kid and making sure the teen isn’t sneaking off when he shouldn’t.”</p><p>“You need a break,” Jen is the one who pipes up amongst the small crowd of realtors. There are only about five on the payroll for neighboring towns, but all, Agatha has made sure, are the best at what they do. “Or an orgasm. The order doesn’t really matter.”</p><p>“You know I’m your boss, right?” Agatha crosses her arms over her chest. “</p><p>“And? My point stands. You need to go out there, make out with some lady – or a few – at a bar and maybe more. But you need you-time,” Jennifer exasperates, and those around her all nod in unison. “We can go to Cubbyhole in Newark. Lilia can watch the boys and you, Alice, and I can go out tomorrow night.”</p><p>“So we’re just drafting people into babysitting, huh?” Lilia huffs from her desk. There she lounges back, her reading glasses perched on the tip of her nose, while scrolling through her phone. At times Agatha hates Jen for having taught the older woman all about social media – now, that is all she frequents. “No one thought to ask the old hag to tag along?”</p><p>“Aren’t you banned from almost all bars in the area?” Alice asks, her eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>The sole response from Lilia is short. “And?”</p><p>There is a split-second where Agatha attempts to come up with any excuse to not go. That Billy is sick, or Nick has a tee-ball game. Yet, her mind is blank as she is put under the pressure of being stared at by her subordinates. So with a deep, long sigh, and a mental note of how badly she will regret it, Agatha nods. </p><p>“Fine, we can go,” Agatha sighs. The squeals that stem from Alice and Jen create a headache she will not easily rid herself of. “Lilia, do you mind?”</p><p>“The emo one is fun to play chess with, and the snot-nosed pest usually knocks himself down after a few hours,” Lilia mumbles, never looking away from the book. “Don’t worry, I’ll be there early so you have time to get dressed.”</p><p>The gray-haired woman often hides behind a wall of extreme confidence and coldness to hide her true nature. Deep down, Agatha knows of the warmth her heart exudes. And that if worst comes to worst, she would be the first to step up and nurture her boys. Lilia never had any of her own; she forever thanks Agatha for giving her the opportunity to care for Billy and Nicky from time to time. Even if in secret. </p><p>Jennifer turns to Agatha with a wide smile. “I’m going to get you laid before the year ends if it is the last thing I do.”</p><p>And while she fears the extent to which her employee will go in order to meet the goal, Agatha hopes for it to become a reality as well.</p><hr/><p>With each time Friday comes, a breath of fresh air follows. There is a serenity unlike any else which gushes through the town – hell, even the state. During the final period of the day, Rio takes it upon herself to project a movie for her students, who previously voted on it, so she can calmly relax as another week comes to an end. Parent-teacher conferences are the following week, and although it is not her first rodeo, the woman forever fears the different personalities she will bear witness to during those few hours. </p><p>“Mrs. Vidal.” The small voice shakes the woman from her thoughts. </p><p>“It’s Ms. Vidal, Nicky,” Rio corrects him with a warm smile – he is not the first nor the last student who says so. And although they hold no malice to their words, they serve as a cruel reminder of her loneliness. “What can I help you with?”</p><p>“Uhm, I can’t do my homework.” His eyes shift downwards as he clutches his hands together. Much like his typically shining shoes, Nicholas’ light flickers off. “I think my brother threw it out. Or ate it.” </p><p>“Your brother ate your homework?” Oh how difficult it is to not laugh in such situations, but the boy’s crestfallen expression is what stops her. “That doesn’t seem healthy.”</p><p>Nick feigns an exaggerated shrug. “I don’t know, miss. My mommy says teenagers are weird. Makes me never wanna be one.”</p><p>“Well, I am sure when you do turn into a teenager, you won’t be eating paper, sweetheart.” Rio rolls her chair closer to him; it is the most privacy they can have in a room-full of children excited to go home and not return for an entire weekend. “Can’t you tell me why you can’t actually do your homework? Is it hard? You know, you can always ask me for help, your brother, or even your mom.”</p><p>“I just…” Nicholas produces a folded paper he previously shoved into his pocket, hoping to have never seen it again. He unfolds it, and as he studies the contents again, a tortured pout spreads over his face. “I don’t want to ask my mommy. It’ll make her sad.”</p><p>A hand reaches out to grab the bent-up paper, and although he hesitates, Nicky eventually lets it go. This allows Rio to take in the piece. There is a family tree which proudly stands in the middle, even if partially faded. The only names scribbled on it are ‘Agatha O’Connor’ and ‘Billy O’Connor’ under the ‘mother’ and ‘brother’ sections, while one of the ‘grandmother’ sections has a shy question mark, which was angrily covered by the graphite from a pencil – the excellent spelling amazes Rio, but she realizes it is beside the point. The paper only breaks her heart, but she is sure the effect it has on her student is much worse.</p><p>“It’s just the three of us,” Nicky adds. “Mommy doesn’t like talking about grandma. Last time they talked on the phone, she yelled a lot. It made mommy sad for days. She tries hard to be happy, but I see her cry sometimes. It’s why I leave my bunny in her room. I think it makes her happy. Señor Scratchy has magical powers to make anyone smile.” </p><p>“I bet your mom appreciates that a lot, Nicky. More than she can say,” Rio reassures him. “You don’t need to add more to the tree. Sometimes our families look different from other people’s, but that’s okay. What matters is that you have people there who love and care for you. Don’t your mom and your brother love you a lot?”</p><p>For a moment, Nicky thinks, his finger tapping over his chin. “Sometimes Billy gets angry at me when I eat the candy he hides in his room. But it’s not my fault. He doesn’t hide it good. And mommy does it too!”</p><p>“Well, that is his candy,” Rio chuckles. “But just because Billy gets angry doesn’t mean he loves you any less. What about the drawing you made of the two of you this past Monday? He loves driving you to school.” She watches as Nicky slowly begins understanding. “Sometimes our family gets angry or sad at us, but that’s okay. It doesn’t mean they’re any less our family. And if your family only has three people, then so be it. That is still a family. Don’t ever doubt that for a second.”</p><p>At the reassuring words, Nicky’s face lights up. “That means Señor Scratchy is part of my family too. Sometimes he makes me angry when he falls off the bed, but I love him lots. It was the first stuffie my mommy got me when she brought me home.”</p><p>Oftentimes her family scratches their heads upon finding out she still proudly teaches first-graders. Her personality presents as the opposite when compared to other educators, yet, it is moments like these which inspired Rio to seek such a career goal in the first place. And she has found from students fawning over her dark classroom and intriguing attires, children quite love a black sheep – especially those who find relatedness in that. </p><p>“When you see your mommy get sad again, tell her ‘te amo.’ That means ‘I love you’ in Spanish. I’m sure she’ll be happy in no time after you say that to her.”</p><p>“Wow, really.” Nicky is amazed as his teacher nods. “Oh, Ms. Vidal?”</p><p>“Yes, cariño?”</p><p>“Since you know Spanish and all,” he pauses with a bright smile. “How do you say ‘fuck’? My mommy loves saying that word! It’ll make her sooo happy if I say it!”</p><p>And as the bell rings, Rio lets out the giggle she could never hold back; not the response a rather puzzled Nicky wants, but the sole one that comes. </p><hr/><p>When Saturday night comes, so do the insecurities. Hours upon hours are spent exasperatedly searching for the perfect outfit. Nothing too skimpy, yet not formal enough to repel any attention from herself. It has been quite some time since Agatha last actively cared for her appearance in such a manner. And she knows Jen would never let her live it down if she were to wear something rather…boring.  </p><p>Agatha settles for a pair of slacks she has not worn in ages, which are awkwardly tight around her backside, yet she is sure will draw attention to her. She pairs them with a loose-fitted button-up black shirt and black stilettos. A golden necklace and matching earrings set only help accentuate the look. But it is the puce-colored lipstick that seals the deal. </p><p>The woman is dragged off into the sunset after having bid her goodbyes to her boys and Lilia, who already made herself comfortable with a chessboard in the living room. To have such a village who takes care of her, and her own, never ceases to amaze Agatha. Especially considering how empty her connections were growing up.</p><p>In true fashion for her personality, it is Agatha who ends up alone, at the bar, with only a neat whiskey in her hands to keep her company. There are a few women she already chatted up, but are far too young for her liking. She has come to the moment in her life where even one-night stands are something she is rather rigid with in terms of choosing her partner. The last thing she wants is to guide some twenty-something year-old in how to properly manage themselves in bed. </p><p>Sighing, Agatha turns to her coworkers. It does not surprise her one bit to already see Jen getting rather frisky with a short-haired blonde, whose muscles are to die for, by the end of the bar. Meanwhile Alice takes up an animated conversation with a seemingly nerdy woman who swoons with every word spoken to her. Even if Agatha goes home empty-handed, she is joyous to see her friends finding others. </p><p>Taking a rather hefty swing of her drink, Agatha frowns when another is pushed her way.</p><p>“Oh, I didn’t order a drink,” Agatha flushes as she pushes it back, but god does her throat itch for the whiskey, her own already downed, she denies. “You must have the wrong person.”</p><p>“Some cute brunette bought it for you and walked off. She’s on the dance floor somewhere,” the woman behind the counter shrugs as she begins pouring another drink, but as someone catches her eye, she points. “I think…that’s her.”</p><p>Agatha turns to the dance floor. As soon as her eyes connect with another’s, the world stops. The music goes silent, instead replacing it with a loud, thumping sound that only grows louder in her head. The sight before her hypnotizes Agatha — she never stops looking.</p><p>There is a brunette whose hips shake round and round as she moves sandwiched between two other women. Although an inappropriate sense of jealousy befalls her, Agatha is far too mesmerized to tune into it. The warmth which takes over her body trumps whatever negative emotions she has for the women grinding against the brunette. Because whether she likes it or not, that image will forever be ingrained into her mind. Not that she complains. </p><p>A pair of warm, brown orbs meet her own icy blue ones. They mix together, fighting as the stare only grows more intense. There is a sense of familiarity in them, but Agatha is far too tipsy to put her finger on it. Besides, looking into them only inebriates her further. </p><p>Agatha is at a loss of words, swallowed whole by her active imagination — all for Alice to shake her awake. </p><p>“Hey, where did you go? You look like you got hypnotized.” The woman questions. “Oh, nice drink.” She raises her eyebrows. “Who’s it from?”</p><p>“Don’t know,” Agatha mutters, but her voice can barely come out from the loud music. She points her chin towards the dance floor. “What do you think?”</p><p>Alice takes quick notice of what her boss refers to and her eyes go nice. “Nice. Are you going to introduce yourself? Maybe more…?”</p><p>“I’m not making a fool out of myself there,” Agatha laughs. “But…maybe after a few drinks.”</p><p>There is not nearly enough confidence in her body to even move it. All Agatha can do is sit, stare, and lick her lips hungrily. She is famished for dessert, and the full-course meal she wants is not even available. But by the gods does it elicit a thrill within her she has not found in eons. </p><p>Drink after drink, Agatha, whose status as a designated driver switches over to Alice, grows bolder. She won’t remember it on the following day, probably not even later that night, but at some point she finds herself doing body shots off of a woman a handful of years her senior alongside Jen, whose state is far worse than her own. They giggle with one another, surrounded by a multitude of people similarly drunk off their minds. </p><p>And yet as a particular brunette shifts to the side of the bar, watching in awe, Agatha miraculously sobers herself in a second and inches forth to her prize. </p><p>“You look lonely,” Agatha slurs, her eyes practically undressing the other woman. “Maybe I can fix that.”</p><p>In their indistinguishable drunken chaos, the two women melt into one another. Her lips burn hot as they band together, sloppily moving in the midst of the bar. There are no prying eyes upon them, no interested parties gazing their way. No, it is just the two of them in the corner lewdly running their tongues over the other’s mouths for silent permission inside. </p><p>They make-out for what feels like ages, their hands feeling each other up through their clothes. Even when Agatha is eventually dragged off to the car to nap away her intoxication, she feels the fiery pair of hands over her hips still. And oh do they frequent her dreams as she passes out on the way home. </p><p>Upon awakening she does not remember the face of her counterpart, but the moment they share is one Agatha will never forget. </p><hr/><p>In the middle of the night, still wearing the outfit from earlier, Agatha is awoken by her door creaking open. She fears for a moment Lilia, who oftentimes when babysitting takes the guest room for ever, has been sleep-walking again, but when a wild head of hair rushes into the bedroom, the woman is able to sigh. Once more, she lays upon the bed and awaits for the boy to reach her.</p><p>“Nicky? What’s wrong?” Agatha sobers up as the kid throws himself on the bed, then promptly on her with a loud thud. “Why are you up so late, buddy?” </p><p>“I had a bad dream,” he whispers, already knowing of the bad headache his mother sports. “Sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t apologize, baby. Mommy’s right here.” Agatha ruffles his hair, pulling him much closer than ever. “Do you want to tell me about your bad dream?”</p><p>“No ‘cause you’ll be sad.” He produces the rabbit – which the boy often refers to as a bunny but is far too adorable to be corrected – that he often leaves lounging around his mother’s bed. “I don’t like you being sad. I have to be strong and take care of you the way you take care of me when I’m sad or when my tummy gets upset.” </p><p>“I never want you to worry about that, okay? It’s not your place, honey. Sometimes mama feels sad and that’s okay, but never feel like you can’t tell me something because of it. Mommy is a big girl who can take care of herself and her feelings,” Agatha reassures him. “Now, what’s wrong?”</p><p>“I had a bad dream about grandma,” Nicky’s voice is small. “She was yelling a whole lot. And she kept making you sad. But when I tried asking her to stop — asking her nicely like mommy taught me — I couldn’t speak.” He huffs and throws his arms up with frustration. “She never heard me, mommy. But I promise I tried real hard to protect you.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, sweet one. That must’ve been such a scary dream.” A hand begins rubbing itself across his back, gently lulling him into peace. In a handful of minutes, Agatha knows he will be knocked down. “But look at you. You’re so brave for telling me about it, and mommy is so proud of you for defending her. After all, it’s just a silly dream, huh? Grandma isn’t around to yell. She won’t make you feel scared. And you, little boy, don’t ever have to worry about protecting me. That’s my job as your mother, not yours.”</p><p>“Thanks mama. Te amo,” Nicky giggles. He sleepily nuzzles his face against the crook of his mother’s neck. “Mrs- I mean, <em> Ms </em>. Vidal taught me how to say it. She’s such a cool teacher. On Fridays she lets us pick a movie to watch before going home! Today we watched Cars. It’s my favorite movie ever!” </p><p>Truth be told, the boy has about nine favorite movies he alternates between every so often. He has her watch them alongside him constantly; Agatha already memorized the scripts to the fullest. And while she would love listening to him ramble on about the film, the strain her head experiences in one she wishes to rid herself off immediately. The poor boy still has not mastered his inside-voice.</p><p>“Sounds like first grade is a blast. Maybe I should go to school with you.” Agatha ignores the reaction the teacher’s mention has on her. The same warmth she experienced at the bar shoots through her. And those eyes…<em> fuck </em>, those eyes, haunt her daydreams. She will never escape them, but she only hopes to find them once more. To make them hers for one night only. But as she shakes her head, Agatha pushes it all back for the sake of her son. “Let’s get some rest, buddy. You need all the sleep you can get if you want to grow big and tall like your mama.”</p><p>“But you’re so short. I’m not going to grow like you. You never even grew,” Nicky nonchalantly states, eliciting a chortle from Agatha. “I’m serious. But Billy is sooooo tall. He’s, like, millions of feet tall! I wanna be like him when I grow up. He even has the coolest boyfriend ever! Eddie always buys me ice cream at Dairy Queen. Oh, Eddie is even taller!”</p><p>“Well, he needs to get me some ice cream too,” Agatha playfully pouts. The normalcy of her life is one she never attained growing up. One of her sons is happily in a relationship with a young man who, if she is being honest, at times she views as one of her own. While the other has no worries or care in the world – nothing but which ice cream flavor he will pick next him Eddie and Billy take him out that is all she has wanted to give them: peace. A peace she never knew. Yet, the cycle will stop with her, Agatha makes sure of it. “Now, now. Close your eyes, kid. Mama will be here until you fall asleep.”</p><p>And she never breaks the promise. Well, at least not until Nicky is snoring lightly, and with the minuscule amount of strength her drunk body carries, Agatha picks him up en route to his room. Amazement and mortification drive through her like a truck as she accidentally bangs his head on his doorframe, yet he remains fast asleep. He is something of a walking-Ambien that makes her jealous as she too wishes to have the power of sleeping under such duress.</p><p>Upon returning to her bedroom, Agatha takes her sweet time in undressing and throwing herself in the shower. The warm water washes away the stench of alcohol and replaces it with a sweet, vanilla scent from her soap. All she can do is stand there and let the sprinkling take her, before washing off any former insecurities into the drain. Even after what feels like decades of not embracing any potential partner, much less being intimate with them, Agatha is proud to know she still has ‘it’ – or whatever it is that let her sloppily make-out with a random woman at a bar.</p><p>She spends quite long minutes brushing her teeth, but blames it on the sluggishness so much alcohol elicits on her.  Her nighttime routine is one she thoroughly ignores, and instead opts to throw on the first pair of pajamas she finds and fall onto the comfort of her bed. Agatha has learned that, even in her most intoxicated state, she cannot allow herself to sleep in the nude any longer. Poor Billy has been traumatized enough for her to count. </p><p>Sighing, Agatha settles into a comfortable position for her long slumber. When the week begins again, she knows her life will revert back to the boring, stale manner it always has. Yet, with the night having brought her so much hope, the woman can only long for more thrills to find her. And if they come in the shape of a certain brunette she was too drunk to remember, yet remembers a familiarity to, then so be it.</p>

<p>The serene nature of days off is one which speaks to Rio. There is much chaos she endures, voluntarily so, throughout the week. Being an elementary school teacher has numerous perks, but the chronic migraines were rather tedious to deal with. Yet, for nearly ten years, that is all she has known. And if she were to be honest, quite the difficult ordeal for her, Rio would not want it any other way. </p><p>She sits atop the deck connected with her bedroom through a glass sliding door. With her feet up on the wooden veranda, the woman angles herself back, rolling her shoulders as a means to crack the bones against the chair. Her hands clutch a searing cup of coffee that she is careful not to let spill over her satin robe or green pajama pants – much less the slippers which were a Christmas present from her grandmother. </p><p>The birds chirp, and although annoying, she allows them to take over her mind. One which she leaves empty and desolate. From the small table beside her, she produces a pack of cigarettes. Rio buys fresh ones ever so often, but is lucky if she goes through more than five in a span of months. Only when her thoughts flare, getting the best of her, does she pluck one into her mouth before lighting up. </p><p>She cannot begin to phantom the night she had on the previous day. Whenever her busy schedule allows it, Rio barhops as a means to ease her stress. She is able to mindlessly make out with strangers as she is bought drink after drink simply for existing. The low effort it takes to find someone willing to be pleased for one night doesn’t phase her, and frankly, it isn’t something that excites her much anymore. If anything, she uses it to feel something else but her numbness. Oftentimes she is alone, without a soulmate, but on those nights, she pretends otherwise.</p><p>The problem comes in the form of a peculiar auburn-haired woman who incidentally — she remembered upon awakening in a yelping frenzy that morning and a hangover — is the mother of a student of hers. Rio muses the woman, who appeared a bit more plastered than her, would not remember such events. But although Rio was similarly drunk out of her mind, there was no way in the world she would forget about that. </p><p>Hela, her friend, had been witness to her exasperation through the phone. Even if a migraine has set itself for the remainder of the day in her head, Rio could not stop rummaging through the memories of last night. She needs to feel them all, in real-time, over and over. That way, she can bask in the thrill they brought her, one which she has not felt in eons. </p><p>The smoke burns through her larynx, crispening her throat that clenches at the sensation. Rio holds it back for a moment, inhaling the cigarette, torturing her lungs, before puffing it all out. The stench makes her scrunch her face. It is disgusting, she realizes, as the tar seeps into her nostrils. But by the gods does it make her <em> feel </em>. </p><p>Leaning back, Rio enjoys her short-lived peace before her phone buzzes. The ringtone is one that fills her with dread, and for a moment she believes to be safe once it stops, but eventually it rings again. Then again. <em> Then again.  </em></p><p>Until eventually her headache worsens and the poor woman, who humors throwing her phone off the deck, picks it up.</p><p>“¿Qué pasó?” Rio huffs into the phone. </p><p>“I’m going to let you try again,” the woman says through gritted teeth. “This time say it right.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio takes another puff of the cigarette. At this rate, she is going to need more than what remains to get through the conversation. “How’s it going, ma?” How are you?”</p><p>As Beatriz rambles on, Rio closes her eyes. She is not religious, yet prays that someone, anyone, can swoop her off such an arduous situation. At times she wishes she was able to perform magic so as to make herself disappear out of thin air — although, truth be told, sometimes she humors the thought that she might as well be a witch. </p><p>“How is work?” Beatriz questions, but Rio knows there is a hint of judgment lying beneath. The real question she wishes to pose is ‘why are you still doing that?’, but the older woman knows better. Last time she dared ask, Rio refused to speak to her out of fury – why would she wish to interact with someone who constantly talks down on her profession? A younger-Rio would remain as the doormat, but in the midst of her middle-ages, she knows better. </p><p>“It’s going well I suppose.”</p><p>“You know, you could always join your father in-”</p><p>“Stop.” All her life, she had been nudged into being part of her father’s law firm. Beatriz always says her daughter has a fire in her eyes that would do wonders in courthouses, with a high sense of justice, yet that was not a shared passion for Rio. “En serio, no te voy a hablar si me sigues diciendo la misma mierda.”</p><p>“You swear too much, nena.”</p><p>“Pues, lo tuve que aprender de alguien.” It had been her parents that she learned all her colorful verbiage from, but they would not be too happy to be told so bluntly. “I’m relaxing now, mami. Can I call you later?”</p><p>“You sound annoyed. More so than usual,” the comment earns her an eye roll through the phone. “Is it that weird lady you’re always around?”</p><p>“You think all my friends are weird.”</p><p>“Because they are,” Beatriz says. “Is it a lady friend?” </p><p>“You know, you can say girlfriend without having a heart attack, right? It won’t kill you,” Rio cannot be surprised, yet is often disappointed by her mother. “Listen, ma, I have to go. There’s something I need to take care of.”</p><p>The ‘something’ equates to herself. Once Rio bids her goodbye, she chucks the phone on the table, ignoring the small crack it gives out. A rather long, deep drawl of the cigarette is taken, one which almost has the small stick dissipating between the tips of her fingers. </p><p>Her headache doesn’t cease and by she becomes conscious of her surroundings once more, the sun is covered by maddening dark clouds. And the birds, well, she supposes it is best that they returned back home. They no longer need to witness the downed mess she becomes.  </p><hr/><p>Walking through the colorful halls of the elementary school, Agatha is amazed by every intricate, even if rather…childish, piece of art which surrounds the building. Near her child’s homeroom, she spots a watercolor painting she recognizes. In the previous week, Nicky had proudly flashed it to her before rambling on about how his teacher would hang it around the school alongside creations of his peers. She is biased, but Nicky’s painting is by far the most gorgeous of them all. </p><p>By the time she arrives at the empty homeroom, Agatha smiles. </p><p>“Knock, knock,” she says while mock-knocking on the agape door. “Am I too early or too late?”</p><p>“Well, considering you’re the only parent that has come see me tonight, I would say early,” the other woman giggles. “Welcome, Ms. O’Connor. It’s a pleasure to see it again.”</p><p>“Agatha,” she corrects.</p><p>“Yes, my apologies. Agatha,” Rio nods towards the chair before her desk, and although her counterpart cannot tell, there is hesitation upon her mentioning the name. “Take a seat. I hope it was no trouble finding a babysitter for your children.”</p><p>“Well, they’re at that age where the big one takes care of the little one,” Agatha shrugs. “A friend of mine only comes by if I’ll be back too late.”</p><p>The two of them settle into a comfortable silence. The sole sound comes from the ruffling of papers as Rio drags out Nicholas’ notes, ones she makes sure to write for each parent to have a detailed report on how their children are doing. And for the boy, Rio realizes she has written more than usual.</p><p>“Nicholas is doing very well. He gets along with pretty much all his classmates. And he is quite the little artist as I’m sure you have seen,” Rio begins. She brings out several drawings the small boy has made throughout the past few weeks, most of which have a variety of animals – the common denominator being a bunny. And rather than face the woman before her and be lost in her presence, Rio focuses on the task at hand. “The only thing that he had a bit of difficulty with was his family tree. He handed this in which is more than fine.” She shows off the paper with only three names written with blue markers. “I know it’s not my place, but I wanted you to know he did mention your mother. Apparently he doesn’t have very fond memories of her.”</p><p>“He mentioned something about that,” Agatha notices the faintly erased name under the ‘grandmother’ branch. “I didn’t know he was having trouble with this. Hell, I didn’t even know he was making a family tree.”</p><p>“Nicky does grow a bit uncomfortable whenever we discuss the topic of families in class. I’m not too worried, he is a great kid after all.” Rio has difficulty when it comes to disallowing her gaze from lingering over the woman. The beauty bestowed before her is far too immense to ignore. Although she mentally berates herself for it, she cannot help but follow what her heart wants. “But I always try to make parents aware of what their children experience in the classroom. </p><p>“I appreciate that,” Agatha throws her a smile, and Rio just about melts under it. Those lips…oh, she has not been able to forget them. But seemingly, the mother of her student cannot say the same. “I’m glad he told someone. Nicky does seem to like you a lot. He won’t stop saying that he loves me in Spanish. It’s relieving to know he is in good hands.”</p><p>At first she has trouble with a gnawing feeling at her chest, one which tugged much harder as she stepped into the room. There is no denying that Ms. Vidal is quite the sight for sore eyes, but her appearance is just…too close to home. Agatha frowns as her mind goes on the hunt for memories which carry the teacher. Although most are simply of the two of them sharing quick waves whenever she picks Nicky up, there is another that is rather faint in her mind. </p><p>And as her thoughts drift to that night at the bar, Agatha’s eyes widen. </p><p>“Oh my god,” is all Agatha can muster, but she doesn’t take in the grimace flashing over Rio’s face. “You were there. At the bar.”</p><p>“I was,” Rio whispers. Normally she would find herself to be quite proud of the rather wild night that was, but upon seeing clear manner in which Agatha is torn, her face falls. “We don’t have to talk about it. It was all a misunderstanding, Ms. O- <em> Agatha </em>. It won’t happen again and I apologize for that.” And yet, neither wishes to subscribe to such a notion. As they get lost in one another’s eyes, there is an animalistic craving for it to occur again. “If it’s any consolation, I didn’t remember who you were until the morning after. I can imagine you were just as drunk as I was.”</p><p>“One could say that,” Agatha shakes her head. </p><p>The sense of familiarity she has around Rio doesn’t cease. Not only does she know the woman through her child’s school, but there was…<em> is </em> something beyond that which drives the two of them together. She wonders if it has anything to do with the constant dreams she has had with the woman’s face plastered over them. They have barely exchanged that many words, still strangers to one another, yet she has a feeling in the depths of her gut that they know one another somehow. And maybe for once, Agatha will trust her intuition. </p><p>“Agatha, I have a strict policy against dating my students’ parents,” Rio explains. There is no policy, not really, but the last thing she wants is to potentially impair the relationship she has with her students – they are children, sure, yet deserve the utmost respect. “It’s not appropriate-”</p><p>“We should go get a drink,” Agatha, whose confidence suddenly grows as though she swallowed a whole bottle of tequila, interjects. “It’s premature, I know, but I think we both need it. And I sure as hell would love to further discuss <em> this </em>thing.”</p><p>“There’s nothing to discuss,” Rio lies through gritted teeth. Because as little information as she knows of the woman sitting before her, the messy auburn hair and titillating smile is enough to draw her attention further towards Agatha. She simply cannot resist it and wishes to give into temptation instantly. “I’m not sure we should be going on a date either.”</p><p>“It’s not a date, sweetheart.” Agatha cannot help the amusement that drives within her. She mused Rio would be more of a challenge, but turns out all she needs to do is tear down such walls. Maybe then can she get a further peek into the truth beyond the woman. “You look like you could use a drink. Or maybe twenty.” The irony doesn’t escape either of them. “I’ll be at Lucky 7 on Thursday night after seven. Don’t worry, I won’t drink until you arrive.”</p><p>Rio, who knows the tavern well, frowns. “How are you so sure I will?”</p><p>Agatha smirks at her. They both know. “Oh, you’ll show up. Toodles, Ms. Vidal.” </p><hr/><p>Upon her arrival at the home, a rather giddy Agatha was met with silence from one of her sons. She drops the cardboard box she previously held on the kitchen island, and quickly hugs the small boy who rushes to her. The woman holds him up, kissing his face regardless of how big he gets with each passing day. </p><p>“Hey, kid,” Agatha greets her other son who sits by the table, earbuds in place, engrossed by his phone. “Sorry I’m late, but I brought you some pizza.” She gives out a soft smile” How was school?” </p><p>“It was okay I guess,” Billy shrugs. Ever since he began high school, that was the go-to response for just about every question. “Thanks, Agatha.”</p><p>As Billy goes up to grab a slice of pizza and dunk it into a plate, his mother freezes. She cannot remember a time where he willingly referred to her by her given name. Even when she first adopted the boy, he took quite quickly to calling her ‘mom’. Hearing him stray from such an honorific pangs at her heart. </p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha tries to upkeep a lighthearted tone as she drags Nicky to the kitchen to serve him a slice of the cheesy goodness. “What happened to ‘mom’?</p><p>“Well, Agatha is your name, right?” Agatha hesitantly nods, she doesn’t like where this is going. Especially not with the nonchalant tone Billy has. “Why can’t I call you by your name then?”</p><p>“Because I’m your mother,” Agatha doesn’t mean it, but there is a certain flair to her voice. “I don’t refer to you as ‘teen’. You are my kid; my <em> son </em>.” </p><p>“Whatever.” He pushes the plate of food away. The pizza is untouched as he waves her words off, shifting towards the staircase with a serious look on his face. “I’m not hungry anymore. Goodnight.”</p><p>There is a sense of anger at the dismissal of her words, but it is trumped by the worry that seeps into her chest. The boy has been quiet as of late, and while she has wished to question him about it, each time he brushes her off. Yet, Agatha never expected it to reach a point where her own son would find discomfort in referring to her as his mother. </p><p>“Hi, Agatha!” Nicky giggles between a bite of his pizza. “Thanks for the pizza, Agatha.”</p><p>“Not you too, kiddo,” his cuteness is enough of a palette cleanser to make the woman shake off any pain she feels at her other son’s cutting words. “It’s mom, not Agatha.”</p><p>“I’m just being silly,” Nicky shakes his head. “I know you’re my mommy, duh.”</p><p>“Duh?” She finds herself chortling at his sweet tone. </p><p>The boy can never do any wrong, she knows. Even if they are not biologically related, he often takes after his brother. Billy can do no wrong either, Agatha is sure of it. At times, and during the uncharted waters that is his adolescence, he strays from his paths. But she is sure it is all but a momentary lapse of judgment for his part. And regardless of what he vocalizes, his mother knows him best – it is not how he truly feels. There is no denying his words hurt, but Agatha is sure in due time she can heal from them. </p><p>“Some kid at school taught me how to say it! His name is Tommy or something. He is always running around the classroom and drives Ms. Vidal crazy,” Nick proudly states. “Duhhhh.”</p><p>“Okay, buddy. Let’s sit back down and eat your food,” she feigns a stern tone as she points for the boy to return to his previous position rather than stand atop the chair. “It’s the only time of the week I’ll let myself be a subpar mama.” </p><p>With his mind correlating pizza for dinner and the newfound word together, he beams. “You’re always a subpar mama, it’s what makes you awesome!”</p><p>“Oh buddy. Never change.” Agatha gently pats his back as she takes a seat beside the kid, taking Billy’s forgotten plate for herself. “Do you know what’s got your brother in such a foul mood?”</p><p>“Beats me,” the kid shrugs. “Teenagers, amirite?”</p><p>In a truly surprising fashion, Agatha decides Nicholas is the most normal out of the three people living in the household — that’s saying something. He forever carries out the same childish behaviors as can be expected. And if he ever lets a bad mood get the best of him, he is lucky if it lasts longer than ten minutes. </p><p>“Right,” she mumbles through the food. “Hey kid, what do you really think of Ms. Vidal?”</p><p>Because if Agatha is being honest, all her thoughts are consumed by the woman – how lucky for her. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The day before such a casual request to go out for drinks was made, Rio gnaws at her bottom lip, already madly bruised, wondering whether to accept or not. A sleepless night has found itself to not be fruitful. There is a side of her, a wild one she has loosely clung to since her youth that wishes to accept no questions asked. But the mature side, the one her mother drilled into her since childhood, knows nothing good will come from it. </p><p>Well, at least she hopes not. Maybe then it will become easier to decline any advances made by Agatha. A woman who has deliciously overtaken her subconscious. </p><p>With a warm bowl of leftovers from yesterday's dinner in tow, Rio makes a beeline for her classroom. She is still rather new at the district and has yet to find any connection with her fellow educators. They are mostly older than her or fresh out of university – no in-between. So rather than torture herself by spending her only break through the day in the teacher’s lounge, the woman often opts to eat by her lonesome.</p><p>What she does not expect is to find an intruder taking over her serene hiatus from teaching. </p><p>“Nicholas?” The woman frowns as she steps into the room. The first sight she sets her eyes upon is that of a boy casually eating from his lunchbox in front of the room. She cannot help but smile at the Cars design of it – surely, she muses, he pestered his mother far too much for all his belongings to resemble the peculiar red car with a dashing smile. “Why aren’t you in the lunchroom?”</p><p>But all Nicky does is shrug. And Rio, who has gotten to know her students all too well, understands. The boy knows, but it will take quite a bit of work to pry it off him. He is rather extroverted, but when shyness takes over, it subdues him fully into a silent mess. Perhaps she can work with him, as she does with many of her students, to push him out of his shell. </p><p>“Can I stay here?” He wonders even if he has been given no orders to leave. “The lunchroom is…too loud.”</p><p>“Just for today,” Rio explains. She takes a seat on her desk, relaxing on the comfortable chair before digging into her meal. Although, frankly, her true hunger comes in the shape of seeking knowledge, not food. “So, all these days the lunchroom has been quiet and today it’s loud? That’s interesting.”</p><p>“Yup,” is all the boy says as she downs his chocolate milk. “And Tommy was being gross. He keeps sticking boogers under the table no matter how much Mrs. Hart tells him to stop. It makes my tummy feel bad when he does that.”</p><p>“That is pretty gross,” Rio concurs. “You know, you and Tommy get along very well. Maybe you can help him stop. It might be better if it comes from one of his friends than Mrs. Hart.”</p><p>“I pinky promise I will try to tell him, Ms. Vidal.” As he downs another bite of his sandwich, Rio notes the boy is careful not to speak with his mouth full – Agatha must have done wonders to raise him to be so well-behaved. She can only assume Billy has a similarly lax personality. “Mommy can talk to his mom too. They used to be really good friends.”</p><p>That is a conversation Rio knows better than to dip her toes in. She ignores the comment, but most importantly, she shoves down the green monster that lies beneath. Never had she seen Wanda Maximoff and Agatha interact, but now, she simply cannot get the image to leave her mind. There is an implication under the words that Nick doesn’t catch, but oh does Rio notice. </p><p>The two of them sit in silence, let alone for a few random comments made by the student. Throughout her entire career, there were only a few times when children this age remained quiet during such an elongated period of time. So as Nicholas settles comfortably and finishes his lunch, she decides to find an appropriate opening into his mind. </p><p>“Can you tell me why you’re really here, sweetheart?” Rio wonders aloud. Lately she has seen a pair of third-graders flocking around young Nicholas mirroring a flock of hawks. She has been careful to pull the boy aside when necessary, but does not intervene much when her power lacks. She refuses to lose her job, but most importantly, she refuses to allow one of her students to be intimidated. “Michael and Edward can be a bit intense, huh?”</p><p>“Guess so,” Nick mumbles. </p><p>“Are they the reason you don’t want to go to the lunchroom anymore?” But she knows the answer already given the boy’s crestfallen features. “If they are being mean to you, I can help.”</p><p>“They’re not being <em> that </em> mean. We were all playing tag during recess last week and they…dunno.” While Nicholas is typically full of life, he can barely muster a smile at her. “They thought my shoes were dumb. I got them for Christmas last year. Santa knew I really wanted them, and even Billy says they look awesome. But <em> they </em>said my shoes look dumb.”</p><p>It isn’t until now that Rio realizes the shoes he wears pale in comparison to the light-up ones she typically dons.</p><p>“It’s okay, Nicholas. I can talk to them,” Rio nods in the boy’s direction. “Besides, I think your shoes are amazing. I wish there were light-up shoes for grown-ups. I would be wearing them all the time.”</p><p>“I’ll talk to them, Mrs. Vidal. I just didn’t want to be there today,” Nicholas says, his features suddenly growing softer. “Mommy always tells me it isn’t good to talk if I’m too angry because I can say something to hurt someone’s feelings. Mike and Ed are really cool. I don’t want to be a meanie just because they sometimes are. Otherwise Santa won’t bring me any presents this year!”</p><p>“I can help you write them a letter if you’d like. That way you don’t have to worry about saying anything mean to them, but you’ll still be able to stand up for yourself.” She takes the final bite of her lunch. Even if, after eyeing the clock, she knows the bell for recess will ring at any given time, the woman is happy enough to lend a helping hand to one of her students. Perhaps this is the only way to get his mother out of her mind. “How does that sound, Nicky?”</p><p>“It’s awesome!” He throws his fists up in the air out of joy. “You’re the best, Ms. Vidal.”</p><p>And while Rio cannot agree with the compliment, she happily takes it regardless. </p><hr/><p>When Thursday comes, Agatha finds herself nervously fiddling with the straw of her glass, topped with rum &amp; coke, and alone at the bar. She settled on the edge of it, far away from the rest of the drunken population focused on whatever basketball team plays on the televisions. But her mind is elsewhere, ignoring the constant chanting within the locale and instead boring her eyes into the melting cubes of ice. </p><p>“Sorry I’m late,” a voice suddenly sounds, happily snapping her from her thoughts. There was no doubt Rio would materialize herself, especially after the rather risqué moments they shared while under the influence of both lust and alcohol. “I ran into a bit of traffic.”</p><p>It has a white lie, but Agatha doesn’t need to know that for the better part of the afternoon, Rio shuffled through her closet in search for the perfect outfit – a true mixture of elegance and raciness. The burgundy shirt is unbuttoned low enough to give off a smidge of a peek of her black lacy bra, while her tight pants run down past her ankles, with feet covered by sharp stilettos. The sight is truly one for sore eyes, and true to her purpose, Rio is amazed to find a pair of blue orbs gawking at her. </p><p>“Someone sure cleans up nicely,” Agatha cannot help but whistle. “All I had time to do was touch-up my hair and make-up.”</p><p>“And as simple as that was, you still managed to look this gorgeous. My, you are a natural beauty, O’Connor,” Rio shoots back with raised eyebrows. “But you look…tense.”</p><p>“I saw my ex…<em> best-friend </em> shortly before you arrived. There is nothing left to resolve, but I can’t help but feel a bit awkward here,” Agatha turns, and from the edge of the bar she catches a glimpse at Wanda, who sultrily waves back. “Heh, what are the chances we end up living in the same shitty town?” </p><p>“Maybe the universe is telling you something,” Rio says, but the venom in her voice is palpable. She turns green, finding herself questioning her own motives. Why? Why does she feel a sense of ownership over another who she has just met? And as her eyes come in contact with Wanda’s from across the locale, she frowns. Yet, Agatha is as oblivious as ever. “What if she is your soulmate?”</p><p>The words that are spat feel wrong, but Rio won’t tell her that. </p><p>“Oh, honey, that ship sailed a long time ago. I’m more than certain she’s not my soulmate.” The only way to have known that is to show off one another’s markings, but Rio shakes her head at the sole thought. She doesn't want to humor it. Never again. “Besides, my sights are set on someone else. Someone who has really caught my eye in a short amount of time.”</p><p>“What a lucky lady she is to have all your attention to herself,” Rio beams. “Careful, sweetheart. You might not be able to keep up.”</p><p>But all Agatha does is cackle. “That really should be the least of your concern, Vidal. Now, why don’t you tell me a bit about yourself?”</p><p>The two of them share one or two drinks throughout their conversation. The small bits of alcohol are enough to grant them each elongated confidence while not inebriating them. Their conversation is rather fluid with them growing fonder for the other as seconds pass. It is natural, a bond forming as though it has existed there forever. Neither is quite sure why or how, but the comfort they experience with the other around is rather relieving. </p><p>They grasp a good look at one another, and while Agatha sees herself as nothing but a lowly single-mother, there is a perfection which Rio finds to that. The auburn-haired woman lives her life for others. Hell, she put a complete stop to it early in her thirties to adopt a pair of young boys as her sons. And since then, these past five years have been fully devoted to them. She doesn’t consider herself a helicopter mother, something she finds relief in, yet Rio notices the true passion she has for raising her children to be truly adequate members of society. And that, she knows, is rather busy work; one she has never found herself in, yet admires from afar. </p><p>The beauty that Agatha holds goes beyond that of her appearance – one which, if Rio is frank, is quite the bonus. But there is much more that lies beneath the facade the single-mother puts up. She is broken, Rio can tell. A woman without a home who instead compensates by giving her all to others; something she was never lucky enough to receive growing up. The crude demeanor she sometimes presents, with over-exerted confidence and at times sarcasm, protects the soft heart which rests deep inside. Rules be damned, Rio will find it at some point. </p><p>Rio may not have a soulmate either, but Agatha comes damn close to giving her the adoration she has craved for so long. </p><p>“Nicky tells me you have another son,” Rio nonchalantly mentions. </p><p>“Billy,” Agatha replies, a hiccup escaping her mouth before she continues. “He’s 16 so, uh, he can be a lot. But he’s a sweet kid, really.”</p><p>“Rough age,” Rio mumbles as she takes another swing from her beer. “With a young kid as well? How do you survive? You must be superhuman.”</p><p>“Perhaps I am a witch or perhaps I get drunk every-so often and remember life is worth living.” </p><p>Rio licks her lips eagerly. “Touché.” </p><p>Brown orbs find ocean ones. They make a steep decision and opt for drowning in them, forever being washed away by crashing waves which hold Rio hostage. But by the gods does she enjoy willingly allowing herself to be devoured. Her heart has never been so content. And her lust similarly rises in a never-before-seen manner. </p><p>“You have beautiful eyes,” Rio cannot help but comment – she is unsure if it stems from her soul or that of the alcohol shooting through her veins. Regardless, they are chalcedony. That is what such hypnotizing eyes remind her of. “They’ve casted a spell on me.”</p><p>“You do too,” Agatha swallows the knot in her throat before speaking again. “They look…familiar.” She shifts her gaze to the woman’s lips. “So much of you feels familiar, actually. And not just because we made out in a sleazy bar.”</p><p>They sit in silence with the remembrance of the moment, even if slightly faded, looming before them.</p><p>“So, Cubbyhole, huh?” Rio is the first to break the silence. “I go over to Newark for the sole purpose of not running into anyone I know, but of course that doesn’t stop one of my student’s mothers from finding me.” </p><p>“I’m just magical like that.” Agatha shrugs. “We don’t have to talk about it. I was just afraid you were too drunk to remember anyone making out with you.”</p><p>“Oh, I want to talk about it. I actually haven’t been able to stop thinking of it,” Rio confidently states, she only hopes the same goes for Agatha. “It looks like you’re on the same boat. So tell me, Agatha.” She leans dangerously close, her hot breath panging at the other brunette’s ear. “What do you do when you drunkenly make-out with your son’s teacher at a bar?”</p><p>“Make sure the opportunity repeats itself,” she brazenly responds. “Wouldn’t you?” </p><p>“Hm, perhaps I would.” </p><p>“It’s nothing that can’t be arranged.” Agatha’s eyes zero onto the plump lips residing only millimeters from hers. “It would be a shame to let go of such a beautiful-”</p><p>But the sound of her phone desperately ringing interrupts her, and before she can find it in her to huff in annoyance, it is Billy’s voice which seeps through the device.</p><p>“Hey,” he whispers as he drowns in a fear that piques at Agatha’s curiosity. “Can you come pick me up? It’s an emergency.” </p><hr/><p>Anger does not come easy in her mind. If anything, a momentary lapse of frustration of constant annoyance befalls from time to time. But a full-blown fury, one which leaves her cheeks tinted with red as she howls off into the universe, does not often occur. Agatha considers herself quite the content person let alone for her lack of a soulmate. Even if she does not receive such affection in return, she can always offer a different type of it to her children. </p><p>And yet it is a child of her own which creates such a devil in her that night she returns home. </p><p>“You left your brother alone?!” Agatha yells. “Are you fucking kidding me?”</p><p>“I didn’t leave him alone,” Billy shoots back with an irritation that drives Agatha mad – yet it is one he gets from his mother. “Mr. and Mrs. Barton were happy to take him in for an hour or two until I came back.”</p><p>“Well, you didn’t come back. So where does that leave us?” By then, she is grateful to have held her fury in long enough before letting it seep out with Nicholas still awake. But once she put him to bed, it was time to let Billy have it. “I wasn’t even gone for two hours and you managed to get yourself arrested. What a record-breaker you are. What’s next? You’ll commit a felony while I sleep?”</p><p>“You’re hysterical,” Billy growls. “I can’t talk to you like this.”</p><p>“Excuse me, mister, but I just bailed you out of lock-up so you have no other choice. You either talk or I send my little delinquent back.” Agatha knows that after having paid the $500 fine to release her son for the night, she cannot simply return him. But under the wrath that exudes her body, she cannot help the words that escape her mouth. Perhaps Billy is right; it may be for the best to cease the conversation until she calmed herself down. But after having left a ‘date’ early to find him in lock-up, she cannot control herself. “So which is it?”</p><p>“You’re clinically insane.”</p><p>It takes all of Agatha’s will to not break something at that moment, but she muses that stooping to her mother’s level would be too low. “The officers said they found pot in your friend’s backpack.”</p><p>“They don’t even call it pot anymore, Agatha.,” Billy rolls his eyes, arms crossed over his chest. </p><p>“I don’t give two shits what they’re calling it.” Agatha stands tall before him. She refuses to let him rebel in a similar destructive manner she did as a teenager. Lucky for Billy, he at least won’t be kicked out of the house regardless of the tumultuous stupidity. “Are you smoking or not?”</p><p>“You tell me, Agatha,” he shot back with venom in his tongue. “Since you know everything.” </p><p>“Have it your way. I’m grounding you for three months. You’ll only be using the car to take you and your brother to and from school. No more sneaking out with Eddie in the middle of the night.” The comment makes Billy’s eyes widen. She can afford to pay whatever the principal asks for, but the same cannot be said for affording her son’s suddenly cruel behavior. “Oh, I am well-aware of that, mister.” </p><p>“Fine, Agatha. Whatever you want.”</p><p>“Whatever I want? You got in trouble for spray-painting your principal’s car and his home. It’s not what <em> I </em> want, it’s what the law wants, you little crook. Just last week we were fine and overnight you decided to become a criminal and be an ass to your mother.” Agatha begins pacing, because otherwise she knows the fury will cause her a brain aneurysm if left untreated. “And what the hell is up with you calling me ‘Agatha’ all of a sudden? Oh, let me guess. Big, boy Billy is too cool to have a mom anymore.”</p><p>“Well, maybe I am,” Billy yells back, his hands squeezing themselves into fists. “Maybe you should’ve never adopted me. My real mom would never treat me like this.”</p><p>The words make her stop dead in her tracks, and even Billy, who covered his mouth, realizes how royally he screwed up. </p><p>“Your <em> real </em> mom?” She tries to be angry, but all that comes out is a small, pained tone. Agatha shakes her head as she faces away from her son — her <em> real </em> son. There is enough left unsaid, but she drops it. Much like her shoulders drop as she begins gliding towards the stairs. “Get some rest, Billy. We’ll talk tomorrow.” </p><p>“Wait, no-”</p><p>But by then, Agatha already makes her way into her room, calmly closing the door behind her before breaking down against it. She makes no noise, none which the rest of the house can hear anyway. But that night claims to be her most painful one yet. None of the torture her mother inflicted on her comes close to the searing pain that wedges itself into her heart. </p><p>Once again, Agatha is left vulnerable and alone; just like when she came into the world. </p>

<p>The sunlight beams down with its mocking persona through the cracks of rigid blinds. It shifts as the sun does, and soon enough the natural source covers the entirety of a sleeping face whose features scrunch at its presence. Long hours during the nightfall had been spent muffling cries through bedsheets ridden with tears and snot. Not quite a beautiful sight, especially not when compared to the majestic manner in which the sun awoke her. But it was necessary.</p><p>Although now, as her eyelids struggle to open, Agatha wishes to have been granted a couple more hours of downtime. Her ‘super-mom’ facade falls flat on her face as she groans into her pillow. None of her limbs find any energy to move. Frankly, she cannot be bothered. Part of her hopes her children are fine to fend for themselves, but she knows better. Nicky could survive for maybe a week off of just cereal, but Billy is quite useless without his mother. </p><p>Normally her mornings consist of a rather tedious routine for both her own sake and that of her children. The last thing they should witness is their mother angrily running about mirroring that of a monster – something she quickly turned to if she missed her morning coffee. She was used to waking up in the early hours of the morning more often than not, but of course, there are always days where Agatha struggles so much as to lift a finger. </p><p>Eventually, the woman pushes herself off the confines of her sheets. A zombified version of her forgoes the slippers and instead opts to camp out in the bathroom until she finds the energy to brush her teeth. She knows Billy is struggling. Hell, if anything, she expected it from the beginning. It cannot be easy to have been given away after having developed as a child to a complete stranger. And while the reality of such a situation had not hit him then, she wonders if he is coming to terms with it now. </p><p>Wrapping a black satin robe that pools at her feet around her body, Agatha makes a beeline to her door. She refuses to go into work and deal with her employees’ constant positivity today – even if it could prove to be beneficial. So instead, she opts to carry on her work in the safety of her study. It is on days like these that she gives herself pats on the back for having found such a large living space to have her own office, even in a condominium which, if she was frank, could mirror that of something of a house. </p><p>Before she can step out into the hallway, the sight of a teenager curled up into a ball, blankets and pillows thrown over him. It breaks her heart to see her son settling for a clearly uncomfortable surface to sleep in rather than his own bed. </p><p>Agatha frowns and softly nudges the boy with her foot. “Did you sleep out here all night?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Billy mumbles back, only having awoken a handful of minutes prior.</p><p>“Well, you need to go get ready for school. It’s almost time for your first class and you need to get on your hands and knees to apologize to your principal,” Agatha explains.  “And take your brother to school.” </p><p>“I already took him.” Billy sits up, his eyes not yet meeting his mother’s. There are small hints of eyeliner running down his cheeks, and Agatha cannot help but be pained by the sight. Regardless of what he does or says to her, he will forever be her son. “I’m not going to school today. You’re not going to work either.”</p><p>“And, pray tell, who will be paying for the electricity bills you love racking up by gaming all night long?” Agatha wonders as she leans on her doorway, arms crossed over her chest. </p><p>“Nicky? He watches enough Bluey to power a small country.” Billy tries joking, but falls flat as Agatha blankly eyes him. “I’m sorry. I…I don’t even know where to begin. I’ve been such a fucking idiot-”</p><p>“Hey, no swearing”</p><p>But Billy ignores the warning. </p><p>“-That I’ve been taking it out on you. I didn’t even realize it until last night when you got all upset. Eddie talked me through it and he almost came over to console you. He said I was being an ass and I don’t think he’s wrong.” The ends of Agatha’s mouth quiver upwards slightly. The young man is a wonderful influence on her son. She knows that with Eddie, Billy is in good hands. Eventually, she will relay to him the joy of looking out for the teenager; she simply cannot wait at times. “I’m really sorry for what I said last night. You <em> are </em>my mom. Maybe not biologically, but you’re my real mom. You took care of me when my birth mom wouldn’t. Only a true mother would do something like that.” </p><p>“Honey, it’s fine-”</p><p>“No, it’s not fine.” Billy shakes his head as he rises to face his mother. “It’s just…kids at school found out I’m adopted and haven’t stopped teasing me. They keep saying my birth mom abandoned me for good reason. That I should be embarrassed to ‘live with some stranger who pretends to be my mom.’ And that…that I’m not your son because we’re not related. They kept calling me a ‘goodie-two-shoes’ and told me I needed to ‘pass a test’ if I wanted to be their friend. I don’t have any friends other than Eddie. And I know it’s all bullshit, but it’s hard because-”</p><p>“Don’t you ever let anyone tell you who or what you are. That is for you to decide. And you best believe I’m telling the principal about those fuckwits,” Agatha says, cutting her son off as her emotions flare. “You are <em> my </em> son. Mine. I don’t care what some stupid, snot-nosed highschooler has to say about that. You are my boy. If someone tries to fuck with you, they have to answer to me.”</p><p>“If you want to return me I-”</p><p>A pair of arms envelop themselves around him. She cannot hear the rest of the sentence. Although she is sure Billy humors the thought here and there whenever she is upset, Agatha wishes to take it all away – to make him realize that nothing will dare make her change her mind about being his mother. All the pain he endured upon being abandoned by his former parents in a sketchy part of Paramus, letting the young boy to fend for himself. All the questions he asks himself: why me? Because she knows he undergoes them each day in silence. All the anguish he expresses, through different verbiage and actions, which all stem from his confusion on why his birth parents gave up on him. Agatha longs to make such anguish her own; no child of hers should ever worry about going through such motions alone. She refuses. </p><p>“You and your brother have given me so much joy in the past five years. You don’t understand how proud I am of the young man I have raised you to be,” Agatha sobs. “I know you had it rough. Oh baby, I know.” She squeezes Billy, feeling him growing sadder by the second. “But a real mom doesn’t abandon her son. Not when she thinks he is too much to handle, and never when he acts up. This won’t be the last time we clash, but honey, I need you to know that I will never give up on you. Never. My job as your mother is to help you become the best version of yourself possible. There will be some bumps here and there, but I’ll take you past the finish line, kid. You will always have me by your side, even when you find it embarrassing and annoying.” </p><p>Billy beams as he presses his head against his mother’s, slightly towering over her. “I can’t wait.”</p><p>“I know it’s not the lame. Maybe having a dad as well would be easier, but I’ll be both parents if I have to, kid.” Agatha reaches out and with a shaky hand, she brushes off tears from his glossy eyes. “Hell, I’ll wear a mustache and everything.”</p><p>“I’ve already made peace with not having a dad. I don’t want one,” he explains. “I don’t need another mom either. You’re enough, ma. Always.”</p><p>Those are reassurances Agatha never asks for, yet they soothe her insecurities either way. </p><p>The two of them embrace one another for what feels like ages. Agatha fears letting go, because in only a matter of years, the timid small boy she once knew as a stranger will become an adult. She wishes to keep him young forever to make up for the time she didn’t have with him as a child. But, regardless of her selfish wants, Agatha knows soon she will let go. And that will be the push Billy needs to become the man he has always been destined to be. </p><p>It started as a joke, but eventually it is Billy who moves to drive the two of them to a nearby diner as their stomach churn in search for food. They sit across from one another in a booth by the edge of the locale, each engrossed in the menus they already know like the back of their hands. If he remembers correctly, it is the first restaurant Agatha ever took him to on the day he was adopted. </p><p>“I got the bill,” Billy breaks the ice as he sets down his menu, already settling for a rather hefty plate of macaroni and cheese in the early hours of the morning – hoping, praying almost, that his mother would let it slide for once. “So don’t worry about it.”</p><p>“You still haven’t gotten a job, mister. Are we dining and dashing or…?”</p><p>“I have money,” he stammers. “I mean, it’s some leftover from the allowance you give me.”</p><p>“So <em> I’m </em> actually paying,” Agatha giggles, shaking her head with amusement as she sets down the large piece of laminated paper to face her son. “If so, I’ll be sure to get the most expensive thing on the menu.” </p><p>“Knock yourself out.” He reaches out to take hold of her hand. “You deserve it.”</p><p>When the food arrives as the minutes trickle in after their orders are placed, the two of them dig in. While Billy is quite busy shoving copious amounts of cheesy pasta, a pondering agatha simply stares at him. Awkward conversations had never been her strong suit – she still grimaces at the memory of discussing the birds and the bees with him – but she knows it is vital to have them. </p><p>“Listen, I’m going to level with you as a young man, not a kid. If I catch you smoking that shit while you are living under my room, I will kick your ass. You and I both know I’m not messing around,” Agatha sternly states, ignoring her omelet to focus on the teenager. “Once you turn 21, you can smoke all the pot you want. But I want you to be old enough to make those decisions, not be peer pressured into it because your friends think it’s cool. I did a lot of crazy things when I was your age and I am not letting you make your mom’s mistakes. Got it?”</p><p>“Yes ma’am,” Billy answers while chewing through a mouthful of food. “I mean, it can’t be that bad, right? What you did in high school.”</p><p>“Believe me, there is a whole side of your mother you will never know about.” She only hopes he does not pressure a more detailed answer out of her until he is at least 25. “I know you’re young and curious, but as someone who was in your situation first, I promise this is what’s best for you.”</p><p>“Was grandma- I mean, <em> Evanora </em>,” Billy corrects himself. “Did she not care?”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure she prayed each night that she would wake up to me choking on my own vomit.” Agatha shrugged, but there came a searing pain with her words. “But I’m not her. I will look after my kids no matter what. You and your brother will always be my priority. That’s what a mother should be like.”</p><p>“I’m sorry you didn’t have a mom,” Billy mumbles. “It sucks, you know? Some people like you are meant to become parents, but some people who are parents aren’t meant for it. I’m lucky to have you.” </p><p>“The world is one cruel son of a bitch,” Agatha sighs. “But I’m lucky to have you as my kid, Bills.”</p><p>There is a pregnant pause that the two of them take, but it is Billy who garners enough courage to break through its icy silence.</p><p>“What did end up happening between the two of you? You and Evanora, I mean.”</p><p>“Nothing good, kid. I just distanced myself as much as I could from that monster.” Agatha fiddles with her glass of orange juice before taking a cautious sip. “You know, I was waiting until you were at least 18 to tell you, but O’Connor is a last name I chose for myself. I’ve gone through great lengths to be the opposite of that lady.” </p><p>“So she’s not Evanora O’Connor?” The woman shakes her head. “That’s why I haven’t been able to find her.” </p><p>Agatha is not an idiot. Ever since he arrived at her home, she has found search histories spanning years in search of any of her living relatives. There are not many, but she muses at least some are sprinkles across Salem where she grew up. Not that she cares, nor does she wish to know of anyone’s whereabouts – especially not her mother.</p><p>“I won’t stop you from having a relationship with your grandmother if you’d like. I have always dreamed of her mending things for once.” It is not on her, Agatha finally realizes. Her mother’s primary fault was her uncaring personality. Now, in her adulthood, the woman realizes the effort to keep a phantom relationship alive is futile. “She’s Evanora Harkness. And I was Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>“That’s a pretty cool last name,” Billy smiles. “But don’t worry, I won’t do anything. That woman is not my grandma. I’m not going to push you to tell me exactly what happened, but I know it must’ve been pretty bad. I can’t be around someone who treats my mom like shit.”</p><p>“You really ought to take that ‘no swearing’ rule seriously,” Agatha orders, but the tightness her chest held from the previous night loosens. “But thank you. Sometimes you can be such a typical teenager, but then I remember how beautiful your heart is. Never let anyone take it. Okay?”</p><p>The way in which Billy’s eyes twinkle opposes that of her appearance when Agatha was his age – she can only hope that flame is never put away. </p><p>“Yes, ma’am!”</p><hr/><p>Their shared day is spent solely with one another. Agatha is well-aware that rewarding putrid behavior is a huge red flag in her book, but as she truly gets a feel into what has been bothering her son, she cannot help but offer him a day of peace. If that means following him around a surprisingly-packed arcade in Eastview and humoring him in whatever game he wishes to play, so be it.</p><p>Tomorrow the punishment can start, but today, Billy can have an olive branch.</p><p>“Hey, I wanted to tell you something.” As the day nears to its end, Agatha finds herself parked outside of her younger son’s school. They are late enough that the buses have left, leaving nothing in their wake but a small boy standing beside his teacher staring off at the car. “I thought it might be best to say it before you found out the hard way, but I’ve been thinking of seeing someone. In a romantic way.”</p><p>“Oh, are we getting a step-mom?” Billy beams. “Is she crazy?”</p><p>“Hush. We’re just getting to know each other. But if it starts getting serious, I would like her to meet you,” Agatha explains. She watches from the rearview mirror as Rio and Nicholas approach the car from afar. “I want to make sure the two of you get along before going further. The last thing I want is for you to be uncomfortable around someone I am with.” </p><p>“It’ll be fine, mom. I’m sure she’ll love Nicky too.”</p><p>“Oh she does,” Agatha mumbles, ignoring the confusion stricken over her son’s face. “Don’t worry, she’ll love you too.”</p><p>As Agatha steps out of the car, Billy, who scratches his brain for a second, gasps. He rolls down the window enough to quietly yelp at the woman who chooses to ignore him. But he doesn’t back away easily. </p><p>“No way, you like Nicky’s teacher!” Billy is giddy as he attempts to gain the woman’s attention. </p><p>“Oh shut up,” Agatha rolls her eyes. “I do not.”</p><p>“Mom, don’t gaslight me.”</p><p>“Gasli- what the fuck?” But as Nick approaches, Agatha moves away from the car and kneels to the ground. “Hi, baby!”</p><p>“Mommy!” The boy howls, but when he catches a sight of his brother in the car, his excitement shoots through the roof. “Billy!”</p><p>As the boy runs around to reach his brother, Agatha rises back to her feet. From the corner of her eye she catches wind of a peculiarly gorgeous brunette who stops on her tracks to cross her arms. Whether she admits it or not, the woman has been tinkering in her thoughts for eons. Even in her dreams does Rio make an appearance. </p><p>“Ms. O'Connor,” Rio nods her way. “Nice to see you again.”</p><p>“Ms. Vidal,” Agatha flatly responds as she awaits to be led by the rather fiery woman. </p><p>“I was hoping we could talk.” Rio’s eyes flicker over the woman who, albeit slightly disheveled, dons a confidence to her that is quite attractive. Even if they had seen one another on the previous night, neither can go long without the other. Everything in their surroundings goes awry, their focus instead places on one another. And by the gods does it feel glorious to bask in their presences. “If that’s alright with you.”</p><p>Agatha approaches close enough that the two are only a breath away. “That’s more than fine by me.”</p><p>“You ran out on me last night,” Rio states, her voice sultry. She devilishly sticks out her tongue to lick her lips, and Agatha cannot help but unashamedly stare at it. They remind her of the lewd moment they shared at the bar where she- “Is everything alright?”</p><p>“Just some teenage angst that led to an arrest, no biggie,” Agatha brushes it off — the truth is far too hefty to share during a quick conversation in the parking lot. And, lo and behold, for once she refuses to allow herself to drown in the memories she has shared with Rio. Not when her children are around. “It was very rude of me to leave just as things were getting interesting.” </p><p>“I believe you owe me a date.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha’s excitement rises at the confidence exuding from the teacher. “So now we are going on a date?”</p><p>“Is there a problem with that, Ms. O’Connor?” A challenging set of eyebrows are raised. The game they began playing last night has not ended. And neither finds themselves wanting to lose. “I thought that’s what you wanted, mi amor.”</p><p>Agatha bites down her bottom lip hard to muffle an incoming groan. “Not at all.”</p><p>“Next week I’ll be rather busy, but I can clear up my weekend so we can have a do-over.” Rio takes the reins, but she cannot wait to hand them over to her counterpart. “How about you pick me up at five o’clock next Saturday?” </p><p>“A little forward, aren’t we?” Agatha husks. </p><p>But Rio ignores the comment. “Don’t keep me waiting. I’m a busy woman.” </p><p>“Well, we can’t have that. Don’t worry, I won’t be even a second late.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio hums. “Have a lovely weekend, Agatha. You know where to find me if you…” her eyes shamelessly engorge themselves along Agatha’s body. “…need me.”</p><p>With that, Rio waves the woman off before setting on a walk back to the school. But Agatha, oh, poor Agatha, is glued to the ground. She doesn’t tear her eyes away until after the teacher disappears into the building, and even then, she looks back before moving towards the car. </p><p>“Why is mommy acting weird around Ms. Vidal?” Nicky whispers at his brother.</p><p>At the sight, Billy grins. His mother has put more than enough years into solely focusing on raising them. He muses it is time for her to find the happiness she has always longed for. “Well, buddy. It looks like we might get another mom at some point. We just gotta make sure it really happens.” </p>

<p>Fuck. </p><p>That has been the only word bored into Rio’s mind. </p><p>Just…<em> fuck </em>.</p><p>Throughout the week she has spent what feels like countless hours in search for the perfect outfit. From her closet, numerous items have been ruled out. The pool around her feet even as Saturday comes. And just as she began, Rio has no tangible outfit in sight to wear for her date. With Agatha due to arrive in less than an hour, she just about wishes to bang her head against her four walls simultaneously until something materializes in her hands. </p><p>She catches a look at herself in the full-body mirror sitting at the edge of her walk-in closet. The matching set of black lacy underwear over her body was one she purchased just for the occasion. Not that she wishes to get lucky that night given that with Agatha, unlike her previous partners, she prefers taking it slow – she is special in that way, but Rio is truly unsure why, but her gut is never wrong. </p><p>A pair of dark eyes zero on the marking of a crossroads on her waist. The sight makes Rio sigh. After all the years she had spent waltzing around on Earth, she has yet to find the one who matches her tattoo. At times people wait decades to find their soulmate, yet some never do. It’s not as though she can force every woman she meets to undress slightly to be sure. But oh would it make it all much easier. </p><p>It takes time, but eventually she settles for a dark red long-sleeved shirt, which she rolls up to her elbows. It has a plunging v-neck leaving little to nothing for the imagination of others. That paired with black slacks and a loose-fitted light coat are enough. With the fall season coming through in full-force, the cold closely follows. </p><p>A thin layer of lipstick is applied to her features – its gloomy hue matching that of her eyeshadow. Normally the parents of her students frowned whenever she presented herself with such dark colors, but with Agatha, she noticed, it was different. If anything, the woman appeared to be quite enticed by such uniqueness. </p><p>Upon rechecking her hair for the millionth time, Rio descends the stairs of her apartment. She quickly exits the building, but in doing so a wave of giddiness crashes over her. It is not often that she loses her typically calm demeanor. If anything, most of the time the woman dons a serene nature to her that cannot be faltered. But Agatha, oh sweet Agatha, breaks through such walls without trying much. It leaves Rio feeling vulnerable, naked almost, with nothing to cover herself but the excitement she experiences in seeing the woman again.</p><p>“My, my,” a voice stemming from a running car says. “Do you do weddings, sweetheart?”</p><p>“You wish,” Rio replies back. “Aren’t you going to be a lady and open the door for me, linda?”</p><p>Agatha, never backing down from a challenge, does exactly that. Rio watches in awe as the woman rushes across the car, pulling the passenger door open for her to enter. But for a second she hesitates – the dress the other woman wears is far too tight to ignore. Everything beyond half of her thighs is exposed for her to enjoy. She simply cannot-</p><p>“You like?” A slack-jawed Rio looks her up and down. “I got it just for the occasion. I like to make a good first impression.”</p><p>“I’m a lucky lady,” Rio licks her lips before her eyes meet a pair of icy blue ones. “Very lucky indeed.”</p><hr/><p>On a Saturday evening the elegant Eastview restaurant is bustling. As the two of them arrive, it is Rio who disallows her counterpart from taking charge. She walks through the tables, and before Agatha can even blink, pulls out a chair for her to take. No words are exchanged, just smiles which suffice. </p><p>If anything, they are far too enthralled with the other to muster out a single syllable. </p><p>In the beginning there is a deafening silence as they tune out those around them. Neither are shy – far from it actually – yet decide to wait on the other before giving in. Because if they do, each woman is well-aware of how deep they will fall. And it will be glorious as they go down together. </p><p>“It’s a nice restaurant,” Rio comments first, her eyes inspecting the woman before her. “Such a shame that it only has one beauty in it. I’m lucky to be the only one to have her tonight.”</p><p>“A shame, huh?” Agatha smiles. “I sometimes come here for bigger client meetings. Some rich folks like being wined and dined before paying my salary. So long as they keep my bills paid, I frankly don’t care where we go.”</p><p>“Ah, you’re a realtor. That makes sense. Nicky always says his mommy lets random people stay in her houses for money,” Rio chuckles as she remembers how proud the boy was when discussing the fact in class. While the other students were in awe, the teacher scratched her head in an attempt to figure out what went on. “I was worried I had competition.”</p><p>“Honey, no one can compete with you,” Agatha sultrily states. “I didn’t expect you to be so forward when asking me out. Honestly? I didn’t know you had it in you.”</p><p>“You invited me out for drinks even if you’re well-aware of what happened last time we drank in the same vicinity.” She is thankful the waiter had brought glasses of water prior to taking their orders; Rio nearly downs one as a means to keep herself cooled off with cheeks beginning to flush. “Two can play that game, Ags. And I am not a fan of losing.”</p><p>
<em> Ags.  </em>
</p><p>The sudden nickname makes the auburn-haired woman beam. Much like the tattoo on her waist, she finds herself at a crossroads. The urgency to go the extra mile to keep seeing her child’s teacher is far too imminent to let go of. Agatha wants to be greedy for once in her life. She wants her happiness beyond that of her family. She wants someone to keep her company once her boys are out and about forming their own lives. She wants – no – she <em> needs </em>her soulmate to share life by her side. </p><p>And if it were to end up being Rio, beautiful Rio who pushes back strands of her soft hair to allow a better view into her dark eyes, then Agatha’s prayers would be answered. </p><p>The two of them chat amicably as their orders are placed. Wine glasses are half-filled by the waiter before being clung against one another in a throaty cheer. And as the evening goes forth, so do their laxed conversations.</p><p>“You never had a rebellious phase?” Agatha questions with wide eyes. </p><p>Their chat led them to discussing their own experiences in high school, not mentioning much but her rather crazed actions that nearly got her kicked out. On further thought, perhaps having set a small fire in the Chemistry lab to get out of an exam was not her brightest idea. </p><p>“I wasn’t allowed to,” Rio shrugs. “My mother expected perfection from me, so that’s what I gave her. It wasn’t until I turned 21 that I decided to grab life by the balls for once and stand up for myself. I even went to an adventist school and everything. I <em> was </em>the perfect child on paper until she realized men were off the table for me.”</p><p>“21? Isn’t that a bit too old?”</p><p>“Are you kidding? I’m Puerto Rican. My mother still considers me a child and I’ll be pushing forty soon,” Rio howls. “There is no such thing as ‘being too old’. God, <em> I wish </em>.”</p><p>“Nicky told me you’re fluent in Spanish,” Agatha cannot help but zero into that fact. “That’s, uh, incredibly attractive.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio licks her lips. “Que bueno que te guste. Creo que lo más atractivo aquí eres tú, mor.”</p><p>“That's not fair.” Agatha tugs at the collar of her shirt, her other hand being used to fan herself. “You’re going to drive me crazy, Vidal.”</p><p>“Cuento con eso.”</p><p>With her cheeks burning bright, Agatha leans back on her chair. Her composure is flaccid as she refuses to meet the gaze of the beauty sitting before her. She fears that if she were to do so, nothing could get her to crawl out of the grip Rio would wrap her in. Then again, she wonders if that is exactly how she wants to go.  </p><p>“That’s beautiful,” Agatha motions towards the necklace pouring down her counterpart’s cleavage. It is a simple cord with a small wooden rectangle on it – the Puerto Rican flag painted on its surface. “Did you ever live on the island?”</p><p>“I was born and raised there, but I moved away for my bachelor’s and master’s. Once I finished grad-school, I moved back for some years. Then Maria hit and I…well, it was difficult to keep doing what I loved when everything was going to shit. The school I was working at closed. So I packed my bags and moved myself and my parents over to the mainland – my father’s business has only blossomed here.” Rio glances at her necklace, gently caressing it. “It was a going-away present from my grandfather. He carved and painted it for me. He told me to never forget my roots.”</p><p>“That’s wonderful, Rio. I really can’t imagine how difficult it must’ve been for you and your family,” Agatha says, her heart out in her chest for Rio to take. “Just moving to a completely different place almost against your will…”</p><p>“It was difficult, sure, but my parents have settled well. They’re living in New London over in Connecticut. Apparently there’s a lot more of us over there,” Rio shrugs. “But here in Westview? Not so much. I suppose it gets lonely sometimes. At least there’s some good restaurants at a driving distance that remind me of home.”</p><p>“It is a pretty bleak town. I don’t fault anyone for opting out of living here,” Agatha jokes. A hand of hers reaches out, and although hesitantly, she eventually sets it atop Rio’s. “Thank you for sharing that with me. And here I thought I couldn’t like you any more.”</p><p>“Oh? So now you like-<em> like </em> me,” Rio teases. “Are you going to invite me to the prom and get me a corsage? Should I expect a limo to come pick me up tomorrow night?”</p><p>At quip, Agatha cannot help but giggle. “Whatever the lady wants.”</p><p>And when the food arrives, Rio is far too enthralled by the enchantress before her to dig in immediately.  </p><p>“Tell me more about yourself. I hardly know who the real Agatha is.”</p><p>“Oh, darling, there’s not much to say. You’ve seen it all at this point. I’m just another boring single mother living in the suburbs.” Agatha hums as she takes a sip of her wine. “The people I hang out with the most are my own children. Against my will at that,” she jests. “Other than that, I am a realtor with my own business. Life is a bit dull, but I’m grateful. I have my kids, I have my job, my house, and even friends that I <em> sometimes </em>like.” </p><p>“And your family?” Rio wonders, but the pause the other woman takes gives her all the information she needs. So rather than pry, she sets her foot down on the conversation. Instead, she opts to begin biting at her food. “Don’t worry, I get it. That’s a seventh date type of conversation, huh?”</p><p>“There just aren’t any family members to talk about.”</p><p>“Are you looking for some?” Rio raises her eyebrows. “You can take my siblings and maybe even my parents if you’re feeling generous.”</p><p>“They can’t be that bad,” Agatha hopes. “Right?”</p><p>“Guess you’ll just have to find out, pretty girl,” Rio sing-songs. </p><p>“There’s something about you,” the realtor huffs, her pupils dilating in the sole presence of Rio. “I can’t really explain it. You’re just so…intriguing.”</p><p>Pouring herself another glass of wine, Rio sticks out her tongue to lick her lips. She is well-aware of the effect she has on Agatha, but then again, it is a rather mutual sentiment. It is on rare occasions that the woman disappears from her mind. </p><p>“Well,” Rio clears her throat, reeling Agatha in with a single look. “Cheers to being intriguing.”</p><hr/><p>By the time Agatha falls back on her bed, it is past ten at night. Her and Rio had spent nearly the entire evening talking at the restaurant. Their cheeks were similarly blushing from the wine and their close proximity to one another, but she was sober enough to drive the other brunette back to her place. There, as much as she wished to stay for a nightcap, there was a bid for goodbye. </p><p>Although, to her surprise, a rather chaste kiss had been plastered over the back of her hand by a rather tipsy Rio. The woman had slurred a quick farewell, waved her off, and struggled to make her way into the building in a straight line. Figures. </p><p>Still, as she lays in her bed, Agatha’s fingertips ghost over the faint lipstick smudge on her hand. She cannot remember the last time she felt so…alive. The thrill of getting to know someone again in a romantic manner makes her experience youth once more. Even Rio mentioned something about her skin glowing while enroute to the restaurant. </p><p>With the boys soundly slumbering in their given rooms, Agatha grabs her phone. The last message she received from Rio was one with her address on it. And Although she hesitates, the realtor opts into beginning a new conversation. </p><p><b>Agatha:</b> Are you awake?</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>If not, this will be very embarrassing. </p><p><b>Rio: </b> Calm down, Ags. I’m all yours. <em> Again.  </em></p><p>As a smirk flows into her features, Agatha fails to realize the other woman shares a similar expression from across town. </p><p><b>Rio: </b>I’m fighting the beginning stages of a mini hangover. My phone screen is too fucking bright and I cannot figure out for the life of me how to turn it down right now. </p><p><b>Rio:</b> And I’m in the middle of a bath. If my phone falls and electrocutes me to death, I’ll be sure to send you my funeral bill from the afterlife. </p><p><b>Agatha:</b> Call me.</p><p>In a matter of seconds, the teacher’s name is plastered over her phone screen. A sigh comes before a shaken head. There is no turning back if she were to take the call. Agatha knows that if it were to go south, this…whatever she has with Rio, then Nicky would be affected. The last thing she wants is to put her child in an awkward position. But as the incoming call reaches its final few rings, she settles to put herself first.</p><p>“Well, good evening, Ms. O’Connor. To what do I owe this lovely pleasure?” </p><p>The sultry voice that sounds casts an immediate wave of relief over Agatha. Her body loses its previously-tense composure as she melts over her bed. Even the reading glasses perched over her nose feel less heavy than before. </p><p>“I had a lot of fun tonight,” is all Agatha musters. “More than ever, really. Thank you for that. You really are amazing, Rio.”</p><p>“Anytime,” Rio pauses before continuing. “I’m assuming you didn’t just call to talk about how awesome I am. Penny for your thoughts, Ags?”</p><p>“I’m not entirely sure why I called. You’ve been in my mind a lot as of late. I think I need to start charging you rent.” The comment earns her a throaty fit of laughter. It is enough to elicit such a joyous sound in herself as well – Rio is simply contagious in that way. “Can I…is it alright if I talk to you about something? Well, I guess it’s more of a vent. I haven’t really been able to tell anyone else.”</p><p>“Sure,” Rio, albeit normally taking a playful tone when interacting with Agatha, turns soft. “Go on, mor. Talk to me.”</p><p>“The other day Billy alluded to the fact that I’m not his ‘real’ mother. I love the kid, really, and we had a wonderful conversation about what went down. But I still feel,” Agatha pauses as she reaches for the right word. “Inadequate? I know he said it out of anger, but I can’t help it. Those words really got to me. I wish I could forget and move on, but I’m still stuck on that.”</p><p>The pieces of the puzzle that is Agatha’s family begin shifting into their designated places, but Rio doesn’t mention it. Instead, she sighs. From what she has been told by Nicky and his mother, Billy is quite the well-established young man, yet her stomach churns at the thought of him spewing such words to his mom. </p><p>“You’re a wonderful mom, Agatha. And I’m not just saying that because we made out in a sleazy bar. I mean it. I have the pleasure of teaching one of your sons and through him, I can tell you’ve done such an amazing job at parenting – which is an incredibly hard job as is,” Rio says. “Half of the parents I see don’t go the extra mile as you do. Will you mess up sometimes? Sure. but it’s your first time living and being a mom.  Besides, I’m sure the kid was just being a typical teenager. Teens can be assholes a lot of the time and there’s not much you can do about it. That doesn’t mean they’re bad people nor are you an inadequate mom. Be kinder to yourself, sweetheart. Eres asombrosa, nunca lo olvides.” </p><p>There are unshed tears in her eyes threatening to fall, but she doesn’t let them. No, if anything the words spoken to her bring a strength she has lacked since the conversation with Billy. In only a matter of weeks since known one another, Rio has cemented herself into Agatha’s previously boring life. There is even color she has brought over the monotone existence. Her simple presence is cause for a smile; by the gods does she make Agatha smile. </p><p>“You know I was being serious about the Spanish thing, right?” As a means to keep herself from sobbing, Agatha switches the conversation topic. “It does <em> something </em>to me.”</p><p>“Las tentaciones como tú merecen pecados como yo,” Rio’s voice is low as she throws off the compliment. “No te preocupes, tienes el mismo efecto en mí que yo tengo en ti, querida. Me emociona pensar en lo que pasará.”</p><p>And all that a rather hot and bothered Agatha can mustered is quiet, lowly, “Fuck.”</p><hr/><p>

<p>By the time the first day of November arrives, the trees are almost fully nude. Their leaves flutter across the atmosphere, eventually pooling over the ground once the breeze that carries them ceases to exist. Morning grows darker while nights turn to a bitter cold warzone with breaths visible to the naked eye. </p><p>Staring out the window of her classroom, Rio sighs. Her breath has remained quite rhythmic until now, when she is pulled from her daydream and into the reality of the world. Technicolor leaves are stern across the outside of the room. She cannot help but be mesmerized by their hues as they crinkle over one another to see who lands first. There were never moments like these back home, and although she misses the Caribbean island dearly, she can’t help but become enamored by the Fall in the East Coast of the mainland. </p><p>There is a small twinkle in her eye as she relaxes against her chair. Not that she will admit it, but it has materialized since she first saw Agatha. The more interactions the two share, the brighter it grows. She hates it, hates how vulnerable and mushy it makes her appear. But deep down she is well-aware of how soft she is – sheep’s wool has nothing on her. She both blames and thanks Agatha for having pulled down the sheets of her cold, mysterious demeanor to reveal the true Rio who lies beneath. </p><p>Even her friends and coworkers have commented on her sudden glow. </p><p>Staring down at her buzzing phone, a smirk sprinkles itself through her features. Rio picks it up in an instant, and at the sight of a text whose sender is her true focus, she cannot help but giggle. Leave it to Agatha to turn her into a big pile of rainbows and smiles. </p><p><b>Agatha:</b> The little one asked about you today. Apparently his big brother mentioned that mom went on a date.</p><p>Another text follows which only proceeds to further elongate the woman’s humor. </p><p><b>Agatha:</b> For Christmas he’s asking Santa for another mommy. I guess you have a little over a month to propose.</p><p><b>Rio:</b> And here I was planning on doing so on our next date. Might as well give you a key to my apartment.</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> No thank you. I can’t live without an office at home.</p><p><b>Rio: </b>Guess I’ll have to settle for your basement.</p><p>Hela has teased her nonstop for the uncharacteristic behavior she displays. The two are on opposite sides of the country, yet she can see the woman’s smile from afar. So mocking, so bright. It nearly makes vile rise up her throat. </p><p>From the corner of her eye, she catches a commotion in the schoolyard. There are several children circling around, each yelping out while a rather peculiar voice stands out. Even if all but one window are fully sealed, Rio knows who it belongs to. And as her stomach churns, she rises from her seat. </p><p>“Come, quick,” Mrs. Hart exasperates as she rushes past Rio’s room. “It’s Nicholas. They say he fell off the playground and he can’t get up.”</p><p>The world goes silent. Unlike ever before, there is a heaviness weighing on Rio’s shoulders, drilling her into the seat as she watches the older teacher rush to the playground. But her legs don’t allow her to move, not yet anyway. Not until she pictures the boy, a true sweetheart she has the pleasure of teaching, and his mother who would surely spew fire across the world if her child were to be seriously harmed. </p><p>The thought alone forces Rio upwards. She is hot on Mrs. Hart’s heels, her fingers quickly typing out a message as she finds herself the first to arrive at the scene. From far away she can see Nicholas writhing in pain, his face covered in dirt as tears turn it to mud. If her heart is not swollen enough already, the sight alone is enough to break it. </p><p>“It’s okay,” she lies to Nicky, cradling him in her arms. “Everything will be okay, hon. I’m right here.”</p><hr/><p><b>Rio:</b> Hospital.</p><p><b>Rio:</b> Now.</p><p>Her stomach dropped at the sight of such messages materializing back-to-back. Agatha sighs in the midst of a meeting with a client, rushing to gather her belongings before apologizing profusely. Not that she meant it anyway. The last thing she cared for was the man who stares back, puzzled at the sudden end to the encounter before she bolts to her car. </p><p>The arrival at the hospital is hectic to say the least. Agatha is unsure about whether or not she parked the car within the two white lines properly or if she even remembered to lock it. But what she is sure about is that her son is laying on a gurney in the middle of a packed emergency room with reddened features. One of his arms is being inspected by a man donning a white robe while the other one reaches out to hold hands with a sour-faced brunette who won’t stop boring her eyes at the doctor.</p><p>Anger does suit Rio well.</p><p>“What happened?” the woman questions as she faces her son. “Oh my baby, are you okay? Did you fall? Did someone push you? What-”</p><p>“Fell off the jungle gym,” Nicholas’ groggy voice states. “Didn’t mean to. ‘M sorry.”</p><p>In the wake of her fury at the universe for having hurt the boy, Rio lets his hand go – one quickly grabbed by Agatha. Her jaw is tightened as she takes in the other woman’s disheveled appearance. She cannot explain it, but the raw emotions shoot out from her without meaning to. There is a desperate need to absorb the pain the boy and his mother exude and make it her own. Maybe then could she find peace. </p><p>“What happened?” This time, her voice carries no fire in it, only broken undertones as she faces Rio.</p><p>“Some of the kids dared him to go on top of the jungle gym and walk across it. Apparently when he fell, he banged his head pretty badly, but his arm got the worst of it. He got it stuck on one of the bars before falling onto the ground,” Rio flatly explains. “I’m sorry, Ms. O- <em> Agatha </em>.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha sniffles as tears spring from her eyes. No one wants to imagine their child being put through such unbelievable pain. Even as she stands there, hand gripping Nick’s small one, she cannot capture the severity of the situation. “Fuck, okay.” </p><p>“Don’t worry. S’okay mama,” Nicky slurs out. “Ms. Vidal told me it’s gonna be okay. Don’t cry.”</p><p>“Here, sit down.” Rio rises from the sole seat, allowing the woman to take it. A hand caressed her back, the touch along with the boy’s words reducing Agatha to a mess. But she listens to her child, refusing to shed a tear while he watches. “Is there anything I can do? Do you need me to pick Billy up from school or get you something to eat while you wait here?”</p><p>“I forgot I took them both to school this morning.” Agatha uses her free hand to massage her temple in preparation for an incoming headache. “I’ll call the school. Could you…<em> would </em> you pick him up and swing by the house on your way back? We’ll need a change of clothes if he needs to stay here for the night.”</p><p>“And Señor Scratchy,” Nicky pipes up. “Please?”</p><p>“And his rabbit,” Agatha adds with a dry chuckle. “Billy should have the key.” But before Rio can move, her wrist is grabbed weakly. “And Rio?” their eyes join together for a rather slow, poignant dance. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Anytime, Ags. anytime.”</p><hr/><p>“Billy, baby, Rio is going to pick you up from school, okay?”</p><p>Standing outside the school building, Billy’s eyes widen as that is the sole greeting his mother gives him through the phone. She had previously texted him the situation, and yet he cannot help but nervously fiddle with his many rings at the thought of his brother being in pain. Surely they are not related by blood, yet they might as well be. He rues remembering the times in their lives when they lived separate lives before Agatha brought them together. </p><p>“But you barely know her!” He exasperates. “Mom, I’m scared to embarrass myself. I don’t want to ruin this for you. Can’t I walk or something?”</p><p>“Come on you little twerp. You committed a misdemeanor, you can be in the same car as your brother’s teacher for less than fifteen minutes.” </p><p>“You mean your girlfriend?” Billy teases. From afar, a rather slick black Challenger grows closer. His mouth is left agape as it stops in front of him, its window rolling down as a woman raises her eyebrows at him. “Ma, I gotta go. Your goth girlfriend is here.”</p><p>“You little shit, she’s not my-”</p><p>But before she can get her rather colorful verbiage out, Billy hangs up. He inches closer, inspecting the interior of the car. If he was told the car was brand new, he would believe it. Not even Eddie takes such pristine care of his comic book collection. </p><p>“Billy I presume?” </p><p>“Yep,” he replies. That’s me.”</p><p>The car ride is a rather awkward endeavor – a sentiment shared by them both. There are not many conversation topics they can discuss when the air is thick with worry for Nicholas. So instead, Billy opts to stare out the window and hope for the trip to be over. But of course, with the cruel sense of humor the universe carries, they get stuck in what feels like every traffic light leading up to the house. </p><p>“So uhm-“</p><p>But simultaneously, Rio begins. “High school is-”</p><p>The two of them sit in a rather uncomfortable cloud of silence, grimaces stricken over their respective faces. Billy wonders if it would be quicker for him to jump off the car and be picked up by an ambulance. Maybe if he was in the hospital, he wouldn’t have to face Rio for a good fifty years. </p><p>“Your mom says you’re sixteen now,” is what Rio settles for.”</p><p>“Yep, sixteen.”</p><p>“Tough age.” Billy eyes her incredulously, and although Rio is not normally one to fall victim to awkward interactions, she feels out of place. It is not as though she makes it a point to interact with teenagers regularly. Children are fine, cute even, but adolescents are little devils in disguise. “I mean, adolescence is weird. All those hormones and- you know what? Never mind. I just hope you’re at least doing well in school. But judging by who your mother is, you must be on top of everything.”</p><p>“Actually, I vandalized my principal’s car and almost got expelled.”</p><p>Pretending to never have heard such information nearly earns the woman her one and only Academy Award nomination. “No kidding,” her voice is monotone as she attempts to appear surprised. “That’s crazy.”</p><p>“It was. Mom lost her shit,” Billy stops. “Can I swear in front of you? Mom would kill me.”</p><p>“Knock yourself out,” Rio responds, secretly hoping it is the proper choice to make without being murdered in cold-blood by Agatha. “Why vandalize it? And the principal of all people? You should have jammed their desk so they’d have a hellish time trying to open it, not go straight for a criminal offense. I mean, not that I’m judging.” </p><p>“You speak from experience.”</p><p>A grin forms over her face. “More like a vivid imagination. But don’t tell your mom I said that. I’m supposed to be a positive influence or something.” </p><p>“I was peer pressured.”</p><p>“You don’t have to explain yourself, kid. I promise I’m not judging,” she repeats.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I really can’t tell.” he leans in, his eyes narrowing as he inspects the woman’s features. “Are you mad or is that just…your face?”</p><p>And that is exactly why she steers clear from teenagers. Rio is sure that if she had gone into becoming a high school teacher, she would’ve already been a victim of a brain aneurysm at her age. Maybe even a simultaneous heart attack. </p><p>“I’m not mad,” Rio awkwardly laughs.</p><p>Silence befalls upon them before Billy takes charge of the conversation. It is the least he can do for accidentally taking a jab at the woman his mother is interested in. </p><p>“Do you like my mom?” He wonders aloud. “More than friends, I mean.”</p><p>The question forces the woman to freeze. Truth be told, she is unsure of how to define whatever it is they have. She is sure they are past the point of being friends, but rather than solidify their newfound relationship, if one could even call it such, they are stuck in a limbo as their hectic lives pass. “I’m not sure she wants me to discuss that with her kids.” </p><p>“I’m just wondering what your intentions are, that’s all.”</p><p>Rio giggles as she turns to him. “Are you going to give me the ‘dad talk’?” </p><p>“I’m protective over her. Mom hasn’t really had an easy life. Since she adopted us, she hasn’t even dated anyone. I want to make sure you’re taking this as seriously as she is.”</p><p>“I do like her. Quite a lot actually,” Rio explains, not that she needs to, but she can tell he truly cares even after spewing such venom as his mother all those days ago. “She is a magnificent woman and she raised an equally-amazing pair of boys. You’re a good kid, Bilbo.”</p><p>“Billy,” he corrects, unaware of the purposefulness of the wrong name being said — her teasing nature wouldn’t let an opportunity like that slide.</p><p>“Isn’t that what I said?”</p><hr/><p>Upon her arrival at the hospital once again, Rio is redirected to a room rather than the emergency room. It won’t be long until she leaves again, not wishing to intrude during a moment quite intimate for the O’Connors. Her sole purpose for being there is dropping the teen off and handing the bag of clothes, with a special inanimate rabbit inside, and leaving. That’s it.</p><p>At least that is what she tells herself to endure the visit.</p><p>“Hey,” is the first word directed towards her by a rather fatigued woman sitting beside her sleeping son’s bed. There is relief stricken over her face, one Rio too shares. “Did you get my clothes?”</p><p>“Here, Billy put them in this bag. The little rabbit is in there too,” Rio whispers. There is a second seat beside Agatha that she takes. The two of them share a rather close proximity, their bodies face away from each other. “I just stood by the door waiting for him to come down. I didn’t want to intrude.”</p><p>“You rushed my son to the hospital when he broke his arm,” Agatha shakes her head as she smiles slightly for the first time in hours. “You can move into the guest room for all I care. I don’t think I can even repay you for that.” </p><p>When the words die out, the two of them watch as the doctor enters the room. He has been pouring in and out, checking on both Nicholas’ arm and head injury — the latter, luckily, not being too serious. From what he has explained to Agatha, once the cast is set and they can check on the kid overnight, he will be free to go. But at the very least, he should be freed from the confines of school for a handful of days, if not weeks. </p><p>“I have to go back to the school and get some things I left, but I’ll return. Do you…” Rio trails off hesitantly. “Would you like me to stay with you?”</p><p>“Oh honey, I couldn’t ask you to do that,” Agatha hums, but god does she want to say otherwise. She wishes to hug the woman, to be held in her arms as she bawls out the tears she’s been holding on all day. “You’ve done more than enough as is.” </p><p>“I’m offering, preciosa.” </p><p>“I know, thank you,” Agatha takes a moment to eye the interaction her son, albeit exhausted through his sniffles, has with the doctor. “Could you actually stay with Billy? They want Nicky to stay for the night and I’m sure as hell not leaving. I don’t want Bills to be home alone.”</p><p>“Of course. Would you rather he stay over at my place or should I stay at yours?”</p><p>“You can stay at my house. I wouldn’t want to intrude more than I am.” As she ruffles through her purse, Agatha produces a set of keys. A single gray one is pulled out to be handed off to Rio. “I thought we’d have a fourth or fifth date before you stayed over at my place, but here.”</p><p>“This can be our fourth date,” Rio jokes. “The second was when you brought me coffee on your way to work and stayed over for two hours rambling on my couch. The third…” she pauses, deep in thought. “I guess the third can be when you stayed in my classroom after school waiting for Nicky to finish rehearsing for the play.”</p><p>“I am not looking forward to going.” The Valentine’s Day celebration, Agatha found out against her will, for first-graders involved a small musically-driven about a makeshift history of Valentine’s day — the real one was far too boring to retell through children. Not that she would allow her biases to trump that of reality, but she is sure Nicky has by far the most beautiful singing voice in all his school. The last thing she wants is to spend her Valentine’s Day listening to screeching children on a stage. “I’d rather walk through a path of nails than listen to those little shits trying, and failing, at singing.”</p><p>“You are so mean,” Rio playfully slapped her shoulder. “I like it.”</p><p>“Mama?”</p><p>The small, weakened voice makes the two women turn their heads. Before making his exit, the doctor nods their way, mumbling something about how he would wait outside of the room once they were finished. It leaves them in a teary-eyed Nicky pouting as his mother. </p><p>“Hi Ms. Vidal.” But it doesn’t have the same energy as the greeting usually does. While Rio sits in place, smiling at her student, his mother rushes over. “Thanks for taking care of me when I fell. I was so, so scared.”</p><p>“I bet, Nico.” The first time had been a slip-up, but given the boy’s joy at finding himself a new nickname, it only continued. Rio has taken to referring to the boy as such, an aspect of their hopefully-growing relationship she adores. “How are you feeling, bud?”</p><p>“Hurts,” he mumbles before his eyes flicker towards his mother. “Hurts, mommy. Make it stop, please.”</p><p>“Oh baby, I know.” Agatha kisses his forehead once, then twice, then a third time. “It’ll stop hurting soon. But look at it this way, now you’re getting a really cool cast all your friends can sign. Isn’t that nice?”</p><p>“Can you get me markers? I want to draw all over it,” Nicky lights up slightly. </p><p>“Of course. Anything you want.” As her other son enters the room, a weight lifts off her shoulders. “Look who’s here, Nicky baby. Billy was worried sick about you.”</p><p>“Sorry, I had to use the bathroom. Then I got lost,” Billy sheepishly says. He sits at the other side of the hospital bed, careful not to touch his brother’s wounded arm. “Is he gonna be okay?”</p><p>“The doctor says the break was pretty bad, but I’ll talk to him more now. Hopefully we get to take this little bug home soon,” Agatha fluffs her younger son's hair. “Listen, Rio is going to stay over tonight. Be nice to her.”</p><p>“I’m always nice,” an appalled Billy responds. “Well, most of the time.”</p><p>Although he hates the thought of having a babysitter at an age he believes is old enough, Billy smiles. All he hopes is that this…whatever they have going on ends well. That perhaps his mother will finally find the happiness she seeks. </p><p>“Hey, I’ll be back a little later.” A hand lands on Agatha’s lower back. “Do any of you need anything?” </p><p>“Candy,” is all Billy says. “Pretty please. If you still have some from Halloween.” </p><p>As Rio faces his mother who gives her a nod of approval, she beams. “Of course, kid. I’ll bring you all the candy your little heart desires.” </p><p>The woman leaves, but not without a matching pair of curious eyes sending her off. </p><p>“Rio’s really nice,” Billy states. “I like her.”</p><p>The comment nearly brings Agatha to a teary mess, but she swears not to cry again in front of her boys — to be strong instead. “Yeah, I like her too.”</p><hr/><p>The sun sets across the expanse of Eastview by the time Rio returns to the hospital. It is the third time in a day where she finds herself walking across the rather vibrant halls of the children’s ward with two searing cups of coffee in each of her hands. She nods at the nurses who curiously shatter amongst themselves as to why, yet again, she finds herself there if not a member of the family. </p><p>But the self-conscious thoughts she faces are all strewn away upon entering the room.</p><p>“Hey, hot stuff.”</p><p>The comment brings out a toothy grin. “Hey yourself.”</p><p>“Billy went to get me some food from the cafeteria,” Agatha quietly mentions. “Poor Nicky has been out of it ever since you left. The doctor says he’ll be sleeping soundly until the morning. They had to give him something extra because of how in-pain he was. But apparently we should be able to leave tomorrow. Luckily he doesn’t have a concussion, just a nasty bruise.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, honey.” Rio, who dons a fallen face at the sight of her young student passed out in a hospital bed, shakes her head. She displays the cups of coffee, and as tempting as it is to down them both given her difficulty staying awake after such a busy day, she hands one to the other woman. “I brought you a little present and a bagful of candy for the kid. Thought you might need it after being stuck here all day.” </p><p>“You’re a godsend, Ri.” Regardless of how hot it is, Agatha seemingly downs it in a matter of sips. The manner in which the liquid burns its way down her throat is delicious, bringing her a semblance of peace during such a horrid day. “You must be sick of me with how much I’ve been troubling you all day. This is quite the fourth date, huh? Stuck in a hospital room with a scrawny middle-aged woman and her sleeping son. So fun.”</p><p>“Well, I am enjoying myself. Don’t get me wrong, I hate what happened to Nico, but I’m glad I can be of some help,” Rio breathes out. This time she sits much closer to Agatha, their bodies facing one another as though they were alone in the room. Not that Nicholas would awake for another ten hours minimum anyway. “I got to meet your other kid who is actually quite the gentleman. He was asking what my intentions are with you. It was sweet, really.”</p><p>The comment piques Agatha’s interest. </p><p>“And what are your intentions?”</p><p>There is a lecherous tone that hides behind a layer of feigned innocence. But Agatha is so far beyond innocent, Rio has come to find out. She is a lioness who carefully stalks her prey – named Rio – without letting impulsivity get in the way. But both could tell the hunt would soon end. It is only a matter of time. </p><p>“I think you and I know what my intentions are,” Rio shares a similarly teasing hint in her voice. “I didn’t get to say it before, but you look beautiful today. You should wear your hair up more often. It makes it easier to see <em> all </em>of you.”</p><p>“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” This time, it is Agatha’s tongue which darts out to hungrily lick her lips.</p><p>“Pero claro que sí, mi amor,” Rio hums; it is all she can do to withhold the moan she refuses to let out. Not when Nicky is around, and sure as hell not to give Agatha the benefit of one-upping her. “Solo es cuestión de tiempo. Cuando sea el momento indicado, te veré <em> toda </em>.”</p><p>“Might as well make it sooner rather than later,” Agatha husks. A sense of pride shoots through her chest at the surprise morphing over the teacher’s features at her understanding of the other language. “I’ve been learning just for you.”</p><p>The two of them grow closer, and before either knows it, lips faintly ghost one another’s. Their hot breaths are palpable against their flushed faces that grow redder by the second. A singular movement could set it all off and give them what they have desired to partake in since meeting at the bar. So close, yet so torturously far.</p><p>But as the haze in Rio’s mind washes away, she frowns. It hurts, fuck does it hurt, but she needs to oh-so slightly pull back. She won’t let Agatha, whose emotions are raw, urgently find the first thing to suppress them with. It is not fair to either of them. The woman’s focus should be on her son, not Rio. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio mutters, ashamed of her own actions. There is nothing more she wishes than to make <em> that </em> come true, but she cannot bring herself to take advantage of such an emotionally-vulnerable Agatha. “You should be focusing on Nicky, not… <em> this </em>.” </p><p>“And what is this?” Agatha huffs, a bit sharper than she originally meant, with her features fallen at the thought of being rejected by Rio. “Are we just playing a game?” </p><p>“It’s not a game to me. But I want you to focus on your kid now. Once he’s better, we can sit down and talk about it,” Rio shoots her a warm smile; just the thing Agatha needs to get through the night without sobbing. “For now, let me be here for you as a friend. Whatever you need, I’m one call away. <em> Coño </em>, I’ll even catch Nico up after school if I must. I won’t let you go through this by yourselves. We don’t know each other that well just yet, but I promise I am here to stay if you’ll have me.”</p><p>Tears trickle down Agatha’s cheeks, tracing the path of those that came before. Before she can reach out to clean herself up, a gentle thumb swipes over the tears, wiping them off the face of the planet. The caress makes her shudder as a warmth is shot through her chest. Such an intimate moment, she muses, is far better than whatever she originally hoped for. </p><p>“Thank you.” With Rio’s hand lingering over her face, Agatha moves to plant her lips in its palm; she too waits tedious seconds before pulling back, instead opting to talk with her voice suppressed by the woman’s hand. But another kiss soon comes against it, she really cannot help herself. It is all she can have for now. “You are something else, Vidal. Something <em> more </em>.” </p><p>“Yeah?” Rio’s eyes light up at the comment before a tongue sticks out to lick her lips hungrily. “If you keep me around, te voy a dar mucho más, bebé. Todo lo que te mereces. Yo te lo doy sin pensar. Does that sound good, Ags?”</p><p>With her mind running around in circles at such a wondrously bold display, Agatha nods. If she were left unattended around Rio, she would surely succumb to her deepest desires in a manner of seconds. And all the poor woman can muster through her shaky lips is a rather short, “Si.”</p><hr/><p>The pillows form a warm pool of softness that captures an exhausted body as it falls. The condo is rather spacious, something which has left Rio in awe of its size. Those who live around the neighborhood are in quite the different tax bracket compared to her own. But alas, she finds herself enjoying the stay at the hotel-esque guest room found on the first level of the home. </p><p>Billy had been quiet throughout the car ride home. As soon as they arrived, he was courteous enough to show her around past the doorway she had glued herself to earlier that way. But soon enough, he bid his goodbye and eventually slumped himself to sleep over his messy bed. </p><p>With every nook and cranny of the house being pristine, Rio fears so much as sneezing and causing a mess. She smoothes her hands over the bed sheets that cover her body, noting how much nicer they are compared to her own. But then Agatha, she muses Agatha is one to enjoy the finer things in life. After all, the woman likes Rio of all people. </p><p>Grabbing the phone from her bedside table, she cannot help but beam at the sight of an incoming text.</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> I hate you.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Why are you stuck in my head?</p><p>To be fair, the sentiment is shared. For the past few weeks, Rio has found herself surrounded by solely thoughts of the other woman. </p><p><b>Rio:</b> I’m just amazing like that. Get used to it, babe.</p><p><b>Rio:</b> BTW, your guest room looks like a fucking master suite at the Hilton.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>I’m offended. It’s so much nicer than that filth. </p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Actually, my room is better. </p><p><b>Agatha: </b>But don’t you worry, you’ll get to see it soon enough ;)</p><p>The thrill that settles on Rio’s heaving chest will disallow her from sleeping soundly, she knows. Her dreams will be haunted by the innuendo hidden in Agatha’s words. She can only secretly hope, as per the other woman’s own words, it does come sooner rather than later. </p><p><b>Rio:</b> I’ll hold you to that, sweetheart.</p><p>Before Agatha can respond back, Rio sends over a quick picture of her in bed. It is rather risqué for her own liking, something she has never done, yet it comes easy when knowing who the person receiving it will be. She can only hope Agatha will enjoy the small token of her appreciation for having let her stay in the guest room.</p><p><b>Rio:</b> Goodnight, sweet girl. I’ll be thinking of you. </p><hr/><p>
<b>Translations:</b>
</p><p>Preciosa = Beautiful</p><p>“Pero claro que sí, mi amor.” = “But of course, my love.”</p><p>“Solo es cuestión de tiempo. Cuando sea el momento indicado, te veré <em> toda.” = </em> It’s only a matter of time. When the right moment comes, I’ll see <em> all </em>of you.”</p><p>Coño = fuck <em> (this is what it means in Puerto Rico given that Rio is Puerto Rican, in other countries ‘coño’ may mean ‘pussy’) </em></p><p>“Te voy a dar mucho más, bebé. Todo lo que te mereces. Yo te lo doy sin pensar.” = I’ll give you much more, baby. Everything you deserve. I will give it all to you without thinking.”</p>

<span>With the month of November being put into motion, halfway over already, the trees carry no substance. They stand tall and proud in their nude forms awaiting for the cold breezes to buffet them into shivers. The remainder of the mostly-brown leaves crinkle as they are blown away into the depths of forestry areas, leaving the town of Westview desolate with not even a single soul daring waltz across its freezing streets. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So far, this has been the third week Rio has found herself entering the O’Connor residence on a nearly daily basis. She shudders as she jogs up the steps to the front door, her arms making quick work to cover her body with a warm hug. Yet, that is not nearly enough to shield her from the mean gust that threatens to drop bouts of hypothermia her way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She knocks ones, her gloves hands barely unmoving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then twice, her desperation growing as her teeth titter against one another. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And before she can dare let out a third knock, the door is promptly open. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi Ms. Vidal!” A chirpy Nicholas greets her. He waves at her through the screen door which she pulls open in an instant. Albeit quite the painful experience at first, he proudly shows off his signed cast with numerous names, messages, and drawings over it. The small bunny covering the area of the palm of his hand was one Rio took a few seconds to doodle. “Mom said she’d be back soon and she’s gonna bring burgers!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s amazing, Nico,” she scuffles the head atop his head that seemingly grows longer as the days pass. Not that she will reveal the tidbit to his mother given he entrusted his teacher that his sole reasoning was to feel closer to the matriarch. Although they are not related by blood, he hopes to look the part. “¿Dónde está tú hermano, papito?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s upstairs with Eddie studying for yucky finals,” Nicholas shrugs as he makes his way back to the dining room table. There, he has a flurry of pictures he has drawn alongside assignments his school has asked him to complete. While he has been back for a week, Rio never stops visiting him. Yet no one makes mention of it. “Billy’s upset he can’t use the car and now he’s stuck here with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, he did a very bad thing.” Rio frees herself from the coat that she wastes no time in hanging by the rack. Her feet kick off the boots she wears, lining them up by the front door as per Agatha’s instructions. Just the past week, the realtor had berated his son for making a mess of the floorboards with his mud-stained Converse shoe. “Now, what do you need help with today?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Math,” he huffs. “It’s always math. Why can’t it be as fun as your History and Spanish classes?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s only so much you can do with numbers,” Rio giggles. “But I promise Mrs. Hart tries very hard to make it fun for her students. Not as fun as my class, obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Obviously,” the kid parrots. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them spend quite some time going from assignment to assignment. Not that there is much to complete in the first grade, but with the aversion Nicky has to mathematics, it becomes quite tedious to tutor him. It is not as though Rio thrives on the topic, yet is knowledgeable enough to share her tips and tricks with the boy. Unlike Agatha who constantly bickers about how ‘they’ – Rio is unsure who – have changed math. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither is sure how, but there comes a point in the afternoon, once the sun sets at the early hour of five, where their hands are focused on sketching away in their given papers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ms. Vidal?” Nicholas suddenly speaks out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can call me Rio,” the woman warmly smiles. “Dime, mijo.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s a soulmate?” His mind shifts to the remembrance of a conversation he overheard his mother carry out over the phone. That along with the slew of students who mentioned the word across the school piqued his curiosity. “Everyone talks about it, but no one wants to tell me what it is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wonders about the appropriateness of revealing such information to the boy. Perhaps Agatha has her reasons for remaining quiet about it, but as she stares at him, his eyes twinkling under the warm light of the dining room, she simply cannot help herself. She hates how adorable the child is for his own good. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, a soulmate is a partner for life. Some people have soulmates, others don’t. But soulmates have matching tattoos they get at some point in their lives. It’s not easy, but once you find that person whose tattoo matches yours, you are bound to them for life,” Rio says, her fingers fiddling with the pencil in her hand. “It is said to be the purest form of love. Soulmates can be partners, but they can also be friends or family members. Just whoever the universe decides is the one who connects you to the world. Who makes you feel alive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the boy digests the newfound information, he cutely taps his chin. “Is that why my mommy is all alone? Because she doesn’t have a soulmate?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, your mommy isn’t really alone. She’s got you and your brother.” Rio hesitates before adding to her sentence. “She’s also got me if she needs it. We’re a little village protecting her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have a soulmate?” He wonders with wide eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Somewhere out there, I do. I just haven’t found them yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them carry on their respective drawings. At times Nicky takes a peek at that beside him, frowning at the familiarity of the person being pictured. He cannot help but see the resemblance to his mother, but simply shrugs it off as a coincidence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you going to be my new mom?” The comment causes the woman to freeze more than she has outdoors. She does not know it is one he has rehearsed with his brother often as the two scheme for the women to join together as a couple. “I heard you and my mommy talking at the hospital. Are you guys married now? Is she your soulmate?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your mommy and I are just good friends, honey.” But she cannot help but allow the words to seep deeply into her. There was no doubt the two share quite the connection, but perhaps it is solely their respective loneliness which drives them close. Yet, Rio humors it, even for one second. And during the miniscule amount of time where she grants herself just the slightest bit of hope, there is an unabashed happiness she cannot console. “I was just doing her a few favors while you were there.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Much to her dismay, Nick does have a point. Rio has found it quite difficult to take things other than slow with the other woman. Walking on eggshells is not an easy feat. Yet, for the sake of Agatha and her ever-so busy life, she does whatever is required to keep her afloat. But as time passes and their hearts become further intertwined without a spoken word about being something beyond friends, Rio grows impatient. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She simply needs to take what she wants for herself. And Agatha proves to be quite the prize to earn herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you please be my second mom?” The boy begs, his bottom lip sticking out adorably. “Mommy is all sad and alone. But she gets happy when she sees you. Please make her smile again. Maybe when she comes back home, you can give her a hug and make her so, so happy!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll try my best,” Rio sheepishly laughs, ignoring his question. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pinky promise?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With her pinky finger stuck out, the teacher makes a note of interlacing it with the young boy’s. The promise is set in stone, and while she does not immediately wrap her arms around his mother as soon as she comes back home, heaving off the cold she brings, she waits and waits for the perfect opportunity. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It doesn’t come until after Nicky downs the entirety of his food. He is sent off to shower with a full-stomach, and albeit a rowdy boy, his disappearance sprinkles silence over the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They have not shared a word other than a quick greeting, but Rio is the one who takes the reins. With Agatha engrossed in cleaning the kitchen counter from the night’s dinner, a pair of arms wrap themselves around their waist, unknowingly brushing past the crossroads rune tattoo stricken over the flesh. They are alien, carrying a newfound feeling to them – a feeling of passion. Their strength is enough to hold her up as she melts into the embrace. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We haven’t been able to talk,” Rio notes. She doesn’t hesitate when setting her chin over the other woman’s shoulder, her breath buffeting Agatha who cannot help but hum in approval. “You should come over this weekend. Stay the night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s up with this confidence?” Agatha cannot help the amusement that befalls her. Her eyes flicker over Rio’s lips, practically calling out for her. But she doesn’t budge just yet. “Cat got your tongue, Vidal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ya no aguanto más,” Rio breathes out. “Lo peor de todo es que sabes muy bien lo que haces. Bruja malvada.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Moi?” Her teasing nature only strengthens when faced with such raw intensity. “It’s not like you’re brave enough to do anything about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you calling me a coward?” Rio challenges. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were the one to say it. I’m innocent.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A pair of lips find themselves threading across the expanse of the back of Agatha’s neck. They pepper about, exploring the newfound area before moving further towards her shoulder. It is not long until they reach her jaw, where little bites are added to the mix. The actions fuel the fire that her body is lit into, but she never even begs for them to cease. No, she wants them to remain forever. To have Rio relinquishing such lewd attention to her night and day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The grip over her waist grows rougher until nails, even if short, dig into the skin there through the fabric of her clothes. Through her life, each of them had numerous partners, yet none made them experience such passion. The tension they held had grown for the weeks since they had first met. And now, it is just about to burst in a manner neither can control. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pero que belleza,” Rio cannot contain her desires as she gently nips Agatha's soft skin. “You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting for this. How long I’ve had to hold myself back. It’s been torture. But you enjoy that, don’t you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re acting as if I wasn’t tormented in the same way.” Her voice is low and husky. Such a wondrous sound in itself nearly makes Rio’s knees buck. “Go on. Claim your prize, toots. You and I both know there’s nothing we want more than each other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Time takes a halt as Agatha cranes her head just enough for her mouth to be overtaken. The touch is electrifying, nothing quite like it in the universe. The eighth wonder of the world stands before her, kissing her with an adoration unknown to mankind. Rio holds her tight, afraid to let go, while all Agatha can muster is a returned embrace as she begins turning around. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once the training wheels are off, Agatha takes hold of the brunette’s face. She clutches more than her flushed cheeks, but her heart is on the line as well. No worries, though. Agatha is gentle as she cradles them, her lips kissing away any hints of concern her beloved may have. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They kiss for what feels like graciously long hours, only stopping at times to garner air before continuing – not even the one they shared at the bar had such long lasting effects on them, ones they would not forget for weeks to come. Their bodies melt, sliding with one another as one. Rio giggles at the manner Agatha sinks her teeth, oh-so gently, onto her bottom lip, while the realtor finds herself heaving with a tongue that circles her mouth for silent permission inside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And by the time they pull back, afraid of passing out from the intensity of the moment, their features are red as they heave for air. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our fifth date will be this weekend,” Agatha confidently mumbles. Her lips are sore and wet as she beams. “Tell me when and I’ll come over. I can only hope this repeats itself by then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes glimmer at the idea. “I’ll make sure of it.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>By the time Saturday comes, Agatha finds herself drifting through the halls of the apartment building at the other side of time. A hand grips an overnight bag, one which had Billy raising his eyebrows and questioning the motive behind it. He is far too smart for his own good, but there is an annoying overtone to it. All she had done was ignore him, bid her goodbyes to the boys and Alice, before escaping through the front door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And before she can even raise a hand to ring the doorbell she stands before, she is allowed inside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome, Ms. O’Connor,” Rio sultrily greets, stepping back to allow her counterpart inside. “Make yourself at home.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Taking in the entirety of the apartment is easy for Agatha. Her eyes flicker over the warm lights that adorn the space with every object intricately placed in its designated spot. There are a few framed images of what she assumes are favored movies by the other woman, although she never expected Rio to be an enjoyer of Nolan films, whose posters fill the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If it weren’t for the two of them standing in the middle of the living room with the kitchen adjacent to it, Agatha would not have known anyone vacated the space given its pristine appearance. She could only wish her home donned the same niceties. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So this is your bachelor pad, huh?” Agatha is impressed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But at such words, Rio shrugs. She makes her way deeper into the home, learning against a wall as she waits for her counterpart to follow suit. “Not a bachelor anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No?” Her attention is caught as she drops the bag on the floor before standing in front of the woman. “And pray tell, who is lucky enough to have your hand?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I don’t know. There is this one woman I haven’t been able to stop thinking about.” Rio begins. “Her sons are adorable, but nothing quite like her. She’s an enchantress, a witch if you will. She’s got me under a spell I don’t feel like breaking out of. And she knows full-well how desperate I am to make her mine. Sound familiar?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm, not really. Maybe you can jog my mind a bit?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re incorrigible,” Rio huffs. “How adorable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The gap between them is filled as Rio takes a step forward. She crashes her lips with Agatha’s, making them hers in an instant. This time, though, her arms wrap themselves over the woman’s neck as a pair of hands settle on her hips, pulling her closer. They stay there for a handful of minutes, the passion of their kiss growing monumentally. With the freshness of their relationship, unlabeled as it may be, it will become quite the hurdle to go on a second without embracing one another. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the night passes, Rio drags the woman off to her balcony. It is not spacious enough for her liking, yet they are able to comfortably sit with her legs perched over the veranda staring off at the moonlight. The temperatures won’t drop any lower for a few hours, something they take advantage of. But the half-empty bottle of whiskey sitting between them on a small table is enough to warm the heart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha focuses on taking sip after sip of her glass, from the corner of her azure eyes she catches a glimpse of the other woman gripping a small stick between her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You smoke?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But by then, Rio is far too engrossed with the item in her mouth as her hands make quick work to flick the lighter over its tip. “Sometimes. It beats murdering someone when things get too chaotic. Besides, I'd rather smoke this than my cigarettes right now.” She pauses as she takes a small hit, the psychological effects already bringing her a blanket of relief. “My mother keeps trying to set me up with some women at her church. As if I’d drive to Connecticut for a booty-call.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re already thinking of other women, huh? Quite the womanizer you are,” Agatha teases as she takes another sip of her drink. “So she’s supportive. Your mother, I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“In her own way I guess. She was disappointed when I came out, I could tell. But I think at some point she realized there’s nothing anyone could do. So now she has settled for trying to get me with a nice and honest Christian lady.” Rio puffs out a cloud of smoke, the tar mixture that seeps into her vocal chords burning lovingly. Oh how badly does she love succumbing to a fuzzier headspace than ever. “I take it yours was…not supportive to say the least.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s putting it lightly,” Agatha shakes her head. “I can’t count how many scars my mother gave me, both physical and mental. The worst came when she caught me kissing Becky Isles on the couch while she was supposed to be sleeping. I frankly can’t tell you how I survived.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” her fingers grip the joint, nearly tearing it in half as she listens in to true nature behind Agatha’s mother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t want pity, she can’t have it. Otherwise it will simply be internalized as she will too begin wallowing in her sadness once more. Although even during certain days, the remembrance of her mother’s treatment of her leaves the poor woman with puffy eyes unable to let go of any more threatening tears. “It was a long time ago, it’s fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it’s not.” Rio scoffs, her anger seeping through the pores. Her mind cannot easily comprehend, not does it want it, why a parent would ever treat their child as lesser. “Clearly your brain thinks it was just yesterday. I can’t say I know what it’s like to have such a monster as a parent, but I don’t want you minimizing it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, toots. You really are a sweetheart,” with her free hand, Agatha reaches out to land it atop Rio’s. “Enough about my shitty mom. What’s yours like?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She is the most stereotypical Puerto Rican mother there is. A helicopter mother who still considers me a baby. I guess that’s what comes with being the younger sibling.” Inhaling the dread leaves, Rio coughs slightly. Yet the action drives a wave of peace through her. Relaxing against her chair, she can feel her eyelids growing heavy. “She wanted me to be a lawyer like my father and every godforsaken member of my family, pero puñeta did she annoy me with that. And because none of her family members got the chance to get a higher education, she drilled into us the importance of it. Maybe that’s why I enjoy teaching. Some people aren’t lucky enough to have someone be patient and supportive through learning different things in life. And I want my students to learn beyond that of their books. They should learn about navigating through life. You see them as little kids one day, then the next they’re off to college.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You couldn’t have said it any better,” Agatha says. “I’ve only had five years with them. Is it selfish not to want to let Billy go just yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That means your care, honey. Not a lot of parents are like that. I’m telling you, some of them joke about wanting to rid themselves of their kids. Their elementary school kids,” Rio emphasizes. “What did lead you to adopt?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to think I’m crazy.” Agatha pours herself more liquid courage to properly carry out the conversation. But the expression on Rio’s face reassures her of a positive response. “I’m not religious, but ever since I was a little girl, I prayed for someone to save me. It was just Evanora and I in a shitty little cottage in Salem. It’s like she was so ashamed of my existence, she wanted to keep me away from everything. Because a monster like me shouldn't have the opportunity to feel happiness in life. She said other kids at school were born lucky, but that I was lucky to even be born.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words bring a chill down Rio’s spine. Their harrowing significance leaves her sober as she pulls away from the joint long enough to draw her eyes to Agatha’s crestfallen expression. She tries hard not to cry, realizing her counterpart, who lived the horrors herself, fails at doing the same. The tears in her eyes are accented by the moonlight. But even when she cries, Agatha is the most gorgeous specimen Rio has had the pleasure of facing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ay mi amor…” Rio squeezes her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve always wanted children of my own. And while I get some people prefer to have them be biologically related to them, I wished for the opposite. All I wanted was to save a kid the way no one ever saved me.” A sniffle rings out as she downs yet another glass of alcohol. “That maybe I could make a difference in their lives.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you have.” But when Agatha hands her an incredulous look, Rio continues. “I’m serious. You’ve raised a pair of the most amazing kids I’ve had the pleasure of meeting. Teenagers are horrible creatures, but Billy has such a beautiful heart. Nico is intuitive and so aware of other’s emotions. Just the other day he asked if I could lend him some markers so he could handcraft a condolences note to Tommy because his dog died. You did just as you wanted. You ended the cycle with them. Now it’s time to end it within, Ags.” Fingers interlaced themselves with Rio squeezing tightly. “And I’ll be here every step of the way. You don’t have to keep watching out for everyone now that someone’s got your back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But by then, the tears that rush down her reddened cheeks are ambiguous – she is unsure of whether to drown in her misery or be joyous to have found someone like Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Breathing in the scent of pot, Agatha hums. While life with her mother had been tumultuous to say the least, there were moments of beauty during it. Her and Wanda used to sneak away to smoke underneath the bleachers at their school’s football field. She had been her only friend in a world full of assholes. At some point, while not working in the long-run, they became more than that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And for those moments of happiness, she would forever be grateful to the redhead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I used to be Agatha Harkness,” she reveals as the ambiance quiets down far too much for her liking. Silence is what her mother tormented her with regardless of her insistent begging to be simply looked at. “My mother was a grade-A bitch. I got the hell out of dodge as soon as I could. I made a name for myself with the one I picked. I’ve never looked back since.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Harkness is quite the name alright.” With the next hit Rio takes, her mind begins growing fuzzier. “Shame you had to change it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shame indeed. All because of that cold-hearted asshole. Evanora Harkness is the meanest bitch alive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, here’s to hoping she’s rotting six-feet-under somewhere,” Rio cruelly pipes up, but is surprised by Agatha’s positive response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now </span>
<em>
<span>that’s</span>
</em>
<span> a toast.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Grabbing her untouched glass of whiskey, Rio dings it with the empty one before her. The alcohol burns brighter than the weed. It boils down her throat, making her hiss at the delicious pain both bring at once. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How rude of me, I didn’t ask if you wanted some.” Rio offers the nearly-finished stick. “Here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No thank you. Weed makes me…you know,” Agatha refuses to face the other woman at first, but then she does, her cheeks turn pink. All she received in exchange is a puzzled look from Rio, whose effects by the weed are seemingly better than her own. “It makes me horny. And since we talked about taking things slow, I’d rather not go back on our agreement.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No kidding.” The way Rio’s face lights up in an instant makes Agatha roll her eyes with amusement. “Is that really so bad?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who’s the incorrigible one now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But with such an image stuck in her mind, Rio swears it will be impossible to focus on anything else through the night. “Can’t blame a girl for trying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll get there, sweetheart.” Agatha promises. Her breath hitches at the manner she is adored by Rio’s suddenly-glowing orbs. Such desire is not something people had for her, but it is enough to rub on Agatha’s dim ego. “Don’t worry, I’m not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll hold you to that, O’Connor.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Given the lack of a guest room at the apartment, she ends up resting beside the one woman who, thankfully, will not leave her mind even in her sleep. Agatha feels exposed as she lays down, her face turned away as the bed dips. She is well-aware nothing will happen, neither wants to move so quickly, yet she cannot help the disappointment that settles into her stomach at such a boring thought. </span>
</p><p>
<span>To have Rio in such close proximity and only be able to kiss her is a true torture the universe inflicts upon her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you think any harder than you already are, you’re going to give yourself a brain aneurysm,” Rio laughs as she comfortably sneaks beneath the sheets. “¿Qué pasó, calabacita?” But at the incredulous look Agatha gives her, she is forced to clarify. “I’m going to call you every name under the sun, so get used to it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re adorable,” Agatha mutters. “Come here, let me see something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Obedient as it were, Rio does as she is told. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their lips are only centimeters apart as their breaths are encapsulated by one another. In the comfort of the room, nothing matters. Not their jobs, not their children, not their families. No. It is only the two of them there, listening to the rhythmic way as the other’s chests rise up and down. The calmness it brings them is titillating with such closeness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A hand reaches out for Rio’s face. For the second time that week, Agatha finds herself holding it carefully. It is that of a porcelain doll who she refuses to allow to break. So vulnerable, so fragile. Yet so hers. Her finger traces up the blemishes on Rio’s almost-clear skin. Its tip ghosts over a tender nose which scrunches at the ticklish touch. Lips are outlined back and forth, up and down. Agatha memorizes the feeling of them against her hand, and when she closes her eyes, she can picture the entirety of her counterpart’s beauty without missing a beat. On nights where loneliness is present, the memories will preclude it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How?” She finds herself asking, eyes unmoving as they remain hypnotized by the teacher. “How did I end up here? How can someone be this…this exquisite?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Those same lips find themselves peppering kisses across the expanse of Agatha’s hand, leaving traces of faint lipstick in their wake. “Siento que el universo te trajo aquí por una razón. Tengo una idea de lo que es, pero me emociona esperar a estar segura. Ay, mi reina. Pero qué belleza tienes. Y yo aquí enamorándome aún más cada día. No me parece justo.” She breathes in the scent of vanilla from Agatha’s lotion, her words slightly mumbled with skin sliding against her mouth. “Tú eres tan hermosa y yo aquí no tengo ni la oportunidad de decir que no. Bueno, tampoco la quisiera.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No fair,” Agatha pouts. “I might have to get a tutor so I can catch up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be your tutor,” a tongue sticks out. Filled with unabashed confidence, Rio sensually runs it along the palm of the realtor’s hand. The process is oh-so slow, but by the gods does it awaken something within Agatha. “But that’ll cost you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pray tell, how would I repay you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she doesn’t answer and not for a lack of wanting to. A pair of lips overtakes her. They carry fervor as they freeze her, making it impossible for her to even breathe. And when she eventually returns the kiss, her strength is no match to the vigor displayed towards her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can think of a few ways,” Rio husks against her lips. A hand traces down her body, but stops right at Agatha’s hip – she will not dare go further, not tonight anyway. And once again, unbeknownst to her, the crossroads runes burn Agatha’s skin. Simultaneously, the same hidden marking urges Rio for more. "You know, Nicky asked if I was going to be his mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did he?” Agatha raises her eyebrows playfully at her son’s antics – he truly is hers. “Well, depending on how you behave yourself, he may have one by the time his birthday comes around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’d keep me waiting until June? Oh, you little devil,” Rio licks her lips hungrily. “You’re going to drive me crazy if you keep being you. I don’t know how the world has been able to handle Agatha O’Connor without falling to its knees.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll just have to see how you fare. You had me making out with you in my kitchen and now I’m sleeping with you.” The literal sense of it is disappointing, but eventually the innuendo will become reality. “I think you’re coming close to winning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them nuzzle closer together in a manner that makes it impossible to move without bumping the other. Yet, they remain that way, humming about as they quietly stare into the other’s enchanting eyes. Although the day is ending, both wish to share this moment for the rest of time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be going out of town for Thanksgiving to visit my family and again for Christmas Eve,” Rio suddenly states. “But maybe I’ll stick around for New Year’s if you’ll have me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha presses their forehead together as a smile overtakes her features. “I’d like that. A lot, actually.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<b>Translations: </b>
</p><p>
<span>“¿Dónde está tú hermano, papito?” = “Where’s your brother, little man,” (yes, papi can mean daddy, but in the context that it is used, it refers to ‘little man’ and it is very common to refer to other people as ‘papi’ and ‘mami’ as a simple term of endearment even between friends/strangers)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Mijo = kid (although it literally translates to “my child/my son” as it stems from “mi hijo,” in this context, and because it is used as a term of endearment in Puerto Rico for children, partners, strangers, friends, etc., the closest I can relate it to is ‘kid’)</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ya no aguanto más. Lo peor de todo es que sabes muy bien lo que haces. Bruja malvada.” = ‘I can’t handle it anymore. The worst thing is that you know full-well what you’re doing. Evil witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pero que belleza.” = “What beauty.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“pero puñeta” = “but fuck”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ay mi amor.” = “Oh my love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Calabacita = Little pumpkin/zucchini (depending on if you’re translating it literally or not)</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Siento que el universo te trajo aquí por una razón. Tengo una idea de lo que es, pero me emociona esperar a estar segura. Ay, mi reina. Pero qué belleza tienes. Y yo aquí enamorándome aún más cada día. No me parece justo.” = “I feel like the universe brought you here for a reason. I have an idea of what it is, but I’m excited to wait until I’m right. Oh, my queen. What beauty you have. And here I am falling more each day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tú eres tan hermosa y yo aquí no tengo ni la oportunidad de decir que no. Bueno, tampoco la quisiera.” = “You’re so beautiful and here I don’t even have the opportunity to say no. Well, not that I’d want it anyway.”</span>

<span>At the sight of the store, Agatha sighs. The bags she carries weigh on her shoulders as her hands turn red. She purses her lips, eyeing the fabric plastered on a plastic mannequin through the display. To see that an inanimate object had better curves than her own leaves a sour taste in her mouth. And as she-</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, what do we have here?” A voice shakes her from her thoughts. “Are you planning on dressing up for someone, </span>
<em>
<span>Aggie</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you call me that again, I’ll run you over with my car,” she huffs, turning on her heel to leave the store far from her sights. “Let’s go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hot on her feet, Rio matches her speed with a shit-eating grin not being dissuaded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t answer my question,” comes the teasing tone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Even with flushed cheeks, stemming from being caught ogling at the Victoria’s Secret lingerie collections from afar, Agatha grasps at her feisty persona. “I make a note of ignoring stupid questions. You should know that by now, Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Originally Agatha had planned on coming alone to upkeep Santa Claus’ duties. Leaving her sons behind at Alice’s place, who would secretly take them out to eat all the junk food their hearts could desire, she set off on her journey. But with the ever-so proper timing Rio has, a simple call ended with the teacher being picked up as the two of them set off to their designated location. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With already bags-full of presents, Agatha continues to waltz across the expanse of the mall with Rio, who barely carries a bag with perfume for her mother, making the endeavors quite entertaining. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why did you want to come out to Paramus again?” Rio, searching for any semblance of a conversation, asks. “Westview has a perfectly functional mall.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Which sucks,” Agatha finishes. “Besides, I don’t want to risk running into the boys. Lord knows Alice will be dragging them all around time searching for a thrill. The little one still believes in Santa so I need to go the extra mile.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Isn’t he old enough to know the truth by now?” Rio furrows her eyebrows. As she takes in the flat appearance Agatha carries, she giggles. “Guess not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With Rio nudging herself into the reality of the O’Connors, she carries out her own quest. Albeit in secrecy, she runs off on numerous occasions, purchasing sets of times for the boys as well as their mother. Agatha wonders aloud if she should keep her on a leash – with the tease Rio becomes at the question, finding an innuendo where there was none, she regrets it dismally. </span>
</p><p>
<span>School has come to a momentary end for the holidays. While Agatha cannot be more thrilled about being able to spend more time with her boys, there are times she locks herself up in her office to carry out even a smidge of work that Nicky is quite fond of interrupting. At times she thanks Rio for coming over and keeping them entertained long enough to let the woman catch her breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Regardless of their growing closeness, Agatha can’t quite put her finger on why or how it has taken such a quick turn. In a matter of weeks, Rio has clasped herself around the entirety of her life. They share good morning and goodnight texts on a daily basis, at times finding themselves in one another’s places just-because, and even stealing quick kisses when no one watches. Although an unofficial relationship, the thrill of having such passion with another person brings Agatha to life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pots and pans?” Rio cannot help herself but point out as she watches the other woman’s hand ghost over them. “Are you getting a second stovetop to use them all simultaneously?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m pretty sure my friend Alice lives off of paper plates and ramen noodles. Funny thing is, she’s the one that earns the most commissions on a monthly basis. And her mother is the one-and-only Lorna Wu,” Agatha shakes her head at the irony of it all. “Poor girl needs some structure in her life. And she’s in her early thirties.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio makes a mental note to further question her counterpart about the singer’s daughter, but instead chooses to tease further. She can’t help herself. Not really. “Are you raising her too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mommy never takes a break, toots,” Agatha licks her lips. “It’s a part of me now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t say,” Rio whispers, ignoring how the mention of the title makes her stomach flutter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time noon wraps up, the two women march out of the mall with hands-full of bags. They barely fit into the car, but alas, with enough stubbornness shared between the two, they make it work. They were willing to stay at the parking lot for the rest of the night if it meant doing so. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now that Nicky is on break, I don’t have an excuse to see you every day.” Upon reaching Rio’s apartment, Agatha says. She had welcomed herself inside under the guise of bringing in presents, only to end up melting against the comfortable couch – her body threatening to fall asleep after such a long day already. “Bummer.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t need an excuse, baby. I’m right here.” Plopping herself down next to the auburn-haired woman, Rio hums. She takes hold of the limp hand that lays on a thigh covered by loose jeans. As fingers intertwined, she cannot help but be mesmerized by the sight. It is just right. A true defining trait of perfection. “You can always come over if you’d like us to have some privacy. My door is always open for you. Well, for </span>
<em>
<span>all </span>
</em>
<span>of you too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The comment perfectly creates a warmth in her chest. She never expected all those months before at the bar to have found a person to not only prioritize her, but her children as well. For far too long she has held herself back from enjoying the finer things in life. But now she will not cease to enjoy every single part of Rio she has to offer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you doing anything for New Year’s?” There is silence from beside her. “Come over. We would love to have you. It’ll just be the four of us and some of my coworkers who have nowhere better to be. If you show up, I’ll think about letting you kiss me at midnight. But </span>
<em>
<span>only </span>
</em>
<span>if you earn it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Leaning forth, their breath buffeting one another, Rio grins. “I better be the only one you convince with that tactic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jealous much?” But she doesn’t need a response, not when the brunette’s voice is husky and fueled by passion. By the gods does she crave Agatha; just the way Agatha does her. “Green does look really good on you. Among other things,” she points out. “What do you say, pretty girl?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio doesn’t respond immediately, not verbally anyway. She takes the opportunity to grab hold of Agatha’s lips that beg to be overtaken. A hand lands over a blushing cheek, caressing it with the utmost gentleness while her kiss does the opposite. Regardless of how much the realtor fights back, it is Rio who leads. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And even when they pull back, heaving with bruised, glossy lips, Rio doesn’t remain silent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be there.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“Mami?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The longer the boy spends around his homeroom teacher, the more fluent he becomes in the foreign language. He has taken to referring to numerous items or people using newfound words he learns. There is an unabashed sense of pride that befalls upon the small child as others around him glimmer at his knowledge. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Without missing a beat, he climbs over the queen-sized bed, using it as a trampoline before dropping next to his mother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Nicky?” She tears her eyes away from her phone. Months before she would fall asleep after reading a handful of chapters from whatever book she could find at home, while lately she has begun sleeping soundly only after conversing with Rio for a few minutes…or hours.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is Rio gonna come over for Christmas? If we let Santa know, maybe he can bring her presents here,” Nicholas beams at the thought. “I don’t want her to be alone for Christmas. If Eddie gets to come over, how come she doesn’t?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio is a grown woman, sweetheart. She can do whatever she wants,” she laughs. “But she won’t be alone. She’ll be with her family in Connecticut.” The manner her son’s face falls breaks the woman’s heart. She pulls him close, developing him in a warm hug. “But she </span>
<em>
<span>might </span>
</em>
<span>come over for New Year’s. Doesn’t that sound like fun? We get to celebrate a whole new year with her by our side.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guess so,” he shrugs. With his head moving to lay over his mother’s chest, the boy pouts. “I made her something. Can I give it to her next time she comes over? I bet Santa will bring her all sorts of cool toys like he always does for me, but I made her the coolest picture ever!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah? Do you want to show mama?” The way in which he shakes his head without hesitation makes her eyebrows rise. “Can you tell me what you drew then? Just a little clue.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s our family. I drew you, Billy, Eddie, me, Señor Scratchy, and even Rio!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That sounds amazing, sweetheart. I bet it looks beautiful.” Running a hand through his hair, Agatha feels tears threatening to fall. They come with an unmistakable joy she cannot shake off. To see her sons grow fonder of her part- </span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span>, her</span>
<em>
<span> “friend”</span>
</em>
<span> with each passing day grants her a sense of peace she has never found. She clings to it, never daring to let go. Once upon a time, her mother cursed her with a life full of misery, but now that she can take matters into her own hands, Agatha will bathe in her happiness for the rest of time. “So, you really like Rio, huh? She told me you had asked her to be your mom. Are you trying to replace me, little bug?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nu-uh!” He appears indignant by the accusation. “You’re silly, mommy. Billy and I were just trying to get you to be really, really good friends. Like, the ones who get married and share yucky kisses.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, really?” Her interest is piqued. “And what else did you and Billy do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uhm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He thinks back to the time Billy used his mothers phone to get Rio to come over during a rather cold night with flurries falling from the sky. Agatha had been confused yet pleasantly pleased by the appearance of the woman. That alongside using her card to send the teacher flowers had been rather fun; although, Billy was confused as to how his mother never noticed so many charges for flowers, but instead simply accepted the affections she received from Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to tell me, hon. You and Billy can keep your little secrets.” A hand traces over his cheek. “What matters is that you both are comfortable with mommy’s friend. I would never want to bring someone home that makes my boys feel bad. Do you understand?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, mommy.” He sticks out the pinky finger on his good hand, a motion his mom follows. “I pinky promise I love, </span>
<em>
<span>love </span>
</em>
<span>Ms. Rio. Billy says she’s really funny too. And sometimes she gives him tips on how to make his make-up better. Even when it looks silly.” Nicky is careful not to accidentally hit his mother with the cast – which has occurred far too often – as she nuzzles himself closer. “She makes me and Billy happy, mama. Does she make you happy too? You smile lots now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With her mind on the woman who sits waiting for a text back across town, Agatha nods. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, baby.” She feels her phone buzz again. At the sight of a kissy-face emoji being sent followed by a quick ‘what are you doing?’, Agatha chuckles. “Rio makes mama really happy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>It causes her a sense of amazement to see how easily her children take to being around Rio. Their personalities are matching, something she has noted through the weeks. Sometimes she muses that the other woman acts in more motherly manners than herself. And with each adorable vignette she is witness to, the euphoria she experiences grows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Close your eyes, Nicky. You’re exhausted,” Agatha points out. “Mama’s here. Don’t you worry about a thing.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>In the week prior to Christmas looming over, Agatha finds herself huffing atop a pile of pristinely-wrapped presents. She has spent the better time of her days in secrecy tending to each and every item she bought. Luckily Billy was a rather low-maintenance kid whose current needs came in the form of money or video games, but the same could not be said for his brother who would receive quite the collection of Legos from his dear friend ‘Santa’. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As a woman huffs as she walks into the living room she has overtaken, Agatha looks up. At the sight of a rather fuming Rio, she shakes her head sympathetically.</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your mom, I assume?” It’s an obvious assumption. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When is it not?” Rio throws herself on the couch. After a tedious amount of training, Agatha had taught her how to properly help her wrap presents without making them have a similar appearance to that of Frankenstein’s monster. “Apparently Valeria is a </span>
<em>
<span>really </span>
</em>
<span>sweet woman of God who has even more tattoos than I do. But she always puts the Lord first and just so happens to be single. Lucky me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You never told me you had tattoos.” The thought in itself makes her heart race. “What are they?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You never asked. But don’t worry, you’ll find out soon enough.” Rio throws a teasing wink her way, her anger subsiding momentarily. “Well, unless Valeria and I decide to get hitched. My mom says she’s quite the cook and is Honduran. Guess that equates to the perfect wife.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re already leaving me for another woman. How dare you?” Agatha feigns distress. “You’ll never find a better cook than me. When I’m in the mood anyway. I make a mean lasagna.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Coming to kneel before her, hands fall down on Agatha’s lap. She grips them lovingly before planting a soft, yet longing kiss on the woman’s waiting lips. Since the first day they shared their first passionate embrace without the help of alcohol, neither has been able to go seconds without repeating the endeavors. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish I could bring you with me,” Rio says. “Maybe next year? You’ve never had a Puerto Rican Christmas.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can count on it. For now, we can have New Year’s.” Agatha leans in for another kiss, but is disappointed when Rio pulls back. The pout in her face is one her counterpart can barely resist. “No?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, of course. But…” Lips cascade alongside Agatha’s jaw, peppering along it sweetly. “It’ll be impossible to keep my hands off you. Con este cuerpazo que me tiene loca. No lo puedo resistir.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Patience, love. And maybe then I’ll reward you with something </span>
<em>
<span>sweet</span>
</em>
<span>.” A hand sneaks up from underneath the shirt, unknowingly revealing a hint of the crossroads marking she had forgotten the existence of. As it encloses around her breasts through her bra, Agatha hums. “Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Her tone drips of innocence, but Agatha knows she’s the devil in disguise – that won’t keep her from letting herself be taken to the depths of hell. “It’s nothing I haven’t done before. Besides, you seemed to like it a lot last time. Don’t you want me to make you feel good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know it does,” Agatha husks back. “I’m mostly scared I won’t know when to stop. And I have a lot I need to get wrapped. But of course here you come being so very distracting. Tsk.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Little old me?” Rio widens her eyes in surprise. She pulls back, sitting upright on her knees before Agatha who shudders at the sudden lack of touch upon her. “Whatever you want, m’lady. I’ll control myself. Which, by the way, is something you make really difficult.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good girl.” The offhand praise makes Rio hum with delight. “Now, finish up wrapping Billy’s presents. I have a few more boxes for Nicky to wrap. I really shouldn’t be fueling that boy’s Lego addiction more than I already have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them sit in a comfortable bout of silence with nothing but the faint sound of Tony Bennett singing in the background from Rio’s record player. At times they rise to stretch out their limbs which grow sore as the time passes. But the peace which they bask on never ceases. Not when Billy calls asking Agatha if she could bring some food whenever she returns – which she replies to with a stern ‘we have food at home’ but will inevitably make her child’s wishes come true. Not when Agatha grows tired of plastering pieces of tape on the Bluey-themed wrapping paper, leading Rio to cordially take over for her. And not when Rio rises briefly, only to come back with two cups of searing hot chocolate, coated with a rather obscene amount of whipped cream for her own, which she places on the coffee table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As a pair of brown eyes flickers outside the window, a smirk comes alive. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Looks like it’s snowing,” Rio points out. It is the early hours of the evening, but the sky appears almost pitch black. Small flurries fall from its darkness, slowly trickling over the floor as they solidify there. “What are the chances we get a white Christmas this year?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hopefully high,” Agatha pipes in. “It’s beautiful. As a little girl, I always loved going out and playing in the snow. Mother wasn’t fond of it. She preferred for me to spend my time locked up in my room instead of having fun outdoors.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We should go out.” It is not a question, but a statement instead. With a hand reached out, she wipes the chocolate mustache from the other woman’s face. “Don’t think about it, mor. You can borrow some of my clothes if you’d like.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When about two inches have piled up on the ground, the two make their way outdoors. At first she hesitates, but upon the feeling of magical sets of snow falling on her face, Agatha rushes off to a nearby pool of snow. Her gloved hands pick a mound of it up, giggling at how it doesn’t break off when she morphs it into a ball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>From afar, at first Rio only watches. She takes in the sight of the inner child the realtor often hides behind copious amounts of sarcasm and eye-rolls. The mentions of her mother would always allow peeks inside, but as she runs around, leaving trails of footprints on the white ground, Agatha lets it all come out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t dare stop until something hits her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Turning around, Agatha frowns. “Did you just throw a snowball at me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe,” Rio snickers. “What are you going to do about it, O’Connor?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>In her true competitive nature, Agatha is quick to gather snow in her hands and throw it back. Minutes pass that they spend fighting with the avalanche of white that they gather off the coated grass. Their breaths are visible as their bodies grow warmer with the adrenaline that shoots up. Neither can stop giggling and smiling, mirroring the children they once were. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once exhaustion sets upon them, the two women join as one for a longing kiss. Their formerly frozen lips find coziness in one another. At first it is chaste, but with the liveliness Agatha experiences, she sticks her tongue out to flatten it over Rio, who hums before allowing her to enter inside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their tattoos burn brighter than the sun who hides for the evening, but neither cares. Not as they hold up the other, their chests heaving with passion. Unable to let go even for a second. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come home to me after Christmas,” Agatha orders in jest. “I better be the one who gets to see all your tattoos instead of Valeria.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>After dropping a sweet kiss on the woman’s freezing nose, Rio nods. “Lo que digas, mi vida. No te preocupes, cuando vuelva, te enseñaré todo lo que tu alma anhela. Ya te echo de menos.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>

<p>The drive to the southern part of Connecticut resulted in a migraine that was impossible to shake off. She should have known better than to be on the roads during Christmas Eve while snow fell from the gray sky. Traffic accident after traffic accident led to a lengthy time frame. And with insistent calls to her phone wondering when she was arriving, Rio could only muster enough strength to hit her forehead against the steering wheel when deemed necessary. </p><p>Arriving at her parent’s house in the midst of the quaint town exacerbates her pain further. Luckily for her, it is only the two people responsible for birthing her who find themselves already preparing the meal for that night. Pernil takes quite the effort to cook, her mother always says. Not that Rio has ever cared enough to ask. </p><p>After having given her greetings and apologies to them for having arrived closer to the end of noon, Rio slumped herself over the chair in the kitchen island per her mother’s request; more of an order if she was being frank. </p><p>“Did you get the picture I sent you of Valeria? I don’t like those crazy doodles she has, but she is such a wonderful girl,” her mother starts, and Rio just about gets the urge to turn herself around and back to Agatha’s embrace. </p><p>“Mami, she's 43, I doubt she still constitutes as a girl.” A hand grips the glass in her hand. If it weren’t for her father having taken the initiative to finish the coquito before the guests arrived, she would have long left to find the nearest liquor store for her sake. “Besides, I’m not looking. I’m more than happy with the way things are.”</p><p>“You’re old and way past your expiration date,” Beatriz hums. “You have no choice but to look.”</p><p>“I’m sorry that not everyone wants to make mistakes at the age of 18.”</p><p>“You and your siblings weren’t mistakes. You were a blessing.” Her mother corrects. Rio muses it is the only way she can be content with her decisions. “You know, just because you have different preferences doesn’t mean you can’t have children.”</p><p>A loud groan escapes the depths of her throat. ‘<em> Maldita sea’ </em>, is all that swims in her mind. There was love that stemmed out to her mother, but oftentimes she could have rather ancient beliefs. Regardless of how many times she was corrected by all her children and husband, Beatriz had a knack of casually forgetting the proper terminology for Rio’s – as she would put – ‘choices’. </p><p>“Pero qué cojones. It’s not a preference,” Rio huffs. “Come on, you know that by now.”</p><p>“Sorry, sorry.” There is a truly apologetic tone to her, but alas, not enough of an attempt to keep it from happening again. Rio thanks the stars that she lives at a lengthy proximity from her family. Dealing with such insolence on a daily basis once again would break her mind. “You know I get confused with all this modern talk.”</p><p>“I’ll get it tattooed on my forehead so you never have to forget again,” she mumbles before taking a swing of her drink. </p><p>“¡Uy, no!” The horror Beatriz exasperates can be heard across the entire tri-state area. She gets the knife down, ceasing her motion of cutting plantains, to eye her daughter with a harsh look. “Ya deja de hacerte esos dibujitos tan feos. Eres una dama, no un pupitre de escuela pública.”</p><p>“Oh my god.” Hands move to her temples in a frail attempt to massage the pain away. “I am not having this conversation right now.”</p><p>Being enlisted into helping with the final touches to that night’s celebrations proves to be the escape Rio sought out. She prides herself in crafting the rice and chickpeas – making enough to feed a small army. At times her mother looks over her shoulder, her eyebrows furrowed as she wonders how the process is going. But after a stern expression is thrown her way, she slowly pulls away. </p><p>The surprising silence that surrounds the house allows the woman to fall deep in thought, ones which solely land on one person across state lines. </p><p>She had texted Agatha earlier in the day updating her when she was safe and sound in the Connecticut residence, but had yet to hear back. The neediness that encapsulates her soul is alien. Rio feels shame in herself for the manner in which her chest aches at the lack of responses. Surely Agatha, with two boys in her hands and some last-minute shopping left to do, is far too busy to even see the messages sent. But alas, Rio impatiently waits to be so much as perceived. </p><p>Rather than spend her lonely hours mindlessly staring at her phone, Rio busies herself outdoors. Although freezing, she dons only a wife beater with a loose-fitted half-open jacket on top. With each passing second, she brings down an ax atop a tree stump. She cannot remember when or why her father had opted to switch from store-bought firewood to their very own, but alas, it is the release she requires. </p><p>In her parent’s house, she feels like a guest. It is not her home, not anymore. Walking across those dimly-lit halls, she realizes they are odd in comparison to the ones in Agatha’s condo. They are somewhat tight and…empty. The sound of a small child howling with excitement is one she misses along with that of phone tapping the older one constantly carries forth. In a matter of months Rio has become accustomed to being part of such a sweet little family. </p><p>“You’re going to break your arm if you keep chopping up wood,” her father says. The sound of his boots sliding through the piles of snow is comforting – at least it is not her mother. “I think we have more than enough. Unless you’re planning on setting the whole house on fire.”</p><p>Following his gaze, brown eyes land on the rather tall pile of firewood; a product of her dissociative state. She shakes her head, ignoring the embarrassment that seeps into her feature at the ramifications of having Agatha loose in her thoughts. Next time she saw the woman, she would kiss her dearly for having visited her subconscious from afar. </p><p>“You never know. We might need it,” Rio mumbles back. “What if the neighbor needs it? He’s senile and lonely.”</p><p>“También es un pendejo racista. Me imagino que no vas a ir a darle toda esta madera.”</p><p>“Maybe I can burn his house,” a devilish tone takes over her. “Did you hear the news? Valeria and I are getting married. Disque tiene más tatuajes que yo y es Hondureña. Me la voy a llevar pa’ Nueva Jersey y viviremos felices por siempre.” </p><p>“You? Live happily ever after? Maybe after you get rid of those cojones you got,” Fernando giggles as he approaches his daughter. “What’s on your mind, mija? You look like you’re about to kill someone with that thing.”</p><p>Leaving the ax leaning against the wooden stump, Rio pulls at the messy gloves. “I’m not in a murderous mood. Not today at least,” she adds with a glint in her eyes. “Just thinking about something ma said. She said I need to be looking for <em> someone </em>. But papi, I think I found her. I really do.”</p><p>Fernando, with the ends of his mouth rising, grabs his daughter’s wrist. He drags her out to his workshop, which she assumes is not up to code, before sitting her beside a table full of appliances. As he situates himself by her side, the man produces a small box of cigarettes from his pocket – emptier than her own. </p><p>“I thought you quit after that cancer scare.”</p><p>All he does is smile. “That’s what your mom tells everyone. What she doesn’t know won’t kill her.”</p><p>“But it will kill you.” Alas, Rio pulls out a cigarette. She finds a lighter in her pocket – one she had inherited from her grandfather. There are flower engravings over the green object that she flicks open to set her own cigarettes along with her father’s. </p><p>“You too,” he raises his eyebrows. “Tell me about her. Who is this special person who has enchanted my daughter? She must be quite the woman with a pair of big cojones to get your attention.”</p><p>“That just about sums her up.” Rio takes a drag of the stick, her body instantly being hit with a wave of warmth before she blows the smoke into the atmosphere. “She’s a realtor and apparently a very good one.”</p><p>“Look at you getting yourself a sugar mama. Maybe she can pay for those student loans you won’t let me touch.”</p><p>Rio playfully punches her dad’s shoulder, rolling her eyes at his asinine comment. There is no doubt her parents are more than well-off – Fernando nearing retirement while Beatriz has lived in peace without the stresses of a job for almost five years. And yet, she cannot bring herself to greenlight funding for her student loans. Slowly but surely, she pays them off. Her parents worked far too hard for what they have. Rio would never live with herself if she were to take that away. </p><p>“Her name’s Agatha and she has two boys: a 16-year-old and a 7-year-old. They’re adopted, but I’m sure mami would be proud and get off my ass for the rest of time,” Rio chuckles dryly. “But papi, me siento tan feliz cuando estoy a su lado. Ni sé cómo explicarlo. It’s like her presence has…<em>something</em>. It draws me closer to her.”</p><p>“<em> Someone’s </em> in love,” Fernando sing-songs. “That’s the same way I felt about your mom when we met. Well, things were different back then. You either got married and had kids before 20 or you enlisted to make a life for yourself. I suppose I fell before I knew what I was signing up for. Lucky me.”</p><p>“Tiene los ojos azules bellos como el agua de Montones.” Her mind goes back to a popular beach in her hometown, ignoring the words her father spews. Even then, the blue from its waves are nothing compared to that which Agatha carries in her eyes. It is ingrained there for the rest of time. “Things have started picking up between us. Her youngest, Nicky, is my student and-”</p><p>“You’re dating your student’s mother? Score,” Fernando teases. </p><p>At times she wonders how the differing personalities her parents have brought them together, but she muses that is the beauty of soulmates. Her own aligns quite well with the feisty persona Agatha often carries. They were cast in the same mold. Perhaps their connection stems deeper than simply liking one another, but Rio refuses to get her hopes up in such a way. </p><p>“You should tell your mother,” he speaks again. “Ideally before we go to church tonight. Otherwise she might have the minister wed you and Valeria.”</p><p>“Lucky me.”</p><p>By the time the holiday celebrations begin, Rio does as her father advised. The conversation ended on quite the joyous tone as Beatriz, with a suspicious amount of joy, hugged her daughter. There was a faint question about when she would get to meet the O’Connors, to which the younger woman rolled her eyes and begged her mother to take it easy. That if she were to, even in the slightest manner, interject herself into the unofficial relationship, she would spend next mother’s day in her lonesome. </p><p>With the guests arriving, Rio grows anxious. The care she has for her family is best left at a distance. Her and her siblings – Rosaura and Ramón – oftentimes exchange messages when they remember one another’s existence. But with the three children they each have, Rio prefers to keep her distance. One is perfect, two is acceptable, but three is quite the handful to raise; at times she wonders how Agatha could even fair with two that were not hers originally. </p><p>Throughout the festivities, Rio, in her true introverted nature, finds herself sitting by the corner of the living room awaiting for the signal to leave. While the rest of the guests chat amicably amongst themselves, she is approached by a pair of toddler twins, Rosaura’s, who hand her a coloring book. Coming to terms with the fate, she sets herself down on the floor. As her two nieces make quick work to share an animal-themed book, using markers to paint both inside and outside the lines, the woman carefully adds hue to the princesses she finds.</p><p>By the time the entirety of the family reaches the sole church in the area that offers services in Spanish, the sky is pitch black. There are small flurries that melt as soon as they land on surfaces. Although there is no breeze in sight, the cold cast upon the town is enough to cause each individual to shiver. </p><p>Rio nearly falls asleep in the back of the church as the time passes, exhaustion overtaking her, but as her phone buzzes, she shakes herself awake. Before she can be upset at the distraction from her slumber, a smile finds itself trickling on her face. </p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Feliz víspera de navidad. </p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Nochebuena. Whatever. Google is confusing me.</p><p><b>Rio:</b> What matters is that you’re trying. Nico is running off on you, huh?</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>You’ve turned him into a little Spanish-speaking monster. He’s been teaching Billy some words all night long. He wants to open his “regalos” tonight like Ms. Vidal does. </p><p>The message makes her giggle. The fondness that has been building up through the past few months for the boys and their mother alike is one she basks in. To see that they have so much as mentioned while she is away makes her heart soar. </p><p><b>Rio: </b>I miss you. I hope that’s okay to say. </p><p><b>Agatha: </b>We’ve made out how many times now and you’re asking if that’s okay? You’re something else, Vidal. I miss you too if you were wondering. Actually, we all do.</p><p>Before she can type out a response, a picture is delivered. It shows Agatha with her arm far out, seemingly snapping the picture, who has Billy and Nicky sitting at each of her sides. They are all wearing a matching set of red and black pajamas with small pictures of green dinosaurs with Santa hats on them. </p><p><b>Agatha:</b> Sorry to spoil part of your present, but I got an extra pair for you. You can wear it for Three Kings if you’d still like to celebrate with us.</p><p><b>Rio:</b> You remembered. </p><p>Such a statement makes a slew of happy tears threaten to fall down her cheeks. Originally she had made a quickly brushed-off comment about the holiday weeks before. Agatha had joked about inserting herself in the celebrations, ones that would not be had with her family. But Rio had taken it to heart.</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> Duh. </p><p><b>Agatha: </b>How’s it going? Have you sent your mom to hell yet?</p><p><b>Rio:</b> I told her about you actually. My dad knows too. They’re both happy for me.</p><p><b>Rio: </b>But honestly I think my mom is happier about the fact that you have kids. She basically told me today that my biological clock is ticking. </p><p><b>Agatha:</b> If she wants, I can give you a child. No strings attached ;)</p><p><b>Rio: </b>That would be child abuse. I feel bad enough for my nieces and nephews as is. </p><p>“Deja el teléfono,” Beatriz whispers towards her. “They’re going to kick you out again.”</p><p>“They can bite me,” Rio retorts, making her mother’s eyes narrow with annoyance.</p><p><b>Rio: </b>Can I call you later? When the boys go to bed and after Santa comes. I miss your voice. </p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Of course, sweetheart. I’ll be waiting. </p><p>By the time she arrives back to the house, Rio can only muster enough energy for a quick shower. She brushes off her family’s instance to open the presents on that night, instead opting to bathe under a rain of warm water. Arms enclose themselves around her body, tracing some of the ink she has had tattooed onto her. A sigh breaks out through the bathroom as she leans against the cool tiles. </p><p>Never has Rio fallen in such a way, much less for someone she originally met at a sleazy bar. With her luck, the two of them would have hooked up once or twice before calling it quits by now. But Agatha…Agatha is something else. She cannot quite put a finger on the enigma that is the lady. So tenderly loving at times, but while also carrying a spirited torch that makes her difficult to domesticate. Thankfully, Rio is fond of a challenge. </p><p>Rio throws herself atop the mattress of one of the guest bedrooms by the time she finishes drying her hair. Her body is covered with a hoodie that has her old alma-mater faded onto its chest, while a pair of fuzzy pajama pants with stars coat her legs. She reaches out for her phone, tapping away to be on the line with Agatha who, to her surprise, picks up after only one ring. </p><p>“Someone’s desperate,” Rio teases. “Were you waiting long for me to call you?”</p><p>Agatha is quiet for a second. “Maybe. Does it matter?”</p><p>“I like knowing you want me.” The sound of the blue-eyed woman’s voice lulls her into a peace she has lost during the day, its totality spent around the draining family of hers. “This is the icing on the cake.”</p><p>“Little minx.”</p><p>The two of them sit in a comfortable silence. After having spent her entire evening listening to members of her family bicker about in the midst of what was supposed to be a jolly time, Rio loves it. She can make her way under the covers, her mind blank as she solely listens to heavy breaths her counterpart lets out. Odd, but she won’t question it. Not now anyway. </p><p>“I got back from church not too long ago,” Rio mentions. “And I didn’t burn as soon as I walked in like my uncle said. That’ll show him.”</p><p>“Did your mother threaten to shoot a puppy if you didn’t go?” Agatha’s tone is sultry, dripping with sex. She knows it is inappropriate, but by the gods does it jolt excitement between her legs. </p><p>“You could say that.”</p><p>The sound of a mattress dipping back and forth creates confusion in her. Rio tries to press her ear against the phone further, but is unable to narrow down where it stems. Instead, she is left to quietly listen to the shudders Agatha lets out across the line. </p><p>Oh. </p><p>“Agatha?” Nothing but a small hum, one Rio knows oh-so well, returns. “Are you okay, sweetheart?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p><em> Oh. </em> </p><p>“What are you doing?” The vibrations she hears from across the line makes her chest tighten. Eyes close at the noise, leading her malfunctioning brain to garner enough power to take it all in. “Agatha. Tell me.” Her voice shudders as she comes to term with the secrecy the other woman holds. “<em> Now </em>.” </p><p>“Why?” Agatha chuckles across the line; Rio just about shakes as she presses her own legs together. “You’re a smart girl, figure it out yourself.”</p><p>Playing with the hem of her underwear, Rio relaxes against the bed. She inches herself down, carefully threading against her own skin. The touch is nothing similar to that of Agatha during their numerous heavy make-out sessions when fingers threaten to pull at her clothes, but alas, it will have to do. </p><p>“Does it feel good at least?” Her hand slips past her boxer briefs. With her eyes closed, all she can imagine is Agatha being the one to witness her writhing in pleasure. “Baby.”</p><p>“Yeah. It feels amazing,” Agatha is breathless. “Haven’t felt like this in a long time.”</p><p>There is a small buzz from her side – one Rio can only imagine stems from a toy. The picture it paints in her mind is quite graphic; Agatha laying there, legs spread out as she withdraws the small vibrator before pushing it into herself once more. The motions would be repeated time and time again unless she eventually grows far too weak to carry them on. </p><p>Only the presence of Rio by her side could entice them further. </p><p>Each woman refuses to take their sweet time. They desperately please themselves, one another’s names falling from their half-agape mouths. Mere whispers, but it is enough to drive the other past the brink of madness. They are small mumbles that neither will forget as they are etched into their respective subconscious’ for dear life. </p><p>“Close,” is all Agatha can bring herself to say. But she knows that after tedious minutes, Rio is on a similar boat. “Oh baby. I can feel you.”</p><p>Although her ego is non-existent, it flies high as soon as the words are spoken. Rio nods to the phone, ignoring the fact that she cannot be seen, as she curls her fingers upwards; they do wonders upon hitting her sweet spot. A thumb lazily rubs over her bulbous clit, giving her just the final push she needs to come undone. </p><p>And when they reach their climaxes, they do so joined as one. </p><p>“That was…” Rio is the one to speak, but finds difficulty with a dry throat. “Mi amor, that was fantastic.”</p><p>“I do aim to please,” Agatha giggles back. She is exhausted, her counterpart can tell, but still keeps herself awake for the sake of hearing a voice she has missed dearly. “When do you come back again?”</p><p>“Two days. I’ll try to leave early enough so I don’t get stuck in traffic for an eternity.” Fingers remain knuckle-deep in her, still wishing to feel Agatha’s phantom touch – it’s all she has for now. “Let’s just hope my mother doesn’t wake up by the time I’m leaving. She always cries when saying goodbye.”</p><p>“Good. Come home to me, honey,” Agatha begs. “I’ll be waiting. </p><p>“I’ll be there before you know it.”</p><hr/><p>Christmas Day happened to be quite the snowy endeavor. The inches that piled up outdoors were far too much as winds blew harshly through the atmosphere. From what was originally a calm environment, a snowstorm was created. It blasted through the better part of New England, making it impossible to so much as exit the house without being blasted into oblivion. </p><p>The dent in the plans create a sense of urgency in Rio. She found herself preferring to walk to New Jersey if necessary for the sake of not spending another day surrounded by most, if not all, of her family. But with her father’s strong arms enclosing themselves around her, she gave up the last bit of hope she had. </p><p>On the day of New Year’s Eve, she rushes through the roads en-route to her apartment. There are only a handful of hours left in the year; hours she must stretch out to be able to get ready, gather all the presents hiding in her walk-in closet, and make her way over to Agatha’s place. Although seemingly impossible, with enough faith and the breaking of a few traffic laws, Rio makes it just in time. </p><p>She is breathless by the time the front door opens to reveal a boy, who Rio muses has grown in the days she has not seen him, elatedly jumping up and down.</p><p>“Happy New Year, Rio!” Nicholas yells before jumping on the woman for a hug, one she instantly returns awkwardly with one arm as a bag-full of presents is held by her free hand. </p><p>“New Year’s Eve,” Rio corrects. “Nice to see you again, buddy. Did you have a fun Christmas?”</p><p>“Super fun! Santa brought me so many Legos. I haven’t even been able to finish the small ones,” he explains as he allows the woman to walk into the house. As Nicky takes a glance at the rather enormous bag the woman carries, his eyes widen. “Presents?”</p><p>“Santa left them at my place for you, Billy, and your mom. Since I don’t have a chimney, he had to climb all the way onto my deck to leave these. Sorry that they’re a bit wet. They, uhm…” she musters an excuse before daring to admit to having accidentally dropped them all when exiting her apartment. “Santa didn’t have a key to my apartment so he left them outside all this time. He was a bit silly this year.”</p><p>“I’ll say,” Nicky mumbles back, still engrossed in the presents. </p><p>“¿Dónde está tu mamá, Nico?”</p><p>“Cocina,” he mindlessly responds. “Can I have my present now?”</p><p>“Let me say hi to mommy first and then we can get to that.”</p><p>After having kicked off her shoes and hanging her coat on the nearby rack, Rio makes her way further into the house. With a lack of Agatha around, seemingly having waltzed off to the kitchen, she is subdued by the nowfound people she shyly waves at. But when they motion for her to come closer, the woman internally groans. </p><p>Lillia is the first to introduce herself, and truth be told, is the one Rio takes most of a liking to. She reminds her of her own grandmother, much younger of course, but with a similar fire in her eyes. Her hair is curly and wild as it sits prettily atop her head in a monotone hue. And upon shaking Rio’s hand, Lillia inspects her further. </p><p>Then comes Jennifer whose sense of style surely turns heads. Rio hesitates in shaking her hand, only due to being rather amazed by her fascinating appearance. She dons a peach dress that accentuates her figure along with golden jewelry wherever she can muster. Rio wishes to someday have such clear beauty as Jen who mirrors that of Aphrodite herself. </p><p>Alice appears skittish at first, but she ends up being quite the talker. Rio is the one who brings up her mother, <em> the </em>Lorna Wu, something which makes the other woman grimace. And yet, all the words that spew from her mouth in reference to her mother are loving. It is only an assumption, but Rio can clearly tell where Billy got his inspiration for the outfits he often wears alongside heavy bouts of dark make-up. </p><p>Albeit finding Agatha’s coworkers to be a rather entraining and fabulous bunch, as soon as she finds the proper window, Rio makes her escape. She leaves the bag-full of presents at the top of the stairs she has memorized since first coming around to tutor Nicky. It is not often she has found herself there, but instantly, she finds the entrance to Agatha’s bedroom. </p><p>And without missing a beat, she knocks. </p><p>“I’m half-naked right now so unless you want to be traumatized, don’t come in!”</p><p>The words cause the woman to chuckle. “Now I want to come in even more. May I?”</p><p>A few seconds of silence pass before loud steps make their way to the door. Agatha pulls it open, revealing herself to carry a head of intricately messy hair and pristine makeup. Her free hand holds a shirt against her seemingly nude chest. Although rude, Rio cannot help but catch herself staring. </p><p>“My eyes are up here, Vidal,” Agatha utters with amusement dripping from her lips. “Are you trying to sneak a peek before the year ends?”</p><p>“Is it really that bad if I am?” Rio shoots back. “I can wait for you downstairs if you’d like me to…”</p><p>“Ugh, come on in. Make yourself right at home in <em> my </em>room,” Agatha says before stepping back. It gives enough space for Rio to sneak through the cracked door, her chest heaving as she finally finds herself within the confines of the room she could only fantasize about. “I spilled wine on my shirt and the only thing I got left to wear is this stupid dress.”</p><p>“You and I both know you don’t need silly clothes to look gorgeous,” Rio teases. She takes the spot at the edge of the bed, eyeing the woman with dilated pupils.</p><p>“Watch yourself, toots. We have guests. I can’t go all night with you undressing me with your eyes. It’ll drive me crazy.” Stepping into the bathroom within her bedroom, Agatha continues dressing herself, all while Rio attempts to peek from her seat. “Did you have fun with your family? And Valeria?”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure my mom told her to get lost after she found out I was seeing someone. Someone with kids she can take as her own grandchildren.” Truly, she had never seen her mother express such joy in her life. Not even when her older siblings graduated high school with the top marks, or when any of her other grandkids were born. She muses that due to formerly deeming Rio as a lost cause, Beatriz is exhilarated to have found a loophole. “I showed her a picture of you and she said you were very beautiful. I don’t think she’s that much of a fan of me dating outside our culture, but when she found out you’ve been learning Spanish as well as the kids, she almost offered to marry us then and there.”</p><p>“And you didn’t say yes?”</p><p>While she knows it is said in jest, Rio gives herself a moment to humor it into reality. Never had she expected to find anyone worthy of wedding herself to. With the numerous mindfulness hook-ups and short-lived relationships she’s been a part of, hope had never been something she clung to. But with Agatha, it is different. The thought of marriage, even if mere months into their…<em> relationship </em>, makes her stomach flutter.  </p><p>The sight of a true deity, a goddess of beauty, leaves her mouth agape. Agatha escapes the bathroom in a flash, showing off the manner in which her little black dress accentuates every curve imaginable. It is tight against her skin, enough to forever pique at Rio’s interest. </p><p>“I heard Nicky asking about presents. I hope Santa didn’t forget to bring little old me something,” Agatha’s voice is husky as she leans down enough to match her counterpart’s eyeline. “I can’t imagine him being that rude.”</p><p>But before Rio can dare kiss away her pout, Agatha places an index finger upon her lips. Something which makes her grumble. “Seriously? I haven’t seen you in a week and <em> this </em>is how you treat me? Maybe Santa won’t care to give you your presents.”</p><p>“Don’t be such a baby. I don’t want my make-up to get ruined.” Agatha stands up straight once more, her hands fiddling with the dip of her neck. The last thing she wants is to traumatize her children before the year ends, so she pulls it up oh-so slightly to Rio’s dismay. “Be a good girl. I know you can hold it in your pants until twelve.”</p><p>“This sucks,” is all Rio can muster, her cheeks turning into an unmissable red hue. “I can’t believe you won’t even give me one kiss before the year ends.”</p><p>With a deep sigh and a quick eye roll, Agatha takes the woman’s face in her hands. The kiss is much quicker than either of them could want, but alas, she is weak for the other brunette. Frankly, she couldn’t dare wait for hours before such passion oozed out. Agatha is only glad she can use Rio as an excuse for it. </p><p>“Now will you stop pouting like a big baby and wait for more?” Rio nods, that stupidly dashing smirk propping over her lips. “Good.” </p><p>The entirety of the night is spent joined at the hip with one another. Past-Rio would hate it, hate herself for having succumbed to another woman’s will and be turned into nothing but a stupid puppy who follows her around with each step. She wishes to stop herself from glancing in the general direction whenever Agatha so much as breathes, but it’s impossible. For months she has thought of nothing, of no one, other than the realtor. Now that they are in such close proximity, only a handful of steps from kissing one another yet again, she finds it difficult to even blink without fearing losing sight of Agatha.</p><p>By the time the clock strikes twelve, hugs and a handful of kisses atop one another’s cheeks are given out. Rio keeps her distance, but she watches in awe as Agatha holds Nicky in her arms, the boy far too tall already to be picked up with ease, as Billy wraps a singular arm around his mother. The three of them hold serene expressions to themselves, basking in the other’s happiness. The mental image she takes is one she stores in her subconscious for the rest of time. </p><p>It is Nicky who breaks free from the embrace only to wrap his arms around her. The boy was cheery when being given the opportunity to open his presents from ‘Santa’, but nothing beats the wide grin he sports as he hugs his teacher. And in return, Rio envelopes him closely. </p><p>“Happy New Year, Ms- <em> Rio </em>.” He flashes her a toothy grin. “Thanks for making mami happy.”</p><p>“I told you I’d try my best,” she taps him on the nose before looking up to face Billy, who awkwardly stands there with his arms open. “Happy New Year to you too, Billy. Maybe try not to get arrested this time around, eh? Save your mom the heart attack.”</p><p>As the two of them share a rather rigid hug, neither huge fans of such close proximity, Billy chuckles. “And here I was planning on shoplifting some more eyeshadow from the Eastview Target.”</p><p>Up until the guests leave, Rio awaits for her grand prize with teeth sinking into her inner cheeks. She bids her goodbyes to the women who end up Ubering to one of their apartments and all crashing simultaneously on whatever surface they can find. But behind stays a lanky brunette who doesn’t say a word. Not until the children make their way into their respective bedrooms after enough stern commands from Agatha for them to at the very least take a quick shower. </p><p>Time stands still as Rio awaits for a signal, just anything. She fiddles with the crossroads tattoo underneath her clothes, leaving her button-up shirt loose around her hips rather than deep within the waistline of her slacks. Although it had materialized itself in her youth, just shy of her reaching her 18th birthday, it burns more than ever before. </p><p>“Are you going to sleep on the couch or would you fancy a more comfortable surface? An actual bed, perhaps.”</p><p>The voice from the end of the stairs pulls her from her thoughts. Rio shakes her head, her sight focusing on the woman, solely donning a comfortable robe, searching for a response. And how dare she make her wait for longer than a handful of seconds. </p><p>“I didn’t know I was staying over,” Rio explains, but still finds herself waltzing to the brunette. “Might have to sleep in the nude. It wouldn’t be the first time.”</p><p>“Goodie. We have that in common at least,” Agatha teases. As she extends an arm, she is pleased at the speed at which her hand is grabbed. “Come on, toots. I promised you a reward, didn’t I? Time for Mrs. Claus to pay up with something a bit more…<em> fun </em> for your liking.”</p><p>With a slack-jaw, Rio nods. Her body levitates across the stairs as she is left feeling nervous for the first time in her life. But then again, her confidence drops when Agatha’s rises. Not that she minds.</p><p>Being controlled has always been a true fantasy of hers. </p><hr/><p>The searing hot water burns as it lands across the expanse of her skin. A hiss comes out, then another, until all that can be heard within the foggy bathroom are small bouts of verbal pain muffled by the shower drain. The temperatures have reached negative degrees outdoors, and while the heating is in full blast flowing through the condominium, it is not nearly enough for a woman who was raised on a tropical island, still growing used to such demonic cold. </p><p>A jolt of excitement strikes up her body as her mind drifts to future moments. Not that her thoughts have only been lewd since first meeting Agatha, but regardless, the possibility of being intimate with her for once causes her stomach to churn. A normally-confident Rio is reduced to a putty who needs to grab onto the wet walls for balance as her knees buck. </p><p>New year, new Rio – even if a lesser version of her past self. </p><p>Shaky legs help her climb off the tower. The previously-folded towel Agatha had given her draws itself across her body, drying every drop of liquid coating it. Even from the murky mirror above the sink, Rio catches sight of her tattoos. Surely their presence would not surprise Agatha, even if she has gone through great lengths throughout the school year to keep them hidden, but alas, she hopes the fairly large amount of the ink on her body won’t scare off the other woman. </p><p>“Took you long enough,” is the first thing she hears upon exiting the bathroom, a cloud of haze trailing along. After she is given a once-over, Rio, whose cheeks are already flushed from the heat, rolls her eyes playfully. “You look good in my clothes. Really good.”</p><p>Rio wonders if the woman planned ahead for it, but knowing Agatha, it had all gone according to plan. “I bet that’s what you tell all the lucky girls that end up in your bed.” Mirroring that of a lioness, she crawls on all fours towards the woman who sits against the bed frame, darkened blue eyes reeling her in. “¿Que tengo de especial? Porque me elegiste, mi vida?”</p><p>“No fair. I can barely understand what you’re trying to tell me.” A pair of lips land atop her own, sensually, yet slowly, kissing them. Agatha shudders, her hands gripping whatever they find first for support – she’s lucky Rio’s hips, covered by her own oversized hoodie and lewdly short pajama pants, are right on sight. The sole tattoo on Rio’s leg stemming from her thigh to her ankle is quite the sight. “There we go. Hm, maybe you can tell me more.”</p><p>“¿Qué más quieres de mi? Ya te he dado tanto. Tienes mi corazón, mi cuerpo, y mi alma.” Another kiss, this time lingering atop Agatha’s sore lips. Rio suckles on the bottom one for a second or two before releasing with a rather loud ‘pop’. “You’re greedy, O’Connor.”</p><p>“Can you really blame me?” A self-assured hand travels to Rio’s back sight, gently squeezing it. The act is rather new and fills her with surprise, all while the culprit licks her lips hungrily. “It's impossible to keep myself composed when you look like this. But you know that, don’t you? You’ve been teasing me relentlessly since we first met.” At the feigned innocence stricken over Rio’s face, Agatha howls. “And now you want to play dumb. How cute.”</p><p>“At least you think I’m cute.” With her hands on her counterpart’s chest, Rio leans down far enough for their lips to oh-so slightly brush together. “Besides, I haven’t done anything you don’t want me to. You’ve been practically begging for me all this time. I liked the coyness you pretended to have. But it’s nothing compared to <em> this </em>.”</p><p>Their hands explore one another’s body as the new year begins. Even through their respective clothes, they grope at the other’s breasts, pulling and prodding far enough for little moans to be elicited. With Rio straddling the woman’s lap, she gains a momentary advantage, only for a hand to enclose itself around her throat, gently pulling her downwards for mouths to meet once again. </p><p>The outdoor air is numbing, its piercing persona quick to freeze anyone on sight. Yet within the confines of the bedroom, all each woman feels is a brutal warmth. Their bodies slide together as one, begging for more and more touches that soon come. </p><p>“You’re wearing too much clothes,” Agatha slurs out as she breaks free from the sharp teeth that previously sunk into her lips – leaving them possessively marked.</p><p>“If you want, I could-”</p><p>“Mami!” The knock on the door alongside a loud wail startles them. As much as they wish to remain prisoners to the other's embrace, they quickly break away. “Uhm, I need help. I think I might’ve, sorta, flooded the bathroom. I thought I turned it off after brushing my teeth but guess not. The paper towels keep getting soggy and Billy is starting to panic ‘cause it’s getting out and going to his room. I think he’s using the broom to clean it but that’s just silly.” Nicky pauses, visibly frowning. “Right?”</p><p>“Looks like the bat signal is on,” there is disappointment in her voice, but Rio weakly diminishes it as she lays back on what she deems is her side of the bed. “Time to go, superstar. I wouldn’t want your house to flood.”</p><p>“It can’t be that bad.” A loud thud stemming from the hall rings out followed by the unmistakable scream of a teenage boy. As she grimaces, Agatha is offered a sympathetic look. “Right?”</p><p>“You know your children are capable of wonderful things, but also very bad ones.” A hand moves to delicately caress Agatha’s cheek. Her thumb with chipped nail polish draws imaginary circles along the pristine skin. The urge to succumb to temptation is strong, but Rio must ignore it for the sake of the chaos outside the door. “Go be a supermom. I’ll be here by the time you come back.’</p><p>Planting a chaste kiss on the teacher’s lips, Agatha huffs. “We’re not done here.”</p><p>“Oh, I would hope not.” </p><p>In her mind no time passes when she finishes tending to the sea of lukewarm water that is the boy's bathroom. And yet when arrives back to her bedroom, seemingly half an hour later of consoling Billy – promising his belongings would not be tarnished – while sternly sending Nicky to bed. There she finds Rio peacefully slumbering on the bed, hugging the pillow previously set on Agatha’s side. </p><p>Without much thought, Agatha is quick to snap a picture of the ordeal. She makes a note to change her phone’s wallpaper another day to display the dark-haired woman, but for now, she retakes her place amongst the mess of sheets.</p><p>An arm delicately wraps itself around Rio’s body, pulling her close until her head lies on the realtor’s chest. The light snores are what slowly let Agatha be lulled to Sandman’s realm. But not before she plants a longing kiss on the top of the mess of hair. </p><p>“Sleep tight, toots,” Agatha whispers. “Can’t wait to see what this year has in store for us.” </p><hr/><p>

<p>
<span>Even as winter nears its final set of weeks, there is a striking cold which takes over the Eastern Coast of the country. There is a semblance of light before the end of the tunnel which drags along passing days. It can only be hoped for warmth to cover the state of New Jersey once again, but alas, one could only hope that it comes quickly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You okay, honey?” A hand shakes a full head of hair. But to her dismay, the boy doesn’t look up. “Nicky? You okay, bud?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” comes the sole reply. Nicholas hugs himself. Shielding himself from the phantom gust of wind that comes is not an easy feat for someone his size. “I don’t wanna go in. I hate this. I hate Valentine’s Day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He didn’t, not really anyway. The fear in the boy’s voice makes the woman sigh, her breath visible as she stands outside of the elementary school after hours. There are children and their respective families puring inside, something she follows, but opts for kneeling beside him by the front doors. Too bad Billy is elsewhere to help – he always does wonders giving his brother a pep-talk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you scared of singing in front of everyone?” The boy quickly nods. “Oh, I bet. Even mama would be scared.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky pouts. “But you’re the bravest person I know. Mami never gets scared.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re sweet, kid, but it’s the truth. Everyone’s scared of something,” Agatha warmly says. “You can’t let it control you. Every single person in this school knows you have a beautiful voice. Why do you think they made you the lead? It’s because they know Nicholas O’Connor is a fantastic singer. It’s normal to be scared, yes, but are you going to let it consume you and keep you from doing something you love?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, ma’am.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s my boy,” Agatha plants a kiss atop his forehead. “Now, you’re going to go out there and you’ll kill it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh-huh,” but before he can make his exit in search of his music teacher, Nicky stops. “Mama?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, honey,” Agatha responds, her eyes scanning the crowd surrounding them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Throughout the remnants of the winter break, her and Rio had been bombarded with responsibilities neither had ease when partaking in. Whether it be one of the boys getting sick, or even Agatha at one point, or Rio spending the better part of her days planning for the upcoming semester, they barely had the opportunity to sneak away for a smidge of passion to be shared. And now that the school year was kicked off in an instant, Agatha was lucky if she could take a peek at the woman whenever she picked her child up from school.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How come you and Rio are sleeping together?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There is far too much innocence posed that at first, she barely registers the question. Not until pairs of prying eyes turn to them. Parents judge from afar, frowning in silent wonder at what the boy asked. Agatha cannot wait long enough for her son to graduate high school and never have to face them again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” She tries to keep herself composed, but the heightened pitch of her voice makes it difficult. “Who told you that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Last Saturday I went into your room to look for Señor Scratchy ‘cause he got lost and Rio was sleeping there on </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> side of the bed,” the boy huffs. “It’s mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a big boy, Nicky. You got your own bed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So does Rio. Why does she need to sleep with you.?” He suddenly gasps in a manner which startles his mom. “Did she get kicked out of her house? Is she moving in? Do I finally get a second mommy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I…no, baby. That’s not it,” she grimaces, unable to find the proper verbiage to explain whatever her and his teacher have between them. Not that she wishes to traumatize him, but alas, she is well-aware of how easily her son of all people can see through a weak lie. “Mommy and Rio just have lots of sleepovers when we’re not busy. That's what friends do.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never kiss any of my friends on the mouth. You kiss her every morning.” Nicholas makes a disgusted face. “That’s yucky.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>In an attempt to recover from such embarrassment, Agatha rises to her feet. She pretends to dust herself off, hoping those around them have turned bored of witnessing the same scene. Otherwise, she is unsure she can face them, for the upcoming years Nicky still has in the school system. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why don’t you be a dear and go find Ms. Rodriguez.” Agatha throws her son a sheepish smile, feigning happiness. “I’m sure she is wondering where the star of the show is hiding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The halls of the school surrounding the auditorium are impossible to make her way through. Agatha huffs and puffs, at times even gently pushing those away who do not have a sense of spatial awareness. There are numerous teachers that she waves off without wishing to interact much closer with them. With the loud music that plays prior to the show beginning, her head already pulsating for what she deems is an incoming headache. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Valentine’s Day was never something she found herself celebrating given her lack of a romantic partner. Before her children came along, the day would be spent ignoring the existence of the holiday, but all changed once she adopted her boys. During the early morning – her one true enemy – she rises before the kids. At their doors Agatha often leaves a bagful of candy and a small card for smiles to be brought to their faces. And once they make their way downstairs, the matriarch never fails to have heart-shaped pancakes ready for her children to munch on as she hands them off small presents to commemorate the day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>While the customs have been left untouched, the addition of one Rio Vidal to her life has added to them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could so much as reach the end of her staircase, a knock at the door interrupted her. She was pleasantly astounded upon finding a delivery man offering her a bouquet of roses. A rather cliché present alongside a box of chocolates and a small teddy bear, but one she has never received. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she makes her way further into the bodice of the building, her face lights up at the sight of the culprit behind her joy. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“Ms. Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tone is rotten enough to draw an eye roll from darkened eyes. She wishes to ignore it, to go about her night sipping her disgusting cup of store-bought punch, but the insistence of the other person is not easily subdued. So without much choice, Rio turns around, slaps on the fake expression she can muster, and smiles at her student’s mother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mrs. Maximoff.” If the redhead did not know she was hated, she sure as hell knows it now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s actually Ms. Maximoff now.” She flashes her finger, accentuating the lack of a ring there. Frankly, Rio doesn’t blame Vision. A divorce would also be imminent if she had the torturous task of being wed to Wanda. If she holds the same persona she uses when directing the PTA, it would be a nightmare waiting to happen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Rio mumbles, but the lack of sadness in the other woman’s face puzzles her. “Or congratulations?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She is unsure who the lucky one was out of the collapsed marriage; surely not Rio who is left in her lonesome to either die or slay the beast before her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, dear.” She follows the gaze of Rio that doesn’t falter until it lands on a particular woman waving away to a young boy at the entrance of the school. “You know, we used to date.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A tightness protrudes her jaw. She doesn’t admit it, but the piece of knowledge is one constantly ingrained in her mind when having the horrid experience of seeing Wanda. How Agatha ever dated her, Rio doesn’t know. She supposes that is what desperation does to a person. “No kidding.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She wanted a luxurious life while being a realtor and I wanted to settle down and have kids right after college.” It creates a hint of relief to see how little Wanda knew Agatha, even if they had shared love long before. “And look at us now. It’s like our paths were meant to cross.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The crossroads runes sting on her waistline.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, Nicky tells me she’s seeing someone. Apparently they are </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> happy together.” Her eyes glimmer as she flashes — albeit hesitantly — a feigned sympathetic smile towards the redhead, one carrying deep seeded annoyance. “Wrong person, wrong time, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, not really.” With the incoming approach of an already exhausted brunette, Wanda beams. “Would you be a dear and excuse us, Ms. Vidal? Agatha and I have to </span>
<em>
<span>catch up</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>If her jaw could physically clench further than it was, Rio was sure her teeth would shatter. She doesn’t speak, much less nod as she walks off without a second look at either woman. The simple action of merely looking in Agatha’s general direction would have broken her. So instead, she chooses to save everyone’s peace by hiding out in the corner of the auditorium, a cup of punch in hand, and stare off into the nothingness. All while her mind runs rampant with all the delicious thoughts of how she could get back at Wanda if it weren’t for not wanting to end up in prison. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tries, she really does, but none of her silent cues are enough to drag Rio back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’s your husband?” Agatha questions, focus still on another. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ex-husband, actually. We finalized the proceedings a few weeks ago,” her green eyes darted to Agatha’s lips as she licked her own — a sight which made the teacher’s stomach churn along with the words. “Once again, I’m a free agent. </span>
<em>
<span>And looking</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Must be nice,” she looks far off towards Rio who doesn’t meet her line of sight, but instead furiously eyes Wanda. “I couldn’t relate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Funny, the boys’ teacher said something like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s a bright woman.” Much more than that, really, but that is for Agatha to selfishly have. No one else should even get a semblance of the beauty that is Rio Vidal. Everyone but her is undeserving. “A feisty one at that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda appears to take offense to the comment. “And I’m not?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh please. You and I both know you can’t keep up with me even if you tried, Wands. You’re barking up the wrong tree.” Surely they had found once upon a time, but nothing compared to the new life Rio breathed into her. “I’ve found myself someone more…</span>
<em>
<span>wild</span>
</em>
<span> to put it lightly.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She looks like a rabid animal waiting to be tamed. Cute guard dog though.” To hear someone refer to </span>
<em>
<span>her </span>
</em>
<span>Rio as such both thrills and dismays her – albeit minimal vitriol, Wanda should know better than to sniff around what does not concern her. “Are you sure you can keep up with her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know me,” Agatha flicks her hair back with a dashing grin. “I’m a </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> patient trainer.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What a lucky gal.” They each feel the manner in which a simple tap on Agatha’s shoulder brings fire to the eyes of a woman standing far from them. “Any Valentine’s Day plans for the two lovebirds?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We haven’t decided. Truth be told, it’s been a few days since we were last able to sit down and just talk.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me take Nicky off your hands. I can tell she needs a bit more than a conversation over some red wine. She’s just about ready to burst.” From the corner of her eye, she can feel knives against her back. So deliciously rabid. “For a moment, I was scared she would actually kill me or pop a vein. Maybe both. Looks like you have your hands full with this one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be sure to tell Nicky he’s sleeping over at your place today.” With a quick side-hug, she thanks her friend. “I suppose Rio and I have some catching up to do.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, Agatha eventually finds herself creeping towards Rio. There is nothing but pure hatred stricken over delicious features which soften at the sight of another. Jealousy is not something Agatha was fond of in a partner, but the way Rio dons it proudly makes the butterflies in her stomach flutter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Never did she believe such a confident woman would succumb to such vile green fury. Yet, she wears it as though she was made for it. It would be impossible for Rio to look bad in anything – even jealousy itself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So now you want to look at me?” Is the first set of words Rio speaks to her in a rigid, cold demeanor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha giggles. It takes all her strength to not pinch her counterpart’s puffed-up cheeks then and there. “What’s wrong with the little pouty baby now? Not getting enough attention from mommy?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will murder you in your sleep and dance over your grave. I know where you live.” Her lips form a thin line, but truthfully she is nearing her breaking point to a fit of laughter. “You and the little red riding hood should get a room. I would recommend your bed, but from what she told me, she’s no stranger to it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s been almost two decades, toots.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You two looked chummy together,” Rio comments. Her refusal to refer to Wanda as her given name is evident. The name creates bile in her throat after all. “What does it feel like to be hit on by an old flame at your son’s elementary school play? What a story that’ll be for your grandkids.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Behave,” Agatha warns, but can’t help the manner the edges of her mouth rise. “Wanda is just a friend. She offered to watch over Nicky tonight. And I’m being a bit more lenient on the emo one now, so he’s staying with Eddie’s family.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you can come over if you’d like. Unless you’d rather spend the night shooting daggers with your eyes at Wanda and plotting her death. Whatever makes you happy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was getting too close to you. Her hand was on your back and I…” Rio pauses as she begins growing frustrated, more so than ever. But she can’t help it. Not when another makes such a bold move on the woman who has her heart. “I’m not a fan of people ogling you like you’re some piece of meat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Isn’t that what you do all the time?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They each ignore the curious parents who turn at the question. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s different,” Rio mutters, her words only Agatha’s to have. “I’m allowed to kiss you, she isn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Cocky, are we?” Grabbing the woman’s glass, it is Agatha who ends up downing the rest. Her lips are given a newfound red hue from the punch that burns her throat more than a glass of pure vodka could. How nice to see her taxes being put to good use by poisoning townspeople.  “If you learn to behave, maybe you can do more than that tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you…</span>
<em>
<span>tonight</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio, for one of the first times since Agatha has known her, seems taken aback. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What better way to celebrate our first Valentine’s day as a couple.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha steps closer, giving one the illusion that she ferociously towers over her counterpart. She stands proud, her chin arising as she looks down to the bug at her feet. All Rio can do is shudder, even if in a sickeningly uncharacteristic manner. She hates the person Agatha forces her to become with her presence, but by the gods does she want her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So now we’re a couple.” The word in itself makes her chest heave. “I think I missed that conversation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A couple of friends,” Agatha is quick to joke; Rio is not so fond of it, but the pout she displays is far too adorable not to admire. “This is what you’ve wanted, isn’t it? Because it’s what I want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And taken under a spell by the other woman, all that comes in a small whine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio hums. “Better than I imagined.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>The dead of the night coats the town by the time they make their arrival at Agatha’s house – whose owner had come up with the bright idea. They had arrived in their designated cars, but regardless, entered the front door together. It felt alien, unlike any time they had set foot within it. Neither can narrow down the reasoning nor do they care. Because as they stare at each other, a deep longing suffocating the area past the door frame, all that matters is what threatens to spill.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Months of an ever-growing tension led them to that moment. Not a breath is let out, not when even the single most miniscule sound will set them off. Instead, the women stare at each other, their pupils dilating as they mirror that of lionesses hunting their prey. But it is Agatha who finds herself victorious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She throws the other brunette against the door, holding limp wrists above her head. A pair of famished lips overtake shy ones who barely move from the immense pressure they are put under. Teeth sink on them, bruising the flesh until small drops of blood threaten to fall. But even then, with a slack-jawed mouth that easily allows a tongue to slip inside, Rio moans loudly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulls her close until the heat of the moment creates turns their skin clammy. Fingers needily tug at articles of clothes, but neither is in their right mind to properly take them off. As they make out, sensually with saliva dripping down their chins, they make headway towards the staircase. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A fit of giggles breaks out as they struggle onwards, and by the time they make it to Agatha’s bedroom, they stumble together over the bed – Rio being the lucky one to gain the upper hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s about fucking time,” Rio whines. She tears at the white button-up shirt the woman wears, ignoring the protests at the manner it breaks. Gladly she will purchase the realtor a dozen more if it means she ends the night getting what she has craved for eons. “You have no idea how long I've been waiting to see you like this.” She runs her eyes over the brunette’s half-nude figure, taking in the heaving chest where a fabric hides the seemingly soft breasts that spill together. Rio cannot help but cup them curiously; the groan she receives makes her bite her bottom lip. Hard. “Eres tan preciosa. Aún más bella de lo que pensé.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I aim to please, toots.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agonizing seconds pass before two pairs of desperate hands remove every last article of clothing from her body. She lays back, naked as the day she was born, with hazy blue eyes that never tear themselves from brown ones. The shoddy woman straddling her waist can barely function, not when the true entity of all mortal beauty is displayed right for her to have. Mesmerized, Rio reaches to allows her digits to travel down from the woman’s chest, to her torso, to her w-</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha’s eyebrows knit, her confidence suddenly flowing away as she makes a frail attempt to cover her nudity. “I’m not model-material, but I-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s my tattoo.” Ignoring the woman, Rio reaches out to press at the small crossroads rune on Agatha’s waist — one mirroring her very own. Pulling off her shirt in a swift succession, she points to her marking. They are a perfect match; so are the tattoos. “You’re my…Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Never believing the day would come, the two women remain silent. All they can do is bore their eyes onto the runes, ensuring that every last line is one they share. Lo and behold, realization dawns upon them. And by the time it does, all Rio can muster is annoyance. The universe owes her a lot of time in return. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s perfect.” Rather than disgusted, a mannerism Agatha is not a stranger to, her tone is filled with disbelief. “I’ve finally found you and you are so much more than what I wanted.” She takes the auburn-haired woman’s hand in her own, bringing it right to their soulmate marking. “Yo iba por mi propio camino por primera vez en mi vida y me perdí, pero tu me encontraste. Me has dado una felicidad que ni puedo describir. Ni te busqué ni nada. Tu ya sabias como encontrarme, mi vida. You have no idea how happy that makes me.” Her eyes are glassy as she leans down right above Agatha’s frozen features. “How happy </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>make me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> “And here I thought I would die a crazy, lonely cat lady,” Agatha jests, her voice hoarse with emotions. She trails her free hand over Rio’s features, truly taking them in for the first time. Those amber orbs watch in awe, carefully noting each and every movement she makes. But it doesn’t dissuade Agatha. No. Instead she draws the outline for her soulmate’s lips with the tip of her digit, memorizing it in a manner where even in death she will remember. Every part of the other brunette’s face is studied, this time as soulmates, not a pair of women finding solace in one another. “It makes sense. For us to meet under such circumstances and for you to attach yourself to my hip too easily.” Quite literally, Agatha muses as she views their matching tattoos. “It was meant to be. Your soul is the only one I have ever connected with.” She scoffs, berating herself for not having noticed sooner. “You know, I never noticed how beautiful your eyes are. They remind me of a delicious bar of chocolate that is so quick to melt on my mouth as I try it. So sweet even under all that wrapping, but at times feisty. They fit you well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets the woman undress her. They end up laying in bed, this time side by side sharing a similar nudity with the other. Never do they tear their sights from the other, not even for a second. They have spent far too long apart; now it is time to make up for lost time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’d tell me if you were a witch, right?” An amused nod is returned. Rio takes it in before running a hand through Agatha’s hair. “You were crafted from the stars itself. Your heart, my love. It’s beautiful. Of all the billions of people in this godforsaken world, I’m the luckiest. All because I am bound to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time as soulmates, they kiss. It is rather timid unlike their former embraces. They hug tightly, their breasts brushing together as their cries are drowned in one another’s lips. The tears that fall down their hot cheeks carry a brazen bliss Agatha has not felt since adopting her children. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need you,” Rio tells her. It is not an order, it is not a plea. It simply is. “Show me who I belong to.” The tips of their noses touch. “Who my soul is bound to.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I got you.” The promise is full. “Close your eyes and feel how badly I’ve longed for you. Let me make it all better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither is sure how, but after what feels like tediously long hours, a sole digit dripped in lubricant Agatha found somewhere in her drawer, gradually enters Rio. At first it is unmoving, simply sitting there to allow her to grow used to such a newfound feeling. There are failed gasps for air that drive the poor woman mad as she begins writhing atop the bedsheets. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does it hurt?” The soothing voice asks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Albeit thrilled by finally having the opportunity to bask in such a grand moment, Rio grimaces. “A bit. It’s been awhile since I- </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shh, I know. Me too,” Agatha admits. “I’ll go slow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>While the digit carefully moves within her, Rio allows herself the opportunity to be lost in Agatha. There is disdain at the sight of the scars she traces with her eyes. They were surely left there by Evanora. Although they carry their healed, white tint to them, their sizes vary — some more than easily visible to the naked eye. Oh how she wishes to take them away; ideally ensuring they never existed in the first place. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She kisses each and every one she can muster. Her lips trail over the disfigured skin, one she learns to love further by the second. Every second of pain Agatha has endured under her mother’s hand is soothed by the attentive ministrations carried out. She doesn’t want to imagine it, but oh she does. Rio thinks through every possible scenario that could have resulted in such wounds. Her heart aches, but Agatha’s does twice as much. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was supposed to make you mine,” Rio mumbles. She closes her eyes for a split second, letting vigorous lips kiss their way across her jawline. The finger inside her gains traction, moving with heightened speed that leaves her breathless. “Not the other way around.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have all the time in the world, baby. Just sit back and let me make you feel good.” She senses Rio visibly relax against her. Even her inner walls lose their former rigidness, allowing for better movement from within. Digits oh-so slowly push deeper inside before pulling back; the motion repeats in a never-ending manner until a second finger can be added. “Good girl. You are incredibly cute when you follow orders, Ri.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t get used to it,” Rio chuckles dryly. “This is- ah! This is a first. You better enjoy it while it lasts.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh honey, I’ll make sure it lasts forever. Don’t you worry about that.” Kissing her way down the woman’s chest, Agatha flicks her tongue against one of her rosy nipples, hardening it immediately. I am </span>
<em>
<span>very </span>
</em>
<span>good at getting people to do as I wish. Those silly displays of confidence won’t save you from me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With fingers massaging her depths, Rip shudders. “Is that a challenge?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take it as a promise, toots.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth lightly suckles on one of the buds. She is careful to solely brush her teeth against it, a miniscule touch, before drawing lazy circles along the nipple. As they are both given the utmost attention, they proudly sit up for Agatha, who cannot hide her excitement as she kisses them each, focusing her way along the areolas, before pulling back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thumbing at Rio’s clit, she finds a decent rhythm. There she can hold herself upwards, towering over her lover, while fingers pump deep within her. In the few times they curl up, their tips come in contact with a spongy sweet spot that earns her quite the loud wails. The stimulation alongside that of a bundle of nerves being flicked drives the teacher mad. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In a feeble try to save herself from the titillating thrusts, Rio hugs her thighs together. It is a short-lived motions which earn her a light slap over her pussy as a guttural moan spews into the atmosphere. The focus of those cerulean eyes have hypnotized her, turning the woman into a willing, obedient mess. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ag- fuck, Agatha!” Her cunt is pulsating, begging for more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shh, I know. It’s okay, sweetheart. Let go for me, yeah?” But Rio still manages to lose herself in her own mind. Eyes shut, mouth forming a grimace, while Agatha oh-so gently stimulates her. “Don’t think about it too much. Be a good girl and come for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That is what does it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Part of Rio is ashamed of it, but by the gods does it feel glorious – heavenly even – for her orgasm to shoot right through her when Agatha requests it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With an arched back, Agatha’s name falls from her lips. The overwhelming lust she faces is far too much to handle. Hands grips the bedsheets for dear life. Eyes shut themselves. Her face crunches up. And the formerly slow, steady rhythm her chest followed turns rapidly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! I-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she can muster another word, it is her very own soulmate who swallows her cries whole. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Agatha repeats. “I got you, sweetheart.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“You weren’t lying about the scars.” A hand grasps Agatha’s. “Even though they’re healed, they’re so…deep and angry. I don’t get it.” She can feel a pair of eyebrows furrow before continuing. “How could she see evil in you? Enough to do </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They have spent the better part of the night, into the following day, exploring one another’s bodies. It is Agatha who rules on top time after time, although after enough begging, she allows the other woman to sink to her knees and carry out lewd movements with just her mouth. And once they deemed a break was necessary, after having mustered enough strength to fetch at the very least a shared glass of water, they can barely move a muscle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they’re done, Rio lays flat on her back. She has Agatha on her side, a protective arm draped over her chest. Just as they were meant to be. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was a wicked woman. I think she was pissed off at the world, at herself, but didn’t know how to channel her anger.” Agatha shrugs. Never has she had the space to vocalize such disdain – it all had been bottled inwards “Then she had me all by herself. No parents to guide her, no husband to help. I guess I was the ‘perfect’ child. I was the first person in her life that took everything she gave without fighting back. Not that I could, anyway. Children are far too small of creatures to prevent a belt coming down on their backs for hours without end.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope for my own sake that she’s dead. Because if she’s not, I might not be able to keep myself from killing her.” Albeit an extreme comment to make, there is no humor in Rio’s voice. Benevolently, she makes all of Agatha’s pain her own. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the dimly-lit room, eyes find each and every piece of artwork scattered over Rio’s body. At first they are merely touched with her gaze, but as her curiosity grows, she reaches out to pet one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the story behind this one?” Agatha’s fingertip lands on a medium-sized tattoo on the woman’s outer thigh. It is that of a red flower, but she cannot muster a name for it. “It’s beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a flor de maga. My grandfather used to grow them for my grandmother. And when they would blossom, he would spend hours picking at them until sundown. He would preserve some of them, but would always pick the most beautiful one of the bunch to put behind my abu’s ear.” Rio fondly remembers watching such glorious displays of love as a child — she always did want it. “I miss them a lot.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They seemed like amazing people,” Agatha comments. “With an even more amazing granddaughter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lingers there, taking in the ruby-colored flower, before moving along to one by her ribs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And this little guy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A coqui. I miss going to sleep listening to their beautiful melody. It’s a lullaby. I wish you could hear it, there’s nothing like it in the rest of the world.” Her mind flies off to the manner in which the small amphibians would sing each passing night in her homeland. As the years went on, their tune grew fainter, but it isn’t rare to find them hiding in the safety of bushes as they harmonize for the island to listen. “My father designed it and it’s the first tattoo I ever got apart from ours. He dared me to get it in secret because my mom would’ve killed me. I was 21, but still. Mami’s blood pressure shot up that day. I don’t think she’s ever cried that much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I cannot wait to meet your mother,” Agatha jokes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I can.” Sharing a fit of laughter, the two women nuzzle further against one another. “She’s going to eat you alive. You better brush up on your Spanish, cariño.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do have a pretty amazing teacher,” she says before placing a chaste kiss on her lover’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The ink is mesmerizing. Agatha could spend hours upon hours tracing every intricate line with the tip of her finger. She has never quite been interested in women with tattoos, yet her mindset changes as she explores the expanse of Rio’s skin. The newfound beauty behind them is one she will forever obsess over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about this dragon over your leg?” It expands from Rio’s thigh to her ankle and a fascinating attention to detail. “I didn’t take you for a fantasy gal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not. Well, not really anyway. I was feeling bored one day and had just gotten my heart broken by my college girlfriend,” Rio rolls her eyes at the reminder. Back when she thought her world would end due to a silly heartbreak of a relationship that barely lasted five months. “So I decided to do what every calm and collected young woman would: get an impulsive tattoo. It was half off ‘cause the guy felt so bad for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Running her fingers over the mythical creature, Agatha hums. “It looks amazing. I’ve never seen anything like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turns and shows off her back. There is a flower tattoo that stems from her upper back to her lower back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have one more,” Rio interjects. Much to her lover’s dismay, she tears herself away from their embrace oh-so slightly to reveal the inking on her back. “These are the flowers we always bring to my grandparent’s shared grave. It’s the latest one I got. Mami loves it because it reminds her of them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s gorgeous.” Agatha draws a finger through the lines that make up the set of flowers. “What flowers are these?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Orchids,” Rio explains. “My grandma's name was Orquídea. She was named after the flower.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Leaning in, Agatha plants a deep, lingering kiss in the middle of her soulmate’s back. She hugs her, tightly pulling the woman toward her own body until they melt together once more. Her chin comes to rest on a relaxed shoulder. And with wild locks of hair near her face, she can inhale the scent of crisp lavender Rio carries. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could have had any woman you set your eyes on. If I weren’t your soulmate, would you still choose me?” The gentle expression across Rio’s face as she nods without hesitation, having turned around when the question began, says all she needs to know. “Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?” Rio shoots back, scoffing at her partner. “You don’t get it, do you? I guess you can’t see it.” She shakes her head, shifting enough to face Agatha while still wrapped around her arms. “I have never even dreamed of a specimen as perfect as you. You are everything, Agatha. Your presence alone has healed the pain of loneliness I’ve endured these past decades and made it worth it. Can you believe that? A single person can heal another by just existing. Why wouldn’t I want to be around that? To love and cherish the one who has brought me happiness I couldn’t even phantom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have such a beautiful way with words,” Agatha states. Her throat tightens while her eyes turn wet. But she can’t let herself cry, not when she has found such bliss after a life full of anguish. “I love it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There is only one beautiful thing in this room and I can promise it’s not my words.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their foreheads are joined as one. Agatha reaches out, her hands trembling as she grabs hold of her beloved’s face. Almost as though she were grabbing a china doll who may break at any given second; not that she would ever harm it, but instead spend her days protecting such beauty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Promise me you’ll never stop saying them,” Agatha begs in an almost weakened tone.</span>
</p><p><span>With her pinky finger stuck out, Rio beams; a rather easy commitment to upkeep.</span> <span>“Te lo prometo, mi vida. You and me against the world now and until the end. Como debe ser.”</span></p><hr/><p>
<b>Translations:</b>
