<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio, as a Boston's PD coroner, stumbles uppon a series of suspicious deaths of women. No, not women - witches.<br/>However, as she is being framed for these killings, she seeks the help of the head of Boston's most feared gang: Lilia Calderu. She thought it would  be a straightfoward solution - except Lilia had two conditions: Rio had to accept her own nature, and she had to take Agatha as her personal bodyguard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Please excuse any english errors. I write in Word to avoid them, but english is not my native language. Also, it has literaly been a decade since I write fanfiction - it's nice that this fandom pulled me back to wanting to do that.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="justify">Boston always had this dampness this time of the year – its air reeked with the scent of damp earth and dying, brown leaves. It was a stark contrast to the usual sterile tang that usually permeated Rio’s world. Formaldehyde and cold steel, much more familiar smells, were replaced by the cloying sweetness of decaying foliage – a reminder of her current situation. She was running.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Not just running, fleeing – <em>hunted</em>.</p><p align="justify"><br/>The rain plastered her dark hair to her face, blurring the already dim streetlights of the outskirts of New Salem, a small neighborhood near Boston. The name, a cruel irony, served as a constant reminder of the past – one where women like her were burned at the stake for the crime of existing and being feared by men.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio, Dr. Rio Vidal, forensic pathologist for the Boston PD, was a witch. There weren’t many by now. The Trials took place to erase all her kind – they <em>almost</em> succeeded. And although being a witch today was not a crime, it was still frowned upon in every aspects of society. Laws forbid them from using magic. Schools and universities often took measures to make sure they did not enrolled, or eventually lag behind in class and get expelled. Marriage with or between witches was not permitted and they would often have a hard time owning property or companies. Yes, the echoes of the Salem Trials still resonated well into this city – fire was no longer the reaper, poverty and prejudice taking its place.</p><p align="justify">So, Rio was… the <em>exception</em>. And she was so because her identity of a witch was very well hidden throughout the years – she had her late mother to thank her for that.</p><p align="justify">But now, she was a suspect of murder. Not just any murder, but a series of them. All seemingly accidental deaths of women, all women with a subtle, almost imperceptible shimmer of magic around their souls – all <em>witches</em>. All deaths that she, as the coroner, was assigned to autopsy.</p><p align="justify">The first ones, Rio recorded as natural causes or unfortunate accidents. However, has months went by, she started to notice the subtle distortions in these death’s signatures, the faint residue of drained energy – telltale signs of deliberate, targeted eliminations. Murders.</p><p align="justify">She had dared to look closer, to question who was responsible for these deaths, even though her boss told her not to – “<em>No one cares about witches. They probably deserved it. They are always like this, killed each other’s. They don’t know better; too dumb to even go to school anyway. It’s no waste, I’ll tell you that.</em>”</p><p align="justify">And in doing so, she had become a target. Somehow.</p><p align="justify">Well, she knew how. Rio started to suspect that the Boston PD, or at least a faction within it, was hunting witches. And she, a witch in their midst, almost certain to have stumbled upon their secret. What she didn’t know how was: <em>how they found out</em>. How they found out about her suspicions and how they found out about her identity as a witch. Because she was always careful – but now she was being incriminated as the author of these murders.</p><p align="justify">So, to be running and hunted – for the first time in her life – made her feel like a caged animal. And caged animals rarely had the best decision-making process.</p><p align="justify">That was what led her to New Salem.</p><p align="justify">There was only one place she could go. One place where the shadows held more than just darkness – to the likes of her, at least. <em>Lilia’s</em>.</p><p align="justify">Lilia was the matriarch of the Serpent’s Coil, a known and dangerous gang that operated in Boston. Her restaurant – her façade – was in New Salem, a seemingly normal city neighborhood, but where no sane soul would dare to go, much less in a rainy night such as this.</p><p align="justify">But Rio was starting to believe that her sanity needed to be questioned. She had to, because she was contemplating the flickering neon sign of this women’s restaurant: “<em>Lilia’s</em>”. Not much left to hide – which is how Rio knew this woman was to be feared: she displayed her name in big, bold letters for the city to see where she was.</p><p align="justify">But her mother told her about Lilia, when Rio was still a child. She told her how Lilia was an old fortress, like the last remaining coven, hidden within the heart of the Boston's crumbling infrastructure. If Rio was to be in any trouble, Lilia’s was to place to seek.</p><p align="justify"><br/>And Rio wondered just how many mothers would tell these stories to their witch children. Of how Lilia was to be their only chance at the precarious balance between survival after exposure.<br/>The rain intensified, almost mirroring the growing dread in her heart. She was a scientist, a woman of logic and reason. The cold, hard truth was that she had given up on her magic for science – a desperate attempt to a normal life. And now her life had shattered – and the magic she had tried to suppress for so long was rumbling inside her, feeding on her emotions of loss, rage and desperation.</p><p align="justify"><br/><em>Let go</em>.</p><p align="justify"><br/>She suppressed it all again. That voice in her head – or in her heart, she never knew.</p><p align="justify"><br/>With one last sigh, she left the graffiti-covered walls of the greasy alley she was in, and crossed the road to Lilia’s – the distant wail of sirens echoing the soundtrack to the city's forgotten corners.</p><p align="justify"><br/>She pushed the rusted door of the restaurant open, a creaked sound climbing up Rio’s neck. There truly was nothing in New Salem that was helping her journey in search of safe heaven.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio was at first surprised to see that this actually looked like a restaurant. A small one, sure – but a functional restaurant still. There was a faint smell of cooked onions and garlic in the air, embraced by the subtle energy, so small Rio almost missed it. All Serpent’s Coil members were magic users. <em>Witches</em>, Rio corrected in her mind. This was most definitely the base for Lilia’s gang.<br/>Two women were eating dinner at a corner table. A boy (a teenager?) was behind the counter, turning the pizza ovens off. All three looked at her with a menacing curiosity.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“Yes?” Asked one of the women. Her voice stern.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio felt the need to clear her throat before speaking. She could not afford to have her voice fail at a moment like this.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“I am looking for Lilia Calderu.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>She heard the boy make a small gasp while the same women raised an eyebrow.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“Oh?”, she interjected. “And who might be looking for her?”</p><p align="justify"><br/>“My name is Rio Vidal.” Rio was really trying to sound calm and sure of herself. She wasn’t.</p><p align="justify"><br/>She women stood from the table – her faded pink dress looked too thin for this autumn whether – and walked to Rio with strong steps and an almost mocking smile.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“I’m sorry Miss Vidal, I must not be acquainted with your royalness. Because surely a peasant women would not dare come looking for Lilia with manners like yours.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>This was a treat, of that Rio was sure.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“Care to name your family crest? Your status? Your bank account?”</p><p align="justify"><br/>No, this was <em>mockery</em>.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio must have looked like a spooked animal, because the boy intervened.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“Don’t be like that, Jen. She looks desperate.” She was, and she hated that he could see that. “Are you looking for help?”</p><p align="justify"><br/>The boy saved her. The <em>boy</em>. This was a new low for Rio, for sure. But she couldn’t be picky now. Not when she really was desperate.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“Yes. I really need to speak to Lilia Calderu. Tell her Maria Vidal sent me.” This wasn’t completely true, and she wasn’t sure it was going to work. But this was a time for a <em>hail mary</em>.</p><p align="justify"><br/>The boy was quick to disappear behind a door at the back of the place, and Rio mentally thanked him for the hurry.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Jen, however, stood her ground in front of Rio – serving as a barrier between her and the back door. Her obsidian eyes were piercing her, a mocking smile on her lips. Rio decided to look at the second women in the room. The small, dark-haired (with a red strip?) women was still enjoying her pasta dinner, seemingly oblivious to what was happening – although Rio doubted that was true. She was not going to test that.</p><p align="justify"><br/>It took three <em>very</em> long minutes for the boy to return, the whole time with Jen’s narrowed eyes glued to her.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“She said you can come in.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>His expression was unreadable. Despite that, Rio felt her breath let go – she didn’t know she was holding it.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Jen, on the other hand, looked offended. When she turned to the boy with a question on her lips, he was quick to answer: “Agatha is there.”, as that was an explanation alone.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Yet, this seemed to ease Jen just the tiny bit. Enough to step aside to let Rio pass and walk down the dimly lit hallway, closer to the heavy wooden back door.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“Good luck.” Whispered the boy, with a smile on his face, pushing the door open and stepping aside. <em>God</em>, thought Rio, <em>to be teenage and naive again</em>, as she entered, hesitant, into the back room. She wasn’t sure what awaited her, but she knew there was no turning back now.</p><p align="justify"><br/>She was expecting to meet Lilia by now, but Rio just entered another hallway. But this one was different, much narrower. Here, the air was thick with the scent of incense and something metallic, like iron or blood. The walls were lined with peeling wallpaper, its floral pattern faded. The floor creaked under her weight as she moved forward, and Rio reconsidered her teenage choice to become a horror movie enthusiast – even with that, and with the fact that her literal job (did she still had it?) was being a coroner, the whole scene just creeped her brains out.</p><p align="justify"><br/><em>Yup</em>, she though,<em> if this was a horror movie, I would definitely be walking into my own death trap</em>. Rio’s heart pounded in her chest as she approached the second door.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Before she could touch it, the door swung open. Rio could see the floor covered in a big, thick, patterned rug as she stepped in. The big chandelier in the ceiling was not casting a bright light – and Rio wondered if that was why there were scented candles burning in every corner. Rio noticed music playing so softly she could barely hear it – in fact, she wasn’t sure she was actually listening to Frank Sinatra, or it was just a suggestion in her head from seeing the vinyl from the corner of her left eye. </p><p align="justify"><br/>Behind the large black table – its surface cluttered with jars, artifacts and papers – sat a woman.<em> Lilia Calderu</em>. With silver-streaked hair pulled back into a sleek bun, and a long, yellow robe over her shoulders and back. The shiny pendant shaped like a coiled serpent was as commanding as her figure.</p><p align="justify"><br/>But Rio sensed that she was not the one filling the room with a <em>not so faint</em> hum of magic, a vibration that was making the hairs on the back of her neck stand. Rio looked at the presence on the edge of the table.</p><p align="justify"><br/>A woman with an imposing presence filled the space on that side of the room. She wasn’t taller than Rio, and her tailored black suit – that hugged her figure – matched perfectly her piercing blue eyes, locked onto her from the moment she stepped into the room. Rio swallowed the lump in her throat when she looked at the long and disheveled brown hair that framed a sharp face. Yes, the magic that was making the air difficult to breath was definitely coming from this woman.</p><p align="justify">
<br/>
<em>A sparkle in this room would cause a city-wide explosion, for sure.</em>
</p><p align="justify"><br/>“Dr. Vidal.” Lilia’s smooth voice broke her trance.</p><p align="justify"><br/>And Rio was a bit thrown away by the softness of that voice. Yes, her mother had told her about Lilia Calderu – but the stories were conflicting.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Because her mother always said to stay away from Lilia’s gang and New Salem, saying it was not a place for a young, respectable lady to be. The Serpent’s Coil had a fame of violence and drugs over the city, and Rio has heard all about it since she started working with the Boston PD.</p><p align="justify"><br/>But every now and then – maybe just three times in her life – when her mother looked sad or afraid over something she refused to explain, she would tell Rio that in case of trouble, Lilia would offer her protection. She would make sure Rio would know where to find Lilia, and she had to say her mother’s name. But Rio was a child then, and never quite questioned this. Her mother had died when she was just a teenager, and left more questions than memories.</p><p align="justify"><br/>But this wasn’t the time for sentimentality. She had come here for a reason. <em>And Lilia seemed to know who she was.</em></p><p align="justify"><br/>“You know me?” Her calling by her work title was not missed by Rio.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Lilia smiled, a faint, knowing curve of her lips reaching her eyes. “Of course. Witches don’t get through college, my dear. They don’t get to be doctors. They don’t get to live in the center of the big city. And they certainly don’t get to work with the Boston PD.” Her voice still low and smooth, but <em>something</em> else behind it now. “But then again, they don’t usually renounce the witch they are.”</p><p align="justify"><br/><em>Ah</em>, there it was, <em>judgement</em>.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“But I suppose that was to be expected by Maria’s daughter.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio swallowed hard, not sure if coming here had been a good idea. “You knew my mother?”. She was sure she framed it as a question.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“Of course. Maria was a remarkably smart woman. And fiercely protective of her daughter. I’ve always admired her resolutions, despite our disagreements.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio opened her mouth inquisitively but she was cut by Lilia. “But you are not here for your mother.” She motioned her hand for Rio to seat at the chair on the opposite side of the table. “Seat.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>And Rio did.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“I need your help. Your protection.” Rio said, her voice with a small tremble despite the efforts to keep it steady. “I think there is someone killing witches and making it look like accidents or natural causes.” Lilia’s hard expression told her to keep going. “I don’t really have concrete evidence, but I’ve found many inconsistencies in the autopsies. So far, I’ve encountered this in five women.” She sighed.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“I’ve tried communicating this to my bosses, but they’ve disregarded it. At first, I thought it was because these women were witches”, Rio looked guilty saying: “and cops just don’t care about them. Then I started to look further into these deaths. But this morning, I had cops at my door accusing me of killing them all myself. I think I was getting close to the truth, and someone sent those cops to shut me up.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>She was almost out of breath when she finished: “I feel like I’m being hunted. I don’t know who to trust or where to go.” admitted Rio, with a small voice. “I think they know I’m… I’m a witch too.” She did not enjoy the foul taste in her mouth as she pronounced those words.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio thinks she never, in her life, ever said this out loud. Never admitted to her true nature. </p><p align="justify"><br/>Lilia leaned back in her chair, her expression suddenly colder. “And what makes you think I can help you, Dr. Vidal? The world is not what it once was. Witches are no longer feared for their power; they are despised. It has been so for a long time. Even the Serpent’s Coil is a shadow of what it used to be. We survive, but we do not thrive. This has been the life of a witch.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio clenched her fists, a hot frustration bubbling up inside her. “I don’t have time for your lectures. If you can’t help me, just say so, and I’ll leave. But if you can, then tell me what I need to do. I’m not asking for much – just a place to hide and some information that can help me clear my name and stop whoever is behind this.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Lilia looked unwavering, and Rio stood in her chair, giving way to a flicker of anger – <em>was she starting to sweat? Was the room getting hotter?</em> "They are killing us, Lilia!”</p><p align="justify"><br/>“<em>Us</em>?”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio’s spine froze to the eco of <em>that</em> voice. The women with the blue eyes finally moved from her statue-like presence. She was what looked like an inch closer to Rio, enough that she could smell the faint scent of jasmine and something darker and primal. And Rio could not muster enough strength in her to look away from those eyes – feeling almost like she was drowning in an ocean, her skin no longer hot.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Lilia slowly stood and walked around the table.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“You have your mother’s fire, I’ll give you that.” Lilia said, her voice soft but with an edge of steel. “That’s good. You’ll need it. But fire alone won’t save you. You must understand that we are not a charity. If I am to help you, you will need to prove your worth – and to prove you are not here to kill us. Afterall, for all we know, you renounce your nature – who’s to say you aren’t the killer?”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio felt again a surge of anger at Lilia’s words, but she couldn’t deny the truth in them. She had spent years burying her magic, convincing herself that she could live a normal life if she just tried hard enough.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“What do you want from me?” Rio asked, her voice barely a whisper. With her world crumbling around her, she was feeling desperate, restless and hungry.</p><p align="justify">
<em>Hungry?</em>
</p><p align="justify">“You’ve spent too long suppressing your magic, Dr. Vidal. You’ve tried to live as one of them, to blend in and pretend you’re something you’re not. But you can’t outrun who you are. Not anymore.”</p><p align="justify">“What do you want from me?” Rio asked twice, her voice stronger now.</p><p align="justify"><br/><em>Get hungry</em>, Rio heard a voice in her head.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Lilia’s smile widened, and for the first time, Rio saw a glimpse of something dangerous in her eyes. “I want you to embrace who you are. I want you to stop running and start fighting. The world has tried to erase us, to silence us, but we are still here. It’s bad enough to be erased by others, I can’t let us be erased by our own. And if you want to survive, you’ll need to remember what it means to be a witch.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio’s mind raced as she tried to process Lilia’s words. She had spent so long trying to distance herself from her magic, from the part of her that made her different. Her heart sank a little, as she had hoped for a more straightforward solution.</p><p align="justify"><br/>She wasn’t even quite sure if she would be able to do what was being ask – Rio didn’t even know where to start. But her survival instinct kicked in time. “Fine.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Lilia’s smile turned almost predatory as she turned to walk back to the table to pick a small, carved box. She opened it and withdrew a vial filled with a dark, swirling liquid. “Like I said before, your mother was smart and very protective of you. It is no wonder that you don’t feel the pull of magic like other witches do.” she said, holding the vial out to Rio. “You will have to be taught the ways of magic and witches, but you have a block that needs to be taken care of first.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio instinctively took the vial with her hand, her fingers brushing against Lilia’s as she did so. “A block?”</p><p align="justify"><br/>“Your mother put a protection spell on you, blocking your chains of magic. You can still use it, but you are very weak now. That is not good if you are thinking of fighting back whoever is hunting you.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio stared at the vial, her stomach churning with fear and doubt. She didn’t know what was in it, truly – and the scientist in her was having her reasonableness being tested to the limit today. She had so many questions – and so little time.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio hesitated for only a moment before uncorking the vial and bringing it to her lips. The liquid was bitter and thick, and it burned as it slid down her throat. Almost immediately, she felt a strange warmth spreading through her body, through her arteries and veins, and she could feel <em>something</em> stirring within her, adjusting. Something ancient.</p><p align="justify"><br/>She felt a wave of dizziness. Rio stumbled, clutching the edge of the table for support, her vision blurring.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Lilia seemed surprised. “It is not supposed to affect you that much. That potion only takes care of the block. After so many years ignoring your magic, it should be too dormant for you to feel anything already.” She was now by Rio’s side. “Not before training, anyway.” Rio heard her say, in the direction of the other women.</p><p align="justify">
<br/>
<em>Set me free.</em>
</p><p align="justify"><br/>“I’m fine”. Rio lied, closing her eyes and clenching her fists until she felt her vision going back to normal, and the room coming to a stop. She felt her heart beat faster and a sense of something untamed in her chest. <em>Maybe this is what anxiety feels like</em>. She wasn’t going to let this overwhelm her.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“What’s next? Any more trials for me to prove my worth?” Rio asked with mockery, her teeth clenched as she fought the nausea that was coming from seeing the room spin a few seconds ago.<br/>With this, the blue-eyed women quickly grabbed Rio’s shirt with one hand and forcibly pulled her against the wall – dragging Rio’s body for a few steps with ease.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio felt a pain in her back before hearing the other women dangerously say: “Show some respect.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>"Agatha," Lilia said, her voice laced with authority, "Rio is under my protection now”. Agatha did not move one inch. “I’ll have you in charge of her safety. This seems too dangerous to have anyone else. The first thing now is to make sure she stays hidden, to let things cool off a bit, before considering any next steps.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Agatha nodded, far from thrilled about the arrangement. She let go of Rio’s shirt, but her gaze was still relentless. "As you command, Lilia."</p><p align="justify"><br/>“Take her to one of our safehouses, in the city.” Agatha nodded again, this time turning away from Rio to get her coat that was hanging near the door.</p><p align="justify"><br/>Lilia turned to Rio this time. “She will keep you safe. You will have time to embrace your magic, and in the meantime, we will assist in uncovering the truth behind these murders. We cannot allow witch hunters to think we will not fight back.” Lilia continued. “Agatha is one of our most powerful witches. You would do well to listen to her.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio nodded, shaking the feeling that she was stepping into something far more complicated than she’d anticipated.</p><p align="justify"><br/>“We should go fast.” Agatha said, now sounding irritated. “It’s not safe to stay in one place for too long.”</p><p align="justify"><br/>Rio hesitated, then followed Agatha out of the room after mouthing a “thank you” to Lilia.</p><p align="justify"><br/>As they made their way back through the hallway, her heart was still racing. Rio tried to quiet all her thoughts. She had to focus now on her safety. She would go to the safehouse, let things cool off, then find a way to figure out who was behind the murders, and put them into jail. Only after <em>all of that</em>, would she think about the magic that wanted to take over her body.</p>

<p align="justify">Agatha was walking with fast steps towards the exit of the restaurant, making it hard for Rio to follow without a small jog.</p><p align="justify">As they passed by Jen, the boy and the smaller woman, Agatha told them: “Go to Lilia.” And with that, she was out the door.</p><p align="justify"><em>A woman of many words</em>, though Rio, sarcastically. But she was surprised as Agatha held the door of the restaurant open for her, as she was scanning the streets with her eyes. She raised her arm, car keys in hand, when she said: “Get in.”, pointing towards the black SUV parked just near them and opening it with a small noise.</p><p align="justify">As they both entered the vehicle, silence took over. Rio took the opportunity that Agatha was the one driving to rewind everything that was happening. She had left her house in a hurry this morning, taking only her phone and the clothes she was wearing. All her research was there too.</p><p align="justify">Rio looked at the clock of the car. It was almost midnight. <em>God, she was tired</em>. And cold. Her clothes were damped from the rain she caught while running in the streets – she hadn’t even dare to cross the town in her own car.</p><p align="justify">“Where are we going? Can we stop by my house?” Rio asked, looking closely at Agatha for the first time.</p><p align="justify">She couldn’t deny that this woman was simply gorgeous. If she had crossed her path in a bar, Rio would probably have asked for her number. <em>I guess that part of my life is also on stand-by</em>, though Rio. She just wanted all of this to be over.</p><p align="justify">Agatha looked at her with a fully judgmental stare. “No, we are not stopping by your now-likely-being-surveilled-by-cops-house.” With a sigh she looked back into the road. “We are going to Back Bay. We have a safehouse there”.</p><p align="justify"><em>What’s with the attitude</em>. Rio was a little offended – it’s not like <em>she</em> is accustomed to these things. She probably should – she did work for the Boston PD and all. But she wasn’t.</p><p align="justify">“I don’t have clothes.” Rio finally admitted.<br/>
She saw something flicker in Agatha’s eyes before the woman answered her: “You’ll have something in the safehouse, don’t worry.”</p><p align="justify">A little after that, Rio noticed that they were driving anywhere but Black Bay. She knew Boston pretty well, even if she never was in New Salem before – but they already passed Callahan Tunnel so she knew her way around here.</p><p align="justify">She was opening her mouth at the same time Agatha spoke, as if guessing her thoughts: “We have cops following us since the tunnel. So, my question is…” And Agatha turned to her wearing her most wicked smile on her lips, and a certain kind of joy in her eyes. “… are they following because of me or because of you?”</p><p align="justify"><em>Yup</em>, if Rio was to meet Agatha in a bar she would <em>definitely</em> ask for her number because this woman’s smile, even if predatory, was enthralling.</p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes, trying to seem unfazed. “So, I am supposed to assume that everyone in the Serpent’s Coil gang is a criminal?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha scoffed at that. Oh, she is a <em>proud</em> criminal. Great.</p><p align="justify">“What difference does it make? Won’t you just loose them?”</p><p align="justify">“Well, <em>my</em> cops are pretty mild. Boring even.” Agatha looked at Rio again. “We could have a bit of fun. Test your new-found magic…”</p><p align="justify">Rio mouth fell open. Have fun doing illegal things and harming cops? Sure, had more reasons for her to be in jail.</p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed – a small fun laugh. Rio could get used to this if she doesn’t end up in jail.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t worry, pup. We do have to lay low.” Agatha sounded almost disappointed.</p><p align="justify">They entered an underground parking lot. Rio no longer remembered where they were – too many turning right and left to lose the cops. Agatha parked the car. “Get out. We are switching cars.”</p><p align="justify">They quickly changed to a red coupe car, and Agatha drove out of the parking lot.</p><p align="justify">They drove in circles a few more times, making sure they truly lost the cops, before making their way to Black Bay.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The safehouse was a small, nondescript brick house tucked away in a quiet street. It was unassuming – exactly what they needed. Agatha led Rio inside, her movements brisk and efficient as she locked the door behind them and began to check the windows.</p><p align="justify">Rio stood in the middle of the living room, feeling out of place. The house was sparsely furnished, with only the bare essentials – a couch, a table, a few chairs, a small kitchen. The walls were bare, and the air smelled faintly of dust and old wood.</p><p align="justify">“Make yourself at home,” Agatha said, though her tone suggested that Rio shouldn’t get too comfortable. “We’ll be here for a while.”</p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, though she wasn’t sure what to do with herself. She glanced around the living room, noticing just now the bag that Agatha had brought with her. “How long do you think we’ll need to stay here?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha shrugged. “As long as it takes. Lilia will be working on getting us more information, but until then, we need to get off the cops radar. You can find clothes in the bedroom’s closet.”</p><p align="justify">
<em>The bedroom? As in a single bedroom?</em>
</p><p align="justify">“I’ll stay on the couch. It’s closer to the door.” Agatha said.</p><p align="justify">Rio wondered if Agatha we capable of reading minds because she was being pretty spot-on on her comments. Maybe she was just used to this e Rio wasn’t the first witch she had to guard.</p><p align="justify">With a nod, Rio disappeared into the bedroom. She was now realizing that she was freezing, with her damp clothes making it difficult to withstand the autumn night chill. She grabbed some clothes from the closet and headed to take a bath. </p><p align="justify">The warm water was a welcome relief, washing away the grime and tension of the day. Rio rested her head against the wall of the shower, letting the heat seep into her bones. Her mind, however, was far from relaxed. The events of the day replayed in her head like a broken record – the fear, the running, the realization that she was now a fugitive, the magic…</p><p align="justify">She thought about Agatha, the strangely acute woman who had been assigned as her protector. Agatha must be powerful, because her stance fills a room. Rio wondered what her story was, how she had ended up as Lilia’s right hand.</p><p align="justify">When she finally emerged from the bathroom, dressed in a black sweater and sweatpants, she was too awake to go to bed – adrenaline still kicking in her system. She heard small noises coming from the living room, she Rio decided that she was thirsty. <em>For water</em>, she added, in her head.</p><p align="justify">She found Agatha in the kitchen, brewing a pot of tea. The aroma of chamomile and lavender filled the air.</p><p align="justify">“Tea?” Agatha offered, holding up a mug.</p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, accepting it with a grateful smile. “Thanks.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha just remained leaning onto the kitchen doorway, and Rio decided to take a seat at the small table of the living room, trying not to look like she was making an excuse to not go to bed. The silence between them was heavy but not uncomfortable. Rio took a sip of the tea, the warmth spreading through her chest.</p><p align="justify">“How did you find out about the witch hunters?” Agatha asked, her expression more serious now.</p><p align="justify">Rio took a deep breath, then began to explain. She told Agatha about the autopsies she had performed, the patterns she had noticed. She first started thinking it was weird how suddenly women in their early 30s and 40s were having fatal accidents or deaths that seemed natural. <em>Something</em> had her looking closely and one of them – that was when she found residue of drained energy. She went back to her most recent cases and found all were witches. But their magic had been taken – which was why Rio didn’t get to this conclusion early on. And if they were all witches with their magic drained, this was pointing to something far more sinister. Some sort of serial killer, she thought at first. But it didn’t seem like that because the only thing common between these women was the fact that they were witches – all their apparent causes for death were not similar, like one would expect in serial killing.</p><p align="justify">“But then also something else was weird. They all had been reported missing before their bodies were found. And then there were the reports – <em>my</em> reports. Someone had been altering them, covering up the inconsistences I found.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “That was when you started suspecting someone from the police department itself?”</p><p align="justify">“Yes” Rio said. “I think it’s someone high up. They have access to the files, the evidence. They’re covering their tracks.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned more into the doorway; her expression thoughtful. “And you think they’re targeting witches specifically?”<br/>
Rio nodded. “Yes. It’s not random. They’re hunting. And it must be something well organized to have slipped under Lilia’s nose for so long.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s jaw tightened, a flicker of anger in her eyes. “Do you have any idea why?”</p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, then shook her head. “Not yet. I was hoping you would know more about that then me.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha was silent for a moment, her gaze distant. “Why did you renounce to being a witch?”</p><p align="justify">Rio was caught off guard with the question, choking on a small sip of tea.</p><p align="justify">She tried answering the question, opening and closing her mouth three times, before looking ashamed when saying: “I guess normalcy was just too tempting.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t comment on that. Even if she did look disappointed, she didn’t press further. “You should go to rest. You’ve been through… a long day. We don’t know what tomorrow will bring us.”, her voice bare.</p><p align="justify">Rio just nodded, feeling she had let Agatha down with her answer. She finished her tea in silence, then stood to leave the cup at the kitchen sink, almost brushing Agatha’s side.</p><p align="justify">“Goodnight,” she said softly, not looking into the woman’s blue eyes. She headed for the bedroom.</p><p align="justify">“Goodnight, Rio. Sleep well.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio climbed into bed, pulling the blankets up to her chin. She was still convinced that adrenaline was commanding her body, as she stared at the ceiling, but exhaustion was quick to take over, and she drifted into a restless sleep.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio woke up to a faint creak. She thought maybe Agatha was still awake. <em>That women must be a night owl</em>.</p><p align="justify">But then she heard it again. This time she was sure the creak was <em>inside</em> her bedroom. Rio’s heart leapt into her throat. She sat up, her eyes darting to the door. The house was supposed to be secure, but something was wrong.</p><p align="justify">She was looking for something she could use as a weapon, when suddenly a shadow came through the bedroom’s window, breaking it into shards that flew in Rio’s direction. Rio barely had time to react before a figure lunged at her, pinning her to the wall and strangling her neck. She struggled, but the man was strong – far stronger than he should have been. His eyes glowed with an unnatural light, and his breath smelled of chemicals.</p><p align="justify">“You should have dropped the cases,” he hissed, his voice low and guttural. “Now, you’re just another witch who needs to be put down.”</p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart pounded in her chest as she tried to push him away, but it was no use. She could feel something magic in him – a dark, twisted force that made her skin crawl. She recognized him as a cop from her station. But this was no ordinary cop – he was something else.</p><p align="justify">Rio was starting to have a hard time breath when the man was ripped away from her.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stood in the doorway of her bedroom, her eyes blazing with fury. She moved with speed and precision that was almost inhuman, her hands glowing with a bright, purple light. She grabbed the man by the throat and slammed him against the floor, her grip like iron.</p><p align="justify">“You picked the wrong witch to mess with,” she snarled.</p><p align="justify">The man struggled, but Agatha’s power was too much for him. She began to drain his magic, the glow in his eyes fading as his strength ebbed away. But just as she was about to finish him off, something changed.</p><p align="justify">The man’s body went rigid, his eyes rolling back in his head. And then, with a sudden, violent jerk, he broke free of Agatha’s grip and lunged at Rio once more.</p><p align="justify">Rio braced herself for the impact.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha quickly stood from the floor. A weird silence suddenly filled the room, a cold sensation washing over her. Her eyes took a moment to register what was happening.</p><p align="justify">She saw the men that was attacking Rio completely pierced by many black vines of magic that were coming from Rio. Agatha could hear the men drowning in his own blood, with his insides exposed like a pig at a slaughterhouse.</p><p align="justify">But that was… no longer Rio.</p><p align="justify">The vines retracted back to Rio, and the men fell onto the floor – dead.</p><p align="justify">It was then that Agatha had a full view to the woman in front of her.</p><p align="justify">“<em>Hello, Agatha.</em>” Rio’s voice much lower, much guttural. “<em>It’s been a long time</em>.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes widened in shock. Rio’s stance was completely different, as she seemed to stand taller and poised. “Death,” she whispered.</p><p align="justify">Rio – or rather, the entity that had seemingly taken control of her body – smiled faintly. “<em>You always were perceptive.</em>”</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t dare to move, her eyes fixed on the visible bones from the lower part of Rio’s face. “What do you want?”</p><p align="justify">Death tilted her head, as if considering the question. “The same thing I’ve always wanted,” she said simply. “<em>Balance.</em>” She took a few steps closer to Agatha, stopping only a few inches apart. “<em>But for now, I’ll settle for keeping her alive.</em>”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression hardened. She was going to press on that, when, just as suddenly as it had taken control, the entity was gone.</p><p align="justify">Agatha saw Rio barely waking up from trance before her body gave in, trembling, and collapsing. Agatha was quick enough to catch her before she hit the ground.</p><p align="justify">“Rio,” Agatha said, her voice filled with apprehension. “Are you okay?”</p><p align="justify">Rio tried to speak, but the words wouldn’t come. Her vision blurred, and the last thing she saw before everything went black was Agatha’s face, filled with a mixture of fear and concern.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio woke to the faint scent of lavender and the soft hum of magic in the air. Her head throbbed, and her body felt heavy, as if she’d been drained of all her energy. She blinked, her vision slowly coming into focus, and realized she was lying on a massive bed – a new room she didn’t recognize. The walls were lined with bookshelves, lit by the clear sunlight, and the room was warm and comforting.</p><p align="justify">Rio could hear two voices from outside the bedroom. She sat up as she tried to listen – sure that one of the voices was of Agatha. She crept out of bed and padded to the door, pressing her ear against it.</p><p align="justify">“...taken care of,” The other feminine voice was saying. “Lilia thinks they are targeting specific witches, and they’re covering their tracks well.”</p><p align="justify">“Do you think they know about us helping now?” Agatha asked.</p><p align="justify">“It’s possible,” The other voice said. “Which is why we need to be careful. Lilia’s working on getting more information, but until then, she told to rush the girl’s training.”</p><p align="justify">Rio’s stomach churned and she started feeling hot again. She stepped back from the door, her mind racing. Was she feeling magic charging the air? And why was it making her head hurt more?</p><p align="justify">As she was pinching her nose to stop the headache, the door opened, showing Agatha with an eyebrow raised when she saw Rio standing there. “Eavesdropping?” she asked, though there was a hint of amusement in her voice.</p><p align="justify">Rio flushed. “I didn’t mean to. I just… I heard voices.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded. She stepped aside to let Rio look at the other women in the living room.</p><p align="justify">“Hi, I’m Alice.” The woman eating dinner the night before, Rio remembered. “How are you feeling?”</p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, taking a few steps to be in the living room, the light coming from the windows making her close her eyes a bit. “Like I got hit by a truck,” she muttered, rubbing her temples. “What… what happened?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze flickered Rio’s entire body, assessing. “You don’t remember?”</p><p align="justify">Rio meet her gaze, her eyes widening as the memories came flooding back – the attack, the man’s glowing eyes, the way he’d pinned her to the wall. And then…</p><p align="justify">“Yeah… We were attacked.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha narrowed her eyes, her expression unreadable. “That’s all you remember?”</p><p align="justify">Rio was hesitant. “Yeah…” The floor was suddenly much more interesting to look at.</p><p align="justify">A silence hung thick between the two, when Alice cough.</p><p align="justify">“Well, I’ll leave you be.” Alice then turned to Agatha. “Will get in touch if we find anything more.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha was still looking at Rio. “Thank you, Alice.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha studied Rio for a moment, then walked over to the kitchen counter – an open kitchen. She poured another mug of coffee and handed it to Rio, letting her take a seat on the couch. “Drink this. It’ll help.”</p><p align="justify">This appartement was much nicer than the last safehouse they were in. “Where are we?”</p><p align="justify">“My appartement”. And then Agatha added quickly. “Why did you lie to me just now?”</p><p align="justify">Rio blinked several times, she still felt half asleep. “W-what?” Agatha sat in a chair nearby, her sharp blue eyes fixed on Rio. “What do you mean?” Was this Agatha’s apartment? She didn’t expect it to be so bright.</p><p align="justify">“Just now, you said you don’t remember.”</p><p align="justify">“I said I remember being attacked.” Rio defended.</p><p align="justify">“But you remember something more.” Agatha pressed, her voice annoyed. “Rio, you are a terrible liar.”</p><p align="justify">Rio was going to fake being offended, but she sensed Agatha wasn’t going to appreciate her theatricals. “What do you what me to say?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha stood from the chair with a quick motion – she looked beyond annoyed. “The truth!” Rio swallowed dry. “It was Death, wasn’t it?”</p><p align="justify">The moment she said it, Agatha regretted it. Because if Rio was embarrassed for being a witch, she was much more ashamed for this secret.</p><p align="justify">“Yes…” a small tremble whisper.</p><p align="justify">She was holding the steaming mug of coffee like it was the only thing that occupied her mind now, playing with the edges of it – an almost childlike behavior.</p><p align="justify">Agatha sighed and scratched the back of her neck. She had pressed too much. “Just don’t… don’t lie to me again.” Then she walked towards the kitchen. “Let’s get you breakfast first.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="justify">The morning light cast a warm, golden hue over Agatha’s living room and kitchen. The calmness it brought was a comforting contrast to the storm of thoughts raging in Rio’s mind. She still had most of her coffee, swirling on the crimson mug, and she let her gaze go distant – the rhythmic sound, coming from the kitchen just behind her, of metal whisking the eggs was oddly soothing.</p><p align="justify">Death.</p><p align="justify">The word echoed in her mind like a distant thunderclap, both terrifying and surreal. She had felt its presence since she was a child, though she had never been able to name it. It was a shadow that lingered at the edge of her consciousness, a whisper in the dark that she could never quite decipher. But now, she couldn’t deny it any longer. And she just barely understands why there was a need for her to be a witch – something she always wished she wasn’t. But to be Death’s vessel as well? To have Death inside her – like she was nothing more than a marionette.</p><p align="justify">Rio leaned back against the couch, her chest tightening as she tried to make sense of it all. Why her? Was this why her mother had gone to such lengths to suppress her magic as a child? The memory of Death’s voice echoing through her, the way it had seized control of her body sent a shiver down her spine. She could be controlled to kill people. It was horrifying, unnatural, and yet…</p><p align="justify">There was something disturbingly familiar about it. A part of her felt an inexplicable, almost primal connection to Death, as if it had always been there, lurking in her subconscious, waiting for the right moment to emerge. She couldn’t quite put her finger on it, but she was almost certain she had heard its whispers for a long time, faint and fleeting. But her memories were somewhat intertwined with her magic – both forgotten a long time ago.</p><p align="justify">She could still hear her mother’s voice in her head: “<em>You’ll forget all about this.</em>” She would play this again and again when she was missing her. Rio always thought this was from a time when her mother would say she would forget about being a witch, so that she could have a better life. Now, she was not sure about it.</p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head, trying to dispel the gnawing question that clawed at the edges of her mind: <em>What am I</em>? Was she still Rio, or was she slowly becoming something else, something monstrous and capable of killing? The thought made her stomach churn, and she tightened her grip on the mug, her fingers trembling slightly.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s voice broke through her thoughts. “Okay, first things first.” She had set their plates on the table – fluffy scrambled eggs and golden toasts – and Rio to take a seat, in front of her. “You need to stop feeling ashamed about being a witch. There’s nothing wrong with that – it’s just how we’re born.”</p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes, a defensiveness on her face, despite the relieve that Death was not the subject of the conversation. “Sure, nothing wrong? Witches aren’t allowed to live normal lives, in case you’ve missed it. We can’t study, can’t own businesses, can’t have families. Society shames us at every turn!”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression hardened, her gaze steady as she leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table. With this, Rio noticed she was wearing a t-shirt, and the ink of a tattoo was creeping from her right shoulder. “And society is wrong. Not us. We’ve done nothing to be ashamed of.” Her voice was low but resolute, like carrying the weight of centuries of persecution. “Witches are women with power, and we used to be pillars of a much more equal and fair society. But men have always feared our strength. They burned us in the past, and now they criminalize us in the present. But we’ve done nothing wrong – certainly not by just existing.”</p><p align="justify">Despite the calmness in her tone, Agatha’s words were sharp, cutting through Rio’s defenses. She was trying to drill this truth into Rio’s head, to make her see that their magic was not a curse but a birthright.</p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t resist lightening the mood – humor as always been a way to flee facing her fears. “Are you giving me the ‘it’s okay to be gay’ speech?” She quipped, a mischievous glint in her eye – hoping Agatha wouldn’t see through her act.</p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, caught off guard, her cheeks flushing slightly. “What? No! I mean… yes, it’s okay to be gay. It’s okay to be a gay witch too. That’s not… I’m not comparing the two.” She shook her head, rubbing her temples. “I’m not making a speech, okay?”</p><p align="justify"><em>Oh</em>, she tried hiding a smile, <em>Agatha was fun to mess with</em>. And Rio didn't let it go unnoticed just how easy was to talk to Agatha, even if they had met less then twenty four hours ago.</p><p align="justify">“All I’m saying,” Agatha continued, her tone firm once more, “is that you need to drop this ‘I don’t want to use magic because it’s sinful’ nonsense. We are not second-class citizens.”</p><p align="justify">When Agatha caught sight of Rio’s poorly hidden smile, she frowned, her lips twitching in a mix of exasperation and amusement. “Oh, you’re a little shit, aren’t you?”</p><p align="justify">Rio laughed outright this time, the sound bright and unexpected in the heavy atmosphere. “Yeah, I’ve been told that a few times.” She fiddled with the piercing in her left ear, a nervous habit she’d had for years. “I get what you’re saying. I should try harder to deconstruct all the anti-witch, patriarchal crap society shoves down our throats.” Agatha nodded, seemingly pleased with her conclusion. “It’s just… easier said than done, you know? Accepting who I am, embracing it… it’s going to take time.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression softened, and she gave a small nod. “I’ll give you that.” She said, finally picking up her fork to eat her eggs – a gesture that she would drop the subject.</p><p align="justify">But Rio wasn’t done. She hesitated, her gaze dropping to her plate as she broached the topic that had been gnawing at her since this morning. “And I’m not just a witch…” she added quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify">Agatha paused, her fork hovering mid-air as she studied Rio with a curious, almost searching expression. “No, you’re not,” she agreed after a moment. “But Death is a witch too, Rio. Don’t forget that.” She set her fork down, leaning forward slightly as if to emphasize her point. “I’m not sure how well you paid attention in your Witches’ History classes – assuming you even had them – but Death was never the boogeyman. Not to us. She was… the natural order of things. The balance in our world. Death would materialize into a witch when the world needed equilibrium. To witches, she’s seen more as a righteous savior – one who ensures our ancient duties to society are still being upheld.”</p><p align="justify">Rio listened intently, her chest tightening as Agatha’s words washed over her. There was a strange comfort in them, even if she didn’t fully understand their weight. To her, Death had always been something to fear, something dark and unknowable. But Agatha’s perspective offered a glimmer of clarity, a new lens through which to view the entity that now resided within her.</p><p align="justify">“How do you know so much about Death?” Rio asked.</p><p align="justify">“I did go to Witches’ History class”. Agatha quickly quipped – their banter remaining light. She then cleared her throat. “Now that you know there’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Agatha said gently, “do you want to talk about it?” Her question hung in the air, unspoken but clear: <em>Do you want to talk about you being Death?</em></p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated, her fingers tracing the edge of her plate as she gathered her thoughts. “I’m not sure how to start, to be honest.” She admitted. “I think my mother’s block was more than what Lilia though. I think it didn’t just suppress my magic – it blocked some memories, too. Things I can’t quite grasp, but I know are there. And it’s not just because time as passed.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her expression thoughtful. “I understand. Well, once we start your training, the block on your magic should slowly dissolve. It’s possible the same will happen with your memories.”</p><p align="justify">Rio met Agatha’s steady gaze, those piercing blue eyes that seemed to see straight through her. For a moment, she let herself feel a flicker of hope – a sense that maybe, just maybe, she wasn’t as alone in this as she had thought. But Agatha didn’t press further. Instead, she returned to her eggs, the conversation shifting as seamlessly as the morning light streaming through the windows.</p><p align="justify">And Rio and a bubbling question for Agatha. She wanted to know, but… There would be time, Rio realized, to unravel all of this – the tangled threads of her identity, the bond she shared with Death, the memories that lingered just out of reach. But for now, they have more pressing matters to attend to. Someone was framing her for the murders of witches, and that was a problem that couldn’t wait.</p><p align="justify">Content with the changing of her line of thinking, Rio took a bite of her toast, her eyes wandering around Agatha’s living room.</p><p align="justify">The space was a reflection of the woman herself – elegant, understated, and full of character. The art deco style was evident in the clean lines and geometric patterns, with faded purple as the dominant color, giving the room a sense of timeless sophistication.</p><p align="justify">Her gaze landed on the only two photos displayed in the room, perched on a shelf behind Agatha. One was a selfie of a boy with Agatha and Lilian in the background, all three of them at a beach, fully clothed but clearly enjoying themselves – at least the boy and Lilia. The other photo caught her attention more – it showed a younger Agatha, perhaps in her early twenties, standing beside a red-haired woman. Agatha was making a funny face, trying to look bored, but the other woman had her arm wrapped around Agatha’s shoulders, her smile radiant and full of life.</p><p align="justify">Rio couldn’t help but stare at the woman’s face, a strange sense of recognition tugging at her.</p><p align="justify">
<em>Oh…</em>
</p><p align="justify">“What’s her name?” she asked suddenly, her voice cutting through the quiet.</p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, following Rio’s gaze to the photo behind her. Her expression shifted, with a hint of sadness. “Wanda.” She said softly.</p><p align="justify">“Was she a girlfriend?” Rio asked, unable to curb her curiosity.</p><p align="justify">Agatha met her eyes, not oblivious to the past tense in Rio’s question. “No. We were childhood friends.” She paused, her voice steady but heavy with emotion. “She died five months ago.”</p><p align="justify">Rio held her breath. “I know.” She admitted, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes widened slightly, and she waited for Rio to elaborate.</p><p align="justify">“I did her autopsy.” Rio confessed, feeling as though she were admitting to a crime. Given that she was currently being pursued by the police, she supposed she might as well get used to the feeling. “She was one of the witches whose magic was drained.” Agatha’s face was unreadable. “I didn’t know at the time – I only found out more recently.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha was silent for a long moment, her gaze distant. “Somehow, that makes more sense.” she said finally, her voice quiet. “Witches don’t really die in car crashes.” She attempted a sad smile, but it didn’t reach her eyes.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah.” Rio agreed. “It was made to look like that.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha leaned back in her chair, her posture stiff as if bracing herself against the weight of the conversation. “Billy is her son.” She said after a pause. “The boy who was at the restaurant last night. </p><p align="justify">He’s been staying with us since. It… hasn’t been easy for him.”</p><p align="justify">“Losing a parent rarely is.” Rio murmured, her voice tinged with sympathy.</p><p align="justify">The room fell silent again. Rio’s mind raced, the questions she had been holding back sparkling to the surface. “Agatha,” she began hesitantly, “what is your connection to Death?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s brow furrowed, her expression guarded. “What do you mean?”</p><p align="justify">“I know she recognized you. I know she knew your name yesterday.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated, her gaze dropping to her plate as if searching for the right words. “I’m not sure ‘to know’ is the right word, but…” She trailed off, her voice uncertain.</p><p align="justify">“Those are two words,” Rio pointed out, a faint smile tugging at her lips despite the gravity of the conversation.</p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a small, humorless laugh as she rolled her eyes. “But… when I was a kid, she came to my rescue.”</p><p align="justify">“Death?” Rio asked, her voice barely above a whisper. Shouldn’t Death be in the business of killing, instead of…the opposite? Was this the “balance” Agatha was talking about earlier?</p><p align="justify">“Yeah.” Agatha’s tone was distant, as if trying to relive the memory. “I don’t know why. I was fifteen, and I… almost died. But suddenly, I felt this dark pulse of magic, and she was standing in front of me. She knew my name even then – I don’t know how. She just looked at me, didn’t say a word, and then she was gone as quickly as she appeared, once she made sure I was safe.” Agatha paused, her eyes meeting Rio’s. “This might sound stupid, but the more I look at you and the more I revisit that memory, I think it was you back then.” Rio looked horrified at the discovery. “I mean, Death in your body. I can’t be sure, though – it’s hard to tell with the whole ‘it was 20 years ago’ and the skull thing.”</p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched, her mind racing to process what Agatha was saying. “She saved you?”</p><p align="justify">
<em>The skull thing?</em>
</p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded, her expression thoughtful. “’<em>Death comes for the wretched souls</em>’.” Like she was reciting a line from an ancient tome. “I suppose sometimes she comes for the living one–...”</p><p align="justify">But before Agatha could finish, Rio cut in, her voice sharp and insistent. “What skull thing?” she demanded, her brow furrowed as she latched onto the earlier detail Agatha had mentioned.</p><p align="justify">Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the interruption. She tilted her head, studying Rio with amusement. “Do you have ADHD?” Her tone teasing but not unkind. “You seem to have trouble focusing on one subject at a time.”</p><p align="justify">“No,” Rio replied flatly, her expression unamused.</p><p align="justify">Agatha smirked, clearly enjoying the back-and-forth – grateful for the interruption on a subject she didn’t want to revisit. “Aren’t you impressed that I sounded like a scholar just now?” Oh, the mock pride lacing her voice. “I didn’t even go to school, you know.”</p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes, though a faint smirk tugged at the corner of her lips. “Yes, very impressive. You’re incredibly smart. Now stop using humor as a deflector – that’s <em>my</em> thing. Answer my question.” Her tone was firm, but there was a glimmer of playfulness in her eyes, a hint that she wasn’t entirely immune to Agatha’s charm.</p><p align="justify">Agatha chuckled softly, leaning back in her chair. “Fine, fine. Since you don’t like to share things…” She said, holding up her hands in mock surrender. “But you’re no fun when you’re this serious, you know that?” Why was this woman’s mood so light right now?</p><p align="justify">Rio raised an eyebrow, forcing her smirk to widen. “I’m plenty of fun. You just don’t like being on the receiving end of my own tactics.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed outright at that, the sound warm and genuine. “Understood.” She said, shaking her head. “Alright, the skull thing… Well, when Death is…” Agatha vaguely gesture in Rio’s direction. “… well, you. Your bones are showing. Like, half your face.”</p><p align="justify">Rio seemed like she was going to follow on that, but then her eyes narrowed as another thought occurred to her. “You said you almost died?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a faint smirk. “No ADHD?” she quipped.</p><p align="justify">Rio shot her a withering look. “That’s not how the diagnosis is done, Agatha.” She retorted, her voice dry but edged with a hint of glee.</p><p align="justify">Agatha feigned innocence, placing a hand over her heart in mock apology. “Oh, I’m sorry, <em>Dr. Vidal</em>. I don’t know any better.” An exaggerated deference.</p><p align="justify">Rio leaned forward, her gaze piercing. “But I’m sure Freud would have a field day with your avoidant personality.” She fired back – she wasn’t going to let Agatha get all the fun.</p><p align="justify">“Avoidant personality?” Agatha echoed, her smirk widening as she leaned back in her chair, clearly enjoying the sparring. “I’m sorry, I just met you yesterday. I’m not about to lay my whole life out for you just yet. Buy a girl a drink first, at least.”</p><p align="justify">Rio’s lips twitched, but she wasn’t backing down. She put on a more serious face. “Out with the answer.” Her eyes locked on Agatha’s with an intensity that left no room for deflection.</p><p align="justify">Agatha held her gaze for a moment, the playful glint in her eyes disappearing as she sighed. “Alright, alright. I said I almost died.”</p><p align="justify">“‘Witches don’t really die in car crashes.’” Rio repeated, her voice slow and deliberate. “You said that.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line, her silence speaking volumes.</p><p align="justify">Rio leaned back in her chair, her mind spinning with the implications. Before she could press further, Agatha stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. “Are you finished with your breakfast?” She asked, her tone almost brisk. “We need to train.”</p><p align="justify">Rio glanced down at her half-eaten plate, her appetite long gone. Someone tried to kill Agatha when she was just fifteen. Her stomach churned at that though. Were men trying to kill her – maybe they started this witch hunting thing a lot earlier then she though.</p><p align="justify">The conversation was far from over, but for now, she would let the subject go. She was sure it wasn’t a light conversation for Agatha to have.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry about your friend, Agatha.” Rio still wanted to let Agatha know she cared. “I swear I’ll try my best to make sure no one else suffers the same fate.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio found herself standing in the middle of Agatha’s living room, feeling anxious. The room had been cleared of furniture, leaving a wide, open space that felt both intimidating and strangely serene. Agatha stood across from her, close to the exit door, near a set of buttons that were on the wall – why was she just now noticing that Agatha was wearing yoga pants?</p><p align="justify">“Look,” Agatha began, her tone calm but serious – forcing Rio to stop thinking how good the other woman looked, “the reason I brought you to my apartment is that I have a sort of Faraday cage here. It blocks magic fields. You can still feel magic inside you, but it prevents you from channeling it. This place is like a fortress against attackers. But here’s the thing: magic can be overwhelming the first few times you try to use it. You might feel fine now, but that’s only because the cage is active. Once I deactivate it, you could feel… well, a lot. I need you to stay calm. Breathe slowly, focus, and control yourself. Can you do that?”</p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, though her stomach churned at the thought. She wasn’t sure what “a lot” meant, but the way Agatha said it didn’t inspire confidence.</p><p align="justify">“Breathe,” Agatha instructed, her voice steady but firm. “Deep, steady breaths. Feel the air filling your lungs, then slowly releasing. Let your body relax.”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t care how good you look in yoga pants,” Rio muttered, half to herself. “I’m not here to do yoga.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha shot her an unamused look, one eyebrow arched. Then, without warning, she flipped a switch on the wall.</p><p align="justify">The Faraday cage deactivated.</p><p align="justify">Rio’s knees hit the floor before she even realized she was falling. It was like her heart had stopped and exploded at the same time, a surge of energy flooding her body with an intensity she couldn’t have prepared for. Her mind raced, a thousand fragmented memories crashing into her at once – flashes of her childhood, her mother’s voice, the cold, dark presence she had always felt. It was too much, too fast, and she couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think–</p><p align="justify">And then, just as suddenly as it had overwhelmed her, it stopped.</p><p align="justify">The Faraday cage was back on.</p><p align="justify">Rio gasped, her chest heaving as she struggled to steady herself. The room felt eerily quiet now, the absence of that overwhelming energy almost as jarring as its presence.</p><p align="justify">“Are you okay, Rio?” Agatha’s voice was suddenly next to her, as well as her hand resting lightly on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p align="justify">Rio looked up, her vision still swimming slightly. “What the hell was that?” she managed to croak out, her voice shaky.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression was a mix of concern and guilt. “That was your magic. And Death. Both waking up.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="justify">Rio squeezed her eyes shut. Her muscles burned like she'd been fighting for hours. The taste of copper filled her mouth – nauseating. She had been patient until now. Even if this situation had turned her life upside down. Even if this was going to make her lose her job, and her friends. But <em>this</em>?! She was tired and drained, and this <em>thing</em> hit her like her old neighbor nagging her before her morning coffee.</p><p align="justify">"I told you – I don't <em>do</em> magic." Rio managed to say between her teeth, her patience very thin.</p><p align="justify">“And yet." She dropped into a crouch, bringing them eye-to-eye close enough that Rio could see those baby-blue eyes – and the exhaustion bruising the skin beneath them. "You will learn. Because the alternative is watching Death wear your skin like a party dress."</p><p align="justify">Her callous fingers caught Rio's wrist, turning it palm-up. The veins still pulsed faintly black beneath the skin.</p><p align="justify">"Witches usually learn this when they're small enough to cradle." Agatha continued, thumb brushing the dark tracery. "When their biggest fear is monsters under the bed – not the ones in their blood." She released Rio with a push that wasn't quite gentle. "So yes. It'll be messy. Probably violent. Definitely terrifying." Her concern was gone the moment she realized what had “hit” Rio – just her inability to control magic overall.</p><p align="justify">The Faraday cage's hum stuttered as Agatha rose.</p><p align="justify">“But <em>necessary</em>. And I’m sorry Rio, but we’ll have to do a crash course.”</p><p align="justify">Rio lunged forward without thinking, her nails biting into Agatha's forearm. "Wait!"</p><p align="justify">Too late.</p><p align="justify">The switch clicked.</p><p align="justify">Magic hit Rio like a barbed wire–</p><p align="justify">–and Agatha's voice cut through the storm: "Welcome to Witch school, little grim reaper. First lesson: try not to kill us both."</p><p align="justify">But Rio was already gone.</p><p align="justify">Energy detonated in her veins – scorching honey and broken glass – carrying a flood of fractured memories</p><p align="justify">
<em>Her mother's trembling fingers painting warding sigils in lamb's blood across a crib.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>Burning sage choking her childhood bedroom.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>The cold-dark presence curled around her spine since birth, whispering in a language her blood understood.</em>
</p><p align="justify">And then – other memories. Not hers.</p><p align="justify">
<em>A stone altar under a starless sky.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>Witches shrieking as blue fire ate their skin.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>Winged shadows reaching for–</em>
</p><p align="justify">The Faraday cage slammed back on.</p><p align="justify">And silence filled the Agatha’s living room.</p><p align="justify">Rio came back to herself forehead-first on the concrete, gasping like a landed fish. The sudden magic vacuum left her hollowed out, trembling muscles twitching in the aftershocks, and a fire in her that was choking.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's hand found her shoulder – fresh and rough and smelling of pine needles and gunpowder. "Breathe. Just breathe." Her thumb brushed sweat-slick hair from Rio's temple, lingering just a second too long.</p><p align="justify">Rio rolled onto her side. The protest died in her throat when she saw Agatha's eyes – midnight-blue now, pupils blown wide with something that looked uncomfortably like guilt.</p><p align="justify">"<em>Both remembering who you are</em>." Agatha murmured, fingers tightening. "You need to–"</p><p align="justify">"–breathe. Yeah." Rio's voice was a crow's croak. "Maybe try turning the magic <em>down</em> from 'freight train' to... I dunno, 'angry scooter'?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha's lips quirked. "Maybe. But that’s more up to you than me." She pressed Rio back down with a palm between her shoulder blades. "Stay."</p><p align="justify">Like Rio could move. Like she <em>wanted</em> to.</p><p align="justify">And she let a whine when she saw Agatha getting up to the Faraday switch again.</p><p align="justify">And again magic rushed in.</p><p align="justify">But this time, Rio felt the exact moment Agatha's own magic slid against hers. Not a collision – not a train wreck. A <em>tether</em>.</p><p align="justify">"Breathe." Agatha ordered from somewhere far away.</p><p align="justify">Rio inhaled–</p><p align="justify">–and oh.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's magic was winter-river-cold, slicing through the wildfire in Rio's blood. It carried the electric sting of a coming storm, the clean bite of alpine wind. Rio's power reared toward it, desperate and hungry – hungry for control.</p><p align="justify">"You feel that?" Agatha's murmur was suddenly close, her knee pressing into Rio's hip as she crouched beside her. "That's what control <em>could</em> feel like."</p><p align="justify">Rio shuddered. It was intoxicating. Terrifying. "It's not just control I'm lacking," she managed. "There's something... <em>dark</em> in me. Your whole 'Death the savior' speech? Feels like bullshit when I can <em>taste</em> how wrong it is."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's fingers found her wrist, her magic flooding Rio's veins like a lifeline. "Dark isn't evil. And fine, maybe I oversold the savior bit." Her thumb pressed into Rio's racing pulse. "Death keeps balance. Witches who disrupt it?" A pause. "They meet Death. Witches who <em>are</em> it?"</p><p align="justify">Rio felt the answer in the sudden prickle of Agatha's magic against hers.</p><p align="justify">"They <em>wield</em> it."</p><p align="justify">Rio's laugh was a broken thing, a weak defense against the way Agatha's energy danced along her nerves – sharp and bright and alive. "So, my options are suffocating slowly or becoming Death's favorite knife? <em>Fantastic</em> choices."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's smile was all knife and no warmth. "Your <em>only</em> choice is to stop pretending you're something you're not."</p><p align="justify">Rio's breath hitched, feeling trapped. She looked down–</p><p align="justify">–and saw the black veins crawling up her arms like creeping ivy.</p><p align="justify">Her throat closed. "No–"</p><p align="justify">"Don't!" Agatha's hand shot out, but it was too late.</p><p align="justify">The darkness <em>lashed</em> out – a whipcrack that sent Agatha flying. She twisted midair, slamming the Faraday switch as she hit the wall.</p><p align="justify">The cage reactivated. The darkness snapped back into Rio's chest hard enough to bruise.</p><p align="justify">Agatha spat blood onto the floor. "<em>Christ</em>. You're like a toddler with a flamethrower."</p><p align="justify">"This isn't <em>working</em>," Rio gasped, clutching her stinging ribs.</p><p align="justify">"Because you keep treating Death like a fucking <em>parasite</em>." Agatha swiped her bloody mouth with the back of her hand. "Death isn't the problem. Your <em>denial</em> is."</p><p align="justify">Rio bared her teeth. "You're a <em>shit</em> teacher."</p><p align="justify">"And you're a <em>worse</em> student." Agatha closed the distance between them in two strides, feet knocking against Rio's. "You want control? Stop trying to be <em>human</em>." She grabbed Rio's wrist, hauling her upright. "You never <em>were</em>."</p><p align="justify">"Then what the <em>hell</em> am I supposed to be?" Rio's voice cracked.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's free hand came up, fingers splayed over Rio's pounding heart. "A <em>witch</em>. Death's just the shadow you cast. So use your own goddamn magic to steer it!"</p><p align="justify">The words hooked under Rio's ribs, sharper than any magic.</p><p align="justify">A beat of silence.</p><p align="justify">"Go easy on me this time." Rio whispered, shoulders dropping.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's grin was all teeth. "Not a chance."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Three hours in, Rio's body had become a symphony of pain. Her muscles shrieked with every movement, sweat carving salty trails through her cheeks. Her hands trembled like leaves in a storm – though the urge to strangle Agatha had morphed from genuine to something almost affectionate through sheer exhausted repetition.</p><p align="justify">"Again." Agatha prowled, her shadow stretching long in the twilight. The golden sunlight caught the silver scars on her knuckles as she flexed her fingers. "Proper form this time."</p><p align="justify">Rio spat out a strand of sweat-damp hair. "You say that like I know what 'proper' looks like." Still, she braced her feet apart – the stance Agatha had hammered into her through sixty failed attempts – and let the heat uncoil in her spine.</p><p align="justify">This time, when the magic came, it didn't burn. It <em>bloomed</em>.</p><p align="justify">Emerald light erupted from her palms in waves, illuminating the dust particles between them in sudden, stark relief. The glow caught the sweat beading along Rio's forearms, turning each droplet into a tiny prism that cast fractal patterns across Agatha's sharp cheekbones.</p><p align="justify">Agatha went still. "Well." Her voice had gone strange. "That explains the botanical graveyard in your apartment."</p><p align="justify">Rio gaped at the swirling energy. "What the hell does <em>that</em> mean?" The offense came a heartbeat later. "And how would you know about my plants?"</p><p align="justify">"Means you're a green witch." Agatha said it like she was explaining that water was wet to a drowning woman. "Earth magic. The whole grow-and-decay package." When Rio just stared, she rolled her eyes. "Alice did a perimeter check last night. Said your ficus looked like it died screaming."</p><p align="justify">"Fantastic." Rio flexed her fingers, watching vines drip between them like liquid jade. "Any chance these magic lessons come with a fucking textbook?"</p><p align="justify">"Any chance your brain comes with an <em>on</em> switch?" Agatha flicked her fingers; Rio's magic rippled in response, the green darkening at the edges. "Now shape it."</p><p align="justify">"Into <em>what</em> exactly?"</p><p align="justify">"Whatever your bones remember how to make."</p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled hard through her nose – Agatha's teaching style amounted to 'throw her in the deep end of a pool and yell swimming tips from the sidelines' – and flicked her wrist.</p><p align="justify">The magic that curled from her fingertips wasn't green.</p><p align="justify">A black-edged smoke twisted through the air, merging from one suspended heartbeat into something jagged and hungry. A leaf, a blade or a skeletal finger. It hung there, vibrating with potential–<br/>–then dissolved into nothingness.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's smirk could have beat flesh from bone. "That was tragic."</p><p align="justify">"I hate you," Rio hissed, shaking out the numbness in her fingers.</p><p align="justify">"Liar." Agatha bumped their shoulders together hard enough to stagger, but her arm stayed pressed against Rio's a moment too long, warmth bleeding through sweat-soaked fabric. "Again."</p><p align="justify">And Rio did.</p><p align="justify">Again.</p><p align="justify">Again.</p><p align="justify"><em>And again</em>.</p><p align="justify">By the eighteenth attempt, her green magic would spiral around her forearm like a living thing before vanishing.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's grin was all predator. "Now we're getting somewhere."</p><p align="justify">Rio didn't smile back. Couldn't. Not when her veins still thrummed with the memory of that darkness – how <em>good </em>it had felt curling around her bones. Because each failure brought something new – below the green magic, Rio could feel the smoke lingering longer, carrying a scent of loam and decay.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The dying daylight painted Agatha’s house as Rio slid down the wall, her legs giving out beneath her. In her palm, a wisp of emerald energy flickered – barely more than a glowworm's pulse, but it held its shape for three full seconds this time. <em>Progress</em>, by Agatha's merciless standards. If progress tasted like bile and failure.</p><p align="justify">But if Rio were to be honest with herself, progress was not needing the Faraday cage to keep her magic in check. Not feeling overwhelmed with the fire still quite alive inside her. Not feeling crazy with bits of old memories she didn’t have yet time to process.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's shadow fell across her. A water bottle tossed through the air – Rio caught it against her sternum with a grunt.</p><p align="justify">"Drink." Agatha folded herself onto the floor beside Rio, close enough that their shoulders brushed. "You look like something Death coughed up."</p><p align="justify">"Ha." Rio's fake laugh scraped her throat raw. She cracked the seal open with trembling fingers, water slopping over her wrists as she gulped. It did nothing to wash away the acid burn in her muscles or the metallic tang coating her tongue – the aftertaste of magic pushed too far. She wiped her mouth with the back of her hand – then froze.</p><p align="justify">"That cop." She said, staring at the water droplets on her skin. "When he attacked us. His breath..." She inhaled, chasing the ghost memory. "Ammonia and... burnt metal. Like overheated surgical tools."</p><p align="justify">The plastic bottle crumbled in Agatha's grip.</p><p align="justify">Rio flinched as icy water sprayed her knees. Agatha didn't seem to notice, her fingers crushing the ruined container, droplets leaking between her clenched fists.</p><p align="justify">"Describe it." Agatha's voice had gone dangerously soft. "Exactly."</p><p align="justify">"Like... cauterized flesh. Like–"</p><p align="justify">"Like a branding iron on silver." Agatha was on her feet before Rio could blink, her joints cracking like gunshots in the sudden silence. "Fuck. You're sure?"</p><p align="justify">"I carve open corpses for a living." Rio's own voice turned brittle. "I know chemical signatures." She watched Agatha pace three sharp turns. "You know what this is?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha wheeled on her, eyes reflecting the dying light. "Alchemy." The word came out half-snarl, half-curse. "But not the kind our grandmothers practiced. This is... industrial. Manufactured." Her knuckles went bone-white around the twisted plastic. "They're distilling magic. Concentrating it."</p><p align="justify">The pieces clicked together with terrible clarity. "The murdered witches–"</p><p align="justify">"Weren't murdered." Agatha hurled the ruined bottle against the wall. It shattered like a gunshot. "They were harvested. They're rendering them down like fucking livestock."</p><p align="justify">The chill started at the base of Rio's skull and flooded downward, turning her veins to ice. The Faraday cage's silence suddenly felt less like protection and more like the quiet of a slaughterhouse before the killing starts.</p><p align="justify">"We need to tell Lilia." Rio's tongue stuck to parchment-dry lips. "We need–"</p><p align="justify">"To move." Agatha was already in motion, her hands flickering through the air as she magicked herself new clothes – yoga pants shimmering into something like tactical black. The car keys leapt from the console into her waiting palm. "Get dressed. Now."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Their car tore through Boston's winding streets and into New Salem, Agatha's knuckles bone-white on the steering wheel. Rio stared out at the passing brownstones – realizing with a start Agatha’s was barely ten minutes from her own apartment. All this time, her would-be protector had been practically her neighbor.</p><p align="justify">Lilia's compound rose before them, a converted textile mill. Agatha was fast to get out of the car, and even faster taking the stairs three at a time. Rio was struggling to keep pace, and it had nothing to do with having spent the day in what it felt like a marathon.</p><p align="justify">"They're distilling witches." Agatha's declaration echoed through the cavernous space as they burst into Lilia's living room.</p><p align="justify">The crime lord didn't look up from the map she was studying. Rio watched the truth move through Lilia's body like slow-acting venom – the subtle flare of nostrils, the muscles standing out in her neck, the way her nails dug into the paper.</p><p align="justify">"Explain." A single word, sharp.</p><p align="justify">Rio stepped forward. "The cops attacking me – they're using some synthetic drug. It smells like burnt silver and–"</p><p align="justify">"Ammonia." Lilia finished. Her gaze snapped to Agatha. " You recognize the signature?"</p><p align="justify">"Some black-market synth-alchemy." Agatha's jaw worked like she was chewing glass. " The kind they cook up in those underground labs near the docks in pier 12."</p><p align="justify">Rio made a mental note to ask how Agatha knew the underground labs by location. Later.</p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated – a fraction of a second Rio almost wouldn't notice. "There's a club. The Obsidian Mirror. They've been moving experimental batches there for some months now." Her fingers twitched. "I think they may be moving this drug too."</p><p align="justify">Lilia's laughter cracked through the room like ice splitting underfoot. "Those fucking witch-haters. Predators always return to their feeding grounds." She rose, her neckless clattering at her chest. </p><p align="justify">"This is your domain, Agatha. What's your play?"</p><p align="justify">"Undercover recon. Find the dealer and get the maker" Agatha's eyes flicked to Rio. "But not tonight. We're both running on fumes. And we need a proper plan."</p><p align="justify">Lilia nodded, already reaching for an ancient rotary phone. "You'll stay here tonight. I'll call Alice and Jen too – we are going to need them on this." Her crimson nails dialed with lethal precision.</p><p align="justify">Agatha nodded and then signaled Rio to follow her.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's fingers brushed the small of Rio's back as she guided her into a dimly lit room. The lights flickered on, revealing an arsenal that would make an arms dealer weep.<br/>Rio's breath caught.</p><p align="justify">Gleaming knives and guns lined the walls, ropes of braided witch-hair hung, vials of violet liquid pulsed gently.</p><p align="justify">"You've done this before." Rio murmured, trying not to sound disturbed. She was acutely aware of how close they stood in the confined space.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's lips curled as she plucked a throwing knife from its mount. "What gave it away?" She spun the blade effortlessly between her fingers before tossing it toward Rio. Agatha was very clearly in her environment. "You think I just stand around looking pretty?"</p><p align="justify">Rio caught the hilt by pure reflex, her fingers brushing Agatha's in the exchange.</p><p align="justify">"Tomorrow night." Agatha said, her voice suddenly lower as she threw a bundle of black fabric at Rio, which folded into a deceptively simple cocktail dress. "Try not to walk like you've never broken the law – you look like you got a law degree stuffed up your–"</p><p align="justify">"I get it." Rio interrupted. She hadn’t. Well, she didn’t count the fact that witches couldn’t technically have a degree.</p><p align="justify">But that was a technicality.</p><p align="justify">Rio run her fingers along the silver runes lining the dress. The embroidery tingled against her skin, humming with protective magic.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped closer. "Those will stop most blades," she murmured, her thumb brushing the inside of Rio's wrist where her pulse hammered. "The glamour makes you look like another rich bitch playing at danger." A smirk. "Instead of the real thing."</p><p align="justify">Rio's mouth went dry. "How many times have you–"</p><p align="justify">"Enough to know which bartenders use chloroform instead of vermouth." Agatha's fingers trailed up Rio's arm, leaving goosebumps in their wake. She was too close. Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Rule one: watch every pour. Rule two–"</p><p align="justify">"If things go south, we run."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's smile could have fueled a thousand nightmares. "If things go south, we burn the place down."</p><p align="justify">And Rio could have sworn she would go anywhere starting fires with this woman, whose closeness was now too comforting. She licked her lips as her fingers clenched in the fabric of Agatha's shirt. </p><p align="justify">She could feel the hard muscle beneath, the rapid heartbeat that mirrored her own. "Agatha–"</p><p align="justify">The moment shattered as Agatha stepped back – all business. "You good without the Faraday cage?" The roughness in her voice betrayed her.</p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, fingers still tingling where they'd touched. "I am."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The guest room smelled of sunflowers and old violence. Rio collapsed onto the third unfamiliar bed in two nights – her body humming with exhaustion.</p><p align="justify">She barely registered Jen and Alice's arrival before Agatha had ushered her away to rest with a proprietary hand at her back. Rio should have protested, but didn’t find the strength.</p><p align="justify">Sleep took her violently.</p><p align="justify">And that night, Rio dreamed like she didn’t for a long time.</p><p align="justify">Not of darkness, but of falling – through layers of time, through screams and fire and the scent of burning sage.</p><p align="justify">She had dreamed of her mother’s voice sobbing “<em>I can’t let it take her</em>” again, and again, and again.</p><p align="justify">And she had dreamed of another woman’s voice – not hers, but not not hers. An echo of herself: “<em>You are Death</em>.”</p><p align="justify">Rio awoke screaming. Or maybe that was the magic – her power erupting in green and black waves that made the bedposts shudder.</p><p align="justify">She was just catching her breath when the door burst open. Agatha standing against the hallway light, with a purple light already in both hands – hair wild from sleep. The concern in her eyes was raw, unguarded.</p><p align="justify">“Are you okay? I sensed your magic.”</p><p align="justify">"Just a dream." Rio lied, watching Agatha's gaze drop to her throat where black veins pulsed beneath pale skin.</p><p align="justify">“Are you sure you are okay without the Faraday cage?”</p><p align="justify">“I’m sure.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha's jaw tightened. She took an aborted step forward before stopping herself. "Try to rest." The words sounded torn from her. "I’m... nearby."</p><p align="justify">The space between Rio's ribs ached. "Agatha–"</p><p align="justify">Fingers white-knuckled on the doorknob. She paused.</p><p align="justify">"Please." Rio's voice cracked. "Don't tell the others." <em>About Death. About what's waking inside me. About how much I want you to–</em></p><p align="justify">For three heartbeats, only the creak of the old mill answered. Then, just the barest tilt of Agatha's chin – a promise.</p><p align="justify">The door clicked shut behind her, leaving Rio alone with the truth humming in her veins. Death wasn't coming for balance – she was already here. And she wanted to get out.</p><p align="justify">And Agatha… Agatha might just be her personal Faraday cage.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="justify">The scent of scorched coffee beans dragged Rio from sleep. She blinked against the morning light cutting through the ragged curtains, her body protesting in places she hadn't known existed before yesterday's training. Every muscle felt like it had been tenderized by a particularly enthusiastic butcher.</p><p align="justify">Rio almost had a heart attack when she sensed movement coming from the nightstand. She was <em>not</em> the kind of person that took well any excitement before the first morning coffee.</p><p align="justify">A floating mug of (very) black coffee was hovered inches from her face, cradled in a tiny hurricane of purple magic. Steam curled from its chipped rim in lazy spirals. Rio stared, torn between wonder and the primal urge to throw something at being startled before caffeine.<br/>
But, if anything would convince Rio to embrace her witch side was the possibility to cast a spell to get your hot coffee first thing after waking up – without needing to get out of bed to do it herself.</p><p align="justify">She took the mug into her hand and the purple tendrils dissipated immediately, leaving the warm weight of ceramic in her hands. It was only then that Rio noticed the switchblade with a mother-of-pearl handle lying there, still confined to its holster – next to a scrap of paper with what Rio assumed to be Agatha's "aggressively functional" handwriting: "<em>Drink the coffee before you try to play with the knife</em>."</p><p align="justify">Rio had just taken her first scalding sip – what a bliss – when the knock came. Not the polite kind. The <em>I-know-you're-awake</em> kind.</p><p align="justify">“Yeah.” God, she really hated being disturbed before finishing her first coffee. Even past girlfriend wouldn’t cross this line.</p><p align="justify">Agatha filled the doorway, leaning against the frame like she owned it. Same black tank top from yesterday, same cargo pants, but now with the addition of a fresh bruise purpling along her collarbone – Rio's stomach flipped remembering how she'd put it there during their previous training session when she'd accidentally lashed out with magic.</p><p align="justify">"Sleep okay?" Agatha's voice was morning-rough, the kind of rasp that made Rio's fingers tighten around her mug.</p><p align="justify">She nodded, the motion making her wince. "Like the dead." </p><p align="justify">Agatha's boots scuffed against the floorboards as she stepped inside. The blue-eyed gaze dropped to Rio's throat where the black veins still lingered faintly beneath her skin. A muscle in her jaw twitched. "No dreams?"</p><p align="justify">The memory of Death's voice still echoed in her marrow. "Nothing worth mentioning." The lie tasted bitter even through the coffee.</p><p align="justify">For a heartbeat, Rio thought Agatha might push. Instead, she tossed a duffel bag onto the bed with a thump that made the knife rattle. “Your clothes.” Rio gave a questioning look. “Passed by your house at dawn. You really should be arrested for murdering those plants, you know.”</p><p align="justify">Rio nearly choked on her coffee. “Okay, first, it’s creepy having people going into my house when I’m not there. And second, I’m not there to take care of them!” Rio’s voice sounded way too high for her own liking.</p><p align="justify">“Plants don’t die in three days. Your ficus wrote a will." Agatha's smirk was infuriating. "It left its pots to someone more responsible."</p><p align="justify">“They have attachment issues.” Rio muttered, absurdly pleased when Agatha's laugh – real and unguarded – filled the room.</p><p align="justify">Damn, it was easy to get into a playful banter with Agatha, even without her morning coffee.</p><p align="justify">The moment stretched, then snapped when Agatha turned to leave. "Alice made breakfast. Jen's briefing us in twenty." She stood, pausing at the door, now her face more serious. "Wear the knife all the time. Even at breakfast."</p><p align="justify">As the door clicked shut, Rio examined the blade again. The mother-of-pearl shimmering like a dark rainbow. Fitting, she thought, for a gift from a woman who was equal parts weapon and wonder.</p><p align="justify">She dressed slowly, the knife a comfortable weight at her thigh, and tried not to think about how easily Agatha had slipped past all her morning humor.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The scent of burnt toast and strong whiskey hit Rio as she entered the sunlit dining area. The scene before her was something out of a bizarre family portrait – Lilia lounged at the head of the table with a whiskey glass that definitely shouldn't be breakfast-appropriate, while Billy (or was it Willy?) enthusiastically waved a piece of toast in greeting and mouthed an exaggerated "hello" around a mouthful of eggs. Jen and Alice were bickering over how dry the pancakes were.</p><p align="justify">And then there was Agatha.</p><p align="justify">Leaning against the balcony railing, backlit by the morning sun, steam curling from her coffee mug. The sight sent an unexpected warmth through Rio's chest – something she wish not to define.</p><p align="justify">" Oh good," Jen drawled. "Sleeping Beauty graces us with her presence – we can finally start with the plans she totally won’t understand but Agatha insisted she’d listen to."</p><p align="justify">Rio arched an eyebrow. Jen's dislike had been obvious since day one, but this was impressively petty even for breakfast.</p><p align="justify">"Jen." Agatha's voice carried a soft warning.</p><p align="justify">Alice materialized at Rio's side with a plate of suspiciously perfect pancakes. "Eat." she ordered, pressing a fork into Rio's hand. Just as Rio moved to sit–</p><p align="justify">"No." Jen slapped a massive map of Boston onto the table, effectively claiming all available space, giving space only to Lilia and Billy. "Eat standing."</p><p align="justify">Alice's smirk was barely concealed as she took a deliberate bite of pancake. Agatha simply rolled her eyes and walked lazily to Rio’s side.</p><p align="justify">"These are dangerous." Agatha murmured, her breath warm against Rio's ear.</p><p align="justify">Rio eyed the dry-looking, crumbling pancake. "The women or the pancakes?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha's lips twitched. "Both, to be honest."</p><p align="justify">Jen cleared her throat dramatically. "Alice's recon shows all missing witches were last seen near these three clubs." She tapped the map where three locations were circled in what looked like lipstick. "Agatha confirms distributors favor the Obsidian Mirror's VIP lounge." Agatha nodded, leaning over the table. The movement made her tank top ride up, revealing a strip of abdomen that Rio absolutely did not stare at. “It appears the men we want are probably wear some ugly silver rings with black stones – like gangsters’ wannabe – that now everyone uses because that thing lets them carry product without suspicion. So, they are not going to be easy to spot."</p><p align="justify">"And security?" Agatha’s voice was all business.</p><p align="justify">"Enhanced." Jen flipped to a surveillance photo of identical twins. "Black market military-grade monoculars to detect heat signatures." She pointed to their forearm. "And magic dampeners bracelets."</p><p align="justify">Rio's stomach turned. "So, they're immune?"</p><p align="justify">"To subtle magic, yes." Agatha's grin was all teeth. "Good thing we're not subtle."</p><p align="justify">Alice snorted and tossed Rio a small velvet pouch. "Speaking of unsubtle." Inside gleamed two silver earrings. "Comms." she explained. "Tap once to activate, twice to mute. And yes–" she added before Rio could ask, "they're spelled against detection." </p><p align="justify">Rio was impressed at their preparation. She traced the club's blueprints. "How do we–"</p><p align="justify">Jen rolled her eyes. "Agatha gets recognized at the door.” Rio’s eyebrow spook for her. “She is a known gun dealer, and a disgraced pit fighter banned from three fight rings in this district."</p><p align="justify">Alice snorted. "Four."</p><p align="justify">Agatha rolled her eyes. “Not disgraced – just banned because they were sore losers.”</p><p align="justify">Rio made a mental note to unpack that particular revelation later.</p><p align="justify">Jen continued as if they hadn't spoken. "Agatha's the face. Rio–" her gaze swept over Rio's borrowed outfit with clear disdain, "–you'll be the fresh meat. Rich, spoiled, and stupid enough to follow her anywhere. They have to think Agatha is just there for fun, not work."</p><p align="justify">Rio's cheeks burned at Agatha’s predatory grin. “You’ll need to look the part.”</p><p align="justify">Rio tried not to look affected. "I can act spoiled just fine."</p><p align="justify">“Anyway, we need to get close enough to identify their supplier." Ended Jen. “I don’t know who is using the drugs and who is not, so I’d say be very careful. Truth is we still don’t know how the drug works."</p><p align="justify">"Jen and I will hit the docks.” Alice cut in. "Likely manufacturing site. Once you ID the supplier, we move in."</p><p align="justify">Rio's eyes focused on the maps. "What's the extraction plan?"</p><p align="justify">"Burn it down," Jen and Agatha said in unison.</p><p align="justify">Alice sighed. "The real plan–"</p><p align="justify">"–is get out clean if possible," Jen amended, pinching the bridge of her nose. "Burn it down after if necessary."</p><p align="justify">They all looked at each other.</p><p align="justify">“Sounds like a plan.” Interrupted Lilia. She stood. "Agatha, a word." As she swept out, she tossed over her shoulder: "The rest of you – rest, review, gear up. You move at midnight."</p><p align="justify">As the others dispersed, Agatha caught Rio's arm. " Meet me in the armory an hour before we go." Her grip was firm, her eyes dark with something unreadable. "We need to work on your lying face."</p><p align="justify">Rio watched her leave, the ghost of Agatha's touch lingering like a brand. Alice sidled up at her shoulder, following her gaze.</p><p align="justify">"She's insufferable, isn't she?"</p><p align="justify">Rio didn't trust herself to answer. The table before them was littered with violence and strategy, but the real battle was the one raging in her chest – was she really about to abandon the woman who helped solve murders for the one who might soon commit them?</p><p align="justify">And judging by the heat still pulsing where Agatha had touched her, she already had the answer.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio had taken the rest of the day to wander around Lilia’s mill house. She had done as told – rest and review the plan over and over. She did not want this to fail because she was unable to do both things that were ordered.</p><p align="justify">She had dinner alone with Billy – who thankfully chatted in an almost monologue through the whole time. Rio’s mind had been lost wandering where the others were.</p><p align="justify">When it was almost an hour until midnight, Rio found the armory room, already dressed for the night.</p><p align="justify">The room’s full-length mirror reflected Rio in its fractured pieces as she strode with the black dress – liquid silk whispering against her thighs, the neckline dipping just low enough to be dangerous, and her back leaving very little to imagination. The silver runes lining the interior hummed against her skin, with a quiet promise of protection.</p><p align="justify">She placed her silver earrings at the table next to her – the bedroom did not have a mirror to help her put them on. She was going to adjust the straps of the knife holster, when the door creaked open behind her.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stopped at the doorframe, already dressed in a dark plum suit – fabric tailored to the sharp lines of her body, the jacket open to reveal a black corset-style top beneath. The cut of the pants accentuated the lethal grace of her stance, the glint of a gun barely concealed at her ankle.</p><p align="justify">Their eyes met in the mirror.</p><p align="justify">A beat of silence.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s gaze dragged down Rio’s reflection, slow as honey, lingering on the slit in the dress, the curve of her waist, the way the fabric looked like a second skin. Her throat moved slightly, but she said nothing.</p><p align="justify">Rio turned, letting the dress swirl around her legs. She took in the way the suit hugged Agatha’s shoulders, the way the deep purple brought out the blue flecks in her eyes, the way the corset laces emphasized the lean muscle of her torso. Her mouth went dry, but she bit back the compliment burning her tongue.</p><p align="justify">Instead, she reached for the silver earrings on the table and fastened one with deliberate slowness, watching Agatha’s gaze track the movement.</p><p align="justify">Agatha crossed the room in three strides. She plucked the second earring from Rio’s fingers, her touch lingering just a second too long as she brushed Rio’s hair aside to fasten it for her.</p><p align="justify">Neither spoke.</p><p align="justify">The air between them crackled with the way Agatha’s breath hitched when Rio turned her head slightly, the way Rio’s pulse jumped at the heat of Agatha’s fingers against her neck.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped back first, clearing her throat. She adjusted her cufflinks with unnecessary focus, her jaw tight.</p><p align="justify">Rio smoothed invisible wrinkles from her dress, her reflection in the mirror betraying the flush creeping up her chest. But she decided to take in the weight of the moment – the room uncharacteristically silent for them; no banter to fill it.</p><p align="justify">Then Agatha offered her arm. “Ready?” Her voice rough but steady.</p><p align="justify">Rio took it, her fingers curling around Agatha’s forearm, the heat of her skin searing even through the fabric.</p><p align="justify">"Let’s go find these men."</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The Obsidian Mirror pulsed like a dying star at midnight. The bass-heavy music making way to the streets surrounding it, and its neon blue lights scaring the dark of the night.</p><p align="justify">As they were walking towards the entrance of the club – completely ignoring the line – Rio adjusted her dress. She was now much more aware of her part of just looking like the pretty date of a much more dangerous woman.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's hand settled at the small of her back, warm through the fabric. "Relax." her breath tickled Rio's ear. "It’ll be over before you know it."</p><p align="justify">Rio's pulse stuttered. "You’re not the one with an uncomfortably thin dress in this rather cold night.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha's laugh curled low in her stomach. Right before meeting the guards at the door, Agatha's persona shifted like a suit of armor snapping into place. Her walk became a prowl, her smile turned predatory. The bouncers straightened at her approach.</p><p align="justify">"Harkness." The larger one nodded. "Heard you got banned from the Scorpion's Nest."</p><p align="justify">Agatha flashed a wad of cash. "Can’t have fun anymore these days." She jerked her chin at Rio. "Hopefully tonight I will."</p><p align="justify">The bouncer's gaze crawled over Rio. "She looks soft."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's hand slid possessively up Rio's spine, a low growl: "She’s deceiving."</p><p align="justify">With two chuckles, the door opened.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Inside, the club was a study in controlled chaos. Strobe lights cut through the haze of clove cigarettes and spilled absinthe, revealing cages where dancers moved to a bassline that vibrated in Rio's teeth. Every third person wore silver-and-black rings.</p><p align="justify">Rio’s skin prickled as they moved deeper into the crowd, to the bar, every brush of Agatha’s hand against her lower back sending electric jolts up her spine as the other woman’s body was a shield between Rio and the crowd.</p><p align="justify">“Two Boulevardiers.” Agatha told the bartender the moment they reached the bar. "Hold the vermouth."</p><p align="justify">"Eyes on the VIP door." Agatha murmured, her lips grazing Rio’s ear as she pressed a cocktail into her hand. “Don’t drink too much – just look expensive.”</p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes but lifted the glass, her gaze scanning the room over the rim. Near the VIP section, two men entered with a black briefcase, followed by the security twins Rio remembered from Jen’s briefing.</p><p align="justify">“I’m guessing that’s our distributor.” Rio murmured.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s lips curled. “It’s playtime.” She stood, dragging Rio up with her. "Dance with me first."</p><p align="justify">Then her fingers were lacing with Rio’s, pulling her into the seething mass of dancers. The music swallowed them, as their bodies had to stand too close – Agatha’s hips rolling to the beat of the music, in a way that made Rio’s breath catch.</p><p align="justify">"Relax, Dr. Vidal. You’re supposed to look like you enjoy this." Agatha purred, her hands sliding up Rio’s sides, tracing the hidden runes beneath the dress. "We have to sell the act."</p><p align="justify">Rio’s pulse stuttered as Agatha’s teeth grazed the sensitive skin of her neck. "You’re enjoying this too much."</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s laugh was dark, her fingers tightening possessively on Rio’s waist. "Sue me."</p><p align="justify">Then–</p><p align="justify">–movement. The two twins from before were leaving the VIP lounge heading toward a side exit marked “<em>EMPLOYEES ONLY</em>”.</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t hesitate – her fingers locked around Rio's wrist like a vice, dragging her through the sweaty, pulsing crowd. Bodies pressed too close, the music thrumming through Rio's ribs as Agatha carved a path with single-minded intensity.</p><p align="justify">They passed through the door, into a dim-light, wet hallway. Footsteps echoed ahead.</p><p align="justify">"We need to hear what they’re–"</p><p align="justify">A man’s voice growled, "–shipment’s going to Pier 14 next week– Wait, you heard something?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha stopped breathing, and Rio looked at her for guidance. <em>They were caught</em>.</p><p align="justify">Agatha yanked Rio into a shadowed alcove, her body crushing close, just as one of the distributors turned the corner. Rio's back hit the wall, the impact shuddering through her. Agatha's body caged her in, one forearm braced beside Rio's head, the other hand gripping her hip hard enough to bruise.</p><p align="justify">"Don’t. Move." Agatha’s breath was a scorching brand against Rio’s lips.</p><p align="justify">The twin-guard paused, his military-grade monoculars whirring as it scanned the hallway. Rio’s heart hammered – too close, too close – her pulse a frantic drumbeat in her throat, and they were about to be discovered.</p><p align="justify">Then Agatha’s mouth crashed into hers.</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t a kiss – it was a <em>claim</em>. Teeth and tongue and desperate, hungry pressure, Agatha’s hands surging into Rio’s hair, angling her head to block them from view – and to take <em>more</em>. Rio gasped, her fingers twisting in Agatha’s jacket, clinging as much as pulling her closer. Agatha's free hand slid under Rio's dress, nails raking up her thigh, her fingers touching the handle of Rio’s knife.</p><p align="justify">The guard chuckled low in his throat, his footsteps pausing just there, but Rio couldn’t think, couldn’t <em>breathe</em>–</p><p align="justify">Agatha bit down on Rio’s lower lip, hard enough to sting – and Rio <em>melted</em>. A sound tore from her throat, half protest, half plea, and Agatha swallowed it greedily. Her hips pressed forward, pinning Rio harder against the wall, the heat between them rising.</p><p align="justify">The guard’s footsteps faded – figuring two lovers just found the bathroom to dirty to make out.</p><p align="justify">But Agatha didn’t pull away.</p><p align="justify">Her tongue swept against Rio’s, savoring the way Rio’s breath hitched, the way her hips pressed forward of their own accord. The taste of her was intoxicating – citrus-and-gunpowder scent of Agatha’s skin – it was making Rio’s magic hum beneath her skin.</p><p align="justify">Rio’s hands slid from Agatha’s jacket to her waist, fingers digging into the bare skin beneath her tank top. Agatha shuddered, her breath coming in ragged bursts against Rio’s mouth. The kiss deepened, turned slower, wetter – less about hiding and more about taking.</p><p align="justify">A door slammed somewhere down the hall. Agatha tore herself away with a gasp, her pupils blown black, lips swollen and glistening.</p><p align="justify">"Pier 14." She breathed, voice wrecked. "That’s our target."</p><p align="justify">“<em>Copy that, Agatha.</em>” Rio suddenly heard Alice say from her earing-comms.</p><p align="justify">She had almost forgotten about Jen and Alice. Rio couldn’t really speak, even if she tried. Her entire body <em>thrummed</em>, her magic sparking beneath her skin in erratic bursts.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s thumb brushed Rio’s swollen bottom lip, her smirk sinful but shaking. "Don’t look so shocked." A pause. A hitch in her breath. "You kissed back."</p><p align="justify">Then she was dragging Rio toward the exit, her grip bruising tight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The club’s pulse thrummed through Rio’s bones as they slipped back inside. But their luck had run out.</p><p align="justify">The two distributors emerged from the VIP lounge, briefcase still clutched in one’s grip. The taller one squinted, then his eyes widened in recognition.</p><p align="justify">“Hey! You’re not supposed to be here!” His shout barely cut through the music. Then, pointing a finger at Rio: “Wait! I know you!”</p><p align="justify">“Shit.” Agatha shoved Rio backward, toward the EMPLOYEES ONLY exit, just as the distributors lunged.</p><p align="justify">They burst through the dim hallway, sprinting past shattered and discarded bottles, while the two men screamed at them. The emergency exit loomed ahead–</p><p align="justify">The steel door to the street alley flew open before they reached it.</p><p align="justify">The twin bouncers stood framed in the alley’s neon glow. Behind them, the distributors skidded to a halt, blocking retreat.</p><p align="justify">Trapped.</p><p align="justify">“Filthy witches.” One spat, cracking his knuckles.</p><p align="justify">Agatha moved first – a blur of purple cloud and flashing steel. Her magic erupted, forcing the twins back. Rio ducked a swinging fist, but her own magic sputtered uselessly in her hands. She wasn’t ready. Wasn’t <em>enough</em>.</p><p align="justify">One distributor yanked a vial from his coat – Rio barely had time to shout a warning before he hurled it at their feet.</p><p align="justify">The vial exploded.</p><p align="justify">A geyser of glowing green mist engulfed them. Rio inhaled on instinct.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t!” She still heard Agatha scream–</p><p align="justify">–and the world <em>shattered</em>.</p><p align="justify">Fire raced through her veins. Her vision fractured into green shards as something unfolded inside her ribcage. Death uncoiled with a sigh, stretching spectral fingers through Rio’s skin.</p><p align="justify"><em>Finally</em>.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s mouth moved, but Rio couldn’t hear over the screaming.</p><p align="justify">The two distributors were first. Their souls peeled from their body like burning parchment, dissolving into the hungry dark. The twins followed, their cybernetics sparking uselessly as Death drank them down. Silver rings clattered to the ground; their wearers reduced to empty husks.</p><p align="justify">Then Death turned – no, not Death; Rio engulfed in darkness.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stood motionless, knives loose in her hands. No fear. No resistance.</p><p align="justify">“Rio.” Her name breathed like a prayer. Not a plea. A reminder.</p><p align="justify">Darkness hesitated.</p><p align="justify">This one smelled of a familiar scent. Of whispered jokes in safehouses and quiet vigils.</p><p align="justify"><em>Ours</em>, Death remembering Rio. <em>But not for harvesting</em>.</p><p align="justify">The shadows drained from Rio’s skin, leaving her gasping on her knees amidst the carnage. </p><p align="justify">Agatha's arms caught her before she fell. Her green magic erratic, and mixed with darkness still, craving Agatha’s fresh magic to be stilled.</p><p align="justify">"I've got you." Agatha whispered into her hair.</p><p align="justify">Rio was feeling a raging fire inside – even with Agatha’s purple magic caging it. Her throat still burning from the inhaled drug. And all she could cling to was Death’s words: “<em>not for harvesting</em>” – like a mantra reminder her not to hurt Agatha again.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="justify">Rio’s vision swam in and out of focus as Agatha dragged her through the rain-slicked streets, her body a dead weight against Agatha’s side. The drug still burned through her veins like wildfire, every pulse of her heart sending fresh agony through her nerves. The screams of the men she’d killed had faded, replaced now by the distant wail of sirens, in a hollow comfort.</p><p align="justify">
<em>Not for harvesting.</em>
</p><p align="justify">The words echoed in her skull, a fragile mantra against the hunger gnawing at her ribs. Death had left something restless – <em>hungry</em> – and Rio wasn’t sure anymore if it was just the drug making her crave the heat of stolen magic.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s arm tightened around her waist, her grip iron-steady. “We’re almost there.” She murmured, though the strain in her jaw betrayed her. Rio could feel the thrum of Agatha’s magic woven around her like a net, trying to contain the storm inside her.</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t enough.</p><p align="justify">Rio gritted her teeth as another wave of agony tore through her. Her magic writhed, lashing against her ribs like a caged beast. It reached, clawing at Agatha’s energy, <em>desperate</em> for more–</p><p align="justify">–and Agatha stumbled, a sharp gasp escaping her as Rio’s hunger siphoned a thread of her power.</p><p align="justify">For one terrifying heartbeat, Rio felt it – the rush of Agatha’s magic flooding into her, sweet and electric.</p><p align="justify"><em>No</em>.</p><p align="justify">She dug her nails into her palms hard enough to draw blood. <em>Not her</em>.</p><p align="justify">“Fuck, Rio.” Agatha’s voice was raw, but her arms never wavered, still holding Rio upright. Then, with a gritted breath, she pulled back – not just reclaiming her own magic, but dragging a sliver of Rio’s green and black energy with her.</p><p align="justify">The relief was instant. The fire in Rio’s veins dulled to an ache, the hunger receding like a tide.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s smirk was faint but triumphant. “If you’re going to steal magic, you’ll have to try harder against Boston’s best siphon.”</p><p align="justify">Rio choked out a laugh, ragged but real. It still burned – like drawing poison from a wound –but the agony was bearable now.</p><p align="justify">They reached Agatha’s car, parked strategically in the shadows. Agatha shrugged off her suit jacket and wrapped it around Rio’s shoulders, hiding the fading black veins the black dress didn’t hide. Her hands lingered for a second too long, warm against Rio’s collarbone.</p><p align="justify">Then they were moving, tires screeching against asphalt as Agatha sped toward Lilia’s. The city lights blurred past, and Rio let her head fall back against the seat, exhaustion and relief warring in her chest.</p><p align="justify">“Don’t fall asleep.” Agatha ordered, her voice low. One hand left the wheel to grip Rio’s knee – anchoring her. “Stay with me.”</p><p align="justify">Rio turned her face toward the window, hiding her expression in the glass. But she didn’t pull away from Agatha’s touch.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha kicked open the door, her arms trembling with the effort of keeping Rio upright. “Lilia!” She barked, her voice slicing through the house.</p><p align="justify">The old woman emerged from the back room, her sharp gaze locking onto Rio’s half-lid eyes. Agatha saw dread and weariness in her eyes, and some sort of resolution she didn’t understand. </p><p align="justify">“Upstairs.” Lilia ordered, already moving to brace Rio’s other side.</p><p align="justify">The world tilted as they dragged her up the narrow steps. Rio’s legs buckled just as they reached the breakfast room, and she collapsed onto the couch, her breath coming in ragged gasps. She could still feel Agatha’s magic clinging to her, a desperate tether – until Lilia’s own power brushed against her, sharp and unfamiliar, and her focus shattered.</p><p align="justify">Then the pain surged again.</p><p align="justify">Rio arched off the couch with a choked scream as her magic twisted, green and black vines erupting from her skin, lashing through the air. The wooden beams above them groaned.</p><p align="justify">“Shit.” Agatha’s grip tightened.</p><p align="justify">Alice and Jen stumbled in in that exact moment – and Agatha was very grateful for Alice’s heavy foot while driving.</p><p align="justify">“Oh, <em>hell</em>.” Jen’s eyes locked onto the writhing vines. “What did she take?”</p><p align="justify">“It’s that damned drug.” Agatha snarled, pressing Rio’s shoulders down as if she could physically restrain the magic.</p><p align="justify">Alice didn’t hesitate. She dropped to her knees beside the couch, her fingers finding Rio’s wrist, her magic weaving with Agatha’s in a frantic attempt to cage the storm.</p><p align="justify">“You should have taken her to her Faraday cage.”</p><p align="justify">“I don’t think even that would hold this.” Added Agatha with a strange voice.</p><p align="justify">And then Jen stood frozen. “This isn’t just green magic. Those black vines… Agatha, you know what this means–”</p><p align="justify">“I know!” Agatha’s voice was raw. “Just fucking help her!”</p><p align="justify">Jen’s jaw tightened. “I can’t potion Death into submission, Agatha. You think our ancestors didn’t try?”</p><p align="justify">“Then try something else! Death isn’t the problem – Rio just can’t control her own powers!”</p><p align="justify">With a sharp exhale, Jen yanked her satchel forward, vials clinking as she scattered them across the breakfast table. Her hands moved fast, crushing nightshade into a mortar, the bitter scent thickening the air.</p><p align="justify">“She’s burning herself alive.” Jen muttered. “We have to slow it down.”</p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath hitched. The fire inside her was spreading, devouring her from within. She could feel Death’s presence again, coiled at the edges of her mind, <em>waiting</em>–</p><p align="justify">A whisper echoed in the hollows of her skull: <em>Enough</em>.</p><p align="justify">It wasn’t a command. It wasn’t a threat. Death’s presence coiled around her, not to take, but to <em>still</em>.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hand clamped around hers, fingers digging in. “Look at me.”</p><p align="justify">Rio forced her eyes open. Agatha’s face was the only thing not fracturing in her vision.</p><p align="justify">“Just breathe.” Agatha demanded, her voice low and fierce.</p><p align="justify">Jen pressed a vial to Rio’s lips. “Drink this.”</p><p align="justify">The potion was sickly sweet, and thick as tar. Rio gagged but swallowed.</p><p align="justify">And suddenly, everything went <em>cold</em>.</p><p align="justify">The darkness inside her stilled, recognizing its master. The green shards dissolved. The fire in her veins dulled to embers. Rio gasped as the pressure in her chest eased just enough to let her breathe.</p><p align="justify">Jen exhaled sharply. “This is just a stopgap. She’ll need more in the coming days, but it should keep her from lashing out like this again.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t loosen her grip. “Then we get more.”</p><p align="justify">Rio’s fingers twitched in hers. The drug still pulsed through her veins, but the edges were blunted now.</p><p align="justify"><em>Not for harvesting</em>.</p><p align="justify">It was a reminder.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio woke, the world was too bright. Her skull throbbed like she’d spent the night drowning in cheap whiskey, and her mouth tasted like ash. And for some godforsaken reason, the greasy scent of Chinese food clung to the air.</p><p align="justify">Waking up last was getting old.</p><p align="justify">“–how they’ve been doing it.” Alice’s voice was hushed but sharp. “The drug doesn’t just enhance magic. It unravels it. Makes it volatile and easier to siphon.”</p><p align="justify">“Like shaking fruit from a tree.” Jen muttered.</p><p align="justify">Rio stayed still, eyes shut. The couch’s stiff cushions dug into her back – so, she’d slept here. And from the clink of chopsticks and rustle of takeout containers, the others had decided to turn her near-death experience into a fucking lunch meeting.</p><p align="justify">She hesitated before getting up and showing them she was wake. She really needed coffee before anything else.</p><p align="justify">She pushed upright, ignoring the way the room swayed. The conversation cut off mid-word as four pairs of eyes locked onto her.</p><p align="justify">“Rio–” Agatha started.</p><p align="justify">Rio waved her off, legs only barely betraying her as she stood. “Coffee.” She croaked.</p><p align="justify">Alice snorted. “Priorities.”</p><p align="justify">She shuffled to the kitchen counter. No machine. Just a lone French press sitting there, grounds dry and untouched. Rio stared and it for a while – she had never used a frensh press to make coffee.</p><p align="justify"><em>Fuck this shit</em>…</p><p align="justify">“Well, that’s just sad to watch.” Jen exhaled, already striding over. She filled the press with water, her magic heating it to a boil in seconds. Rio should’ve thanked her, but words felt like too much effort.</p><p align="justify">She poured a cup – black and scalding – and downed half in one go. Behind her, Agatha broke the silence.</p><p align="justify">“Lilia had a divination last night, about the same time we were attacked.”</p><p align="justify">Fragments of memory stabbed at Rio’s mind: the club, Agatha’s forceful hips on hers, the men’s souls burning, the desperate, clawing need to consume, the desperation to hold Agatha tight with she tasted her tongue–</p><p align="justify">Her chest tightened, her breathing too fast.</p><p align="justify">“Something’s disrupting the ley lines.” Agatha’s voice pressed in. “This means something bad’s coming and we need to figure out what’s happening.”</p><p align="justify">Rio felt her pulse too loud – she was having a panic attack. Her mug hit the counter with a thud. </p><p align="justify">Agatha tried to get up, to follow her. “Don’t follow me.” Said Rio, without even looking at her.</p><p align="justify">She was out the door before anyone could stop her. The mill house’s walls had been closing in. She needed air.</p><p align="justify">As soon as she got outside, and felt the sun on her face. She could taste the clean air, as her breathing started to slow down. No magic, no death, just wind. She stumbled barefoot to the nearest patch of dirt – an odd need she was having – and collapsed onto her back.</p><p align="justify">Ten minutes later, footsteps crunched over grass.</p><p align="justify">“We’re asking you to do in days what takes most witches decades.” Lilia’s voice was soft. “Death’s vessels usually have a lifetime to adjust. You… don’t.” Rio kept her eyes shut. “I know it’s all overwhelming – and I wish it didn’t have to be.”</p><p align="justify">Lilia took the hint of Rio’s silence and sat beside her. “Your mother’s block makes sense now. It’s never easy news, learning your child is Death’s vessel.” Rio cracked an eye open. “The power – even as part of nature’s balance – consumes mortals. Vessels are born into it, and babies get to adapt slowly. And even then, some witches collapse when they start to yield that dark power. But you?” A sigh. “You’re learning your own magic while holding Death’s. It’s… unprecedented.”</p><p align="justify">“I just wanted to be normal.” Rio’s throat burned. “Forget any of this existed.”</p><p align="justify">“I know, my child.” Lilia’s hand brushed the dirt between them. “But your mother’s choice – however well-meant – only delayed the inevitable. Death comes when balance is needed. And now?” She glanced at the sky. “The world is crumbling.”</p><p align="justify">Silence stretched. The sun baked Rio’s skin.</p><p align="justify">“What are the ley lines?” she finally asked.</p><p align="justify">“The earth’s veins and arteries – the channels through which magic flows.” Lilia traced a finger in the dirt, sketching jagged lines. “Where they converge, power gathers. Stonehenge. The pyramids. Ancient places – always sacred, always mythologized – and for a reason.”</p><p align="justify">“And if they’re corrupted?”</p><p align="justify">“Then the Earth cracks.” Lilia’s voice went cold. “Magic is glue as much as energy. Distort it, and the planet unmakes itself.”</p><p align="justify">“So, Death woke to stop that.”</p><p align="justify"><em>Yes</em>. The voice in Rio’s skull was smooth, inevitable. <em>I am not your enemy, Rio. But I will use you to restore balance – against your will if I must</em>.</p><p align="justify">Lilia studied her face. “I take it she answered.”</p><p align="justify">Rio nodded.</p><p align="justify">“Then you must learn to connect with her – her magic. Not fight it.”</p><p align="justify">“I can barely control my own magic.”</p><p align="justify">Lilia’s smile was thin. “My child, you’re just terrified to admit you already know how.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Lilia left Rio alone after their conversation. The grass beneath her palms felt cool, alive – a small comfort. "<em>Green witches are better at listening to the ley lines – its their connection to earth</em>." Lilia's last words clung like burrs.</p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t try. Not yet. The drug still slithered through her veins, and the thought of reaching for her magic made her throat tighten.</p><p align="justify">But Death’s presence? That was unmistakable now – not an intruder, but a shadow curled in the backseat of her mind. <em>Great, now I’m narrating my own descent into schizophrenia</em>, Rio thought dryly.</p><p align="justify">"So you just… live in there full-time?" Rio prodded, unsure how to address a cosmic force sharing her skull.</p><p align="justify"><em>Yes</em>. Death’s voice was calm, like wind through dead leaves. <em>I prefer not to disturb my vessels unless balance demands it</em>.</p><p align="justify">"Cool." Rio plucked a blade of grass, twisting it between her fingers. "I’m starting to remember things. My mother… I remember her apologizing me right before blocking my magic."</p><p align="justify"><em>Fear makes even the wisest witches reckless</em>. A pause. <em>She saw my true form once. Thought you’d break under the weight of me</em>.</p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled through her nose. "Why use witches at all? Why not just… appear?"</p><p align="justify"><em>The underworld binds me</em>. <em>You are my tether to the living</em>. Something almost like regret tinged Death’s tone. <em>Some vessels carry me for decades, untouched. Others… burn too much, too fast.</em></p><p align="justify">"This is so fucking weird."</p><p align="justify"><em>You’ll adapt</em>. Amusement now. <em>We need not be adversaries, Rio. I’m only here when the scales tip</em>.</p><p align="justify">Rio hesitated. "What’s your connection to Agatha?"</p><p align="justify">Silence.</p><p align="justify">"Are you talking to me?" Agatha’s boots crunched behind her. She held two vials and a grease-stained takeout box.</p><p align="justify">Rio stiffened. The memory of Agatha’s mouth on hers flared – hot, desperate, a purple spark in the chaos – and she shoved it down. Not now.</p><p align="justify">"Jen’s brewing something to flush the rest of the drug out of your system." Agatha thrusts the vials at her. "It’s gonna suck."</p><p align="justify">Rio knocked it back without hesitation. The potion seared her throat, bitter as crushed aspirin. "Fucking delightful." She rasped.</p><p align="justify">"You need to eat." Agatha dropped the food into her lap.</p><p align="justify">They lapsed into silence. Agatha hovered, shoulders tense, unsure if her company was welcomed, until Rio finally muttered: "I’ll come inside soon. We’ll… figure out the ley lines, next steps, all of what you want."</p><p align="justify">Agatha opened her mouth – to argue? to apologize? – but thought better of it. She left with only a clipped nod.</p><p align="justify"><em>You’re not ready for the answer to your last question</em>, Death murmured.</p><p align="justify">Rio stabbed a chopstick into the noodles. Too exhausted to unravel riddles, she ate in the quiet, letting the sun take the shadows from her bones.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The sun was setting when Rio finally stepped back inside. Jen’s potions had dulled the jagged edges of her magic – now she could sense the others’ power without it feeling like nails dragged across her skull. Green magic curled like morning mist around her fingers; Death’s power pooled darker, heavier, but separate and contained.</p><p align="justify">Jen and Alice looked up from a spread of books in the breakfast room.</p><p align="justify">“Feeling less likely to explode?” Alice threw an apple at her.</p><p align="justify">Rio caught it. “Enough that I won’t vaporize you by accident.” She hesitated. “And… sorry for bolting earlier.”</p><p align="justify">Alice waved her off. “Pfft. If I hosted Death’s power, I’d have flipped a table by now.”</p><p align="justify">Jen kicked her under the table. “Subtlety. Look into it.” She turned to Rio, arms crossed. “Don’t expect me to kiss your ass, though. You’re still the rookie who nearly torched Lilia’s house – and us with it.”</p><p align="justify">Rio smirked. This she could handle – no reverence, no fear. Just the same bluntness Agatha had shown her from the start.</p><p align="justify">Lilia swept in, her shawl smelling of burnt sage. “Rio. Better?”</p><p align="justify">“Mostly.”</p><p align="justify">“Good.” Lilia tapped an old book Alice was holding. “We’ve pieced it together. The killers aren’t just harvesting magic – they’re weaving it. Using the drug to warp ley lines. Someone’s trying to unmake the world’s fabric.”</p><p align="justify">Rio took a bit at the apple. “Why?”</p><p align="justify">Jen snorted. “Why do men build nukes? Why do CEOs hoard billions?” She flicked her hand dramatically. “Some people see a universe and think, ‘Mine.’”</p><p align="justify">“So the ley lines…” Rio trailed off.</p><p align="justify">Alice leaned forward. “If you can listen to them, lead us right to the bastard’s doorstep.”</p><p align="justify">“Though,” Jen drawled, “we’ve been ‘close to the truth’ before. Temper your expectations.”</p><p align="justify">Rio swirled the apple in her hand. “Just… tune into magical fault lines. Easy.”</p><p align="justify">“No pressure.” Alice chirped.</p><p align="justify">Lilia rolled her eyes. “Agatha can guide you. She’s the best at–”</p><p align="justify">“Where is she?” Rio tried to sound not very interested.</p><p align="justify">Jen smirked. “Sulking with her knives? Terrorizing Billy about his algebra? Who knows. Our leader fearless righthand’s mysterious like that.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The whetstone screamed against steel, each scrape carving away Agatha's frayed control. <em>Idiot</em>. The dagger's edge flashed her reflection back at her – dark circles under eyes that wouldn't stop seeing Rio's face when their lips met. That gasp. The shove.</p><p align="justify">
<em>Professional. It was professional.</em>
</p><p align="justify">The lie tasted worse than blood when the stone slipped, slicing her thumb. She sucked the wound clean, savoring the copper sting. Better than the ache behind her ribs.</p><p align="justify">The door groaned.</p><p align="justify">"Lilia said you'd be– <em>oh</em>." Rio's voice.</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn't turn. "Sharpening knives."</p><p align="justify">A beat. Then, tight as a garrote wire: "We should be doing the ley line thing now."</p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled through her nose. <em>Of course</em>. She sheathed the blade and finally looked.</p><p align="justify">Rio stood framed in dying light, arms crossed. Sunset gilded the hairs at her temples, the defiant set of her jaw – <em>fuck</em>, Agatha hated how beautiful she looked when she was pissed.</p><p align="justify">They went to the mill's basement – its proximity to the ground helpful.</p><p align="justify">It smelled of damp earth and burnt herbs. Rio folded herself onto the floorboards, spine rigid. Agatha knelt opposite, close enough to catch the clove-and-nightshade scent of Jen's potions on Rio's skin.</p><p align="justify">Agatha cleared her throat. "Focus on the space between breaths."</p><p align="justify">Rio shut her eyes. "I <em>know</em> how to meditate."</p><p align="justify">"Then stop <em>talking</em>."</p><p align="justify">The muscle in Rio's jaw jumped. Silence thickened with everything unspoken: the kiss, the way she pushed away, the kiss, the way Agatha had caught her when she collapsed after the club, the kiss, the fact that neither had mentioned any of it so far, the fucking kiss.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's fingers twitched toward her knees. "Now imagine roots growing from your palms. Down through the floor. Through the soil–"</p><p align="justify">"Christ, I'm not a <em>houseplant</em>–" Rio's voice cracked. The drug withdrawal made her temper brittle, caffeine no longer enough to blunt the edges.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's nails bit her own knees. "Do you want help or not?"</p><p align="justify">Rio's eyes flew open – amber burning black. "I didn't ask for you."</p><p align="justify"><em>Snap</em>.</p><p align="justify">Agatha seized Rio's wrist. "<em>Try</em>."</p><p align="justify">Rio hissed but closed her eyes. She did what Agatha said: vines, soil, reach. Her headache spiked. But then, beneath the pain, a <em>hum</em>.</p><p align="justify">"I... feel something."</p><p align="justify">"Good, try to follow that – wherever you hear it better." Agatha's thumb brushed Rio's pulse point.<em> Too fast</em>.</p><p align="justify">And Rio did.</p><p align="justify">She chased the nature sounds the lines were releasing. A mental map of the ley net started to form in her head.</p><p align="justify">Rio gasped. "I see it – the whole network. There's a <em>rupture</em>–"</p><p align="justify">"Easy." Agatha's grip tightened. "Ley lines listen back. Don't get pulled in–"</p><p align="justify">But Rio was already chasing the corruption, the stench of rotting magic, a chorus of screaming roots–</p><p align="justify">–the dark mass pulsing like an infected heart, just in the outskirts of New Salem.</p><p align="justify">Rio opened her eyes, getting on her feet. “I think I know where they are!”</p><p align="justify">Agatha stood slowly, wiping her hand on her jeans like she could scrub off the feel of Rio’s skin. </p><p align="justify">“You’re welcome. Now go get those drugs out of your system – that withdrawal s making you impatient.”</p><p align="justify">“Sorry. I did never got to thank you for saving me.”</p><p align="justify">But no formal “thank you” came out. Agatha just nodded and left.</p><p align="justify">She was at the door when Rio asked, quiet: “Why did you kissed me. At the club.”</p><p align="justify">A lingering question in those words.</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn’t turn. “We were about to be caught. Seemed the easiest way out.”</p><p align="justify">The lie tasted like ash.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="justify">The plan was simple – in theory.</p><p align="justify">Follow the ley lines like blood trails through the city's veins. Find the festering wound corrupting their magic. Kill/burn/your-violence-of-choosing whoever was responsible. Then, stitch the ley lines back together before the world unraveled at the seams.</p><p align="justify">In practice, it was a suicide mission.</p><p align="justify">Whoever was behind this wasn't just powerful – they were rewriting the rules of magic itself. Distorting ley lines required energy on a cosmic scale, the kind that should have shattered any mortal witch attempting it. The fact that someone had done it – was doing it – meant they either commanded forces beyond comprehension or had an army of witches feeding their power.</p><p align="justify">Which was why Lilia found herself hesitating at the basement door, listening to the sounds of combat magic echoing up the stone steps. The others had been training for hours – most modern witches hadn't practiced real battle magic in generations. The last war between covens had ended before Lilia was born, leaving behind only cautionary tales and the occasional scarred elder.</p><p align="justify">She took a steadying breath and went down the stairs.</p><p align="justify">The basement air hummed with spent magic, clinging to every surface. Alice stood opposite to Rio, demonstrating a defensive ward with patient precision. Yellow light shimmered between Alice’s palms as she shaped the energy into a translucent shield.</p><p align="justify">"See how the edges ripple?" Alice said, rotating the spell slowly. "That's the give – lets it absorb impacts instead of shattering."</p><p align="justify">Rio mirrored the motion, her own magic flaring to life. But where Alice's shield formed smooth and even, Rio's flickered erratically, the green magic still learning who to survive without its dark companion.</p><p align="justify">Across the room, Agatha and Jen sparred with brutal efficiency. Purple and pink magic clashed in sharp bursts as they took turns attacking and defending. Jen fought with clinical precision – every movement calculated, every spell perfectly measured, and the occasional vial that was thrown acted as surprise. Agatha moved like a storm given form – all raw power and instinct, her magic lashing out in unpredictable arcs that forced Jen to constantly adapt.</p><p align="justify">Lilia cleared her throat.</p><p align="justify">Four heads snapped toward her. Four sets of eyes – all waiting for whatever came next.</p><p align="justify">"We can't do this alone." Lilia said, the weight of centuries in her voice. " The corruption of a ley line is too serious for just the five of us. If we’re going into this head on, we are going to need reinforcements – we need more witches."</p><p align="justify">Agatha stiffened, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her hand. The motion pulled her tank top taut across her shoulders, revealing fresh bruises from training. "Who are you thinking of?"</p><p align="justify">Lilia met her gaze squarely. "The Salem Seven."</p><p align="justify">The silence that followed was absolute.</p><p align="justify">Alice's shield spell flickered out. Jen's vial almost slipped from her fingers.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's reaction was more visceral – her magic flared violently, sending a crack spiderwebbing across the ceiling. "No."</p><p align="justify">Lilia sighed. "We don't have the luxury of old grudges, Agatha."</p><p align="justify">"Old grudges?" Agatha's voice cracked like a whip. She took a step forward, magic coiling around her fists. "If not for me, then for Billy, Lilia. You swore we would never have anything to do with those bitches, ever!"</p><p align="justify">Rio edged closer to Alice. "Who are the Salem Seven?" she whispered.</p><p align="justify">Jen answered at full volume, her smirk sharp enough to draw blood. "Agatha's old crew. Before she defected to our side."</p><p align="justify">"I didn't defect." Agatha snarled. "I left."</p><p align="justify">Lilia ignored the outburst. "They're the only coven in Boston with the strength and knowledge we need. They've worked with ley magic before."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's hands clenched so tight her knuckles bleached white. "And you know exactly how they gained that experience, Lilia. They–"</p><p align="justify">She cut herself off abruptly, but not before Rio saw the raw grief flash across her face – there and gone in an instant, buried beneath layers of practiced control.</p><p align="justify">Lilia's expression softened. "I know. But we don't have a choice."</p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose, then turned on her heel and stormed up the stairs without saying another word. The door slammed behind her with enough force to rattle the shelves.</p><p align="justify">Jen stepped forward, brushing glass shards from her sleeves. "I'll go with you to meet them."</p><p align="justify">Rio straightened. "I can come too."</p><p align="justify">Three voices answered as one: "No."</p><p align="justify">Lilia placed a gentle but firm hand on Rio's shoulder. "You're still recovering. And you need all the time you can get to practice." She turned to Jen. "Gather your things. We leave in thirty minutes."</p><p align="justify">As Lilia and Jen disappeared upstairs, Alice nudged Rio's elbow. "Come on." She said quietly. "Let's work on those shields some more."</p><p align="justify">But Rio barely heard her. Her gaze remained fixed on the doorway where Agatha had vanished, wondering what ghosts from her past had just been summoned.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">After three grueling hours of training with Alice, Rio's muscles trembled with exhaustion. Her magic reserves felt scraped raw – like she'd run a marathon while reciting incantations backwards. The last protective ward she'd attempted had fizzled into green sparks, earning her a sympathetic pat on the shoulder from Alice.</p><p align="justify">"Break time." Alice declared, tossing Rio a protein bar that smelled suspiciously of sawdust and regret. "Even witches need to refuel."</p><p align="justify">Rio chewed mechanically, the taste barely registering as her mind wandered. Without conscious decision, her feet carried her toward the armory – the one place in Lilia's compound that always seemed to draw her lately.</p><p align="justify">The heavy oak door stood slightly ajar. Inside, Agatha sat cross-legged on the worn Persian rug, methodically cleaning an old shotgun that looked like it had survived the actual Salem witch trials. The dim light from the ceiling painted golden streaks across her shoulders as she worked, the rhythmic click-clack of the weapon's mechanisms the only sound in the quiet space.</p><p align="justify">"If you want to hide from someone," Rio leaned against the doorframe, "you shouldn't always hide in the armory."</p><p align="justify">The ghost of a smirk touched Agatha's lips before vanishing. "Not now, Rio."</p><p align="justify">Something in her tone gave Rio pause. That wasn't Agatha's usual sarcastic deflection – it sounded almost like... a request.</p><p align="justify">Rio stepped inside fully, letting the door whisper shut behind her. "You okay?" She perched on the edge of an ammunition crate, the wood creaking under her weight.</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn't look up from her task. "Peachy."</p><p align="justify">Rio rolled her eyes so hard it nearly sparked a headache. "You're pissed."</p><p align="justify">"Observant." The shotgun barrel gleamed under Agatha's ministrations, probably cleaner now than the day it was forged.</p><p align="justify">"At me?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha's hands stilled. For three heartbeats, the only sound was their breathing – Agatha's deliberately even, Rio's unconsciously matching its rhythm. Then with a sigh that seemed to come from her bones, Agatha set the cleaning rod aside. "No. Not at you."</p><p align="justify">Rio waited, watching the play of yellow light across Agatha's knuckles – the scars there she'd never explained, the faint tremor that only showed when she thought no one was looking.</p><p align="justify">"Look," Rio finally said, "if I did something to piss you off these past few days – with the drug withdrawal and all – I'm sorry. You were right, it messed me up pretty bad."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's shoulders dropped half an inch. "It's okay. I get that." She picked up a cloth and resumed polishing the same six-inch section of barrel she'd been working on for the last five minutes. "It's not you. I'm..."</p><p align="justify">The words hung unfinished. Rio watched Agatha's throat work as she swallowed whatever venom wanted to spill out.</p><p align="justify">"You really hate Lilia's idea." Rio ventured.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's hands clenched around the shotgun. "No. I loathe it." The words came out sharp as shattered glass. "And she should know better."</p><p align="justify">She set the gun down with deliberate care, then seemed to war with herself before continuing. "My mother was... not a good person." A pause. "The kind of witch who made the trials look justified." Agatha's laugh was bitter as wormwood. "And the Seven? They never lifted a finger to stop her. Not when she–"</p><p align="justify">Her voice cracked. The shotgun's stock creaked under her grip.</p><p align="justify">"And Billy." Agatha's tone turned glacial. "When Wanda died, they tossed him out like yesterday's garbage. Didn't matter that he was just a kid. Didn't matter that he was their family."</p><p align="justify">Rio didn't think – just reached out and covered Agatha's white-knuckled hand with her own. Her magic responded before she could second-guess it, green tendrils weaving through their fingers in what she hoped was a comforting gesture.</p><p align="justify">The effect was instantaneous. Agatha snorted, the tension breaking as she eyed the clumsy magic. "<em>Christ</em>, is that the best Alice could teach you?"</p><p align="justify">Rio's cheeks burned, but she'd take the mockery over that hollow look in Agatha's eyes any day. "Well, the best teacher in this compound is currently sulking with her old firearms, so..."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's grin was sudden and dazzling – all sharp edges and dangerous promises. She stood in one fluid motion, suddenly crowding into Rio's space. "The best teacher, huh?"</p><p align="justify">Rio's breath caught. Agatha smelled of gun oil, her proximity sending an unexpected shiver down Rio's spine.</p><p align="justify">"I heard you haven't had proper combat training yet." Agatha murmured, her breath warm.</p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard. "I'm exhausted."</p><p align="justify">Agatha stepped back, that wicked gleam still in her eyes. "That's when it's best to practice. Besides," she tossed Rio a practice escrima stick, "now that the drugs are out of your system, the odds of you accidentally eviscerating me are... what, sixty-forty?"</p><p align="justify">Rio caught the wooden stick. "Ha ha. Hilarious."</p><p align="justify">But she was already following Agatha toward the training mats, exhaustion forgotten, the weight of earlier conversation lingering between them like the aftertaste of strong wine – bitter, complex, and strangely intoxicating.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The training room started to smell like sweat and magic. Rio flexed her fingers around the combat stick, its worn grooves fitting perfectly against her hand. The weight felt unfamiliar yet comforting, like holding a promise of strength she hadn't yet earned. Across the room, Agatha rolled her shoulders in slow, deliberate circles, the movement making the scars along her collarbone catch the light.</p><p align="justify">"Remember," Agatha said, settling into a stance that looked both relaxed and deadly, "this isn't about brute force. It's a conversation."</p><p align="justify">Rio smirked, shifting her grip. "You always talk with your fists?"</p><p align="justify">"Only to people who won't listen otherwise." Agatha's mouth quirked in that half-smile Rio had come to recognize as both challenge and invitation. "And you, Dr. Vidal, are a terrible listener."</p><p align="justify">The first strike came without warning – a testing jab aimed at Rio's ribs that she barely deflected in time. The impact sent vibrations singing up her arms, a physical echo that lingered in her bones. Agatha flowed into the next movement like water over stone, her stick tracing arcs through the air that left faint purple afterimages dancing at the edges of Rio's vision.</p><p align="justify">Rio tried to mirror her footwork, but Agatha's rhythm was a language she couldn't yet speak. Each block sent fresh shocks through her muscles – each near miss made her pulse stutter in a way that had nothing to do with exertion. After five relentless minutes, her forearms burned with effort, her breath coming in short gasps that fogged the cool air between them.</p><p align="justify">"Stop thinking so hard. This is not science, Dr." Agatha nagged, tapping Rio's wrist lightly when she overextended. The contact was brief but electric, a spark that jumped between them. "Magic isn't in your head." She pressed two fingers just below Rio's sternum, the warmth of her touch bleeding through the thin fabric of Rio's shirt. "It's here. Breathe from your center."</p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard, suddenly aware of how close they stood. "Easy for you to say. You've been doing this since–"</p><p align="justify">Agatha's stick came down hard, cutting her off mid-sentence. "Since I walked." There was something dark in her voice now, a shadow Rio wanted to chase but didn't dare. "And my first teacher didn't tolerate excuses."</p><p align="justify">The air between them shifted, charged with unspoken history. Rio opened her mouth – to ask, to push – but Agatha was already moving again, her expression shuttering like a book snapped too quickly.</p><p align="justify">They circled each other in silence, the only sounds their measured breaths and the soft scuff of bare feet on worn mats. This time, when Agatha struck, Rio let instinct take over. Her green magic flared to life without a conscious thought, weaving through the wood grain of her stick like ivy climbing a trellis. The resulting parry sent Agatha back a step, her eyebrows lifting in genuine surprise.</p><p align="justify">"Better." The single word of praise warmed Rio more than it should have. "But you're still holding back."</p><p align="justify">"I don't want to hurt you." Rio admitted, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her hand.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's expression softened in a way Rio had never seen before, the usual sharp edges of her demeanor blurring into something dangerously close to tenderness – but her voice filled with challenge: "Oh, you won't."</p><p align="justify">The next exchange felt different – less like sparring, more like the careful steps of a dance neither had learned but both understood instinctively. Agatha's movements became deliberate, almost pedagogical. When Rio misstepped, instead of capitalizing on the mistake, Agatha adjusted her stance to demonstrate proper form, her body moving with a grace that made Rio's throat tighten. When Rio's magic flickered uncertainly, Agatha's purple energy reached out to steady it, their powers tangling briefly in the air between them like clasped hands.</p><p align="justify">At one point, Agatha stepped in close to guide Rio's elbow with her free hand, correcting her posture. Her breath ghosted over Rio's neck as she murmured, "Like this." and Rio shivered despite the heat building in her muscles.</p><p align="justify">The intimacy of it unnerved her. This wasn't the roughhousing from earlier sessions with Alice, nor the clinical precision of Jen's drills. Agatha was teaching her, truly teaching her, with a patience Rio hadn't known she had. It felt like being let in on a secret, like being trusted with something fragile and precious.</p><p align="justify">And then, her magic was somewhat addictive to Rio. Every time Agatha used her magic to correct a shape of Rio’s, she felt like holding to that purple, like pull it in and let it rest in her own body.</p><p align="justify">"Why are you doing this?" Rio blurted as they reset, her voice rough with exertion and something else she couldn't name.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stilled, her combat stick pausing mid-air. "What?"</p><p align="justify">"Being... nice." Rio gestured vaguely between them. "No sarcastic comments on my poor abilities anymore."</p><p align="justify">For a long moment, Agatha just looked at her, the golden light coming from the ceiling catching in her dark lashes. Then, so quietly Rio almost missed it: "Because no one did this for me." The admission hung between them, fragile as a spider's web glistening with morning dew. "And you deserve better."</p><p align="justify">Rio's throat tightened unexpectedly. Before she could formulate a response – before she could even begin to process what those words meant – Agatha was moving yet again, her stick flashing out in what was clearly a telegraphed strike. Slow. Deliberate.</p><p align="justify">Rio met it. Then the next, and the next, until they fell into a rhythm that felt something Rio had no name for. The outside world faded – there was only the whisper of bare feet on the floor, the creak of wood under strain, the rhythm of their breathing falling into perfect time.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The training room grew warmer as the night wore on. Sweat dampened Rio's back, her shirt clinging to her skin, but she barely noticed. There was only this – the give and take, the push and pull, the unspoken understanding that passed between them with every blocked strike and countered move.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s chest rose and fell with exertion, sweat gleaming along her temples like liquid silver as she stepped closer – closer than necessary – her combat stick held loose in her grip. The heat between them had long since surpassed the burn of physical effort.</p><p align="justify">Agatha reached out then, hesitantly, as if crossing some invisible boundary, and tucked a damp strand of hair behind Rio's ear. Her fingers lingered near Rio's jaw, calloused and warm. "You're learning." She said softly, her voice rough in a way that had nothing to do with their hours of training.</p><p align="justify">The moment Agatha's fingers brushed her jaw, Rio's breath caught – but then the memory surfaced like a slap.</p><p align="justify">
<em>"We were about to be caught. Seemed the easiest way out."</em>
</p><p align="justify">Agatha's casual dismissal of their kiss at the club coiled around Rio's ribs like barbed wire. Rio forced herself to step back, breaking the contact. The training stick felt suddenly heavy in her sweat-slick palms.</p><p align="justify"><em>Stop this.</em> She adjusted her grip with deliberate focus. <em>She was just doing her job then. She's just doing her job now.</em></p><p align="justify">Agatha tilted her head, that infuriating strand of hair falling across her forehead again. "You're tensing up."</p><p align="justify">"Am I?" Rio feinted left, striking harder than necessary. Their sticks cracked together, the impact vibrating up her arms.</p><p align="justify">A flicker of surprise crossed Agatha's face before she countered effortlessly. "What was that for?"</p><p align="justify">
<em>For making me remember how you taste.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>For looking at me like this now when it meant nothing then.</em>
</p><p align="justify">"I thought fighting wasn’t fair." Rio gritted out, channeling green energy into her next strike. The vines that coiled around her stick were thornier than usual.</p><p align="justify">Agatha blocked, but her eyes narrowed at the sharpness of the magic. When she pushed back, her purple energy didn't just deflect – it <em>caught</em>, twining with Rio's in a way that felt uncomfortably intimate.</p><p align="justify">"Talk to me." Agatha demanded, their sticks still locked together, magic pulsing where they connected.</p><p align="justify">Rio yanked her weapon free with more force than necessary. "There's nothing to talk about."</p><p align="justify">The silence stretched between them, thick with everything Rio wouldn't say.</p><p align="justify">Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose. "Fine." She reset her stance, but something had shifted in her eyes – that earlier softness replaced by familiar steel. "Again. And this time, stop pretending you're not angry."</p><p align="justify"><em>Oh, I'm not pretending</em>, though Rio.</p><p align="justify">And she attacked without a warning, letting the green energy flare wild at the edges – letting Agatha think it was about the training. Letting her believe this fury was for anything other than the way her traitorous heart still raced every time their hands brushed.</p><p align="justify">It was better that than the truth: that even now, part of her still hoped.</p><p align="justify">The air between them crackled as Rio's next strike landed harder than intended. Green energy flared jagged around her stick – not the usual smooth vines, but something barbed and bristling.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's parry came a half-second too slow. A thorned tendril lashed across her forearm, drawing a thin line of crimson.</p><p align="justify">They both froze.</p><p align="justify">Rio's breath hitched at the sight of blood beading on Agatha's skin. Her magic recoiled instantly, the green light dimming to something sickly and pale. "I didn't mean–"</p><p align="justify">"Finally." Agatha wiped the blood away with her thumb, eyes locked on Rio's. "There you are."</p><p align="justify">Purple energy erupted from Agatha's palms, not in attack but in invitation – a shimmering bridge between their weapons. Rio's magic reacted before she could stop it, tendrils creeping forward to intertwine with Agatha's in hesitant, flickering pulses.</p><p align="justify"><em>This is a mistake</em>. The thought came too late. Their joined magic hummed with something deeper than spellwork, resonating in the hollow of Rio's chest like a struck bell. She could feel Agatha's heartbeat in the rhythm of her power, could taste the sharp tang of her frustration.</p><p align="justify">Worse – she could feel the echo of that damned kiss.</p><p align="justify">Rio wrenched her magic back so violently the recoil sent her stumbling. The severed connection left a phantom ache between her ribs.</p><p align="justify">Before either could say more, the door creaked open. Alice entered the room, confused. "You two realize the whole house can feel when you start throwing magic around like that, right?" She nodded toward the hallway. "Jen and Lilia just got back. They've got news."</p><p align="justify">The moment shattered like dropped glass. Rio cleared her throat, rolling her shoulders to dispel the lingering energy. "We'll be right there."</p><p align="justify">Alice raised an eyebrow at their flushed faces and the charged air between them, but wisely said nothing before disappearing back down the hall.</p><p align="justify">Their eyes lingered on each other for a few seconds – swimming emotions begging to get out.</p><p align="justify">Agatha flexed her hand, the faint mark already fading. "We should..." She gestured vaguely toward the door.</p><p align="justify">"Yeah." Rio bent to pick up the fallen training stick, careful not to let their fingers brush.</p><p align="justify">The words hung between them – a promise or a postponement, neither could say. But as they walked toward the meeting, the space between their shoulders felt charged with all the things left unspoken.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The moment Rio stepped into the library room, just after Agatha, the change in atmosphere hit her like a physical blow – magic coiled tight with tension.</p><p align="justify">Jen leaned against the far wall, arms crossed over her chest, her usual smirk absent – and this alone made Rio wonder what was happening. The shadows under her eyes looked deeper than usual, her fingers tapping an uneven rhythm against her bicep. Lilia sat at the head of the heavy oak table, her crimson nails steepled before her, face unreadable as polished stone.</p><p align="justify">And between them stood a woman Rio didn't recognize.</p><p align="justify">Smaller than Agatha by half a head, she carried herself with the easy grace of someone used to command. Blonde hair coiled tightly against her scalp like a crown. A cloak of deep indigo draped over one shoulder, the hem embroidered with constellations that seemed to shift when Rio blinked.</p><p align="justify">Agatha went rigid beside her, her shoulder brushing Rio's as she stopped dead in the doorway. The warmth of the contact vanished as Agatha pulled away, her entire body tensing like a drawn bowstring.<br/>"Sharon." The name left Agatha's lips like a curse, low and venomous.</p><p align="justify">The woman – Sharon – turned with deliberate slowness, her smile spreading like honey over a blade. "Agatha Harkness." Her voice was higher than Rio expected, scratching with an undercurrent of something darker.</p><p align="justify">Alice cleared her throat from where she lingered near the bookshelves. "Sharon's coven is going to assist us into the corruption of the ley lines. They've been monitoring the disturbances longer than we have."</p><p align="justify">"How generous." Agatha said flatly, not taking her eyes off Sharon. "Considering the last time you assisted was... well, never."</p><p align="justify">The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. Sharon's smile didn't waver, but something cold and calculating flickered in her dark eyes – like a shark catching scent of blood in the water.</p><p align="justify">Lilia finally spoke, her voice cutting through the tension like a knife. "Enough. Old grievances won't mend broken magic. Sharon's people have mapped the corrupted nodes along New Salem and into the Lynn Woods Reservation. We move in three days."</p><p align="justify">Rio barely registered the words. She was too busy watching the way Agatha's fingers twitched toward the knives at her belt, the way Sharon's gaze kept sliding to her – lingering just a beat too long each time. Assessing. Calculating.</p><p align="justify">Then Sharon turned fully towards Rio, and the air in the room changed palpably.</p><p align="justify">"And you must be the green witch who heard the lines sing. I haven’t seen you around – I would remember your face." Sharon took a step closer, her cloak whispering against the floorboards like a living thing. Up close, Rio could see the fine lines at the corners of her eyes. "Only the greatest of your kind can do that, you know. Even among the Salem Seven, we've only had three witches in two centuries with that gift."</p><p align="justify">Rio forced herself not to retreat, though every instinct screamed at her to put distance between them. "Lucky guess." She said, keeping her voice steady through sheer force of will.</p><p align="justify">Sharon laughed, low and throaty, the sound somehow intimate in the crowded room. "There's no luck in magic, darling. Only power." Her eyes flicked to Agatha, then back to Rio. "Though I suppose some would rather pretend otherwise."</p><p align="justify">Agatha moved before anyone could react – one smooth step that placed her squarely between Rio and Sharon, close enough that Rio could feel the heat radiating off her back. "We're done here."</p><p align="justify">Sharon arched one perfectly shaped brow. "Are we?" She made a show of examining her nails. "I'd hoped we might discuss New Salem's defenses. My seers have seen... troubling things in the currents."</p><p align="justify">Jen pushed off the wall with a sigh. "Play nice, children. We've got actual work to do." She tossed a rolled parchment onto the table where it landed with a heavy thud. "Alice has been scouting the docks. Whatever they're cooking up there, it's getting worse."</p><p align="justify">Lilia stood, her presence alone enough to cut through the tension like a blade through smoke. "Three days." she repeated, her tone brooking no argument. "Prepare your people."</p><p align="justify">As the others filed out, Sharon lingered just a moment too long, her gaze locking onto Rio with unsettling intensity. "I do hope we'll speak again, green witch. There's so much I could teach you." Her smile widened, showing perfect white teeth. "The old ways are not entirely lost."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's hand closed around Rio's wrist, pulling her away before she could respond. The touch burned – not with magic. <em>Protectiveness</em>.</p><p align="justify">And as they left the room, the weight of Sharon's gaze following them, Rio couldn't shake the feeling that the real battle had only just begun.</p>

<p align="justify">Dawn painted the sky in muted shades of violet when Agatha shook Rio awake. The touch was firm, impersonal – just fingertips against her shoulder, gone before Rio could fully register their warmth.</p><p align="justify">"Up." Agatha commanded, already turning away. "If we're moving in two days, you need every hour of training we can get. Tomorrow you rest."</p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, dragging herself upright. Every muscle protested the movement – yesterday's session still lingered in her bones like a bad hangover. She blinked sleep from her eyes to find Agatha already dressed in her training leathers, strapping knives to her thighs with methodical precision. And a mug of hot coffee on her nightstand.</p><p align="justify">The training room (the basement) was cold when they entered, their breath misting in the air. Agatha didn't bother with warm-ups.</p><p align="justify">"Start." she said simply, and struck.</p><p align="justify">What followed wasn't training – it was punishment. Agatha moved like a storm given form, her strikes sharper than necessary, her blocks harder than required. There was a brittleness to her movements that Rio had never seen before, as if every muscle was wound too tight, every motion barely contained.</p><p align="justify">Rio ducked under a sweeping kick, rolling to her feet just in time to parry a knife strike that came dangerously close to her throat. The blade's edge whispered against her skin, leaving a thin line of purple in its wake. Her breath came in short, sharp gasps, her muscles burning with exertion. Sweat trickled down her temple, stinging her eye.</p><p align="justify">"You're holding back." Agatha accused, circling her like a wolf sizing up prey.</p><p align="justify">"I'm not. I’m just sleepy, it’s fucking six–" Rio began, but Agatha was already moving again, her fist connecting with Rio's ribs hard enough to knock the air from her lungs.</p><p align="justify">Rio staggered back, pain blooming across her side. She barely had time to register it before Agatha was on her again, a whirlwind of purple energy and lethal intent. But this time, Rio managed to strike back with ease – maybe training was starting to pay, or maybe–</p><p align="justify">"You're distracted." Rio managed between gasps, barely dodging a vicious elbow strike that would have shattered her jaw.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's jaw clenched. "I'm fine."</p><p align="justify">The denial was as brittle as her movements. Rio could see it now – the way Agatha's eyes kept flickering to the door, the tension in her shoulders that had nothing to do with their sparring. Something was eating at her.</p><p align="justify">A particularly brutal strike sent Rio sprawling onto the floor, the impact driving the breath from her lungs. Before she could recover, Agatha's boot pressed lightly against her chest.</p><p align="justify">"Again." Agatha said, stepping back.</p><p align="justify">Rio groaned, rolling to her feet. "We've been at this for hours."</p><p align="justify">"And you're still dropping your guard." Agatha tossed her the staff. The wood was smooth, worn from years of use.</p><p align="justify">"So are you." Rio countered, catching it easily. "We're both tired, and not just physically. We should take a break."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's expression darkened. "No time for breaks."</p><p align="justify">She lunged without warning, her staff whipping toward Rio's ribs. Rio barely blocked in time, the impact shuddering up her arms. She countered, forcing Agatha back a step – but then her magic flared without warning, green vines spiraling around her staff.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's purple energy reacted instinctively, twining with Rio's in a crackling braid of light. Their staffs clashed with a deafening crack that echoed through the empty room. Without warning, their magic flared simultaneously. Rio's green vines tangled with Agatha's purple energy in an intricate dance neither had consciously initiated. Rio could feel the barely-contained energy radiating from Agatha – not just magic, something more volatile. </p><p align="justify">They both froze.</p><p align="justify">The connection hummed between them, warm and electric, like a wildfire on Rio's skin. She could feel Agatha's magic – not just its power, but the rhythm of it, the way it pulsed in time with her heartbeat. It was intimate in a way that left her breathless, as if she'd been granted access to something private, something sacred.</p><p align="justify">Agatha yanked her staff back, severing the link with a violence that left Rio staggering.</p><p align="justify">"Stop that." Agatha snapped, her voice rough.</p><p align="justify">"I'm not doing anything!" Rio protested, watching the last tendrils of their intertwined magic fade. The loss of it left her strangely hollow.</p><p align="justify">"It's dangerous." Agatha said, pacing the floor like a restless animal. "This connection between–" She stopped herself abruptly, jaw working. "It's a liability. It can be used against you."</p><p align="justify">Rio threw her staff down in frustration. The clatter of wood against stone echoed through the room. "Then explain it to me! Stop treating me like some fragile thing that needs protecting!"</p><p align="justify">The door creaked open before Agatha could respond.</p><p align="justify">Alice stood in the doorway – her usual playful demeanor absent.</p><p align="justify">"Sharon's here." she said quietly. "She's asking for you, Rio."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's entire body went rigid. The air around her crackled with energy, the scent of lavender sharp in Rio's nose. Alice didn't wait for a response, disappearing as quickly as she'd come, leaving the weight of her words hanging between them.</p><p align="justify">The silence that followed was heavier than any blow Agatha had landed that morning. Rio watched as Agatha turned away, her shoulders tense beneath her leathers. The dawn light streaming through the windows painted her in gold and shadow, turning her into something both beautiful and terrible.</p><p align="justify">When Agatha finally spoke, her voice was barely above a whisper. "Don't..."</p><p align="justify">The words hung between them, fragile as glass.</p><p align="justify">Rio reached for her staff, her fingers tightening around the worn wood. "I’ll just see what she wants."</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn't try to stop her as she walked away. But the weight of her silence followed Rio down the hall, a shadow she couldn't shake.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The morning air was crisp as Rio stepped into the front garden, dew still clinging to the grass beneath her boots. Sharon stood at the gate, sunlight dancing across the silver embroidery of her cloak.</p><p align="justify">"Ah, Rio!" Sharon's voice carried just enough warmth to feel inviting while leaving a metallic aftertaste of calculation. "I'd hoped we might speak privately yesterday – before Agatha spirited you away."</p><p align="justify">Rio crossed her arms, the morning chill raising gooseflesh along her skin. "You wanted to talk?"<br/>
Sharon stepped forward, her cloak whispering against the grass. In her hands she cradled an old book, its surface with intricate botanical designs.</p><p align="justify">"I've been sensing your power since I met you." Sharon murmured, running long fingers along the book's spine. "It's remarkable we haven't crossed paths before." Her dark eyes gleamed with something between admiration and hunger. "Such untapped potential, lying dormant beneath layers of... what? Fear? Restraint?"</p><p align="justify">Rio's pulse jumped at her throat. "Agatha's trying to protect me."</p><p align="justify">"From what?" Sharon arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "From knowledge? From strength?" She extended the book towards Rio. "This is the Grimoire of Verdant Paths – one of only three surviving copies. It contains secrets your mother's generation tried to erase."</p><p align="justify">The leather cover felt unnaturally warm beneath Rio's tentative touch, as if the book itself was alive. She could almost hear whispers in the rustling of its pages.</p><p align="justify">"Agatha wants to keep you caged because she fears what she can't control." Sharon continued, stepping closer. The scent of wormwood clung to her. "And I'm afraid that includes you, my dear."</p><p align="justify">Rio's fingers tightened on the grimoire. The constellations on Sharon's cloak swirled restlessly.</p><p align="justify">"Tell me," Sharon murmured, her breath warm against Rio's cheek, "when your magic tangles with Agatha's – does it feel like coming home? Or like drowning?"</p><p align="justify">Before Rio could answer, a sharp cough came from the doorway. Billy stood there, his usual playful demeanor absent and replaced by a watchfulness that seemed too old for his age.</p><p align="justify">Sharon's smile didn't waver, but something hardened in her eyes. "Well, it seems I'm not particularly welcome here." She stepped back. "Keep the grimoire. Perhaps when this current unpleasantness is resolved, I might teach you properly."</p><p align="justify">As Sharon's figure disappeared down the gravel path, Rio became acutely aware of Billy's gaze burning into her back.</p><p align="justify">"You shouldn't take gifts from her." He said quietly when Rio joined him in the doorway. He nursed a cup of tea between his hands, the steam curling around his serious expression.</p><p align="justify">Rio turned the ancient book over in her hands. "Morning Billy. Staying with us today?"</p><p align="justify">Billy shrugged, but his knuckles whitened around his mug. "Lilia thinks it's safer. Especially with Sharon sniffing around." His dark eyes flicked to the grimoire. "She gave my mom a book like that once."</p><p align="justify">The admission hung between them, weighted with unspoken history. Rio studied the boy – the way his shoulders hunched slightly under his oversized sweater, the purple shadows beneath his eyes that no amount of sleep seemed to erase.</p><p align="justify">"You don't trust her either." Rio observed.</p><p align="justify">Billy's lips pressed into a thin line. "Sharon always hated that I wasn't born a witch. Called me 'wasted potential' right to my face several times." He took a shaky sip of tea. "Said my mother's power deserved better than a mundane heir."</p><p align="justify">Rio's stomach twisted. She reached out instinctively, but Billy flinched away before her hand could touch his shoulder.</p><p align="justify">"You know she never protected Agatha." Billy said while staring into his tea. "Not really."</p><p align="justify">Rio froze. "What do you mean?"</p><p align="justify">Billy's fingers traced the rim of his mug. "You should talk to Agatha. I know she's..." He waved a hand, searching for the right word. "Agatha. But she's got reasons. Good ones."</p><p align="justify">Rio looked down at the grimoire in her hands. The weight of Sharon's gift suddenly felt heavier – less like an offering.</p><p align="justify">And as the morning sun climbed higher, Rio found herself wondering what price would eventually come due for this "gift” – and whether she'd recognize the moment when she'd crossed from student into pawn.</p><p align="justify">Because… part of her – the part that had spent years clawing for recognition in a world that dismissed witches – thrummed with something dangerously close to pride. Sharon, the leader of the Salem Seven, had looked at her like she was something rare. Something powerful. And then there was the other part. The part that had seen the way Agatha’s magic had recoiled at Sharon’s presence, like a wolf scenting poison.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The day passed in a blur of restlessness. After her unsettling encounter with Sharon, Rio had thrown herself into defensive drills with Alice. But even Alice's usual sharp wit couldn't distract Rio from the weight of the grimoire sitting on her bedside table, or the way Agatha had vanished after their morning session without a word.</p><p align="justify">By sunset, Rio found herself wandering the garden paths, her fingers trailing through the lavender bushes that lined the stone walkways. The plants responded to her touch, leaves unfurling toward her with unnatural eagerness. She could feel the ley lines humming beneath her feet, their usual steady pulse now threaded with a discordant note that set her teeth on edge.</p><p align="justify">When she finally returned to the house, the smell of roasting meat and herbs guided her to the breakfast room. Lilia presided over the table with her usual quiet authority, while Alice and Billy arranged plates and cutlery with practiced efficiency. Agatha stood by the window, her silhouette sharp against the fading light, a glass of amber liquor dangling from her fingers.</p><p align="justify">"You're just in time." Lilia said as Rio entered. "We were about to review the plan for the corruption that goes up to the Lynn Woods Reservation."</p><p align="justify">Dinner was a quiet affair, the usual easy banter replaced by tense silence. Rio picked at her food, acutely aware of Agatha's gaze burning into her every time she looked up from her plate.</p><p align="justify">"The corruption is strongest near West Lynn." Lilia explained, tracing a path on the worn map spread across the table. "We'll approach from the east, where the corruption seems weakest. Alice and Jen will–"</p><p align="justify">The door open with enough force to make them jump. Jen stood in the doorway, her chest heaving, her face slightly paler.</p><p align="justify">"A new corruption erupted." she gasped. "By Boston’s center. Three of Sharon's coven are missing."<br/>
Alice's fork clattered against her plate. "A new corruption? Why didn't we detect it earlier?"</p><p align="justify">Jen shook her head, her hands trembling. "It wasn't there this morning. It just... appeared. And Sharon's already gathering her people. She wants Rio to guide them in."</p><p align="justify">The air in the room turned to ice.</p><p align="justify">Agatha went perfectly still, her glass freezing halfway to her lips. Rio could see the tendons in her hand standing out like steel cables.</p><p align="justify">"I have to go." Rio said quietly.</p><p align="justify">The reaction was immediate. Agatha's glass banged against the table.</p><p align="justify">"It's a trap!" Agatha snarled, surging to her feet. The table shook with the force of her movement, sending silverware clattering to the floor. "You can't trust her!"</p><p align="justify">Rio stood to meet her, her chair scraping loudly against the flagstones. "You keep saying she's dangerous but won't tell me why! I can't fight ghosts, Agatha!"</p><p align="justify">"Because you already have a price on your head – without she knowing you’re Death’s vessel!" Agatha roared, her magic flaring purple around her fists. The air crackled with ozone.</p><p align="justify">The words hit like a physical blow. Billy flinched violently at the outburst, his fork bending in his white-knuckled grip. Alice reached for him instinctively, his eyes fixed on Agatha with something between fear and understanding.</p><p align="justify">Rio's hands clenched at her sides. "I already have a target! Or did you forget someone's framed me for murder? That’s what started this whole thing!"</p><p align="justify">The words hung between them, sharp as a guillotine's blade. Agatha's breathing came in ragged gasps, her knuckles white where they gripped the table's edge. The silence stretched, thick with everything they hadn't said.</p><p align="justify">Then–</p><p align="justify">"Fine." Agatha's voice was raw, stripped bare. "Sharon trained Wanda."</p><p align="justify">Billy made a small, wounded sound at his mother's name. Alice's hand found his shoulder, her grip tight.</p><p align="justify">Agatha didn't seem to notice. "Taught her secrets no witch should know. Blood magic. Soul binding. The kind of power that eats you from the inside out." Her eyes were dark pits in the flickering candlelight. "And when Wanda refused to cross her final line... Sharon withdrew her protection. Left her vulnerable when–" She stopped herself from going further.</p><p align="justify">The unspoken words – <em>when hunters came for her</em> – hung heavy in the air.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's throat bobbed as she swallowed hard. "And now she sees the same potential in you. Powerful. Untrained. Malleable." Her voice dropped to something barely audible. "I can't watch that happen again."</p><p align="justify">The confession left Rio breathless. For a moment, the room seemed to tilt around her, the weight of Agatha's fear pressing against her ribs.</p><p align="justify"><em>Trap or not, there is a disturbance in the balance</em>.</p><p align="justify">Death's voice echoed in her skull, sudden and clear. It had been days since the entity had spoken so directly.</p><p align="justify">Rio closed her eyes, reaching for the ley lines beneath her feet – her abilities approved with training. The magic surged up to meet her, but something was wrong – the usual steady pulse was jagged now, frayed at the edges like torn fabric. A wound in the world.</p><p align="justify">She opened her eyes. "It's real. People need help."</p><p align="justify">The silence that followed was worse than any shouting. Agatha stood perfectly still, her face a mask of quiet devastation. When she finally spoke, her voice was hollow.</p><p align="justify">"If you go with her... I won't follow."</p><p align="justify">The words landed like a sentence.</p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled slowly, the weight of the decision pressing down on her shoulders. "You're really going to make me choose?"</p><p align="justify">Agatha's jaw tightened. "I'm telling you the truth. Sharon will use you."</p><p align="justify">"I have a responsibility, Agatha."</p><p align="justify">Agatha turned away. "Then you've already made your choice."</p><p align="justify">Rio stared at her back, the ache in her chest so sharp it stole her breath. The room seemed to hold its breath with her – Lilia's knowing gaze, Alice's worried frown, Billy's wide-eyed stare. Even Jen looked uncomfortable, shifting from foot to foot by the door.</p><p align="justify">Rio turned to her, her voice steady despite the storm inside her. "Tell Sharon I'm coming."</p><p align="justify">She didn't wait to see Agatha's reaction. The door clicked shut behind her with terrible finality – a blade between her ribs with every step she took away from the breakfast room, away from the fragile trust they'd built, toward whatever waited in the corrupted lines.</p><p align="justify">And as she climbed the stairs to gather her things, Rio couldn't shake the terrible certainty that no matter what happened next, something between them had broken tonight.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The rusted iron gate that led them to the old subway tunnels loomed before them like the jaws of some long-dead beast, its hinges shrieking as Sharon pushed it open. The sound set Rio's teeth on edge – too loud in the unnatural silence of the marsh. Beyond the gate, a crumbling staircase descended into darkness, its steps slick with something that glistened faintly in the moonlight.</p><p align="justify">Rio crouched, her fingers pressing into the damp earth. The soil should have been alive beneath her touch – teeming with worms and mycelium, the steady pulse of growing things. But the ground here was wrong. Cold. The ley line beneath it throbbed infected, its rhythm erratic and weak.</p><p align="justify"><em>Something's feeding on it</em>. Death whispered in her mind. The voice was clearer here, stronger. <em>Can you taste the hunger?</em></p><p align="justify">Behind her, Sharon's coven moved through the mist like wraiths. Their whispered spells curled through the air, leaving trails of faint silver light that dissipated too quickly. Rio caught snippets of their murmurs – words in languages she didn't recognize, syllables that made her temples ache.</p><p align="justify">Agatha hadn't come.</p><p align="justify">The memory of those last words still sat like glass shards in Rio's chest, shifting painfully with every breath. <em>If you go with her, I won't follow.</em></p><p align="justify">A hand touched her shoulder. Rio startled, nearly losing her balance before strong fingers steadied her. Sharon loomed above.</p><p align="justify">"You feel it, don't you?" Sharon murmured. "The wound in the world."</p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed against the sudden dryness in her throat. The corruption wasn't just a rupture – it was a feeding ground. Something had sunk its teeth into the ley line and wasn't letting go. The realization sent a chill down her spine that had nothing to do with the marsh's damp cold.</p><p align="justify">"We should wait for the others." Rio said, pulling her hand from the soil. The dirt clung to her fingers, black and viscous like old blood.</p><p align="justify">As if summoned, Jen and Alice emerged from the mist, their faces grim in the pale moonlight. Jen's bag was full of vials. Alice's hands were already wreathed in her signature yellow magic, ready for a fight.</p><p align="justify">Rio's chest tightened when no third figure appeared behind them.</p><p align="justify">Sharon's smile was a knife-slash in the dark. "Agatha had her chance." She turned toward the gate, her cloak swirling around. "The lines won't wait for second thoughts."</p><p align="justify">Jen moved to Rio's side, her voice low. "I tried, I’m sorry.”</p>

<p align="justify">The tunnels swallowed them whole. Each step deeper into the old underground subway made the air thicker, heavier. The walls wept with condensation, the moisture catching the flickering witchlights Sharon's coven had conjured, turning the stone into a shimmering, sweat-slicked throat.</p><p align="justify">Rio's skin prickled as the ley lines' pull intensified. The magic thrummed through her bones, vibrating in her teeth. Her fingertips tingled, the green – with a hint of dark, this time – energy beneath her skin flaring in response to the ancient currents that snaked through the bedrock. But something was wrong – terribly. The ley lines here were an erratic flutter of a dying thing – their power was being siphoned away.</p><p align="justify">Alice moved closer. “You're hearing them, aren't you?” She murmured, her voice barely audible.</p><p align="justify">Rio nodded, her throat tight. “They're... crying.” The words came out hoarse, scraped raw by the overwhelming sensation of suffering that poured through her connection to the earth.</p><p align="justify">Ley lines weren't just channels of energy – they were alive in their own way. The oldest witches claimed they carried the memories of the land, the echoes of every spell ever cast upon it, every drop of blood ever spilled. And right now, those memories screamed.</p><p align="justify">"That's not creepy at all." Jen muttered, but the usual sarcasm in her voice was undercut by the way her knuckles whitened around her satchel.</p><p align="justify">Rio clenched her fists, her nails biting into her palms. The pain helped ground her, kept her from being swept away by the torrent of anguish. “We need a plan.” she said, louder this time.</p><p align="justify">Sharon turned, in one fluid motion. “Plan?” Her smile was all teeth. “We keep going and we kill whatever's doing this. Simple.”</p><p align="justify">Rio met her gaze and saw the hunger there – not just for vengeance, but for power. <em>Not simple</em>, she thought. Nothing about this was simple.</p><p align="justify">The abandoned subway tunnel branched ahead – a sound coming from its depths, like a wet, rhythmic breathing. Its rusted tracks swallowed by decades of sediment and creeping roots. The air hung thick with the scent of metal.</p><p align="justify">Alice's magic flared brighter, casting long shadows that twisted against the walls. Jen already had two vials in her right hand, her breathing carefully controlled.</p><p align="justify">And Rio?</p><p align="justify">Rio reached for the connection she'd been denying herself. The one that hummed between her and–</p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha</em>.</p><p align="justify">But the thread was silent. Cold.</p><p align="justify">Swallowing hard, Rio let her own magic rise, the green light illuminating the determined set of her jaw. “Then let's make it quick.”</p><p align="justify"><em>This place reeks of old magic</em>. Death murmured, the voice resonating in Rio's bones.</p><p align="justify">The deeper they ventured, the tunnels morphed into something else. The walls became lustrous metal alloys, with no visible seams – as if grown rather than built – and filled with ancient runes. The floor started to have geometric mandalas, that seemed to react to the witches’ steps. And the ceiling – suddenly tall enough to hold 3 floors – was a dome of crystalline glass, painting the starts and celestial pathways. The air seemed to vibrate like a whispering singing bowl, a soothing sound.</p><p align="justify">Rio's breath fogged in the unnatural cold as she stepped over what looked like a collapsed pillar. The witchlight allowing a better look at the carvings in the walls.</p><p align="justify">Alice traced the symbols. “What do they say?”</p><p align="justify">Sharon reached out, her fingers hovering just above the markings. For the first time since they'd met, Rio saw something like reverence in the older witch's face.</p><p align="justify">“Here lies the heart of the flying city.” Sharon translated, her voice hushed. “Break it, and the sky will fall.”</p><p align="justify">"Flying city..." Rio panted, her mouth dry. Death stirred inside her.</p><p align="justify">Sharon's eyes gleamed in the dim light. "The Vimanas."</p><p align="justify">"The what?" Jen snapped.</p><p align="justify">"From a time when witches ruled with more than parlor tricks." Sharon said, running her fingers along the wall carvings. "When magic wasn't just a spark, but a storm."</p><p align="justify">
<em>When the world was unbalanced.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Jen's expression darkened. “You think someone's trying to recreate that kind of power?”</p><p align="justify"><em>They are breaking the seal</em>. Death's voice caused a headache. <em>I sealed the Vimanas with the ley lines for a reason</em>. An image flashed in Rio's mind – a dark winged Death, her skeletal form wreathed in black fire, working the ley lines around the world, bending them to trap the massive structures beneath the earth, their surface etching with dying veins. <em>It seems one lies beneath this city. And if they wake it-</em></p><p align="justify">The others were staring at her. “Rio?” Alice prompted.</p><p align="justify">Rio's hands trembled. “The Vimanas weren't just cities. They were alive. And whatever's left of one...” She pointed around. “It's here.”</p><p align="justify">Sharon looked at her with a devious interest. “How do you know those things, girl?”</p><p align="justify">“Their ruin... it's tied to the ley lines. I can listen.” She lied, hoping to deflect Sharon's suspicion.</p><p align="justify">A low hum vibrated through the stone beneath their feet. The ground trembled, sending loose pebbles skittering across the tracks. Somewhere ahead, something stirred. Rio's magic flared in response to the ley lines' distress, her skin prickling with energy.</p><p align="justify">“So, just to be clear.” Jen said, voice dripping with forced calm and lightness. “We're talking about the actual end of the world.”</p><p align="justify">A pulse of blue light shot through the tunnel, illuminating a circular structure embedded in the far wall. Its metallic surface shimmered like liquid mercury, veins of silver light coursing through it in rhythmic patterns.</p><p align="justify">Jen looked at Rio. “What the hell is that?” The question not quite for <em>her</em>.</p><p align="justify">“The core.” Sharon breathed.</p><p align="justify">Rio's voice was hoarse, after listening to Death and repeating it back to the witches. “It seems the Vimana is just dormant, not dead. The ley lines are being drained to release the seal and wake the city.”</p><p align="justify">Jen's face went pale. “That's why they're killing witches. They need enough power to break the ley lines and jumpstart this thing.”</p><p align="justify"><em>They will break the balance</em>, Death hissed, rising within Rio like a tide of black water. <em>The core must not wake</em>.</p><p align="justify">Sharon grabbed Rio's arm with enough force to send her against the wall. “Your magic… You’re–” As soon as Rio’s fingertips touched the wall, the contact sent a jolt through her entire body.</p><p align="justify">She recoiled, but the connection lingered. The core recognized her magic. Recognized Death within her.</p><p align="justify">The walls convulsed, roots slithering like serpents as five figures materialized from the dark. The five hunters stepped forward, their movements unnervingly synchronized. Their eyes glowed with the same sickly silver as the rings on their fingers – witch-forged shackles, designed to siphon magic.</p><p align="justify">“It’s a trap.” Rio whispered.</p><p align="justify">Too late.</p><p align="justify">Jen reacted first. With a flick of her wrist, she shattered a vial at their feet, releasing a cloud of pink mist. The hunters coughed as the gas seared their lungs – poison meant to weaken magic.</p><p align="justify">Alice didn’t wait. She slammed her palms together, and the tunnel shook. Orange roots erupted from the walls, coiling around two hunters like serpents, crushing their ribs with a sickening crack.</p><p align="justify">One of the men – the taller one – just smiled a wicked smile. He raised his hand, and the roots blackened, withering to dust. “You think we didn’t prepare for earth magic?”</p><p align="justify">Sharon’s lips curled. “Oh, darling. We’re just warming up.”</p><p align="justify">Her crimson magic lashed out like a whip, slicing through the air – but the hunters dodged, their movements too fast, too fluid.</p><p align="justify">Rio dug her fingers into the damp earth, reaching for the ley lines. Green light erupted around her, vines surging from the ground – but the moment they touched the hunters, they rotted.</p><p align="justify">Their silver rings were draining her.</p><p align="justify">Jen hurled another vial – this one exploded into ice shards – but the hunters swatted them aside like gnats.</p><p align="justify">Alice reshaped the stone beneath them, trying to trap their feet – but the runes on their skin flared, dissolving her magic before it could take hold.</p><p align="justify">“You’re wasting your time.” The men said. “The core is already waking.”</p><p align="justify">Behind them, the mercury-like surface of the Vimana’s core pulsed faster, its silver veins throbbing like a heartbeat.</p><p align="justify">Then – the air turned to frost.</p><p align="justify">A women materialized above the core – translucent, shimmering like a mirage. The corrupted vines slithered at her feet like loyal hounds, their thorns glistening with something darker than poison. Her long, silver-streaked hair floated as if underwater, her face ageless and cruel. She wore robes of living shadow, and her eyes – black voids with pinpricks of silver light – locked onto Rio.</p><p align="justify">Her voice, smooth as poisoned honey, echoed through the tunnel:</p><p align="justify">“Death’s newest toy... How predictable.”</p><p align="justify">Sharon’s face went pale, her whole body rigid. “Evanora.” The word came like a whisper.</p><p align="justify"><em>I should‘ve known</em>, Rio heard Death. <em>Agatha's mother. The former leader of the Salem Seven</em>.</p><p align="justify">Sharon's voice was barely audible. “You were dead.”</p><p align="justify">Evanora's laugh was the sound of ice cracking. “I shed that skin years ago.”</p><p align="justify">A snap of her fingers – and the roots struck. One of Sharon's coven members screamed as thorns pierced her throat.</p><p align="justify">Rio lunged without thinking, her green magic slicing through the attacking vines. Sharon hurled spells at Evanora, only for the corrupted witch to wave them away like smoke.</p><p align="justify">“Cute.” Evanora purred. “But you're not the one I want.” Her gaze locked onto Rio. “Little vessel.” She crooned, stepping closer. “You don't remember me, do you?”</p><p align="justify">Rio's throat tightened. She didn't. But Death did.</p><p align="justify">Evanora's smile widened. “Your mother came to me when you were a baby, desperate. She didn't want you burdened with Death's power.” Her fingers twitched, black magic crackling. “I offered to transfer it to my own child. But my daughter...” Her lip curled. “Agatha was too weak. The ritual failed.”</p><p align="justify">The revelation hit Rio like a punch to the gut. What that why Death recognized Agatha?</p><p align="justify">Evanora spread her arms, the corrupted ley lines pulsing in response. “Now I don't need a vessel. I'll reshape the ley lines and drain your power directly into the core.”</p><p align="justify">She raised a spectral hand, and the hunters seized up, their bodies jerking like marionettes.</p><p align="justify">“Enough distractions.” Evanora said.</p><p align="justify">The hunters’ eyes rolled back, their mouths stretching too wide, and then their bodies dissolved into liquid shadow, reforming into monstrous, half-formed beasts – jawless faces, elongated limbs, claws like shattered obsidian.</p><p align="justify">Alice stumbled back. “What the hell?!”</p><p align="justify">Evanora smiled. “Let’s see what Death’s made of you.”</p><p align="justify">The creatures lunged.</p><p align="justify">The first creature slammed into Rio, its obsidian claws raking toward her throat. She barely twisted away, the air whistling as the strike grazed her collarbone. Blood welled, but she didn’t have time to react.</p><p align="justify">Death snarled inside her. <em>Use me</em>.</p><p align="justify">She dug her fingers into the earth, and the ground erupted in blackened green vines, lashing around the beast’s limbs. It screeched, thrashing – but Rio yanked, and the vines pulled it apart in a burst of shadow and rot.</p><p align="justify">One down.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Sharon spun, her magic a whip of blood-red lightning, slicing through two creatures at once. Their forms dissolved into smoke, but the shadows reformed instantly, lunging again.</p><p align="justify">“Persistent little bastards!” She spat, kicking one back before driving a dagger through its skull.</p><p align="justify">Evanora watched, amused. “Still relying on brute force, Sharon? How… uncreative.”</p><p align="justify">Sharon bared her teeth, but before she could retort–</p><p align="justify">A third beast tackled her from behind, its jaws sinking into her shoulder. She roared, crimson energy exploding from her skin, flinging the creature off – but the wound bled.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">A pulse of black energy rippled through the green vines. Rio’s magic <em>screamed</em>. The corruption spread like rot through her vines, turning vibrant green to sickly gray. The backlash sent Rio stumbling, her breath coming in ragged gasps as the decay crept up her arms, burning like acid.</p><p align="justify">“Pathetic.” Evanora sighed. “You don’t even know how to wield what’s inside you.”</p><p align="justify">She flicked her wrist.</p><p align="justify">Black roots speared upward, aiming to impale. Rio barely twisted away, but one caught her thigh, slicing deep. Blood soaked her pants instantly, the pain white-hot. She gritted her teeth, forcing her magic to respond – but the corruption was already in her veins, sluggish and heavy.</p><p align="justify">Evanora advanced, her steps unhurried. "Your mother begged me to take Death from you." she murmured. "She feared what you’d become. She wasted your potential."</p><p align="justify">Rio snarled, slashing her hand through the air. A surge of green fire erupted – not just vines this time, but thorns like daggers, aimed straight for Evanora’s heart.</p><p align="justify">The older witch didn’t flinch.</p><p align="justify">She caught the attack midair, black tendrils unraveling Rio’s magic like thread from a spool. “Cute.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Alice slammed her palms together, and the tunnel walls ruptured, stone spikes impaling two creatures – but they kept coming, their bodies reforming like liquid night.</p><p align="justify">Jen hurled a vial, and the glass shattered against one’s face, releasing a burst of fire. The creature writhed, its form bubbling away – but three more took its place.</p><p align="justify">“They don’t stay dead!” Jen yelled, ducking a swipe of claws.</p><p align="justify">Alice grabbed Jen’s arm, yanking her behind a golden barrier just as another beast slammed into it. The shield cracked.</p><p align="justify">"Rio!" Alice shouted. "We need–"</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Then Evanora struck back.</p><p align="justify">A fist of compressed darkness slammed into Rio’s chest, lifting her off her feet. She hit the tunnel wall hard, the impact driving the breath from her lungs. Before she could recover, the roots were on her again – coiling around her arms, her throat, squeezing.</p><p align="justify">"Let me show you how real witches fight."</p><p align="justify">Evanora’s magic wasn’t just power. It was <em>hunger</em>. It gnawed at Rio’s defenses, devouring her light, leaving only cold behind.</p><p align="justify">Rio gasped, her vision spotting. Somewhere distant, she heard Alice screaming her name, heard Sharon’s coven fighting – but it all faded beneath the roar of blood in her ears.</p><p align="justify">Then–</p><p align="justify">A whisper. Not her own.</p><p align="justify"><em>Enough</em>.</p><p align="justify">Death uncoiled inside her like an ocean engulfing land. The roots holding Rio <em>screamed</em> as black fire erupted from her skin.</p><p align="justify">Evanora’s eyes widened – just for a fraction of a second – before Rio was on her.</p><p align="justify">This time, the vines she summoned weren’t green. They were black.</p><p align="justify">“There you are.” she breathed, almost reverent.</p><p align="justify">Evanora moved liquid shadow, her magic a storm of thorns and teeth. Rio met her blow for blow, Death’s power singing in her veins. The tunnel trembled around them, stones shaking loose from the ceiling as their magics clashed.</p><p align="justify">But Rio was still untrained. Still human.</p><p align="justify">With a split-second delay from Rio, Evanora struck like a cobra.</p><p align="justify">Her hand closed around Rio’s throat, slamming her into the ground. The impact cracked stone. Black vines pinned Rio’s limbs, their thorns biting deep.</p><p align="justify">"You’re strong." Evanora admitted, leaning close. "But not strong enough."</p><p align="justify">She raised her free hand, black energy coalescing into a blade aimed straight for Rio’s heart–</p><p align="justify">A purple bolt of lightning struck Evanora, knocking her off Rio with enough force to send them both skidding across the floor. The spectral witch shrieked, her form flickering like a dying candle.</p><p align="justify"><em>Agatha</em>.</p><p align="justify">She landed in a crouch, knives flashing, severing the vines threatening Rio. Her chest heaved, her knives dripping with violet power. She didn't speak. Didn't even look at Rio. But she was here.</p><p align="justify">Despite everything.</p><p align="justify">“I should’ve known it was you.” Agatha said, her voice low and raw. “The way the ley lines were being drained, the fucking silver rings…” Her breath hitched. “You always did like playing with puppets.”</p><p align="justify">Evanora’s smile twisted, already on her feet. “Ah, there’s my disappointing heir – always slow to see the strings.”</p><p align="justify">Rio’s stomach dropped. Agatha <em>knew</em>. Not just now – she’d suspected all along. That’s why she’d been so desperate to stop them from coming here.</p><p align="justify">And she’d come anyway.</p><p align="justify">Agatha's jaw tightened. “You're just a projection.”</p><p align="justify">Evanora laughed. “Enough to handle you and your... emotional magic.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha moved like vengeance given form, her knives flashing faster than the eye could follow. Every strike was precise, brutal – aimed not to wound, but to <em>destroy</em>.</p><p align="justify">Evanora met her with equal ferocity, her magic twisting into razor-edged whips.</p><p align="justify">Rio forced herself up, her body screaming in protest. She could feel Death’s power still humming beneath her skin, but it was fading – the toll too great.</p><p align="justify">“We need to fall back!” Sharon barked, dragging a wounded coven member toward the exit. “She's drawing power from the lines. It’s eating our power too!”</p><p align="justify">Rio looked around her. Alice and Jen were in bad shape. Sharon was worn out too. And Agatha was dissolving into a storm of violet and black with Evanora.</p><p align="justify">If she could just use one last bit of her power–</p><p align="justify">A scream tore Rio’s ears. And she looked up.</p><p align="justify">A spear of corrupted ley line impaling Agatha’s side.</p><p align="justify">Rio's vision went white.</p><p align="justify">Her magic erupted – green threaded with black fire. The vines that lashed out didn't entangle – they eviscerated, unraveling Evanora's projection and her beasts into nothingness.</p><p align="justify">And a silence evaded the chamber.</p><p align="justify">Then–</p><p align="justify">They heard slow – <em>mocking</em> – claps. “Impressive. But you’re still just a child playing with a god’s power.” Evanora’s voice echoed the walls. “The Vimana is unleashed. Now I just need your power to feed it.”</p><p align="justify">She was ignoring Evanora’s warning as she reached Agatha, hands already pressing against the wound. Green light flickered weakly beneath her fingers. “I've got you.”</p><p align="justify">Jen appeared beside them, face grim. “We have to go.”</p><p align="justify">Rio hauled Agatha up, ignoring her pained grunt, and half-carried her toward the exit, with Alice on the other side. Behind them, Evanora's laughter echoed through the tunnels.</p><p align="justify">“We'll meet again, little vessel.”</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">The air outside the tunnels tasted like rain. Rio collapsed onto the damp pavement, Agatha’s weight dragging her down with her. The others weren’t much better – Jen was already digging through her bag for salves and bandages. The Salem Seven members who had survived were scattered, some bent double, others staring blankly into the distance.</p><p align="justify">Rio’s magic was spent. Hollow. The black fire that had surged through her veins was gone, leaving only exhaustion and the dull, throbbing ache of wounds she hadn’t fully felt in the heat of battle.</p><p align="justify">Agatha coughed, a fleck of blood painting her cracked lips. “You reckless, suicidal idiot.” She hissed, the anger in her voice undercut by how her fingers dug into Rio's sleeve. Not just fury there – <em>fear</em>. The realization made Rio's chest tighten.</p><p align="justify">Jen dropped to her knees beside them, uncorking a vial with her teeth. The liquid inside shimmered silver-blue. "Drink." She ordered, pressing it into Agatha's palm. "Before you bleed out on my shoes."</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s fingers trembled around the vial, but she downed it without protesting. Almost immediately, the wound in her side began to close, the flesh stitching itself back together – not quite fully, but enough to stop the bleeding. She hissed through her teeth, her free hand gripping Rio’s wrist hard enough to bruise.</p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t pull away. The pain grounded her.</p><p align="justify">Sharon stood apart from them, her face ashen. She wasn’t tending to wounds. Wasn’t barking orders. She was just <em>staring</em>. At the ground. At her hands. At nothing.</p><p align="justify">Alice frowned, stepping toward her. “Sharon?”</p><p align="justify">Sharon didn’t look up. “We can’t fight her.” The words landed like a stone in still water.</p><p align="justify">Rio’s head snapped up. “What?”</p><p align="justify">Sharon’s voice was hollow. “Evanora was the Leader of the Salem Seven. She wasn’t just powerful – she was perfect.” Agatha winced at those words. “And now she’s <em>more</em> than that.” Her fingers curled into fists. “We can’t win.”</p><p align="justify">Rio pushed herself up, ignoring the way her body protested. “She’s waking a Vimana. If we don’t stop her–”</p><p align="justify">“Then the world ends?” Sharon laughed, bitter. “Maybe it should – maybe we should let her rebuild the world so we don't have to keep hiding in shadows like rats!!”</p><p align="justify">Silence.</p><p align="justify">Alice stepped closer, her voice low. “Sharon. Look at me.”</p><p align="justify">Sharon did. And for the first time, Rio saw it – not just fear, but something worse. Defeat.</p><p align="justify">“She was my teacher.” Sharon whispered. “Before she <em>changed</em>. I saw what she could do <em>then</em>. And now?” She shook her head. “We’re not enough.”</p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard. She wanted to argue. She wanted to rage. But the truth was, she’d felt Evanora’s power too. The way it had <em>eaten</em> at her magic. The way it had laughed at their efforts.</p><p align="justify">Agatha shifted with a pained grunt, her free hand pressing against her half-healed wound. “Then stay behind.” she spat. “I'm killing that bitch with or without you.”</p><p align="justify">Rio met Agatha's fierce blue eyes – truly met them – for the first time since the tunnels. There was a lot of anger there, a lot of blame and a sense of betrayal. And beneath it all, an exhaustion so deep it seemed to seep from her pores.</p><p align="justify">Rio took a slow breath. “We don’t have a choice.”</p><p align="justify">Sharon studied them for a long moment, her expression unreadable. Then, with the careful precision of a surgeon making the final cut: "Then I hope you win. I truly do."</p><p align="justify">She turned on her heel, the click of her boots against pavement echoing like gunshots as she gathered her coven and walked away without looking back.</p><p align="justify">Jen wiped her bloody hands on her ruined pants. "So. Just to recap - world-ending flying city, megalomaniacal witch-goddess, and..." She gestured to their battered trio. "Us. Against all that."</p><p align="justify">A grim smile tugged at Rio's lips. "Sounds about right."</p><p align="justify">And Death's voice, darker than ever, coiled through her mind: <em>She’s at the Lynn Woods Reservation. She’s inviting us</em>.</p><p align="justify">Rio looked north, in the direction of the Reservation. She could feel the pulse of ley lines crying there.</p><p align="justify">They would need to rest first. But soon, she would go face Evanora again. Face her corruption, her power, her hunger.</p><p align="justify">And Rio would let Death do what Death did best.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="justify">The walk to Lilia's mill house stretched into eternity. Every step sent fresh waves of pain through Rio's battered body as she supported Agatha's weight, the other witch's breathing ragged against her neck. The streets of New Salem lay deserted, their footsteps echoing off the cobblestones. Jen and Alice moved ahead, their wary eyes scanning every alleyway, every darkened window – as if Evanora's hunters might materialize from the mist itself.</p><p align="justify">The streaks of moonlight were peeping through the clouds when they finally reached the wrought-iron gate. The protective wards hummed to life as they passed through, the magic prickling against Rio's skin like static electricity. She barely had time to register the relief before the house door flew open.</p><p align="justify">Lilia stood silhouetted in the doorway, her silver-streaked braid coming undone, brown eyes flashing in the moonlight. “Billy!” she called over her shoulder, her voice sharp with urgency before her gaze swept over their battered forms. Her nostrils flared. “You smell like blood and bad decisions.”</p><p align="justify">Jen collapsed onto the hallway bench with a groan, her fingers leaving smears of soot and dried blood on the polished wood. “You say that like they're unrelated.” The attempt at humor fell flat, her usual smirk nowhere to be found despite the illusion of safety the house provided.</p><p align="justify">The footsteps announced Billy's arrival as he came barreling down the stairs. His usual easy grin vanished when he saw Agatha's blood-soaked shirt clinging to her torso. “Holy shi–"</p><p align="justify">“Language!” Lilia chimed automatically, already herding them toward the kitchen. The scent of drying herbs and antiseptic grew stronger as they entered. “Sit. Before you ruin my floors any further or pass out where you stand.”</p><p align="justify">Rio guided Agatha onto a stool, their fingers brushing for a moment too long – a silent question in the contact. Agatha jerked away with a hiss of pain, the sudden movement causing fresh blood to bloom across her makeshift bandages like crimson flowers.</p><p align="justify">“Stubborn ass.” Jen muttered, rummaging through cabinets with shaking hands. “There's a medical kit under the sink.” She tossed Rio a meaningful look. “The good one with a suture kit.”</p><p align="justify">Rio moved to retrieve it, her muscles protesting every motion. But when she turned back, kit in hand, Agatha snatched it from her grasp with surprising speed.</p><p align="justify">“I don't need–" Agatha began, her voice tight.</p><p align="justify">"You're bleeding through your fucking shirt!" Rio's voice cracked like a whip, the words echoing off the copper pots hanging from the ceiling. The kitchen fell silent.</p><p align="justify">Rio took a steadying breath, lowering her voice to something raw and vulnerable. “Please, Agatha–"</p><p align="justify">"Don't." Agatha's voice was a blade wrapped in velvet, her knuckles white around the medical kit. "Just... don't."</p><p align="justify">The air between them thickened with everything unsaid. Rio clenched her jaw until her teeth ached. "We can't just pretend nothing happened down there."</p><p align="justify">Agatha whirled on her, rising from the stool with unnatural grace despite her injuries. "What exactly do you want me to say?" Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "That I should've let you die in those tunnels? That I should've–" Her words caught, the tendons in her neck standing out as she swallowed hard.</p><p align="justify">Rio stepped closer, ignoring the way her own wounds protested. "You should've trusted me enough to tell me the truth."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's laugh was a sharp, broken thing. "Trust? You followed Sharon straight into a trap after I begged you not to. After I–"</p><p align="justify">"Because witches were being taken!" Rio's voice broke. "Because your mother–"</p><p align="justify">"Don't call her that!" Agatha's shout sent a tremor through the hanging herbs above them. Her chest heaved, the medical kit creaking in her grip. When she spoke again, her voice was glacial. "You think I haven't spent years waking up screaming because I wasn't certain Wanda and I had truly killed her? You think I didn't know it was her work the moment Sharon came to us with her pretty lies?" Her dark eyes burned. "Why do you think I fought so hard to keep you from going down there?"</p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled slowly, the weight of Agatha's words settling in her bones. "I don't fucking know, Agatha. Because you never share anything unless it's ripped from you!" She dragged a hand through her tangled hair, trying to steady herself. "You could have told us. You just chose not to."</p><p align="justify">Agatha's face was a mask of carefully controlled fury, but her hands betrayed her, trembling around the medical kit. "All I had were suspicions. And when I asked—no, when I begged you not to follow Sharon, you turned your back on me." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Would it have made a difference if I'd said that woman was behind it? Would you have listened then? Or would you still have charged straight into her trap?"</p><p align="justify">The words hit like a physical blow. Rio took an involuntary step back, her shoulder blades hitting the cold pantry door. "That's not the point."</p><p align="justify">"Then what is?" Agatha's laugh was bitter as wormwood. "You nearly died tonight. Again. And for what?" She stepped closer, her breath warm against Rio's cheek as she lowered her voice. "Now she's seen you. Now she's ready for us. And now she knows–" Agatha cut herself off abruptly, her gaze flicking to where Lilia stood frozen in the doorway.</p><p align="justify">With a final, inscrutable look at Rio, Agatha turned on her heel, medical kit clutched to her chest like armor, and disappeared up the creaking stairs.</p><p align="justify">Rio took half a step to follow, but Lilia's weathered hand caught her wrist. "Let her breathe, child." The older witch murmured, her grip surprisingly strong. "That wasn't anger you saw. That was fear wearing anger's clothes."</p><p align="justify">The truth of it settled in Rio's chest like a stone. She sagged against the doorframe, suddenly aware of every cut, every bruise, every ounce of magic drained from her body. Through the kitchen window, the dawn light painted the millhouse walls in shades of gold and blood-red, the new day dawning whether they were ready for it or not.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio <em>fully</em> intended to listen to Lilia. She <em>fully</em> intended to march straight to her own room and finally, <em>finally</em> get some sleep – especially now that the others had done the same. The night had been long, the battle brutal, and exhaustion clung to her bones like a second skin.</p><p align="justify">Yet here she was.</p><p align="justify">Standing in front of Agatha’s bedroom door.</p><p align="justify">She couldn’t explain it – not to Lilia, not to herself. Maybe it was the way Agatha had stormed off earlier, jaw clenched, movements stiff with pain she refused to acknowledge. Maybe it was the lingering dread in Rio’s chest, the memory of Evanora’s attack replaying behind her eyelids every time she blinked. Or maybe it was just that Agatha had always been a gravitational force to her, pulling her in even when she tried to resist.</p><p align="justify">Whatever the reason, Rio knocked.</p><p align="justify">No answer.</p><p align="justify">She frowned. Light seeped from beneath the door – Agatha <em>was</em> still awake. She knocked again, sharper this time.</p><p align="justify">A pause. Then a cranky, muffled “What?”</p><p align="justify">Rio pushed the door open.</p><p align="justify">The room was empty.</p><p align="justify">Her pulse spiked for half a second before she noticed the faint clatter of metal against ceramic from the adjoining bathroom. A hissed “<em>shit</em>” followed by the unmistakable sound of something hitting the floor.</p><p align="justify">Rio crossed the room in three strides and leaned against the bathroom doorframe, arms folded.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stood at the sink, shirtless, her reflection pale in the mirror. A half-opened medical kit lay strewn across the counter, gauze and antiseptic scattered haphazardly. Blood smeared her side, the wound still sluggishly weeping crimson.</p><p align="justify">Their eyes met in the mirror.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s expression was raw – exhaustion, frustration, and something else. Her breath left her in a sharp exhale, shoulders tensing as if bracing for a fight.</p><p align="justify">For a long moment, neither spoke.</p><p align="justify">Then– “You were right.” Agatha said with a rough voice.</p><p align="justify">Rio arched a brow, a smirk tugging at her lips despite herself. “About which part?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha rolled her eyes – of course Rio would drag this. “All of it.” She slammed the medical kit down with a thud. “I was being stubborn. And I shouldn’t have shut you out.”</p><p align="justify">Rio studied her, the defiance in Agatha’s posture warring with the vulnerability in her eyes. She sighed, the fight draining out of her. “I should apologize too.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha opened her mouth to protest something like ‘<em>I wasn’t apologizing</em>’, but Rio cut her off.</p><p align="justify">“You scared me.” The admission was quiet, almost fragile. “When I saw her attack you–” Her voice cracked. She swallowed hard, jaw tightening.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s chest twisted. She hadn’t considered how it must have looked – Evanora’s corrupted magic spearing through her, the blood, the way her knees had buckled. The way Rio’s scream had torn through the air like a blade.</p><p align="justify">Rio’s gaze dropped to the wound, stark against Agatha’s skin. “You’re still bleeding.”</p><p align="justify">“Yeah, well.” Agatha grimaced. “Turns out I’m not great at first aid when I’m pissed off.”</p><p align="justify">Rio let out a dry laugh. “Let me at least put my medical degree to good use.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha hesitated – then relented, bracing herself against the counter with a stifled groan. Rio stepped closer – so close the heat of her body was a tangible thing between them. Her hands were steady as she cleaned the wound, her magic – returned, it seemed – flickering faintly at her fingertips, soothing.</p><p align="justify">Agatha watched her, the tension between them slowly unraveling.</p><p align="justify">“You’re not fragile.” She said suddenly, eyes fixed on Rio’s careful movements.</p><p align="justify">Rio paused. “What?”</p><p align="justify">“That’s why I didn’t tell you everything. Not because I thought you couldn’t handle it.” Agatha swallowed. “Because the more you know, the more danger you’re in. And I–” </p><p align="justify">
<em>And I’m terrified of losing you.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Rio’s expression softened. “You don’t get to make that choice for me.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha huffed. “Yeah. I’m starting to get that.”</p><p align="justify">Rio finished suturing the wound with practiced ease. “Next time, just talk to me.”</p><p align="justify">“Next time.” Agatha agreed, nodding like a solemn child.</p><p align="justify">A beat of silence. Then Rio smirked. “You’re still an idiot, though.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha rolled her eyes. “And you’re still insufferable.”</p><p align="justify">Rio laughed, and just like that, the weight between them lifted. She reached for a bandage, her fingers brushing Agatha’s skin, lingering there.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s breath hitched. “Why is your magic so addictive?” The question was a whisper, almost reluctant.</p><p align="justify">Rio stilled, considering. “Maybe it has something to do with the ritual. When we were babies, and Evanora tried to take Death from me and bind it to you.” She smoothed the bandage into place, her touch featherlight.</p><p align="justify">Agatha stiffened. “Right. I almost forgot about that.” Her voice was bitter. “Though she never let me forget. Made sure to remind me every other week how useless I was for failing.”</p><p align="justify">Rio’s heart ached.</p><p align="justify">She was close – so close – to Agatha now. Close enough to see the faint scars tracing her torso, the way her muscles tensed under Rio’s touch.</p><p align="justify">“Is that where these come from?” Rio traced a jagged line, her thumb brushing over raised skin.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s face darkened. “Yeah.” She exhaled sharply, then – almost unconsciously – leaned forward, resting her forehead against Rio’s shoulder.</p><p align="justify">They stayed like that for a long moment, breathing in sync, the world outside the bathroom door fading into irrelevance.</p><p align="justify">“Seriously, stop that thing with your magic.” Agatha muttered, her voice rough.</p><p align="justify">“I’m really not doing anything.” Rio’s fingers curled against Agatha’s torso, her heart rate faster. “You’re the one with the siphon power, not me.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha laughed, the sound warm against Rio’s collarbone, sending a shiver down her spine. Rio felt her own temperature rising, her pulse thrumming. She wanted to blame Death on it, but the entity was still beneath her skin. <em>Fuck</em>…</p><p align="justify">Before she could think, her hands slid to Agatha’s waist, fingers splayed, pulling her closer.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s breath caught. Her hands tightened on Rio’s arms, anchoring her in place. “Rio…” Her voice trembled, raw with a vulnerability that made Rio’s chest ache.</p><p align="justify">But Agatha kissed her first – soft, tentative, as if she was afraid Rio might pull away. And then Rio’s hands were on her back, and the kiss deepened, fierce and desperate.</p><p align="justify">Rio carefully lifted Agatha into the counter, placing herself in between the other woman’s legs. One hand moved to Agatha’s hair as she pressed her tongue to open Agatha’s mouth. She let a moan escape her lips when she felt Agatha’s hand cup her ass to pull her hips closer.</p><p align="justify">When they finally broke apart, Agatha’s cheeks were flushed, her pupils dilated. “Bed.” She said against Rio’s lips, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p align="justify">Rio bit her lip as she grinned like an idiot. “Are you sure this time is not about our cover being blown?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s eyes flew open. “Oh my god, is that why you were so pissed these days?”</p><p align="justify">Rio pretended it wasn’t, letting a quite “no”. But then she hesitated, her gaze searching for Agatha’s. “Are you sure?” Her voice husked with concern. “You’re hurt.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha shook her head, a small smile playing on her lips. “I’m not that hurt. Besides, you’re the one who started manhandling me.” Rio was bright red. “Think you can do all the work for me?”</p><p align="justify">Rio bit her lips – she was doomed as much as she was gay.</p><p align="justify">But that was all the confirmation Rio wanted. Carefully, she helped the other woman to her feet, and with Agatha’s hand on hers, she walked them to the bed. She made her seat on the edge of the bed. She took off her shirt and her pants fast, as she looked into those hungry blue eyes. She was going for her underwear next when she heard Agatha protest, trying not to sound too desperate: “Slower.”</p><p align="justify">Rio chuckled. “No, Agatha, you don’t get to boss me or teach me in this department. If you want your way, next time, when you’re strong enough to undress me yourself, I’ll consider complying.” And she removed the remaining pieces of clothing, as she heard Agatha’s low laugh.</p><p align="justify">And fully naked she straddled Agatha, cupping her face to taste those lips again. But Rio pulled back one last time. “Are you sure about this?”</p><p align="justify">“Well, don’t stop now…” Agatha was almost out of breath already.</p><p align="justify">Rio turned serious. “Because it’s not just me you’re getting.” She hesitated. “You understand that?”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hands drifted to Rio’s back, her blue eyes locked on Rio’s. “Yes, I understand I’m getting in bed with Death… as well.” Then her thumbs and index finger were quick on Rio’s nipples. “Don’t worry, I have experience with two women at once.” And Agatha shot a devilish smile and a wink.</p><p align="justify">A breathless, involuntary “<em>fuck</em>” escaped Rio’s lips at both the answer and the way Agatha was toying with her right breast. She quickly moved her free hand to Agatha’s neck, into a searing kiss.</p><p align="justify">Kissing turned to biting, to a wet mashing of desperate tongues. Agatha leaned into Rio, forcing her to bend backwards, so that she could place her mouth, teeth, and tongue on Rio’s other breast, licking and sucking and biting. Agatha’s slender fingers glide over Rio’s bare leg all the way up to where the heat was irradiating from, and Rio could only tug at that gorgeous, disheveled hair.</p><p align="justify">Rio hitched a breath and stifle a moan when she felt Agatha swept her middle finger over her folds and inside her – no resistance – setting up a slow pace.</p><p align="justify">“Start with two.” Rio managed to say – and she felt Agatha smile into her nipple.</p><p align="justify">“Are you going to be bossy?” Agatha’s voice was playful.</p><p align="justify">“Did you think otherwise or is that a request?” Rio quipped.</p><p align="justify">Agatha wanted to protest – this woman always had answers ready for her – but when Rio began to move on top of her, fucking herself on her fingers, head tilting back and grip harder on her hair, Agatha forgot how to think altogether.</p><p align="justify">After a while, soft noises of panting and moans filled the room, and Agatha could feel how Rio was starting to tense up around her fingers.</p><p align="justify">“I can’t wait to taste you, Rio.” And Agatha added a third finger, as her thumb was now over Rio’s clit. “I bet you taste so <em>fucking good</em>.” And soon after, Rio’s muscles were contracting around her, in subtle waves and whimpers.</p><p align="justify">As Rio regained her breath, Agatha couldn’t help to be mesmerized at her rosy face, fully undone in her arms, and her chest wavering up and down – and to be a little proud that this time Rio didn’t had an answer.</p><p align="justify">After a few seconds, Rio looked at her with an almost predatory look in her eyes – so deep, Agatha wondered if this was Rio or Death. But she had meant what she said earlier, she could take both.</p><p align="justify">Rio’s touch was deliberate, reverent, as she helped Agatha settle onto the bed – first easing the straps of her bra down her shoulders, then unhooking it with practiced fingers, letting the garment slip away. The cool air brushed against Agatha’s bare skin, raising goosebumps, but Rio’s warmth followed soon after, her hands smoothing over Agatha’s sides.</p><p align="justify">She took her time with the pants, unbuttoning them slowly, teasingly, her knuckles grazing the sensitive skin beneath Agatha’s navel before peeling both the fabric and her underwear down in one fluid motion. The clothes pooled on the floor, as Rio’s gaze traced the lines of Agatha’s body – every scar, every curve, every place that made her breath hitch when touched just right.</p><p align="justify">Then Rio leaned in, capturing Agatha’s lips in a deep, hungry kiss, swallowing the soft gasp that escaped her. Her hands mapped Agatha’s torso with worshipful attention, skimming up her ribs, brushing the undersides of her breasts, teasing her nipples into stiff peaks before moving lower. Her mouth followed the same path – lips trailing fire down Agatha’s neck, pausing to suck lightly at the hollow of her throat, then lower still, tracing the curve of her chest, the dip of her abdomen. She hesitated just above the wound, before pressing a featherlight kiss next to it.</p><p align="justify">The inside of Agatha’s thighs trembled beneath Rio’s touch, her skin already flushed, already slick. By the time Rio’s tongue finally flicked against her clit, Agatha was arching off the bed, her breath coming in ragged gasps, her fingers tangled in the sheets.</p><p align="justify">Rio took her time, savoring her, licking into her with slow, deliberate strokes before adding a finger, then another, curling them just so, her mouth never leaving her. The pleasure built in waves, each one higher than the last, until Agatha’s vision blurred at the edges, her thoughts scattering.</p><p align="justify">“Rio” Her voice was raw, strained. “Don’t be soft.”</p><p align="justify">Rio paused – just for a heartbeat – her fingers still working inside Agatha, her lips still pressed to her clit. She lifted her head, studying Agatha’s face – the flush staining her cheeks, the sheen of sweat on her skin, the way her arm was thrown over her eyes as if she couldn’t bear to be seen like this. Vulnerable. Undone.</p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry, Agatha,” Rio murmured, her own voice rough with desire. “I don’t think you’ve known soft in your life.” She saw the way Agatha’s breath hitched, the way her throat worked around a swallowed sob. Rio shifted, pressing a kiss to her neck, her fingers still moving, still coaxing her higher. “That’s all I’m going to be now.”</p><p align="justify">Gently, she pulled Agatha’s arm away from her face, needing to see her, needing her to know she was safe here, in this moment, in Rio’s hands. Agatha’s eyes were wet, her lashes clumped together, her lips parted around shaky breaths. Rio kissed her again, swallowing the whimper that rose in her throat as she added a thumb to her clit, circling just right, just enough to make her back arch off the bed.</p><p align="justify">“Agatha…” Rio breathed against her lips, her own body aching with need. “You’re so beautiful. God, and you feel so good.”</p><p align="justify">She could feel the way Agatha clenched around her fingers, the way her hips jerked helplessly against her hand. Rio groaned, pressing her forehead to Agatha’s, their breaths mingling.</p><p align="justify">“I love how you taste,” she murmured, kissing her again, letting Agatha taste herself on her tongue. “And how you feel inside – so tight and so perfect around my fingers.” Another kiss, deeper this time, hungrier. A wicked smile curved Rio’s lips as she pulled back just enough to whisper, “And I know I’m gonna love the way you feel around my strap, too.”</p><p align="justify">“Shit–”</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s curse dissolved into a moan as Rio’s fingers crooked inside her, her thumb pressing harder and faster – and just the small tease of green magic – until the world shattered around her, until she was gasping Rio’s name like a prayer, her body trembling with the force of it.</p><p align="justify">And then Agatha caught her breath.</p><p align="justify">For a long moment, they stayed like that – Rio’s body draped over Agatha’s, her hand still between her thighs, her lips brushing lazy, sated kisses along her collarbones and her lips. The room was quiet except for their breathing, the air thick with the scent of sweat and sex and magic.</p><p align="justify">Rio was ready to drift off, exhaustion tugging at her limbs, the weight of the day finally catching up to her.</p><p align="justify">But then Agatha shifted beneath her, her voice low, rough with lingering desire: “I still want to taste you.”</p><p align="justify">And just like that, Rio felt like she had three coffees in one seat. She didn’t hesitate – just kissed Agatha again, deep and filthy, before moving up, straddling her face, her thighs trembling as she lowered herself onto Agatha’s waiting tongue.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio woke, the space beside her was empty – Agatha was already out. But she had left a cup of coffee, still steaming faintly, sat on the bedside table. Rio reached for it, wrapping her fingers around the warmth – an anchor to the quiet peace of the morning. She took a slow sip, before rising and stretching. The house was quiet, but not silent – the distant murmur of voices and the clink of cutlery told her the others were already gathered for breakfast.</p><p align="justify">She made her way to the breakfast room. Agatha was there, seated between Lilia and Billy, the three of them sharing plates of buttered toast and scrambled eggs. The sight of them – safe and unharmed – made something in Rio’s chest loosen.</p><p align="justify">Agatha glanced up as she entered, her lips curving into a soft smile. “Morning.” She said. “I was just about to get more eggs ready. Hungry?”</p><p align="justify">Rio shook her head, though she returned the smile. “Not yet. I think I’ll grab another coffee first – take it outside while the sun’s still good.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha just nodded as she moved to the kitchen counter.</p><p align="justify">Rio poured herself a second cup and stepped out onto the garden, the (still) morning air crisp against her skin. She closed her eyes, tilting her face toward the light, letting it warm her. For a moment, she could almost pretend that this was enough – that the world was just this house, this quiet, these people.</p><p align="justify">Then Death spoke.</p><p align="justify">Its voice was neither kind nor cruel, only inevitable: <em>Rio, the next step will be to defeat Evanora. But there is something else.</em></p><p align="justify">A cold weight settled in her stomach. She already knew. She had felt it in the way the earth trembled beneath her feet, in the way magic flickered like a dying flame.</p><p align="justify"><em>The ley lines are damaged beyond ordinary repair.</em> Death continued. <em>They are living things, and they require life in return. Evanora’s soul is too corrupted to sustain them. This has happened before. And when it has, my vessels have always been the ones to restore the balance. A pause. Then, softly: You know what this means, Rio.</em></p><p align="justify">Rio’s fingers tightened around her coffee cup. The heat against her palms felt distant now, unimportant. She swallowed hard, her throat tight.</p><p align="justify">
<em>I promise you won’t suffer.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Rio waited ten heartbeats. Tears spilled over, trailing down her cheeks. She didn’t wipe them away.</p><p align="justify">"Can you do me a favor?" She asked, her voice rough. "When you’re reborn… into a new vessel… please find Agatha. And make sure she alright."</p>

<p align="justify">The air in Lynn Woods hung thick with unstable energy, every breath tasting of burnt magic and rotting earth. The clearing pulsed with an unnatural rhythm, the twisted ley lines beneath their feet glowing a sickly silver that made Rio's bones ache. Between those corrupted veins, the Vimana's power flickered – even if they were miles away from its core.</p><p align="justify">The trees stood as grotesque sentinels – bark blackened, their leaves long since withered to dust. Rio could feel nature's silent scream beneath her boots, the earth itself trembling under Evanora's corruption. And beneath her skin, Death stirred like a great beast awakening from slumber.</p><p align="justify">Agatha moved to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with her, her knuckles white around her knives. Every muscle in her body was coiled tight, her usual predatory grace replaced by something far more dangerous – something <em>feral</em>. Raw, unchecked emotion burned in her eyes, and for the first time, Rio saw the girl who had survived Evanora's cruelty. The girl who had been forged in fire and never let herself forget it.</p><p align="justify">And Rio’s heart ached.</p><p align="justify">Jen and Alice flanked them, their exhaustion barely hidden behind masks of determination. Jen's fingers twitched near her satchel of vials, her usual smirk absent. Alice's hands, usually steady as stone, trembled faintly as she clenched them into fists of yellow power.</p><p align="justify">And then there was Lilia.</p><p align="justify">The old witch stepped forward with the weight of centuries in her stride, her golden serpent pendant gleaming against the dark. She didn't raise her voice. She didn't need to.</p><p align="justify">“Last chance, Evanora.” The words were quiet and final. “Stop this madness.”</p><p align="justify">Evanora's laughter slithered through the clearing, the sound like nails dragging over glass.</p><p align="justify">“<em>You</em>'re giving <em>me</em> a chance?” Her spectral form flickered, solidifying into something more terrible and real. Shadows coiled around her like living things. “Age has made you sentimental, Lilia. Or just slow.”</p><p align="justify">The air between them crackled.</p><p align="justify">Somewhere in the distance, a branch snapped.</p><p align="justify">Lilia struck first.</p><p align="justify">Her golden magic lashed out like a whip, carving through the corrupted air with a sound like shattering glass. Evanora barely moved – just tilted her head, letting the blast sear past her cheek. Her mocking smile not leaving her face.</p><p align="justify">Jen flew three viles in rapid succession. The first exploded into a cloud of pink mist, the second into a hail of ice, the third a liquid fire that burned violet instead of orange.</p><p align="justify">Evanora barely flinched. She flicked her wrist and the attacks reversed midair, hurtling back toward Jen–</p><p align="justify">Alice slammed her palms together. A wall of yellow magic erupted, intercepting the projectiles in a shower of sparks and steam.</p><p align="justify">Agatha was already moving.</p><p align="justify">She blurred across the clearing, knives carving arcs of violet lightning. Evanora parried with claws of blackened energy, each clash sending shockwaves through the ground.</p><p align="justify">Rio saw her opening. She slammed her palms together, then spread them wide. The earth beneath Evanora's feet turned to liquid quicksand, dragging her down. At the same time, thick green vines erupted from the ground, wrapping around Evanora's limbs.</p><p align="justify">"Now!" Rio shouted.</p><p align="justify">Lilia's eyes glowed as she chanted in a language older than Salem. The air shimmered as massive spectral serpents materialized, their fangs dripping venom as they struck at Evanora from all sides.</p><p align="justify">For brief seconds, all was quiet.</p><p align="justify">“Is that all you’ve got?”</p><p align="justify">With a roar that shook the trees, Evanora exploded outward. Black energy pulsed from her body, disintegrating the vines, vaporizing the serpents, and sending Jen flying backward into Alice.</p><p align="justify">"You insects dare challenge me with just that?" Evanora's form grew, her shadow stretching across the clearing as she drew more power from the ley lines. The ground split beneath her, tendrils of darkness lashing out like whips.</p><p align="justify">Agatha barely dodged, rolling to the side as one sliced through the air where she had been standing. Jen scrambled to her feet, pulling another vial from her satchel – but Evanora was faster. A bolt of corrupted energy hurled Jen into a tree with a sickening crack. Alice screamed, unleashing a torrent of yellow energy, but Evanora swatted it aside like an afterthought.</p><p align="justify">Rio's chest heaved. She could feel Death stirring inside her, clawing at her ribs, demanding release.</p><p align="justify">Agatha moved like a shadow, her twin knives carving arcs of violet fire through the corrupted air. She feinted left – a flicker of movement – then twisted right, her body a blur of lethal grace. Evanora’s claws of blackened energy lashed out, but Agatha was already gone, reappearing behind the witch in the space between heartbeats. Her blade found its mark, slicing across Evanora’s back with a hiss of searing magic. The wound sizzled, tendrils of purple energy burrowing into the spectral flesh like venom.</p><p align="justify">Rio felt Death stir within her – the great beast starting to uncoil from slumber.</p><p align="justify">She raised her hands, and the sky answered.</p><p align="justify">Jagged spears of green and black rained down, piercing the earth around Evanora in a deadly hail. At the same moment, Agatha’s magic lashed out in whip-cracks of violet lightning, the two forces converging upon </p><p align="justify">Evanora in a cataclysmic collision. The old witch threw up a shield of writhing shadows, but the sheer force of the assault drove her to her knees. The ground beneath her splintered, fissures spiderwebbing outward as the air itself trembled under the weight of their combined power.</p><p align="justify">“Again!” Agatha shouted, her voice raw with battle-lust.</p><p align="justify">This time, Rio didn’t hesitate. She sprinted forward as Death’s power coiled around her fist – a swirling vortex of green and black energy, howling. Agatha timed it perfectly. Just as Rio pulled up at the last second, Agatha unleashed a concentrated beam of violet destruction from her outstretched palm. Rio caught it midair, her own magic fusing with Agatha’s, amplifying it tenfold.</p><p align="justify">The resulting blast struck Evanora square in the chest with the force of a falling star.</p><p align="justify">The witch’s body arched backward, her form flickering violently between solid and spectral as she skidded across the ruined earth, carving a trench through the dead soil. For a moment, the clearing was silent save for the crackle of fading magic.</p><p align="justify">Then Evanora laughed.</p><p align="justify">It started as a wet, choking sound, then grew into something monstrous – a sound that shouldn’t have come from a human throat. She rose, her body knitting itself back together with threads of stolen power.</p><p align="justify">“You think that’ll stop me?” She spat, her voice guttural with fury. “Death will never be enough if her vessel is weak.”</p><p align="justify">She raised both hands to the sky, and in the distance, the Vimana’s core pulsed like a dying star. A beam of sickly silver light tore through the heavens, all the way from Boston city, connecting with Evanora’s outstretched fingers. The ground beneath them <em>shuddered</em>, then <em>split</em> – massive roots, blackened and oozing corruption, erupted from the fissures like the grasping fingers of a buried titan.</p><p align="justify">Lilia barely had time to throw up a golden barrier as one speared toward Jen. The root shattered against the shield in a spray of rotting pulp, but another lashed out – catching Alice across the leg. She cried out as the corruption spread up her calf, veins blackening like frost creeping across glass.</p><p align="justify">Evanora stood at the epicenter of the devastation, her form swelling with stolen power. The ley lines beneath them screamed as she drained them dry, her wounds sealing shut, her shadow stretching taller, wider – <em>hungrier</em>.</p><p align="justify">“I am eternal!” she roared, and the woods trembled in answer.</p><p align="justify">The roots twisted, forming a cage around them. The air grew thick with the stench of decay. Rio’s wings twitched at her back, her revenant-half snarling in defiance. Agatha adjusted her grip on her knives, her eyes alight with the same feral fire that had kept her alive all these years.</p><p align="justify">They weren’t done yet.</p><p align="justify">Not even close.</p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath came ragged, her body trembling – not from fear, but from the weight of what she was about to unleash. She could feel Death writhing beneath her skin, no longer content to be restrained. It wanted out – to put an end to this.</p><p align="justify">
<em>You got this, Rio.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Then Rio let Death truly rise.</p><p align="justify">Black veins erupted across her skin like cracks in shattered glass, spreading up her arms, her chest, her throat. Her bones pressed against her flesh, left jawline sharpening and cheekbones protruding – her very skeleton free from the constraints of mortal form. The air around her warped, reality itself recoiling from the transformation.</p><p align="justify">Power detonated outward in a shockwave of emerald and obsidian, obliterating what remained of Evanora's spectral projection. From Rio's back, jagged obsidian spikes burst through skin and muscle, unfurling into vast, bat-like wings – the skeletal frames veined with pulsing green magic, membranes stretched taut like shadows given form.</p><p align="justify">Through the maelstrom of dark energy, Agatha's gaze locked onto Rio's face – half-human, half-revenant, one eye still her own, the other a bottomless void. The left side of her jaw had become exposed bone, teeth gleaming too-white against the darkness. Terror and fury warred in Rio's remaining human features, her expression haloed in death-green light.</p><p align="justify"><em>Oh</em>, Agatha thought, her breath catching. <em>You're beautiful like this</em>.</p><p align="justify">“You're right, Evanora." Rio's voice was layered thing – her own tones woven with Death's echoing rasp. She tilted her head, the motion unnaturally smooth. "In this realm, I am only as strong as my vessel's magic.” Her lips – half flesh, half bone – curved into a smile that was all teeth, all cocky. "But you forgot one small detail."</p><p align="justify">A gust of unnatural wind howled through the clearing, forcing Evanora back a step. The earth trembled.</p><p align="justify">Rio spread her arms wide, her wings stretching to their full, terrible span. “I.”</p><p align="justify">The forest held its breath before answering Death's call.</p><p align="justify">A visible wave of energy drained from the surrounding woods – from every blade of grass, every tree, every living creature hidden in the undergrowth. Their essence streamed toward Rio in rivers of glowing green, feeding the vortex of power swirling around her. The trees blackened and crumbled to dust, the grass withered to ash, the very air turning stale as Rio drank the life from everything around them.</p><p align="justify">“Still.”</p><p align="justify">Evanora's eyes widened. She launched herself upward, dark magic propelling her into the air – but she was too slow.</p><p align="justify">Rio beat her wings once–</p><p align="justify">“Am.”</p><p align="justify">–and she was above Evanora, a nightmare silhouette blocking out the sun. Her shadow fell across the older witch like a shroud.</p><p align="justify">From the scorched earth below, a helix of viridian energy erupted – pure, unfiltered life magic, torn from the land itself.</p><p align="justify">From Rio's outstretched hands, a helix of utter darkness spiraled forth – Death's inexorable pull.</p><p align="justify">“Death.”</p><p align="justify">They met midair, the two forces twisting together into a single, annihilating spear.</p><p align="justify">Evanora had no time to scream. The spear pierced her chest with a sound like the world cracking in half.</p><p align="justify">Evanora looked down at the wound. Her lips parted. No sound emerged.</p><p align="justify">Corruption spiderwebbed outward from the point of impact, her skin fracturing like dried clay. The Vimana's core, still glowing from the city, flickered erratically, its light dimming.</p><p align="justify">“No.” Evanora whispered.</p><p align="justify">Then–</p><p align="justify">She burst.</p><p align="justify">A thousand shards of darkness exploded outward, dissolving into nothing before they hit the ground.</p><p align="justify">The last echo of her existence was the sound of the Vimana's core magic dying, crumbling to inert, lifeless stone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Rio descended slowly, her wings folding behind her. The black veins remaining – along with her exposed jaw and her eyes, like pools of endless black with the weight of centuries staring out from behind them.</p><p align="justify">Where Rio stood, the earth was now black glass – soil fused into an obsidian crater by the backlash of Death's power. Tiny cracks spiderwebbed across its surface, glowing faintly emerald where residual magic still pulsed. The air above it shimmered with heat distortion, carrying the acrid scent of lightning-struck stone.</p><p align="justify">Twenty yards out, the trees stood like skeletal silhouettes, their bark stripped away to reveal bone-white wood beneath. Not a single leaf remained – just bare branches clawing at the sky like accusing fingers. The ground there was gray ash, so fine it puffed upward with every footstep, coating Jen's boots as she staggered to her knees, coughing.</p><p align="justify">“<em>Christ</em>.” Jen rasped, wiping ash from her face. Her fingers came away streaked black. She stared at the disintegrated remains of her last explosive vial – now just molten glass pooled in her palm. “That's... that’s one way to end this.”</p><p align="justify">The devastation radiated outward from ground zero in concentric rings – a perfect circle of decay, the price of Death's manifestation.</p><p align="justify">But Evanora was gone.</p><p align="justify">Really, truly gone.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">Agatha took a step in Rio’s direction before she spoke – her voice still mingled with Death’s: “The ley lines still need repairing.”</p><p align="justify">The words landed like stones. Agatha took another involuntary step forward, her boots crunching over the brittle, dead earth. Her hands twitched at her sides – reaching, stopping, curling into fists.</p><p align="justify">Rio's gaze held hers. “And they need a witch's life for that.” A pause. The wind stirred the ashes around them. “I'm sorry, Agatha.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha's breath left her in a rush. The world seemed to tilt.</p><p align="justify">“No.”</p><p align="justify">It wasn't a refusal. It was a plea. A whispered word, raw and fractured, barely audible over the sudden roar of blood in her ears. Her throat burned.</p><p align="justify">“Rio, please–"</p><p align="justify">Her voice broke.</p><p align="justify">And then–</p><p align="justify">Lilia stepped forward.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">
<em>Rio had just wiped the tears from her face, her fingers trembling against her damp cheeks, when she felt Lilia’s presence beside her. The older woman moved with quiet grace, her footsteps barely stirring the leaves beneath her.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>“Rio.” Lilia’s voice was soft but firm. “Can I talk to you?”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>Rio swallowed hard, forcing herself to meet Lilia’s steady gaze. The woman’s dark eyes held a depth of sorrow and resolve that made Rio’s chest tighten. “Yeah, of course, Lilia.”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>A heavy silence settled between them, broken only by the distant rustle of wind through the trees. Lilia exhaled slowly, as if steadying herself. “Rio… I know how the ley lines work.” Her fingers twitched at her side, as though resisting the urge to reach out. “Given the state you say they’re in, I doubt they’ll accept anything less than a sacrifice. And I know…” She hesitated, her voice dropping to a near whisper. “I know it’s always been the Death’s vessel who pays that price.”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>Rio’s breath hitched. She clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms, as if the pain could anchor her against the tide of memories threatening to pull her under. Her mother’s face flashed behind her eyelids – her smile, her tears, the hollow emptiness in her eyes the last time Rio had seen her alive.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>Lilia sighed, her shoulders sagging under an invisible weight. “That’s what your mother was so afraid of. Why she couldn’t bear the thought of you inheriting that burden.”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>Rio squeezed her eyes shut, fighting back the sting of fresh tears. She didn’t need the reminder – not now, when the wound felt so raw. But Lilia pressed on, her voice unwavering.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>“But Rio, I can’t let you do that.” She stepped closer, her hand finally lifting to rest gently on Rio’s arm. “I owe your mother more than I can ever repay. And when the time comes… I’m asking you to take me instead.”</em>
<br/>
<em>Rio jerked back as if burned. “No, Lilia – I can’t allow that. This is my responsibility. My fate.”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>Lilia’s expression hardened, a flicker of stubborn determination lighting her gaze. “Then I’ll ask Death directly. Take me. I’ve lived a long life – longer than I ever expected. And I should have stopped Evanora when we were younger. This is my chance to make amends.”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>Rio opened her mouth, but no words came out. The weight of Lilia’s resolve pressed down on her, leaving her breathless.</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>“Rio.” Lilia continued, her voice softening again, though her grip on Rio’s arm tightened slightly. “I need you to look after my girls. And Billy. They won’t understand my choice. Agatha…” Her voice wavered for the first time, a crack in her composure. “Agatha will be devastated. Please – take care of her. I know I’m asking too much, adding another burden to your shoulders. But do this for me.”</em>
</p><p align="justify">
<em>Rio’s throat burned. She wanted to argue, to scream that it wasn’t fair – that Lilia had no right to ask this of her. But the plea in the older woman’s eyes silenced her. Because Lilia wasn’t just asking. She was saying goodbye.</em>
</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">“I’m sorry, girls.” Her voice was soft, but it carried across the ruined clearing like a struck bell. “I loved being a witch.”</p><p align="justify">She turned toward Death, her back straight, her head high – a smile on her lips and a single tear on her eye.</p><p align="justify">And before anyone could stop her – before Agatha could lunge and scream – Lilia strode into Death her arms outstretched.</p><p align="justify">Golden light erupted from her skin.</p><p align="justify">And a white explosion was felt.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When the world finally stilled, only the four of them remained in the meadow. Rio’s body still bore the marks of her ordeal – black veins spiderwebbing up her neck, creeping along her cheek like cracks in porcelain – despite her wings retracting and her face all hers again.</p><p align="justify">She stood motionless, her gaze fixed on Agatha, whose face was a portrait of devastation.</p><p align="justify">It had all happened too fast. The others hadn’t even realized that Rio had crossed into the realm of the dead and returned, guiding Lilia’s soul along the way. But Agatha knew. She had felt it – the moment Evanora slipped from this world, and the moment the woman who had become her real mother too.</p><p align="justify">Rio didn’t move. She wasn’t sure what Agatha needed – rage, grief, silence. Whatever it was, Rio would give her space. Time.</p><p align="justify">Then, without warning, Agatha took a sharp breath and stumbled forward. Her steps were hurried, unsteady, as if her body moved before her mind could catch up. And then–</p><p align="justify">She crashed into Rio, arms locking around her in a desperate, bone-crushing embrace. A sob tore from her throat, raw and unrestrained, her fingers digging into Rio’s back like she was afraid she might vanish too.</p><p align="justify">Rio barely registered the flare of pain from her wounds. All that mattered was the warmth of Agatha against her, the proof that she was here, alive, and – somehow – not angry. Rio wrapped her arms around her, holding her as tightly as she dared.</p><p align="justify">Jen picked up Lilia's serpent pendant from where it had fallen in the grass. “Damn stubborn old witch.” She muttered, her voice thick.</p><p align="justify">Alice limped over, her injured leg bandaged with strips of her own shirt. “She always had to have the last word.”</p><p align="justify">They didn’t like Lilia’s choice, but they knew why she had made it.</p><p align="justify">And for now, that had to be enough.</p><p align="justify"> </p><p align="justify">When Rio woke, she felt the sunlight in her face. She moved her face to the other side.</p><p align="justify">Still, the sun spilled across the bedsheets, warm and golden, painting the room in soft morning hues. The sheets barely covered her legs, tangled from restless sleep, and her back still ached – deep, persistent throbs that came from the wounds of Death’s wings had forced her to sleep face-down.</p><p align="justify">She was in Agatha’s bed. Agatha’s apartment.</p><p align="justify">After everything, Agatha hadn’t wanted to stay in Lilia’s house. Jen, Alice, and Billy had taken the apartment above Lilia’s restaurant, but Agatha had asked – no, insisted – that Rio come here. With her.</p><p align="justify">A gentle touch was tracing along Rio’s spine, feather-light, as if afraid to hurt her further. Agatha’s fingers were playing mindless patterns of purple magic on her naked back. When she felt Rio stir – and Rio’s green magic respond to her touch – Agatha leaned down, pressing a kiss between her shoulder blades, with her hair falling over Rio’s arm.</p><p align="justify">“Stay here a little longer.” She murmured, her voice thick with sleep.</p><p align="justify">Rio had no intention of moving, so she just hummed in response.</p><p align="justify">The last two days had been slow and quiet – a stark contrast to the chaos that had consumed the weeks before. She didn’t want to think about work. Didn’t want to think about the drug dealers scrambling now that Evanora was gone, or the city’s confusion over the magical surges that had shaken Boston.</p><p align="justify">All she wanted was this: the softness of the sheets beneath her, the steady rhythm of her own breathing, and the knowledge that Agatha was nearby, already brewing coffee.</p><p align="justify">
<em>Rio.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Death’s voice echoed in her mind, familiar.</p><p align="justify">“Hm?” Rio mumbled into the pillow.</p><p align="justify">
<em>Do you remember when you asked about my connection with Agatha?</em>
</p><p align="justify">Rio stilled. “Yeah. It’s because Evanora tried the transfer between us, right?”</p><p align="justify"><em>No.</em> Death’s tone was unreadable. <em>Truth is, I don’t have a connection with Agatha. You do.</em></p><p align="justify">Rio frowned, her hand scratching her eyes awakened. “What do you mean?”</p><p align="justify">A pause.</p><p align="justify">
<em>The reason you’re my vessel, Rio, is because you stepped into my world the moment you were born. You died during labor. And when my magic resonates with infants in the underworld, I forge a bond – and they return to life as my vessels. But you and Agatha arrived at the same time. She died in the womb. And when I tried to revive you… your soul refused to go back without her.</em>
</p><p align="justify">Rio’s breath caught.</p><p align="justify"><em>So, I had revived her too.</em> Death continued. <em>You’ve been tied to her since before either of you took your first breath. Every time I saved her, it was because you asked me to – even if you didn’t realize it. You’d sensed her pain and you’d called me to her.</em></p><p align="justify">Rio exhaled slowly, her fingers tightening in the sheets and her eyes finally opening. “Why are you telling me this now?”</p><p align="justify"><em>Because mortals cling to these things. You call it fate. Soulmates.</em> A rare hint of something almost like amusement colored Death’s voice. <em>I’ve never seen a bond like yours. I didn’t know what to call it. And when I thought you might have to sacrifice yourself to save the world… telling you seemed cruel.</em></p><p align="justify">Rio swallowed hard.</p><p align="justify">“Thank you.” she whispered. “For everything.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha reappeared in the doorway, holding two steaming mugs. “Oh, already thanking me for the coffee?” She teased, sitting carefully beside Rio.</p><p align="justify">Rio smiled as Agatha helped her sit up, mindful of her injuries. She took the mug, their fingers brushing, and pressed a slow, lingering kiss to Agatha’s lips before taking a sip – a clear sign of devotion: tasting Agatha before tasting coffee.</p><p align="justify">Agatha’s hand settled on Rio’s hip, tracing absent circles as they sat in comfortable silence.</p><p align="justify">“I was thinking,” Agatha said after a moment, “maybe we could stay in today. Jen and Alice are checking what the police knows about the magic surges. We could have a lazy day and stay here. Just… us.”</p><p align="justify">Rio leaned her head into Agatha’s shoulder, warmth spreading through her chest.</p><p align="justify">“Coffee in bed and lazy days?” She murmured. “Marry me now.”</p><p align="justify">Agatha let out a breathy laugh. She leaned to plant a kiss on Rio’s exposed neck. “Buy a girl some diamonds first, Grim Reaper.”</p><p align="justify">And Rio smiled – because she did know of a few jewelry stores near the Downtown Crossing metro station.</p>
