arch your back and then snap like a violin string when you come
********
On all fours in front of me, legs spread just a bit. Think how easily two fingers could just slide in...no resistance...all slippery sensation. 

Now think about those fingers. They spend their days typing and pulling game triggers. They never stay still, always doing some sort of coordinated dance. 

Now they're dancing inside you. So while they're sliding in and out, they're also fluttering and pressing. They're searching for those places inside you that drive you wild. And when they find that place, they won't stop. 

So next time, imagine it's me behind you with two fingers driving inside you so fast your hips can't keep up.  And then out of nowhere I just stop and start massaging those inner walls, dragging and pressing and curling my fingers so fast but so deliberate. I wonder how long you could resist coming with me so singularly set on my goal. I wonder what noises you'll make when I change tempos. I wonder how hard you'll come and how long I can draw it out. Will you scream into a pillow or let me hear you unrestrained? Will you use that last bit of muscle control to pull yourself off my fingers or to push them in further? 

I know what I would do.
*************************
I want you so completely wanton and driven to the edge that you're holding onto the back of my head and griding yourself against my mouth, gripping me with your thighs
And then at some point, I'll want to grab your thighs and hold your legs in the air, keeping enough downward pressure to pin your hips and then drive my tongue into you

------------
because those long, slow, flat licks are going to speed up
And im going to start pointing my tongue
Flicking it up at the end
Still not hard, but fast
Circling, flicking
Occasionally dipping my tongue into you
And anytime I feel you start to twitch, I change the tempo
I slow it down
Pull away a bit
Look up at you
Watch you
