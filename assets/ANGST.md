## **Untitled Agatha & Rio Angst Fic**

**Act One: The Fall**

### 🍷 First Dinner

Agatha was late.

Not fashionably. Not dramatically. Just *late*, in the way that came from too many emails, too much bullshit, and not enough wine. Her blouse was wrinkled from sitting too long in one position and she hadn’t bothered with lipstick. She was halfway through composing an apology in her head as she pushed open the door of the restaurant, her voice already dry and disinterested.

But the words died the second she saw *her.*

Tall. Relaxed. A knowing smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth. She wore a worn leather jacket and boots that made her already infuriating height seem impossible. Her hands were tucked into her pockets like she owned the entire concept of “chill,” and when her eyes met Agatha’s across the room, they held. Steady. Direct. Curious.

“Great,” Agatha muttered under her breath. “A stranger. I love those.”

The woman—Rio, she learned quickly—tilted her head slightly, already smiling.

“Don’t worry,” she said, not missing a beat. “I’ve already been warned about you.”

Agatha raised an eyebrow as she approached the table. “By Alice or Jen?”

Rio shrugged one shoulder. “Both. Alice said you’d pretend not to like me, and Jen said you’d make it weird.”

Agatha blinked. Then, unexpectedly, snorted. “They’re both terrible and correct.”

“Be nice, Harkness,” Jen said dryly from behind her cocktail. “She’s house-trained.”

### 🥃 The Beginning of the Game

The evening went better than expected—annoyingly so. Rio was clever. Grounded. The kind of person who watched people instead of performing for them. And she watched Agatha with open, easy interest, like she was some ancient text she planned to spend the next few decades translating for fun.

Agatha had been prepared to be irritated. But Rio’s calm confidence never veered smug. She let Agatha make her jabs, and threw them right back—grinning, unshaken.

At one point, Alice leaned across the table with a teasing grin. “This is fun. Usually it takes people a while to stop being afraid of Agatha.”

Rio’s eyes didn’t leave Agatha’s face. “What’s scary about someone who flinches at compliments?”

That landed with more force than it should have. Agatha’s expression didn’t shift, but her wine glass clinked slightly too hard against the table as she picked it up. She took a long sip and didn’t answer.

Later, when they stood outside the restaurant saying their goodbyes, Agatha lingered a moment too long under the awning. She hadn’t expected to enjoy herself. And now she wasn’t sure what to do with the fact that she had.

As she turned to go, Rio touched her elbow—gentle, just enough to pause her—and leaned in, voice low and sincere.

“Thanks for not biting,” she said. “I can tell it took effort.”

Agatha glanced at her, startled. Then she gave a tight smile that barely reached her eyes. “You don’t know the half of it.”

### 📱 The Chat Begins

It started innocently enough.

A reply in the group chat. A snarky GIF. A meme about corporate death spirals. Nothing serious.

But the next day, a private thread appeared. Just her and Rio.

**Rio:**
*sends a photo of an empty coffee pot and a funeral emoji*
**Agatha:**
*sends a photo of a tequila bottle next to her cat, Ebony, who’s sitting on top of her laptop looking deeply offended by Excel*
**Rio:**
*sends a picture of a terrarium with a large, fuzzy tarantula inside*

**Agatha:**
“Oh my *god.* Please tell me that’s not yours.”
**Rio:**
“Her name is Victoria. She’s shy.”
**Agatha:**
“Is she *venomous*?”
**Rio:**
“Yes. But so are you, sooooo…”
**Agatha:**
“Touché. Still disgusting.”
**Rio:**
“She thinks you’re a coward.”
**Agatha:**
“She’s not wrong. I am *delighted* to be a coward when it comes to eight-legged nightmares.”
**Rio:**
“She has seven and a half. One fell off during molting.”
**Agatha:**
“OH MY GOD STOP TALKING.”

Rio sent a gif of a tarantula giving a high five.

Agatha didn’t respond right away. Then sent a string of skull emojis.
Then a second message.

**Agatha:**
“…does she wear the sweater, or do you?”

She didn’t mean to look forward to Rio’s messages. But every time her phone lit up with that name, something warm pulled at her chest.

She told herself it was just banter.

She didn’t believe it.

### 🎨 The Cracks Show

Coffee meetups “accidentally” became part of the routine.

If someone bailed on drinks, Agatha and Rio still went. If there were no group plans, they made their own. They never called them dates. Never acknowledged the way they always sat beside each other.

But Agatha noticed when Rio didn’t show. And she noticed how her day went better when Rio did.

One night, while the group laughed over cocktails, Alice leaned over and grinned at Rio. “You know,” she said, half-drunkenly sentimental, “you’re the best person I’ve ever known.”

Agatha, without thinking, snorted into her drink. “Your standards are appallingly low.”

Rio raised a brow, grinning. “You wound me.”

“You’re fine,” Agatha said. “You’re just not… exceptional.”

Across the table, Jen sipped her drink and muttered, “You’re *so* fucked, Harkness.”

Agatha glared at her.

She didn’t argue.

### 🌙 First Night

It started with dinner at Agatha’s place. The others bailed—"next time!"—but Rio still came. She always did.

They drank wine, cooked together (sort of), argued over jazz playlists. Agatha watched Rio talk, the way she laughed with her whole body, and something inside her shifted. Or maybe it just… *unclenched.*

Later, curled up on the couch with Rio sitting on the floor at her feet, the air thick with candlelight and possibility, Agatha had laughed at something ridiculous Rio said. When the quiet settled, she got up to get more wine. Avoid the moment.

“You always do that,” Rio said softly.

Agatha blinked. “Do what?”

“Deflect. Right when it’s getting good.”

Agatha swallowed.

“I’m not deflecting,” she said, knowing full well she was.

Rio just smiled. “Only when it’s worth it.”

The silence between them buzzed.

“You should go,” Agatha said quietly.

Rio didn’t move. “If you really want me to.”

Agatha stared at her. “I don’t.”

And then she kissed her.

---

They didn’t make it to bed right away, but they made it there eventually—bare skin against cotton sheets, laughter between kisses, soft gasps that turned hungry and then reverent.

Agatha gave in. Completely. She let herself be ruined.

And when they finally collapsed together, breathless and clinging, she thought maybe, *just maybe*, this could be something real.

---

Agatha woke slowly, wrapped in warmth.

The first thing she noticed was how *good* she felt. Not just physically—though that was a lovely bonus—but in her bones. In her skin. In some deep, tucked-away part of herself that had been silent for years.

She blinked at the ceiling, letting the soft morning light fill her eyes. Her body ached in all the right places. She was deliciously sore. Sated. Tangled in rumpled sheets that still smelled like Rio—cedar, citrus, and something faintly like firewood.

And Rio herself was behind her, solid and real, breathing slow and even against the back of her neck. One arm was slung around her waist, hand heavy and relaxed, like it belonged there.

Agatha smiled. Actually smiled. Slow and lazy and *unafraid.*

She hadn’t expected this. Not the sex—though, *God,* the sex—but the aftermath. The ease of it. The comfort. The feeling of being held like she wasn’t a burden or a mistake or a series of sharp edges waiting to cut someone.

She turned slightly, just enough to see the sleeping silhouette behind her.

Rio’s face was peaceful. Her lips parted slightly. One hand twitched faintly with some half-dreamed thought. Her hair was a mess, and her shoulder was covered in faint red lines that Agatha remembered leaving.

Something warm swelled in Agatha’s chest. Something giddy and reckless and terrifyingly unfamiliar.

Hope.

*God,* she thought, heart fluttering, *maybe this doesn’t have to fall apart.*

She didn’t move. Didn’t want to break the spell. She just lay there, soaking it in, letting her heartbeat settle into the rhythm of Rio’s.

When Rio finally stirred and pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s shoulder, murmuring, “Mornin’,” Agatha felt a laugh bubble in her throat.

“Hi,” she whispered.

“Coffee?” Rio asked, lips brushing the curve of her neck.

“Mmm,” Agatha hummed. “Only if you’re making it.”

Rio chuckled and slipped out of bed. Agatha rolled onto her back, grinning at the ceiling like a woman freshly ruined and proud of it.

She felt light. Silly, even. There was a ridiculous impulse to kick her feet like a teenager.

*This is real,* she thought. *This could be something real.*

She didn’t even notice the silence at first—how much time had passed. She was still lying there in a daydream when she heard Rio’s voice, faint from the kitchen.

Casual. Laughing.

Agatha sat up, the smile still lingering on her lips as she reached for her shirt.

And then she heard it.

> “No, it’s not serious.”

Her hand froze.

> “I just needed to get it out of my system, you know?”

Cold swept down her spine like a slap of water.

> “Yeah, I’m fine. I’m good.”

She didn’t move for several seconds. Just sat there, heart thudding in her chest, skin prickling.

Then, in silence, she dressed.

No shaking hands. No tears. Just sharp, automatic movements. Shirt, jeans. Hair pulled back. Keys in hand.

She opened the door gently. Closed it even more gently.

Didn’t look back.

### 🚘 Act Two: The Car

She didn’t cry at first.  She's too proud for that.

Agatha walked out of Rio’s apartment with the calm, practiced elegance of a woman who knew exactly what she was doing. No slammed doors. No rage. Just clean escape.

The car door shuts with a muted click that feels far too soft for how loud everything is inside her chest.

Agatha grips the steering wheel with both hands, like it might hold her together. Her knuckles go white. Her teeth dig into the inside of her cheek until she tastes blood.

Fuck.

The sun hasn’t been up long, but the sky is already too bright. Golden, irritating light spills across the dashboard, and she wants to rip it out of the sky and shove it back behind the clouds.

She can still feel Rio on her skin. The bruising pressure of her hands. Her mouth on Agatha’s throat. The weight of her body pressing Agatha into the mattress like a vow.

Last night had felt real. Too real. So real it made her nauseous now.

And then this morning...Rio's words echoed in her head, over and over, like her mind was stuck in a loop.

> “No, it’s not serious.”
> “Just needed to get it out of my system.”
> “Yeah, I’m fine.”

Each one sharper than the last.

She squeezed her eyes shut. Counted to ten. Tried to breathe.

It didn’t help.

She shouldn’t care. She shouldn’t have cared at all. She’d known better. She always knew better.

But then Rio had made her laugh. Had looked at her like she was something soft. Had touched her like she wasn’t made of splinters and barbed wire. Had whispered things against her skin like they were promises.

Her fingers curled tighter around the wheel, and a hot, gutted laugh escaped her lips. Short. Ugly. 

*Of course.*

Of course she let herself hope. Of course she let her guard down. Of course the second she did, it turned out she'd misunderstood everything.

*She played you,* that old, bitter voice in her mind hissed. *You were convenient. You let it happen. You let her in.*

She should’ve known better. She *did* know better.

The first tear slid down her cheek, and she wiped it away with the back of her hand like it didn’t count.

She didn't go home right away. Instead, she drove around the block. Twice. Then pulled into a quiet park and sat there until the sun was too high and her chest ached from holding everything in.  

She sat there with her legs pulled up into the seat and her arms wrapped around them like she’s thirty years younger and hiding from her mother again. 

She sat there, eyes fix on the dashboard, but all she sees is the curve of Rio’s smile when she said “You don’t have to be scared of me.”

Her phone buzzed once. Then again.

She didn’t look.

She wasn’t ready to feel stupid *and* pathetic.

Not yet.

---

YES. Emotional support Wanda is *exactly* what Agatha needs—and of course they’re exes turned besties because lesbian law requires it. Wanda’s married to Nat now, lives a town over, and probably knows Agatha better than anyone. Let’s build the emotional spiral before that call: dodging texts, collapsing in the shower, trying to work but failing, and finally giving in and calling the one person who won’t let her bullshit her.

### 📵 Scene: Dodging the Fallout

Agatha made it home without breaking down again.

She dropped her keys in the bowl by the door, kicked off her heels, and immediately stripped off the shirt she’d thrown on in a panic. It smelled faintly like Rio’s detergent.

She shoved it into the bottom of her laundry basket and didn’t look at it again.

Her phone buzzed.

**Rio:**

> Where'd you go? You okay?

Buzz.

**Rio:**

> You left your earrings.

Buzz.

**Rio:**

> Agatha? 

She flipped the phone face-down on the counter.

Then turned it off entirely.

---

### 🚿 Scene: Shower Breakdown

She stepped into the shower like it might rinse the whole thing away. Cranked the water too hot. Scrubbed herself raw.

Still, she couldn’t shake it.

The feeling of Rio’s hands on her skin. Her mouth. Her voice.

The way Agatha had felt that morning—*hopeful.* Light. Like maybe, finally, she was safe.

She pressed her forehead to the tile and let the water hammer against her back until her legs gave out. She slid down to the floor, arms wrapped around her knees, and finally let herself cry.

Silently. Fiercely. Like someone trying not to be heard.

---

### 📂 Scene: Distraction (Fail)

She tried working.

Opened her laptop. Stared at a spreadsheet. Closed it again.

She tried reading.

Made it through two pages and realized she hadn’t absorbed a single word.

She poured a glass of wine. Didn’t drink it.

She picked up her phone. Turned it on.

Six unread messages.

Two from Jen. One from Alice. Another two from Rio.

> If I did something wrong, please just tell me. I’ll fix it. I swear.

> I really hope you're ok. 

Agatha reads them three times.

She types: I’m fine.

Deletes it.

Types: Thanks. All good.

Deletes that too.

She turned it back off.

Then finally, she opened her contacts and scrolled to **Wanda Maximoff**.

Her thumb hovered for a second before she hit call.

---

### 📞 Scene: Wanda

“Hey, you,” Wanda answered on the second ring. Her voice was warm. Familiar. Home.

Agatha didn’t say anything right away.

“…Aggie?”

Agatha exhaled. “Hi.”

Wanda didn’t push. She never did. Just waited.

“I screwed up,” Agatha said finally, voice hoarse. “Or I didn’t. I don’t know.”

“Is this about the hot friend with the boots and the tragically good eyebrows?”

Agatha huffed out something between a laugh and a sob. “God, *yes.*”

There was a pause. A clinking noise—Wanda probably setting down a mug somewhere.

“Okay,” she said gently. “I'm coming over.”
