<p>
<span>1688, Salem, MA, USA</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sun had set long ago, and the night was cold, frost growing like lichen on the wood and stone buildings of the seaside town of Salem, Massachusetts. Outside the town, up a small track that may have been left by deer or rabbits passing through, the faintest glimmer of firelight could be seen- a bonfire lit just behind the dip of a hill, not visible to the town or any travelers on the main road. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Here, the witches of Salem were gathered.</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Of course, they did not publicly proclaim themselves witches; nor did they claim to be Puritans; they styled themselves as another branch of Christians, calling themselves the Covenant of the Separatists. They, too, descended from forbears that had been hunted and hounded from their homes in England, and remained unwelcome in Europe. But here, they could find a home. Salem was a fortification and a rapidly growing merchant town; it offered protection and opportunity, but also demanded order, modesty, and piety.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As outsiders, the Covenant were always apart from the rest of the townspeople; they could not worship in their churches, or socialize with their womenfolk, or bury their dead in the hallowed ground of the churchyard. But they were tolerated, because they served a purpose and kept to themselves. The townspeople knew that medicines, and small charms, and useful trinkets like needles that never dulled and matches that always burned, even when wet- could be gotten from these outsiders living among them. And the witches relied upon the strong walls and fortifications of town, as well as the ability to purchase the things they could not make or grow themselves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Thus an accord existed between the town and the small group of families of the Coven of Salem. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their fates were intertwined. Both struggled under the burdens, the cost, and the labor of carving a European settlement into a space there had never been one before- they mutually benefited, and thus, tolerated each other, but only up to a point.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What was often whispered about, though, was how fragile this peaceful coexistence truly was. And so, both groups had rules- inviolable, rigid rules no one dared break. The price for doing so would be devastating for both groups.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The fire that night marked a very special occasion. A hooded group of women stood in a circle, faces in shadow. Closer to the fire knelt 7 young girls, none older than 12. Their eyes were all fixed upon one imposing figure. She stepped forward and lowered her hood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora Harkness’ fingers traced the locket she wore around her neck. She peered down her sharp nose at the kneeling figures silhouetted against the firelight, her eyes lingering one extra moment on the shivering form of her young daughter, Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Speak the words,” Evanora commanded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”On the eve of my thirteenth year,” came the quavering voices of the kneeling girls,  “I pledge my newly emerging powers to the Coven. I will serve the Coven in all things. I will obey the Coven without question. I will never stray from the path set before my feet by the will of the Coven… so mote it be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The fire in the stone ring flared, showering the dark night sky with sparks. Evanora nodded, once, satisfied. She replaced her hood and stepped back into the ranks of the Coven, face masked by shadows. Agatha and the rest of the girls remained kneeling beside the fire, awaiting their next instructions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another witch stepped forward; this was Rosemary, the second in command.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”With these words, the Coven welcomes you to the ranks of our initiates. In your new role, you will learn to serve the Coven.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rosemary fixed each of the girls with a serious look, steel in her eye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”You are an adult now, and will be given no leeway. Transgressions will be punished harshly.” The cold voice spoke decisively. “Allow me to remind you of the tenets of your time as an initiate. I will only tell you these rules once, and then it is up to you to remember.” Rosemary took another step forward. Her stiff posture reminded Agatha of witches she’d seen broken under the lash, carried away from the Gathering Place barely conscious. She did not want to be one of those witches.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Initiates serve the coven. They have no agency, they entertain no thoughts of independence. The Coven must be protected, and in return, initiates are protected by the Coven. The work you will do will make you strong; initiates will draw water from the well, tend to the hearths, and forage for food,” recited Rosemary. “Magic is a gift and a privilege, and must not be wielded for menial tasks. Thus, you will not be taught the art of the craft until you have proven yourself to the Coven.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha risked a glance at the imposing woman standing above her, dropping her eyes immediately. Rosemary noticed the lapse and frowned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When we decide you are ready, you will leave the ranks of the initiates and begin to learn the craft. Now, speak your final oath.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha spoke the words that always felt like ashes in her mouth: “For the Coven, I will.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora spoke again, not moving from her place, as Rosemary reclaimed her own place and lifted her hood: “And never forget- the townspeople would not suffer a witch to live, even if she never interfered with their God or with their lives. We live in the shadows, or we die in the light. Remember this well- for if you break this rule, your life, and the lives of the entire Coven will be forfeit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, the initiates were allowed to rise and to begin the silent walk back to the town. They filed past the Coven members, who remained behind to attend to business.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Daughter, do not disappoint me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha heard the whispered words as she walked past her mother. It felt like an indictment, or a curse- as if Evanora was already disappointed, already justified in her disdain for her daughter and all Agatha’s best efforts would be in vain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was nothing to be said in reply. Agatha bowed her head, telegraphing contriteness and obedience, stamping down the anger at already being singled out as ‘not good enough.’ She did not speak or look up from her feet until she reached her home and closed the door firmly behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Raising her head, Agatha crossed to the shelf that held her mother’s spell book, and the books of witches the Coven had defeated. She did not need a candle to see them; to her, they glowed, always, glimmering and whispering to her of the secrets within their bindings. She fisted her hands in her skirts, not reaching out to touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to get to learn magic,” she whispered, promising herself it would happen. Holding herself back from using the magic twisting and pulsing within her made her skin itch and her throat feel tight. Sometimes, she didn’t succeed at keeping her magic down. Power would burst from her with unpredictable results- a contrary cow suddenly becoming docile and allowing her to milk it; a stubborn well bucket suddenly creaking to the top of its rope without her touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha remembered one such occasion, wincing at the memory; she’d been six years old, and her mother was teaching her to lay a fire; to stack the wood, to shred the tinder, to strike the flint. But Agatha had not been able to get the flame to catch. Evanora had watched, offering no help. Growing more and more frustrated, the young girl had let out an angry huff and made a swinging backhanded motion towards the hearth. A fire had flared immediately. Agatha had been so proud, but Evanora had frowned and chastised her at her lack of control. In Evanora’s eyes, Agatha had seen something like fear. She didn’t understand why- her mother made fires like that frequently, and no one had seen them. After that, Evanora had been more careful not to perform casual magic around Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So yes; as a child, she’d been shown grace, protected from punishment. But now, as an initiate, she would not be shown the same leniency. She knew she’d need to find an outlet, to hide her burgeoning powers and her inability to keep them inside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For now, she knew, the only way forward was through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>A hive shares one mind, and one purpose: to serve the queen. And in exchange, the queen ensures the hive survives. Thus did the Salem Coven operate. There was no room for dissent, no space for any member to step out of the ranks, or to challenge their predetermined role. Maternity did not mean maternal feelings: no tenderness, no pride, no expressions of love passed between the queen and her children. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The queen’s attendants were the most powerful witches, and they, too, produced offspring, but did not cherish or coddle them. They nurtured them to adulthood, and bound them to serve the coven with iron ties. An oath spoken on the last night before a witch’s thirteenth year tied their lives and their magic to the queen and her inner circle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was into this society that Agatha Harkness was born. Her prospects as a girl in the wider society of the new world in 1675 were not better; nor would her chances of survival have been improved by being born to parents without magic. Still, perhaps she would have been better off being raised by wolves. Wolves, at least, showed mercy. Wolves were capable of tenderness and affection.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora Harkness, reigning queen of the Salem Coven, was not.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Water duty was the most thankless of tasks: each Coven member’s cottage needed water, endless amounts, and the well never seemed to be close to the home that needed it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The filthy, sweaty toil of carrying water through the dirt streets, frequently dusty or muddy or icy with slush, was the worst of the tasks the initiates could be assigned, and it was used by the Coven as punishment. Agatha was frequently on water duty, though she rarely knew why. Older Coven members would find fault with her at any opportunity, and assign her the punishment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She longed for the task of foraging; her mind wandered sunlight dappled paths, and she dreamed of crisp greens snapped off the stalk, and earthy mushrooms gathered in a basket. She sighed when she thought of berries, ripe to bursting, swaddled in her handkerchief. But instead, she trudged under the yoke of the water buckets. Sore, exhausted, and unfulfilled, she fell asleep in her cold, narrow bed and dreamed of winding paths through the woods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Time passed, and the Coven marked the cycle of the seasons, celebrating the birth of the new year, and the death of the old. Agatha grew tall, learned to be self contained, tried to pass by without notice. She was fourteen now, and she watched as many of those who joined the ranks of the initiates at the same time she did became fully fledged Coven members, having met some undefined requirement to move up. But it never seemed to be Agatha’s turn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her powers burned inside of her. She didn’t know how the others lived with this fire licking along their nerve endings. She wasn’t sure how long she could last before her desperation to know peace outweighed her fear of the Coven’s retribution.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Coven witches were a secretive bunch, and jealous of their knowledge. The “lessons” Agatha longed for were withheld from her, and she chafed more and more with every passing day spent hauling water, rather than casting spells. The other girls worked without complaint. They found moments to chatter and dance, to skip and sing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But they never asked why they weren’t being given the chance to study magic. Perhaps they knew something Agatha didn’t, something that gave them hope. She tried not to believe that she was being held back, tried to understand how to be good enough for her mother. To be allowed to become a witch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha screamed as the lash came down again across her back. Her hands had gone numb at the place they were tied, and the sharp edges of the Meeting Place stake cut her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sweat stung her eyes, and her hair hung loose and tangled around her face. Even with her vision obscured, she knew her mother’s eyes were on her, dispassionate and unaffected. Maybe even pleased with Agatha’s pain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Mother-” she whimpered, “Please- no more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her latest transgression had been trying to peek into the training hall to watch the Coven witches wielding their magic. She just wanted to learn, just wanted to know </span>
<em>
<span>everything</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d managed to see sparks of color, to memorize a few of the simpler hand motions, before she’d been seen. She was dragged here for her public lashing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora did not acknowledge her daughter’s plea. She simply watched the lash fall again, and tracked the blood trickling down Agatha’s back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Breathing through the pain, Agatha raised her head, baring her teeth at the crowd of gathered witches. They were laughing at her behind their hands, delighting in her humiliation and her pain. Agatha saw no friendly faces in the crowd and heard no calls for mercy. Something in her snapped, and she felt all her emotions freeze, shatter, sink deep within her. Her magic swarmed to the surface, and she held it in, barely, but allowed it to fizz along her fingers, longing to break her bindings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother looked at her, appraising, then nodded at the witch holding the lash. It fell again. Agatha did not scream. Evanora frowned, motioning for the whipping to continue. Agatha didn’t cry, and she didn’t scream again. With each strike upon her back, the crowd’s noise changed, becoming an anxious, unsettled buzz.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When it was over, she rose shakily, donned her discarded dress, and strode home on legs that felt like water. Blood streamed down her torn back. Everyone she passed moved aside silently. Some turned away altogether. Evanora ordered Agatha be given water hauling duty, and didn’t allow her to be healed with magic.  Each night, she gathered herbs to make her own poultice, knowing that if she caught a fever, she would likely die. For weeks after, Agatha carried heavy pails of water, blood blossoming through the fabric of her dress. Pale, teeth gritted, and powered by rage, her steps never faltered. Witches on the street would stop to watch her stride by, whispering amongst themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No one was laughing at her now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>At 15, Agatha saw a man die.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was an accident- she was gathering mussels from the rocks as the tide slipped back out to sea. She was a child of the ocean and knew how to walk on the seaweed slick stones and keep her feet. But she watched a man on a nearby rock spit jutting out into deeper waters misjudge his footing, and fall into the churning, tide-torn bay. He never came back up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha had needed to run- she couldn’t be seen, lest the townspeople blamed her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she ran, she glanced back, and stumbled to a stop- there was another figure on the rocks now. Cloaked in a dark covering, cowl covering their face, she couldn’t make out their features. She choked on her breath in fear- had she been seen? Would she be blamed?</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the figure looked different, somehow, from the upright, neatly dressed townsfolk. As she continued to watch, the hooded figure reached into the water and pulled the man back onto the rocks. But he wasn’t- he looked wrong. He wasn’t solid… and he’d been under the water for so long…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had seen enough- she continued her race back to safety. When news reached the Coven of a man drowning, Agatha shivered. She knew there were powers beyond her understanding in this world, and she felt sure she’d just seen one.  </span>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha All Along has me in a chokehold; I needed to know more about these characters, but mainly I needed to know more about Agatha and Rio. How did they meet? How did they spend enough time together to fall in love? What triggered Agatha’s coven to turn on her? What kind of history and dynamic makes you save your ex, then turn up to kill her once you’ve saved her? What was all that delicious anger and tension about???</p><p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on my interpretations and machinations; I have 7 chapters written, and 23k words up, but I also have another 10k of the next installment written. I have a character study of Agatha, and a timeline of events extrapolated from clues in AAA and Wandavision, and I’m spiraling on my own here lol. Thank you for reading!</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When she turned sixteen, Agatha stole a book from her mother’s shelf. She was skilled enough now to manage it without being caught immediately, and foolish enough to think, as time went on, that she would never be caught.</p><p>And for a time, she wasn’t. </p><p>Agatha alone among her peers remained in the ranks of the initiates. Her nearest year-mate was a girl of thirteen. Everyone else had been tapped to become a full Coven member. Agatha knew Evanora watched her going about her chores, as a hawk watches a rabbit. Her mother’s disapproval and exclusion had left Agatha friendless; none dared befriend a witch marked with disapproval by the Coven’s leader. Agatha performed every task set before her silently, competently. She was beyond reproach, hoping one day to earn approval, but also knowing that she had a secret that would get her through this impossible time. She would take what she knew to be her birthright.</p><p>Agatha had consulted the chickens on her decision; “See, hens, the rules do not say I may not learn from a book- only that I will not be taught by Coven members until they say I’m ready. And, the rules only require that I do chores without magic.” She held one warm, speckled egg up to the sky before placing it in her basket. “I am not using magic now, and I don’t use it for anything menial. So that isn’t breaking any rules.”</p><p>She set her full egg basket down on the straw to nudge her hand below a broody hen’s rear. The bird, ruffled, squawked shrilly. Agatha shushed it, and went on- “And it is all in service to the Coven, after all,” Agatha insisted. “A witch must be strong to serve her Coven. I only wish to be stronger.” A hen pecked at her boot, demanding to be fed. Agatha sighed, bringing crushed cornmeal from her apron pocket and sprinkling it about. The chicken coop burst into life, each hen jostling for position. One hen, bedraggled looking and lacking feathers, seemed to be the coop’s whipping boy- no matter how she came at the gaggle, she was not let in. Agatha frowned, and placed some grains at the sickly looking hen’s feet. She ate. “Grow strong, little hen.” She muttered, stroking the fitful feathered back gently. </p><p>Convinced of the justice of her actions, Agatha took the tome that whispered to her from the shelf the most loudly. Those whispers invaded her dreams, tickled at her waking thoughts, enticed her with its promises of power. She stopped fighting the call; when she picked it up for the first time, the whispers intensified, then died down to a peaceful shushing noise, like the sound a mother makes to calm her child… Agatha felt like she’d finally come home.</p><p>The book opened an entire world before her. She learned to summon her power from deep within, to concentrate the tingling heat along her palms, to explode the gathered light from her fingertips, bending it to her will as it went.</p><p>Thus, Agatha became a thief. She stole time outside the town, far from the Coven’s rune protected walls which would have alerted the Coven to her use of magic, hiding in a distant clearing near a field used for haying. </p><p>One hot summer day, like the dozens of days before, Agatha snuck away with the black bound spell book stuffed in an apron pocket. </p><p>She ran through the endless woods, bare feet nearly silent on the soft carpet of moss and leaves, not minding the sweat gathering at her hairline. She felt free, alive.</p><p>Standing in the center of the clearing, she looked at the sky, re-read the book resting in the grass in front of her, and began the incantation.</p><p>The heat of the summer, the scent of flowers and grass curing into hay, and the quiet fizz of her magic leaving her hands was her happy place.</p><p>At least, it was until she was discovered.</p><p>The witch was named Prudence, and she was one of Evanora’s spies. She was not of the inner circle, but  was a toady always grasping at opportunities to ingratiate herself.</p><p>Agatha had been totally unaware that she was being followed that day; Prudence had moved so silently, perhaps aided by a spell. </p><p>Prudence charged into the clearing, shouting, “Stop this at once!”</p><p>Her screech of rage at the purple magic dancing along Agatha’s fingers startled the girl, and the fizzing ball dissipated, leaving her cold and defenseless. </p><p>“How dare you,” Prudence seethed. Her chest was heaving, eyes wild.</p><p>Agatha tried to defend herself- “I was only curious- I was just borrowing the book-”</p><p>But Prudence could not be reasoned with. “Agatha Harkness,” she screeched, “I accuse you of performing magic beyond your station. I claim the right to punish you for your transgression, in the name of the Coven!”</p><p>Agatha took a step back, holding her hands up, knowing it would be futile to try to defend herself, but needing to try-</p><p>And that was when the other witch lashed out at Agatha. Overly eager, perhaps, to show Evanora that there was no situation where she would hesitate, she struck with murderous intent. Any other nascent witch would have crumbled beneath the attack.</p><p>Agatha braced for pain, for the darkness of the end of her life- but even as her eyes closed, she realized something was happening that she did not expect. The power flowed into her body, but instead of tearing at her, it curled there, settled down, and stayed, making space for more.</p><p>Instead of pain, Agatha felt a growing ecstasy. Her body drew in the magic like her lungs drew in air, naturally and comfortably, but the magic felt like pure, unadulterated joy. Heart racing, Agatha leaned into the feeling greedily.</p><p>This couldn’t be right.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes and saw the terror, the rage, the fear on the pinched face across from her. She watched Prudence try to break away, and then panic as she realized she couldn’t. Agatha took a deep breath in, and instinctively felt along the magical line connecting her to the other witch. She could <em>see</em> into the well of the other witch’s power. </p><p>Agatha felt euphoria like she had never known- every drop of power she took in brought the delirious joy up another notch. She laughed out loud, on an unbelievable high. Each moment made her feel more fulfilled, made her feel like she could take up the space she was owed. The feeling was so incredible, she never considered that it couldn’t last. Seeking <em>more</em> and feeling the flow slowing, Agatha gasped, devastated at the sudden loss. Without thinking, she pulled at the line she held, and suddenly, it all went wrong.</p><p>The well of power within Prudence dried, crumbled, and so too did the vessel for that power, crashing to the ground, then lying still.</p><p>Agatha felt like a puppet with its strings cut, staggering and barely keeping her feet. </p><p>She gaped at Prudence's crumpled form. Her brain wasn’t understanding what had happened. She’d never heard of such a thing as <em>stealing</em> another witch’s power. She didn’t know that it could kill them.</p><p>Her body and mind felt completely split- her body thrumming from the influx of magic, the sensation of it making her feel elated, celebratory- but her mind could not stop screaming “She’s dead, you killed her, they’ll kill you, you have to run, run away, RUN!” over and over and over.</p><p>And then, a cloud passed overhead, and the day suddenly felt dark and cold. Agatha realized that the roaring in her ears was now accompanied by the absolute absence of the sound of birds, insects, or rustling leaves.</p><p>There was a sound like fabric tearing. A figure, cloaked in green, appeared on the edge of the clearing.</p><p>Agatha panicked, and turned to run, her heart in her throat.</p><p>“<em>Wait</em>,” commanded a voice. Agatha felt the word rather than hearing it. It echoed through her rib cage like the beat of a great drum and she froze.</p><p>”<em>Look. See what you have done.</em>” There was something like admiration in the voice, although Agatha could not have said how she could identify admiration in a voice she could not hear. She stared at the cloaked figure, but could not see a face, and did not recognize them, though something niggled at her subconscious… Trembling, but obedient, she turned and looked at the corpse she had made. Prudence was an unrecognizable husk, desiccated and shrunken. Her skin was gray, her eyes staring and accusatory, mouth still wide in that final scream of agony.</p><p>Agatha felt ill, and fell to her knees, slamming hard into the gravel. She tried to focus on the pain in her knees, tried to ground herself. She knew that the other witch would have killed her, but guilt and blame castigated her. She was not supposed to raise a hand to another member of the Coven, even for her own self-preservation. The Coven, the hive, demanded all of her, and would take what they could wring from her, and if she transgressed, she would die. </p><p>But now- she had killed, rather than die for the Coven.</p><p>Her mother would be the one to kill her.</p><p>It was that final thought, and the visual image of Evanora's grim satisfaction as she cast the fatal blow, that decimated the last of Agatha's control. She turned her head and was sick, losing the sour contents of her stomach into the grass of the clearing. She felt a hand on her shoulder; it brushed her hair away from her face.</p><p>”<em>This was not your fault</em>,” that faceless voice said simply into her body, the words penetrating her distress. “<em>Self-preservation, saving yourself, is natural. Death as a result of losing to a stronger foe is natural too</em>.” The hand withdrew. “<em>Look at me, young witch.</em>”</p><p>Agatha looked up into the green cloak.</p><p>She saw there a terrible face, devoid of flesh, muscle or sinew. Without the coverings of life, the face was the stuff of nightmares but compelling all the same. She was fascinated by the terror it inspired in her heart, and the interest it spiked there as well. She did not flinch away- though she felt terror, she did not feel threatened. She felt something else, too- power radiated off this being. Intoxicating, seductive, otherworldly power. And she had felt strength in that hand, fleshless as it was.</p><p>Flushed though she was with the power she had taken from Prudence, Agatha wanted more. She had always coveted power and longed for strength, and now, beside this terrible and wonderful being, she wanted to be closer to all that delicious, enticing power. She could not move away, did not break eye contact. Trembling, she waited for what would come next.</p><p>The empty sockets of the grinning skull below the hood were focused upon her. The mouth did not move, but she heard the voice say, “<em>You are not afraid, though you must know who I am.</em>” </p><p>“You are Death,” Agatha whispered, not bothering to temper the reverence in her voice.</p><p>An impossible chuckle, like the rolling growl of timpani, sent shivers along Agatha’s spine. She clutched at the grass, trying to calm her racing heart.</p><p>”<em>That is one of my names,</em>” the voice drawled, “<em>but I have also been called Reaper.”</em></p><p>“Because you reap life?” Agatha asked hesitantly.</p><p><em>Yes, but I do not kill, I only take a soul leaving this life to the Next place. I am less an executioner than I am a gatherer.” </em> Death surprised Agatha by settling into the grass beside her, and pulling back their hood. In the shadows of the clearing, Agatha took in that face, familiarizing herself with its graceful lines and stark voids.  Agatha wondered if Death, too, felt this pull between them- like kindred spirits, meant to meet, even under these terrible circumstances.</p><p>Death’s mind-speak came again, thrumming behind her breastbone.</p><p><em>“I also participate in the creation of life, as much as I do in the ending of life. I am the guardian of the sacred balance, the one who turns the wheel of the cycle of life.</em>”</p><p>”Creation?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Death held up one skeletal hand, holding it out for her to see a small brown grain. <em>“Death leaves behind a seed,”</em> Between the bleached bones, Agatha watched a tiny seed split, and a vine curl out, expand, sprout leaves, produce a bud, and then burst into riotous bloom.</p><p>“<em>The seed becomes a plant, and blossoms.”</em> The flower was unlike anything Agatha had ever seen before, bright and delicate- white leaves cupped golden, dewy stamens; a pink and purple speckled throat descended to a sharp closed point. The bud was standing as proudly upright as a queen. It was fragrant in the heat, and Agatha could smell its sweet scent even from a distance.</p><p>“<em>In time, the flower dies, and leaves behind a seed.”</em> In their hand, Agatha watched the vine and the flower whither. She immediately mourned its loss, but then, miraculously, it grew again, and blossomed, just as beautifully as before.</p><p>“<em>This cycle is entrusted to my care.”</em></p><p>Agatha stared, mouth agape, eyes wide with wonder and delight. Death held the flower out to her, and she hesitated before taking it, but then reached out and did. Her fingers brushed the bone of one long, thin finger, but she did not feel revulsion or disgust. The bone was dry, somewhat rough, and warmed by the sun. She gazed at the perfect flower in her hand, completely charmed by its beauty. Holding it to her nose, she breathed it in; pollen tickled her nose, and the rich scent of the flower enveloped her, taking her away from this place and her conflicted heart for a brief moment.</p><p>Death slowly pulled their hand back, tucking it below their robe.</p><p>”<em>I must go now, young witch.</em>” If a skull could convey regret, Agatha imagined that would be what she saw on the permanently grinning face as skeletal hands pulled the hood back over their head.</p><p>”Oh-“ Agatha glanced at the fallen form of the witch. She was glad she was already on her knees, as she felt her legs go weak again. The weight of her actions fell on her anew. “I suppose… I must have created more work for you.” She looked down at the ground. “I’m sorry,” she whispered.</p><p>Death said nothing as they stood, but their hand came out from the folds of their robes holding a black knife. The blade was wickedly sharp, and looked as if it had been carved from the horn of a great beast. Agatha did not shrink away from the brandished blade; if it was her time, she would not fight her fate. It had not served her well to do so last time. But she had manners, at least.</p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured to the figure looming above her. “For the flower, and… for comforting me in my last moments.”</p><p>But the knife did not swing down for her; instead, it swung up, and ripped a hole through the air. A path through a dark wood, shrouded in mist, was barely visible to Agatha through the tear. She looked, leaning towards it-</p><p><em>“It is not your time yet, young witch,” </em>rasped that deep voice from inside her. “<em>And it will not be for a long, long time to come.”</em></p><p>Agatha blinked at this pronouncement, but held her tongue, and observed.</p><p>Death turned slowly, black knife raised again, and with a twist of their wrist, the body of the fallen witch became enveloped in a black and green mist, then melted into the earth, leaving behind a patch of grass that looked much like any other grass in the clearing, if a bit greener and better fed.</p><p>Agatha cried out, relief and fear mingling together. She felt overwhelmed, and her eyes welled with tears. Death looked at her again, reaching one white bone finger out to wipe a tear from Agatha’s cheek. She leaned into the touch, knowing instinctively comfort was being offered to her, and that it was rare enough in her day to day life. The bony hand curled into a loose fist, knuckles brushing along her cheekbone, stopping short of her lips. Agatha took in a shuddering breath, and the hand dropped away, one long black sleeve falling over the limb. </p><p>“<em>Death is my bread and butter,</em>” the voice rumbled in her chest. “<em>I love all aspects of life, and death is just one more piece of that.” </em></p><p> Death opened their robe and sheathed their knife; below the robe, Agatha saw more palely glinting bone: ribs, a pelvis. Something dark but sharp glittered in their chest, right where a heart would be- Agatha recognized a fist sized chunk of obsidian, carved into a multi-faceted round shape and bound with black leather. Death rearranged their robes, and Agatha looked away, afraid to be caught staring. </p><p><em>“Do not apologize for clinging to life. I relish your survival as much as I will enjoy your eventual demise.</em>” Another dark chuckle followed this pronouncement, that would have been so terrible from anyone else, but only seemed natural from Death. “<em>I will take this soul home, now.</em>” The robed figure turned its back on Agatha. She stood to watch them go, fighting the urge to follow. Something peaceful tugged at her heart from that space she glimpsed beyond the tear, as if she would find rest and comfort there; but she knew she could not go there, yet. It was not her time.</p><p>The voice, spoken over that green cloaked, boney shoulder, echoed one final time in her chest, seeming to purr: “<em>But perhaps we will see each other again… Agatha Harkness.</em>”</p><p>And Agatha watched, bewildered and awed, as Death departed, followed by the misty figure of Prudence meekly walking behind. The rend in the air closed, and sound rushed back into the clearing. The buzz and hum of insects and the calls of birds felt deafening after the prolonged silence. Agatha stayed seated in the meadow, watching the shadows lengthen as the day slowly died, and thought about Death.</p><p>The flower they gave her never wilted.</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>Agatha returned to the clearing every day after that. She knew she was being watched my one Coven member or another, and even felt herself being followed sometimes, but couldn’t stop going, hoping to see Death again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Prudence was finally missed, someone in the Coven said, “She was seen going on the Boston route. She has a cousin there- she’s just away on a visit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Well, she ought to have told us,” Evanora said officiously. “She’s usually right at my elbow, I’m surprised she never said anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”You know Prudence,” another witch said, “Scattered as a dandelion.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Very well,” Evanora conceded. “Perhaps she will stay there for some time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was the end of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A week previous, Agatha had been in the chicken coop when the delivery of hay arrived. The boy driving the wagon was sweet on her- he blushed as she handed him the coins, and gruffly offered to unload the hay himself every time, saying, “Your hands are too soft for farm labor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knew it was a lie, but encouraged the flirting.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Charity Green peeked around the corner of the barn, thinking a water barrel concealed her plump form. It did not, Agatha thought unkindly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”How are the roads these days, Mr. Matthew?” Agatha offered a conversational opening to the boy, knowing he was longing to talk to her. He stopped his work, removing his cap to lean against the wagon. Agatha grinned as he peacocked, watching that oh-so-satisfying blush spread over those downy cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”I don’t find them too bad, miss, not out the Boston way, at least. They always keep that track well groomed.” He turned his head and spat, eloquently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pretended to care, saying, “I am relieved to hear it, for my dear friend, Goody Prudence, set out on the Boston route to visit her cousin early yesterday morning. I do hope her journey is going well, as she planned to walk until she could secure a ride.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Matthew nodded sagely, and said, “She’s sure to have arrived by now, Miss. And will have made good time, as sure as anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, moved closer, and touched one dusty sleeve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Thank you kindly, Matthew. You bring me great comfort.” She looked deeply into his brown eyes. His freckled cheeks went pink again, and he cleared his throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Always happy to be of service, Miss Agatha.” He smiled at her queasily, then gathered his hat and his dignity, and took off down the road with his horse and cart.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Flicking her eyes at the water barrel, Agatha saw Charity Green retreating, failing at being sneaky, but it did not matter. She’d served her purpose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a satisfaction, seeing the threads of her cover up knit neatly together. Her secret was safe, for now. She’d be all the more cautious going forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even as she continued to break the spirit of the Coven’s rules, if not the letter of them, Agatha became the shining example of a model initiate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Seeking to make a place for herself where the need was greatest, she began ingratiating herself with the young mothers of the coven; their husbands were often at sea, working at fishing or trading or taking a stint in the navy. The Coven shared the duties of childcare, but there were never enough hands and always too many tiny bundles of chaos and mischief. So Agatha began to mind the little ones while their mothers went to the training hall or the fields. She was an excellent nanny. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She spent her time telling the toddlers and babies stories of great witches now gone, and swept the hair away from their smooth brows as they fell asleep in the nursery they stayed in during the day. She was enchanted by their innocence, and grew to love them each for their own little personalities- this one quiet, preferring not to be noticed, like a little mouse. That one, with a quick temper, always coiled to strike, like a hatchling snake. Another, with big eyes, always watching her and taking her movements in, like a small owl. And the rest- each energetic, some precocious, and all precious to her in an unfamiliar, aching way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After feeding them lunch each day, she’d tuck them into their cots, and sing them a wordless song. The notes descended, stayed low and soothing. Thumbs would find little mouths, and eyes would grow heavy and droop. This was not magic, Agatha knew, but when she ran one finger across the silky back of a fat little fist, or kissed a chubby cheek, or rested her chin on a milky smelling head, she felt a warm buzz in the same place she felt her magic- as if her heart was squeezing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The mothers were endlessly grateful to return home from a hard day of work to find their children happy and tractable (as much as babies and toddlers can be tractable).</span>
</p><p>
<span>Some in the Coven became unsure, now, that Agatha was as Evanora had been making her out to be. Those closest to her mother never wavered in their mistrust of her, but there was no outward sign of anything untoward in Agatha. She spent a lot of time alone, yes- but she’d been ostracized, and they all knew it. Who wouldn’t want a reprieve from being alone and always being watched?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha may not have been a green witch, but she knew how to sow and nurture the seeds of doubt, and the seeds of deception, and she did so masterfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The seasons changed, and Agatha volunteered to mend cloaks, secretly sketching the runes and wards stitched into their linings into her notebook before returning the garments, laundered and renewed. Her mends were strong and blended well, and more Coven members visited her, bringing stockings, skirts, dresses. She mended them all happily, seeing the charms to strengthen the heel of a stocking and learning it, or noticing the tricky one that repelled water from a skirt and mud from a petticoat while keeping the appearance of some soiling to avoid the wearer appearing to be suspiciously clean- the masterful tactic keeping the wearer warm and dry but offering the illusion of reasonable soiling. The magic glowed to her, and when she saw it, touched it, she could pull it apart, understand it, replicate it. And she could learn it.</span>
</p><p>--</p><p>
<span>It was January before she realized why Death had not returned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next time she was followed, she allowed it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The witch trailing behind her was new to the Coven- an unheard of adoptee from another Coven down the coast. Agatha did not have any strong feelings towards her one way or another, but Evanora had taken a liking to the girl, and had allowed her to skip over the usual initiate stage and join the witches of the Coven in their training and learning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was still waiting for that honor to be bestowed upon her, but had begun losing hope that the day would ever come for her. She was nearly seventeen, now; no witch had ever remained an initiate beyond the age of eighteen- Agatha only knew of one witch who had failed to be inducted into the Coven. She had been cast out and driven away. Agatha suspected she may have been killed, quietly, later. Evanora liked the Coven to keep their hands clean, and maintain the appearance of being light magic users. But Agatha knew better- she had smelled Death on her mother, and she smelled it on Virginia, trailing behind her, as the wind shifted and carried the scent so imprinted upon Agatha’s memory towards her as she walked ahead, never pausing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Agatha,” the witch called out to her, “What chore brings you out into the wood today?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned, hands in fists, “My travels are none of your concern, Virginia.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Virginia let out an exaggerated gasp. “Is that any way for an </span>
<em>
<span>initiate</span>
</em>
<span> to speak to a coven member?” She clasped her hands dramatically. “What would your mother think of this, I wonder?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gritted her teeth, replying as calmly as she could, “Surely my mother would have no reservations about me taking exercise after all my chores have been completed.” She turned, prepared to continue walking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve been watching you, you know,” Virginia hissed, gliding closer. “We know you’re up to something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She circled Agatha, cutting off her escape. “Some even say,” she whispered, conspiratorially, “That you know what happened to poor, dear, Prudence.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”She left,” Agatha said automatically. “I saw her on the road, walking the Boston route.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Virginia grinned slyly. “I wonder, little witch, if that’s really true.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made to step around her, but the other witch ripped at her cloak, and the spell book fell to the ground between them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a horrible, endless moment of silence, and then Virginia chuckled. “Well, well, well, Agatha. I will have </span>
<em>
<span>quite</span>
</em>
<span> the story to share with your mother. I wonder how she’ll punish you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snatched up the book, growling at Virginia, “I have every right to have this book. It is my birthright.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Virginia laughed. “Don’t you get it, yet, Agatha? They’re never going to teach you magic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She poked Agatha in the chest, “You’re-” poke “too-” poke “dangerous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Bile rose in Agatha’s throat, and she forced out, “That’s not true, I don’t believe-“</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Evanora told me.” Virginia’s voice was so breezy for someone who was destroying Agatha’s whole world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”She said you’re too unpredictable, too ruled by your emotions.” Virginia sneered. “She’s too afraid you’ll go dark.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha heard a ringing in her ears. She needed to get away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Maybe,” she said in a menacing voice, hoping to scare Virginia, “I already have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she began walking away, turning her back to the other witch. She half hoped Virginia would leave, but knew what kind of witch Virginia was- eager to feel powerful by standing on the necks of fallen witches, especially those weaker- the "easy" prey.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Virginia attacked, striking Agatha in the back with a blast meant to disable her. The blow knocked her off her feet, but she did not fall, held aloft by the umbilicus of Virginia’s power pouring into Agatha’s body. That familiar purple misty energy filled Agatha’s senses, overwhelming her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped aloud, twisting her body in midair to face Virginia as that same euphoria she remembered from Prudence filled her veins. Agatha began laughing, incandescent with the feeling. Her laugh covered Virginia’s anguished cry, until both sounds were cut short when Agatha completely drained the other witch’s power stores. Agatha drifted back to earth, chest heaving, face flushed. Her singed fingers balled into fists, dismissing the pain of the burns as minor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once again, Agatha stood over a twisted corpse. She felt filled with light, absolutely overflowing with power.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the sun dimmed, the wind stilled, and the sound of fabric tearing cut through the air, she turned towards the robed figure, a helpless, gleeful smile stretched across her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death’s amused chuckle sounded through Agatha, and she reveled in the lingering feeling of all that </span>
<em>
<span>power</span>
</em>
<span> coursing through her, and now, of the presence of more power- not power she could ever possess, but still drawing her in, making her want to be closer to this mysterious green robed figure.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Hello little witch,”</span>
</em>
<span> Death’s voice rumbled through her again. Agatha closed her eyes, flexing her singed fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Hello, Reaper. It’s been a while,” she said, opening her eyes and fixing her gaze on the shadow beneath the robe. “You didn’t come back,” she said, realizing it sounded like a challenge but not caring.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”</span>
<em>
<span>You didn’t kill anyone until just now,” </span>
</em>
<span>Death’s rumbling voice was snarky. Agatha huffed and crossed her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Did you see what happened?” Agatha asked, voice wary. What would Death think, she wondered- that this was on purpose?</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>”I saw her strike out at you, yes.”</span>
</em>
<span> Death sighed. “</span>
<em>
<span>She has taken her own share of lives, and she intended to take yours.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried not to bristle. “You couldn’t have warned me?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>”It is not in my nature to interfere.”</span>
</em>
<span> Death demurred. “</span>
<em>
<span>And,” </span>
</em>
<span>they hedged, “</span>
<em>
<span>I thought you might be able to handle it</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed. “Took a bit of a risk there, although I suppose you win either way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death shrugged their boney shoulders. “</span>
<em>
<span>I win, either way. In fact, I always win. I am death.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>”Cocky of you, but true,” Agatha conceded. She looked at Virginia’s crumpled form, then turned away, not wanting to see any longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Agatha fixed the hooded figure with a grin. “Murder. Is that the only way you’ll visit me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death cocked their head, the movement causing the hood to fall back. “</span>
<em>
<span>No… I suppose I’d come for other reasons.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened up. “Like what? Animal sacrifices?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The chuckle from death made Agatha’s stomach swoop. “</span>
<em>
<span>Bloodthirsty little witch… no, no- I do not only appear to take life. Some foolish witches have the audacity to summon me;”</span>
</em>
<span> Death bristled. “</span>
<em>
<span>They expect me to come when called, as if I am a dog.”</span>
</em>
<span> There was a snarl in the rumble, and Agatha shivered at it.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I come to bring life, as well. That moment when a life enters the world…” </span>
</em>
<span>Death trailed off; “</span>
<em>
<span>Those souls are mine to care for, too.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shuddered. “Well I can’t very well hang around someone’s bedchamber while they give birth. And I don’t want to summon you, not that I know how- it does seem undignified.” Agatha shrugged. “I guess we will have to wait for chance to bring us this opportunity, then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death watched her, dark sockets steady on her face. </span>
<em>
<span>“You feel… compelled to see me again?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, bitterly. “I know, I must be wicked, or evil, as my mother suspects.” She shook her head, ran a hand through her hair. “I’m lonely, and alone, so much- and I don’t know why, but I don’t feel that…” She looked up, marshaling her courage, “I don’t feel that around you. You make me feel- alive, energized.” She threw her hands up, trying to break the tension. “Hell, it’s probably just the high from getting all juiced up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death rumbled, wordlessly, something that was maybe a chuckle and maybe a throat being cleared where no throat existed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, and changed the subject. “It still feels…bad. To take a life. Not actually doing it,” she waved a dismissive hand, “That’s easy. In fact, it’s addictive. I don’t think I can fully control it, though. But I also feel terrible. Why is that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Death’s turn to sigh, a dark rush of the sound of air in a big open space seemed to fill the clearing. “</span>
<em>
<span>You witches are long lived, but still mortal. You understand that life is precious because it is finite.”</span>
</em>
<span> Death raised their hands, mimicking a scale tilting one way, another, steadying to evenly settled.</span>
<em>
<span> “I said once that you would naturally cling to life. This is as it should be.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed on hand through her hair again, leaving it in disarray. She felt Death watching her movements. “Damned inconvenient,” she muttered, pacing in a circle. “I wish I could see things as you do, to understand them…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She whirled around suddenly, gauging Death’s mood, their stance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Could you teach me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death turned to look at Virginia, still lying, unattended to, on the ground. They turned back to Agatha, motioning at the still form. “</span>
<em>
<span>I cannot teach you, little witch- it is not allowed. I know things you should never find out.” </span>
</em>
<span>Death hesitated.</span>
<em>
<span> </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>‘I suppose,” </span>
</em>
<span>the voice was a whisper now</span>
<em>
<span>, “That as Evanora has been negligent in her obligations to you-“</span>
</em>
<span> Agnes started, shocked. “You know my mother?” She demanded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Death inclined their head. “</span>
<em>
<span>Evanora summons me, and I sometimes come. When I feel like it, and when she asks nicely.”</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind was spinning. “You know she hasn’t been teaching me?” Agatha’s voice was carefully controlled, but angry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”</span>
<em>
<span>I do,” </span>
</em>
<span> rumbled Death.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”But- why?” Agatha asked, anguished. “She won’t tell me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”</span>
<em>
<span>I suspect she has some idea of what you are capable of.” </span>
</em>
<span>Death’s gaze on her sharpened, as if they were looking into her, seeing all the paths of possibility, ruin and fortune alike, that stretched before her.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“And she realizes that you will become a very powerful witch.”</span>
</em>
<span> Death lifted their hands, and pulled down their robe’s hood. </span>
<em>
<span>“I think she is making a mistake- not training you is dangerous, for you and for all the lives around you, and for the sacred balance.” </span>
</em>
<span>Death let out a hissing whoosh of air, and all the bare branches of the trees shuddered. They reached into their robes, and Agatha expected the knife again, but this time, it was a pocket watch, darkly glinting gold, that they took out, consulted, and put away below their robes again. Death straightened, and seemed to have come to a decision.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>I will teach you, Agatha Harkness. But it will not be child’s play. You will need to work.” </span>
</em>
<span>The head on the bare neck twisted, stretching muscles that weren't there, as if limbering up for a serious undertaking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Anything,” Agatha gasped out. “I’m burning from the inside out every day that I cannot practice my magic. I will do anything you ask of me. I would pay any price.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death inclined their head. “</span>
<em>
<span>Very well. Your first lesson starts now.”</span>
</em>
<span> Death’s hand rose, and their hand turned over and opened to reveal a small stone.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>”Make the stone hover, without using your hands. The only tool you need is your mind. You will do this until you can hover the stone at any height you choose.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha protested, “I have already mastered levitation. I’m ready to move on.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I know you are a fighter, little witch. But do not fight me on this.”</span>
</em>
<span> Death chuckled. “</span>
<em>
<span>I have seen many a witch die for want of mastering the basics. Witches are not ducks- they are not born knowing how to swim without sinking.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded tentatively. “So in this scenario, are you my mother duck?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death chuckled, darkly rejoining, </span>

<span>“Do as I say, or I will leave you to Evanora.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flipped her cloak away from her right shoulder, then reached out and took the stone. She set it on the ground and sat cross-legged, staring at it. Death watched for a moment, before turning to gather Virginia and return her body to the Earth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Death turned back, Agatha had a very wobbly stone floating a mere inch above the ground, but it was floating nonetheless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death grumbled their approval. “</span>
<em>
<span>Keep doing this. I will return in three days.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And thus began Death’s tutelage of Agatha Harkness.</span>

<p>The small huddle of Coven witches near the well were whispering as Agatha approached, fear making their voices sharp and fast.</p><p>“-last seen outside the walls the day before last, yes-” one witch said, “and hasn’t been seen since then.”</p><p>“But where would Virginia go?” asked another, anxiously twisting a handkerchief, “She told me she has no other friends, no relations.”</p><p>“No,” the first witch said, “But have you heard about the witch hunters in Boston-?”</p><p>“HUSH,” an older witch hissed, “You’ll call ill fortune down upon all our heads…”</p><p>Agatha did not join them, knowing they’d scatter if she tried. She pulled her water up from the well and continued on her way, casting her gaze at her feet as if she shared the burden of worry the rest of the coven carried.</p><p>Virginia’s disappearance had the Coven on edge all over again. Whispers of witch hunters, scared and shrill, caught Agatha’s notice from the huddles of Coven members.</p><p>“I cannot use the same story as I did for Prudence,” she mused, looking at her face in the mirror, practicing bewilderment, worry, sadness. The candles flickered, and out of the corner of her eye, she’d seen her mother’s shelf of spell books flicker in and out of view, and just like that she’d come up with another plan.</p><p>In the hours after her death, Agatha has snuck into Virginia’s temporary quarters, packed her belongings, and taken them out to the woods, burying them deep underground.</p><p>Then, she’d gone to her own home, and stolen one of Evanora’s spellbooks. Wrapping it carefully in an oilcloth, she stored it in the hollow of a tree near her clearing.</p><p>Her mother’s discovery of the theft had necessitated a Coven gathering, and it was there that Evanora herself was the one to spread the falsehood about Virginia.</p><p>“Sisters,” she’d hissed to the gathered huddle, “We have been ill-used, and taken advantage of by one we sought to bring into our hearts. Virginia stole from me, and from all of you. The knowledge she took was the work of another witch’s lifetime, and cannot be replaced.” Evanora’s voice rose over the murmurs of the gathering. “There is no witch hunter. There was only simple greed, and treacherous deception.”</p><p>Agatha watched from the back of the gathering, seeing robed heads nod in agreement.</p><p>“From this day forward, Virginia is no longer welcome in our midst. She will not be missed, and will not be mourned. We turn inward, and care for our own.”</p><p>Affirmative cries came from all gathered, and Agatha joined in.</p><p>The Coven moved on. </p><p>—</p><p>Agatha laughed aloud as she managed to whip Death’s robes up and into disarray, the wind she’d called up responding to her commands.</p><p>“<em>Focus, </em> ” came the gravelly voice below her breastbone, but Agatha could hear the humor in that voice. “ <em> Show me more levitation.” </em></p><p>Obeying, Agatha lifted three apples from the ground, sending them hurtling towards the shrouded figure of Death. None struck their target, as a flick of Death’s wrist sent them away, and Agatha scowled, re-capturing two apples. Planting her feet, she froze one in midair, and brought the other rocketing towards the blind spot between Death’s shoulder blades. At the last minute, she split the apple in half. Death rebuffed one piece, but the other caught them by surprise, making contact with their shoulder.</p><p>“<em>Good effort,” </em> Death said, unruffled. </p><p>These practical lessons involved Death testing the skills they’d asked Agatha to practice, calling on her to apply them to fights, self-defense, and creative spell-casting. Agatha found it a great improvement from reading her mother’s books and trying to imagine how to apply the magic described in the text drenched pages.</p><p>“<em>Now we will practice new forms that will give you more control over the power you are expending,” </em> Death said, moving closer to Agatha, until they were two paces apart.</p><p>“<em>Follow my lead, </em>” Death settled into a pose, one elbow pointing up, hands hovering close together, fingers arranged carefully, and Agatha mirrored them, trying to replicate what she saw down to the last crooked finger joint.</p><p>“<em>Next form,” </em> Death said, gracefully shifting their body. Agatha saw the movement and tried to copy it, but couldn’t quite get the positioning of her lower arm correct.</p><p>Death came closer, taking her elbow gently into their hand and repositioning her. Agatha closed her eyes, trying to commit the position to memory. She shifted into the first position again, then moved again. Death moved around behind her, settling their arms and hands over hers. </p><p><em> “You just need to move this arm a bit more this way- and the other comes up to meet it- </em>”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed in concentration, steadfastly ignoring the way her body was aware of Death’s proximity, of the power that thrummed through her from them wherever their bodies touched.</p><p>“<em>Good, </em> ” Death murmured, and Agatha bit her lip, willing a shiver away. “<em>Next form will need you to lift-” </em> instead of moving away to demonstrate again, Death guided her body through the next series of forms.</p><p>-–</p><p>The first time Death took her with them for work, Agatha wasn’t sure what to expect. Death had agreed that her lessons should include insight into the sacred balance, as a sort of re-education of what life and the end of it meant from a cosmic viewpoint.</p><p><em> “You will remain with me below my cloak, </em> ” Death rumbled. <em> “Our only job… is to observe, and to clean up afterwards.” </em></p><p>Agatha had stepped beneath the cloak. Death wrapped a protective arm around her middle, their hand resting on her hip. The cloak was heavy, and warm. It smelled of lavender, and fresh hay, and of the cool, fresh air of night. After a time, Agatha wrapped her arm around Death, mirroring their position with her hand on their pelvis. Death did not object, and they stepped forward through a tear in the air.</p><p>The scene was a naval battle. A poorly armed merchant ship was up against a Spanish warship. This was not the clean, quick death Agatha had seen and caused. This was violent, and chaotic, and terrifying. But within Death’s grasp, wrapped in their cloak, she witnessed.</p><p>For this occasion, Death held their green torch aloft, standing at the end of a dock shrouded in mist. “<em> They will appreciate the feeling of solid wood one more time without the pitch and toss of the ocean beneath their feet,” </em> Death whispered through her, <em> “Before they leave this plane. It will feel like coming home after a long time at sea.” </em></p><p>Agatha knew this was thoughtful, and a kindness. She hadn’t expected this level of compassion, or of consideration- that Death would offer comfort in a situation where they held all the power, where they would not receive anything in return. She gazed up at the being holding her, taking in this new information. Feeling it settle somewhere within her that was scarred, but still soft and tender.</p><p>Returning her gaze to the battle, she felt the weight of this work the way a mortal afraid of death does. Despair, anger, sadness, disbelief all warred within her. But as men streamed past, treading the wood boards of the dock and leaving their bodies, broken and ruined, on the decks of their ships, she saw their faces were peaceful.</p><p>”Is it magic,” she asked, “Making them feel peace?”</p><p><em> ”No,” </em> rumbled Death <em> , “I believe it is knowing that they are going on to the Next place.” </em></p><p>Death’s voice was tender, now, as it rumbled in her bones. “<em> They know that they won’t wander, alone, in the dark.” </em>Death held their torch aloft, higher. Their arm around Agatha tightened the slightest bit.</p><p>Agatha thought about that moment for a very, very long time.</p><p>-</p><p>Flying was the lesson Agatha was most excited for. She met Death on a night with a full moon.</p><p><em> “Find a stout tree branch, and decorate it to make it pleasing to the eye,” </em> Death’s voice echoed into her chest. “ <em> This will be your first lesson in applying the hovering skill in a more permanent fashion.” </em></p><p>Agatha found vines of ivy and sprigs of wildflowers, and twined them around the still leafy branch she’d found.</p><p><em> “Now, we do the ritual, and speak the spell: hoteh, delecta, aperio, wyohw;” </em> Death glided around Agatha, their broom-end pressed against hers on the ground, forming a v-shape as they walked in a circle, once. Death handed their broom to Agatha. She saw that it was covered in small purple blooms, and that moss had sprouted along its center. Agatha grinned, pleased.</p><p>“Violets?” She asked.</p><p>Death nodded, once, and ducked their head as they mounted the broom Agatha had made them. </p><p>“<em>Imagine lifting, and forward motion-” </em> The cloaked form of Death was suddenly airborne. Agatha did her best to follow suit. Her toes brushed the dew-wet grass as she finally began to gain height. She caught up with Death quickly, smiling and laughing at the beautiful feeling of the full moon on her face, and the wind in her hair, blowing the loose waves behind her.</p><p>She looked over at Death to see them looking at her, one hand pressed to their chest over the top of their cloak.</p><p>“Come here often?” Agatha asked with a smirk, hearing Death’s rumbling laughter echo through her chest.</p><p>“<em>Not for decades,” </em> Death replied, sounding wistful. “<em>There hasn’t been a need…” </em></p><p>Agatha grinned at them. “What about the need to feel all this?” She asked, getting cocky and releasing one white knuckled grip to motion at the moon and the stars in the clear sky above them. “What about just for fun, for joy?” She asked.</p><p>Death didn’t answer, but they leaned back on their broom, both arms out in the air, head tilted up to the heavens.</p><p>Their hood fell back, taking the folds covering Death’s shoulders and their chest with it. Their ribcage now bare, Agatha could see that intriguing black obsidian shape where their heart should be.</p><p>In the moonlight, Agatha saw it beat, slowly: once, twice, three times. Death pulled their robe back up around their shoulders. </p><p><em> Had their heart always beat like that? </em> Agatha wondered, but couldn’t ask.</p><p>Instead, she smiled at them and, with a challenge in her voice asked, “Shall we race, Reaper?”</p><p>Instead of responding, Death leaned low over their broom handle, and shot forward.</p><p>Agatha followed suit, laughing as she urged her broom to go faster, faster.</p><p>Her heart raced, pounding so loud she could have sworn it was audible to all as she and Death chased each other across the moon’s lovely face. </p><p>—</p><p><em> “Mind control,” </em> Death’s voice murmured through Agatha’s ribcage, “ <em> Should only be used sparingly on other humans, and other higher animals. They will tear themselves apart trying to regain control, so you must be delicate.” </em></p><p>Death’s hand appeared from under their robes, holding a beetle caged in the closed bones of their fist. </p><p>“<em>Creatures like this, small and short lived, already bow to the commands of their biology and have little free will of their own. They are easier to control, to read, and to keep command of.” </em> </p><p>The beetle in Death’s hand responded to some unheard command from Death and flew over to alight on Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“<em>Probe the beetle’s mind with your own, gently- imagine a feather brushing over the surface.” </em></p><p>Agatha did as she was asked, shuddering as her mind brushed the alien mind of the beetle. She heard sounds: vegetation being chewed, wings whirring through the air, the quiet, determined shush of the beetle crawling through moss. There were visual memories too, light one moment, dark another, and vague feelings- hunger, fear, bind elation. Agatha pulled back, seeing to put some distance between herself and the beetle, not wanting to get too enmeshed. </p><p>“<em>Good, now suggest an action to the beetle,” </em> Death murmured. </p><p>“Fly,” whispered Agatha, and the beetle did. “And return,” Agatha whispered. Slowly, drunkenly, the beetle loop-de-looped its way back to her palm.</p><p>“I’m not sure this will be my favorite type of magic,” Agatha admitted to Death. “I feel guilt at taking the creature’s free will away, little though it may have.”</p><p><em> “There will come a time.” </em> Death responded grimly, “ <em> that this skill will save your life. As it has saved many witches before you. Witches that would have died on the pyre, or drowned in the ocean, or hanged until dead, have been able to capture one mind or many, and changed the will of the mob. We will continue to practice.” </em></p><p>“I understand,” Agatha said, probing the beetle’s mind again. This time, there was another presence there with her, dark and large.</p><p>“Is that… you?” Agatha asked, looking up into Death’s face. </p><p>“<em>The flip side of mind control is protecting your own mind from others,” </em> Death responded calmly, their hollow gaze meeting hers. “ <em> We will use the beetle as a third space to protect the sanctity of our minds as we train. You do not want me in your head, young witch. And I do not want you in mine.” </em> Agatha nodded, and the presence beside her inside the beetle’s mind became sharper, somehow insistent, and probed her mind gently. </p><p>“<em>Imagine yourself closed to the outside world tightly. </em> ” Death instructed. “ <em> My first layer is an eggshell, free of gaps or cracks, difficult to get a grasp on. And I layer on from there. Whatever is strongest, or most difficult to break through or wear away. Brick, steel, wood- try anything you’d like. And I will try to breach it.” </em></p><p>Agatha imagined her mind safe within the shell of an egg, and then she pictured the breastplate of a suit of armor, shining and strong, surrounding that. Outside of her new defenses, she felt Death’s mind testing different points, looking for entry. </p><p>
<em> “This is the feather brushing we discussed. The full force attack of a trained assailant will be worse and feel painful. Brace yourself-” </em>
</p><p>Death’s feather touch on the fortifications of her mind became a crushing, targeted blow, and Agatha could not maintain her perimeters. The spiked intrusion fell through the layers as if they were not there, and suddenly Agatha was watching her own memory of being whipped as her mother watched, grim satisfaction apparent on her face. </p><p>Death withdrew immediately, leaving behind an impression of rage Agatha was sure did not belong to her. </p><p>For a moment, neither spoke. Agatha shook with the memories of the pain and betrayal of that day, but through gritted teeth she said, “Again.”</p><p>"<em>First, gather yourself back together. Add more layers, more distance. Tell me when you’re ready.” </em></p><p>Agatha growled, “I said I’m ready, try again.”</p><p>Death hesitated, but then their attack returned, blunted but still strong.</p><p>Agatha lasted longer this time, but soon, she fell to her knees as Death broke through again.</p><p>This time, it was a flood of painful memories, instead of just one; every time Evanora had rebuffed affection from Agatha; every time Agatha had seen disappointment on her mother’s face. Each unkind word from a Coven member that reached Agatha, and that she knew had come from Evanora. And finally, Agatha’s worst memory- seeing Virginia’s body twisted in the dirt, and knowing Evanora had tasked her with spying on Agatha- with killing her if it came to that.</p><p>From her place on the ground, Agatha choked out a sob, and suddenly, she <em> shoved </em> the presence from her mind. And Death left, but returned, probing the new, perfectly smooth barrier Agatha had thrown up in desperation.</p><p><em> ”Very good, Agatha,” </em> Death commented. <em> “Tell me when you are ready to go again.” </em></p><p>Gathering her strength, Agatha stood, brushing off her skirts. She squared her shoulders, imagined layer upon layer of barriers- braided bramble fencing like the farmers used for penning in bulls; ocean waves crashing and driving back anything they encountered; the cool silver glass of a mirror you could never see beyond, no matter how near your eyes got; a thick wall of smoke, choking and blinding; whatever material her mother’s heart was made of, for surely it was not flesh and blood; and that rage and anger and sadness Evanora’s memory in Agatha always invoked, woven into something solid. Agatha gathered them all to her, shaped them around the tender places of her mind, and her heart, and braced.</p><p>”Ready,” she said.</p><p>This attack was not like the others. It did not crash, stab, or tear; it crept around like morning mist, icy fingers trailing and disappearing. Agatha recognized that this would be a test of her stamina, to see how long she could hold out, so she sat back mentally, and waited.</p><p>The misty fingers grew warmer, until they were hot, burning the outer limits of her awareness. </p><p>“Will others really attack me like this, Reaper?” Agatha asked, eyes closed in concentration.</p><p><em> ”Your weakness is not that you do not expect brute force, attacks, and pain, Agatha.” </em> Death’s responding rumble came. <em> “It is that you are ill equipped for kindness. </em>”</p><p>Agatha realized a warm tendril had found a crack that seemed to have appeared when Death spoke the word, ‘kindness.’</p><p>Comforting warmth surrounded her awareness, and she almost forgot to fight back, almost did not want to. But then Death began rifling through a new set of memories, none of these stained with tears or pain-</p><p>“No-“ Agatha gasped, as Death pulled up memories of their training together, lingering over the humor, the happiness, the absolute lack of fear-</p><p>“<em>Throw me out, Agatha,” </em> Death urged, but did not stop their onslaught. </p><p>They’d gone deeper, pulled up countless moments when Agatha was looking at Death- Death, appearing out of the dark before flying, Death with the sun behind them, glowing with gold, Death’s voice in all its rumbling, bone shaking beauty- and with each image, the emotion behind it, raw and undeniable: Agatha’s admiration, and respect; her desire to know and understand; and worst of all, the gut punch of tenderness towards the only being to ever treat Agatha as if she were worth anything. Last and worst, her memories of Death's hands on her, and the buzz that always woke every nerve ending, the hunger for more, the devastation of knowing it was impossible.</p><p>And layered over every memory was the sound of a heart, beating fast, and faster-</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stand allowing Death to see this, to know how flawed and weak she was, to understand how her twisted heart longed to belong somewhere, with someone...</p><p>”No!” Agatha shouted, and managed to throw them out of her mind, and slam her defenses back into place. And suddenly, she was back in the beetle’s mind, aware of Death still there beside her, but they were not probing at her mind any longer.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, pulled herself back into her own head, and tried to speak, to explain- but Death was already turning away, already moving towards the vanishing point.</p><p>“<em>Very good, </em> ” Death’s whisper came, but it seemed subdued. “<em>Practice this skill, we will train more later.” </em> Death turned without another word, and their knife flashed out, ripping a pathway for them to the Other place.</p><p>Alone in the gathering dusk, Agatha opened her fist and watched the beetle fly away, unharmed.</p><p>She sat in the meadow until well after dark, crafting layer upon layer around her mind, and burying her secrets beneath the fortress.</p><p>

<p>
<span>Shapeshifting was not something Agatha had ever had a chance to witness, or to try for herself. But that was to be her lesson for the day. She had a chicken with her for the purpose; it clucked fretfully within the basket she carried. She’d chosen one of the bigger birds, a subpar layer with a brawler’s attitude. She hoped the chicken would live through the day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the clearing, she freed it to scratch around, keeping it close to her with some gentle persuasion layered over its minuscule mind. She could do that, now, even without an incantation. She felt her power growing daily, knew her skills were sharpening, being honed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha heard the telltale sound of Death’s arrival, and she turned to look for them. Death was lurking in the deep shadows of the forest, refusing to step into the sun. Agatha tried not to roll her eyes; the more time she spent with the- deity? Being? Force of nature? The more she was convinced that they were masters of the melodramatic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”</span>
<em>
<span>The form I bear,” </span>
</em>
<span>came the rumbling voice of Death, vibrating through her ribs</span>
<em>
<span>, “Is one of my own choosing. It is timeless, classic; a nod to all of us becoming dust in the wind.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>”I see we are feeling ourselves today,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”</span>
<em>
<span>But I have worn other forms, and borne other faces,”</span>
</em>
<span> Death continued, ignoring the interruption. “</span>
<em>
<span>Today, I will show you.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Death stepped forward into the light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had convinced herself she wouldn’t be shocked, wouldn’t show any outward sign of being impressed or surprised. After all, Death usually wandered around as a six foot tall bare skeleton draped in voluminous magical green robes- what could be more impressive than that?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death now appeared before her as a woman; still draped in a long, green robe, their form was shorter now; slender in build, but substantive in presence. Death now had bronzed skin, long, dark hair falling softly in waves to their shoulders, and hazel eyes lined in black that met Agatha’s directly, not breaking contact, just as they’d always done in their previous form. Red stained lips parted in a smile over even, white teeth. The tan skin of their neck continued down, down- Agatha realized they were still not wearing anything under their cloak. She snapped her eyes up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”So you see,” continued Death, with their new lips. “I can also appear… human.” That voice, low and sure, still carried an echo of the rumble Agatha knew so well, but now it had depth it had lacked before- there was emotion, and a musical quality about the way they spoke now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to respond, realized it was already hanging open, shut it, coughed, choked, coughed again, and finally managed to say, “Wow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death laughed; for a moment, Agatha felt bereft at not feeling that laughter rumbling through her chest. But there were so many new things to take in, like those crinkled hazel eyes, sparkling with laughter, and the pink in those cheeks.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Death’s new form was beautiful. Agatha couldn’t look away from the way the sun fell across the dark head, lighting up each strand, as if underlining how incredible and magical the simple existence of each one was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Watch out,” Death said, “Your cock is getting away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sputtered out a shocked “I beg your pardon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death just grinned and pointed to the chicken making a break for it through the woods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”It’s a hen!” Agatha said indignantly, beginning to run after it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Yeah, and you’re a witch!” Death said, cackling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Oh.” Agatha stopped running, raised one hand, and convinced the chicken that the meadow was a great place to be, actually. Not reeking of mortality at all! Lots of bugs to eat….</span>
</p><p>
<span>The chicken was back, and Agatha was staring again. Death seemed to be struggling with their (her?) new hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stupid…human…hair,” Death muttered, pushing their rapidly tangling nest of hair one way, then the other. “Ugh!” Death threw their hands up. “I miss being a fleshless animated skeleton. Bones were never this much work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached forward, tentatively. “Let me show you how to pull it back.” She stepped behind Death, hands reaching to pull those long fingers from that tangled hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then her fingers were in those shining brown locks, smoothing and settling the curves into some semblance of order. She tried to pretend this was any other member of her coven, as familiar and close as a cousin. But her fingers tingled and she was too aware of how soft the strands felt on her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death sighed and leaned their head back against her hands. “Woah,” they chuckled. “I forgot about that part of having skin- feeling.” Agatha bit her lip, pressed the tips of her nails against Death’s scalp. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmm,” They sighed again. “It’s a lot to take in. You all just go around like this, all the time… feeling.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed softly. “We do, for better or worse.” She finally managed to capture all the hair into a simple plait, securing it with a string. She stroked her hands along the sides of their hair, trying to tame any flyaways. Without warning, Death turned around in her arms. Their faces were far too close now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could see every eyelash, name every color in those hazel eyes. She watched white teeth bite down on a full bottom lip, release, and saw the lips curve into a smile. Agatha realized she could smell the warmth of their skin, and something else- how could an immortal being with no true physical form smell like lavender, she wondered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”I knew this would freak you out,” Death laughed. “Seeing me like this. It’s even better than I expected.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They brought their hand up between them and booped Agatha on the nose with one impertinent finger. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Admit it, you’re stunned.” They jumped away suddenly, arms out, spinning in a circle. Agatha remembered breathing, again, finally. She did so greedily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So will there be any teaching today?” she called out after the figure now jumping around the clearing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” Death called out, giddily. “I need to come up with my new persona.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”What the hell,” muttered Agatha. “Ok,” she called out, “Let me know when you’re ready.” She lay down in the sun, letting the grass and the sound of cicadas lull her for a moment, trying to reorganize her thoughts to include this wild new reality where Death had skin. And a face. And hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was just regaining her equilibrium when a body crashed into her. “Whoops, couldn’t find the brakes on this thing-” Agatha wheezed out a breath as an elbow connected with her solar plexus, then choked as a hand brushed the side of her breast as Death tried lifting themselves off of her, but didn’t quite manage it. “Sorry, sorry,” they quipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tangled in their cloak, they fought to free their legs, their knee falling between Agatha’s thighs and accidentally making contact with the apex there. Stunned, Agatha gasped out, “Stop moving right now, damn it!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok,” murmured a voice, directly in her ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Oh-” Agatha huffed out, shivering. “Ok, rule number one, humans need to breathe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Right, I forgot,” Death tumbled off her. They stretched out beside her, turning to look at her. “Hi,” they said, softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Hi,” Agatha said back, reflexively. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Death smiled at her, wide, guileless, then proceeded to turn their head and try to look directly into the sun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”It burns a bit, eh?” Death asked. Agatha slapped a hand over their face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Don’t look directly at it!” She chastened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rule number two, I take it,” Death’s voice came out from her palm, a bit muffled. They licked her hand, and she snatched it away immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”So with this new body,” Agatha asked hesitantly, “Is this all,” she gestured to the form stretched beside her in the grass- “you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”100% me,” Death said cheerily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”You seem… different.” Agatha said. “Is this how you actually are, but it doesn’t come across in the- erm- mind speaking?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Ah, must be,” Death said. “Or I guess maybe the new form just… translates me differently.” Death shrugged. “Not sure, cannot wait to find out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”What’s your name?” Agatha asked, “In this form, what do you want to be called?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Hmmmmmmmm,” Death thought for a moment. “How about Rio? Yeah, that feels right- Rio Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want to be called…. river of life?” Agatha deadpanned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Hey, don’t say it like that.” Rio frowned. “I like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Ok,” Agatha said, trying to be supportive. “I always thought of you as… I don’t know, not bound by the normal rules of gender. Is that still the case, or are you thinking of yourself as something else now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Definitely thinking ‘girl’,” Rio answered decisively. “That feels right. Lady Death, rocking a new hot bod.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. “Ah. Got it, thanks for sharing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”No really,” Rio jumped up. “I’m a total babe now, right?” She stripped off her robe and stood, gloriously naked, in the sun. She held her arms out, staring at Agatha expectantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Aha, yup,” Agatha said. Her mouth was dry. Weird.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stretched her robe out in the sun, and lay down on it, still naked. “The sun feels so good on my skin,” she hummed out, sighing happily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was trying to be respectful and not look. She could just look at Rio’s face. Looking. Respectfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was failing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Uh, I have to- the chicken- I’m going to get the chicken back home.” She said, rushing to gather up her belongings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok,” Rio said, sounding sleepy. Agatha hesitated. She shook out her cloak, gently laying it over the length of Rio’s bare body, covering everything but her head and feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”I don’t know if you can get a sunburn now,” she said to the dozing deity, “but either way, you should probably cover up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Mmph.” Rio said. She rolled onto her side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at that face, so still in repose, and smiled to herself. She hummed all the way home, the chicken meekly following behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>More and more, Agatha thought of her life as being on hold when she wasn’t learning magic, and getting to flex her growing skills. She began going to the meadow at night, and casting spells alone. She wouldn’t go home until the sun began peeking over the trees.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sometimes, Rio would appear just to watch, hanging back in the shadows.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Other times, she would call out suggestions, critiques.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sharper movements, Harkness,” she’d crow, “You’re commanding the magic, not seducing it!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha would stutter and blush, then flip Rio off before trying again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Some nights, they would brew potions together, although that craft was not Agatha’s favorite. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she would bend over a bubbling cauldron, squinting at some wizened old crone’s spidery handwriting in the moonlight and desperately trying to remember whether widdershins was clockwise or counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d cross her fingers and guess, muttering “Stupid forebears, writing their journals in caves, can’t even read their stupid handwriting…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meanwhile Rio cackled over her own cauldron, throwing things in at random until the whole thing either exploded or let out a puff of smoke before resolving into a perfectly brewed potion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Either way, she’d seemed to be having fun.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s favorite thing to do, aside from practicing magic, was to watch Rio interacting with the world in a body she was not fully used to. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Clumsy much?” She would snark when Rio tripped over a root, her coordination not totally up to walking in the dark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Screw you!” Came the response from somewhere on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eating was another thing Agatha hadn’t expected Rio to be unaccustomed to, but upon brief reflection, it made a lot of sense that Death in the form of a skeleton wouldn’t have had any reason to eat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”I don’t need to eat, technically,” Rio said, “but I can now, and I want to try human food.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brought her bread and cheese, easy to steal and smuggle into the forest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”It’s sho goooood,” Rio said through a mouth full of bread. Agatha laughed, and brought her tea, and sweets, and a hot baked potato.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ate it all, begged for more, and promised Agatha all the dark spells and secret knowledge she knew, “For one more chance to experience cheese.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was happy to oblige her, even without bribes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lessons moved more quickly, now, as Agatha had progressed beyond the basics, and had dabbled in many of the different branches magic had to offer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Divination and astrology are your weakest subjects,” Rio had elbowed her, and in a teasing tone of voice, asked, “How will you ever know when it’s your time to meet a tall, dark stranger?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had laughed, and asked, “Didn’t I already do that? How many tall dark strangers does a girl need in her life?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, “Anyway, there’s going to be a meteor shower tonight, so meet me here and we can discuss the fine art of divining your mortal fate by the immortal movements of the cosmos.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snuck out with a thick blanket and some tarts she’d bought for the occasion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She found Rio standing in the middle of the pitch black field; the moon was new, and the stars blazed all the brighter in her absence. Rio’s face was turned up to their cold light, and Agatha watched as a night breeze blew loose strands of Rio’s hair across her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She cleared her throat and Rio spun around, grinning at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She gestured to her cloak, laid out in the grass, and cocked one eyebrow at Agatha, saying, “M’lady,” and bowing dramatically. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but sat down on the cloak. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wearing clothing had been another thing she’d had to get used to- and now she was blushing, because, no, not like that- but Rio had just appeared one day wearing the most incredible gown Agatha had ever seen, and since then she’d always arrived similarly clothed. Tonight, shockingly, Rio wore breeches, a shirt, and a waistcoat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look dashing,” Agatha said, as Rio sat beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Men get to have all the fun in this time period,” Rio complained. “This is way better than petticoats and stays and corsets.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am partial to a good corset,” Agatha mused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eyes on the prize, Harkness,” Rio said, laying back and tugging at Agatha to join her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither woman spoke for a moment, watching the stars wink and shine above, and waiting for the first one to fall.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what lesson am I meant to be learning tonight,” Agatha asked, when listening to the sound of Rio breathing softly next to her got to be too much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a new moon,” Rio began, “And Saturn is in its vacation home in the Maldives, so we may be able to ascertain when the ships of Salem will return from England with that cheese I’ve been dreaming of.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It took Agatha a minute to catch on. She sat up and looked at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t know anything about astrology, do you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cackled. “Not a fig’s worth, no.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slapped her shoulder. “So what are we doing out here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat up too, and picked up the blanket Agatha had brought. She pushed Agatha back down, chuckling at her grumpy expression, and covered them both with the blanket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lay down beside Agatha and said, “We’re watching the stars fall from the sky, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Pressed together, shoulder to shoulder, hip to hip, sharing warmth, they saw the first meteor flash by.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Beneath the blanket, Rio’s fingers brushed Agatha’s, and Agatha twined their fingers together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even if I don’t know what it is, it probably means something,” Rio whispered in a placating tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It certainly is magical,” Agatha whispered back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They watched the meteors fly by in silence. Eventually, Agatha’s fingers went slack in Rio’s, and she sneaked a glance over to see Agatha had fallen asleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly, tucking the blanket more closely beneath Agatha’s chin before laying back down, wiggling closer to Agatha and witnessing the stars fall and the night die, alone but not lonely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s idea of a practical application of wards and runes was unnecessarily complicated to Agatha’s way of thinking. And somewhat dangerous, as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood in the center of a warded circle, and Rio stood outside, stabbing at it with her terrifying black knife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I can’t get in-” stab, STAB, “Then we know you did it right,” Rio declared, a manic grin on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit back a laugh. She didn’t want to encourage Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you pass on this one,” Rio declared, sulking. “I didn’t even draw blood.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kicked one of the runes out of the way, preparing to step outside and build the next circle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aha! An opening!” Rio crowed, lunging forward.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrieked, falling back and casting the first thing that came to her mind. Rio’s knife glanced off her hasty shield, and Agatha continued retreating, desperately casting about for her next move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can’t just- come after me!” Agatha spluttered. She threw another hasty protection circle up, knowing it wouldn’t last against a prolonged attack, but taking any reprieve she could conjure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, because your enemies will wait patiently while you find the perfect rocks and etch your runes oh so carefully?” Rio challenged, pacing around the circle and slashing at it with her blade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, no,” Agatha argued, “But you didn’t tell me this is what we’d be doing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My previous point still stands,” Rio cackled, “I’ve never fought anyone who politely told me the next way they’d be attacking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her spell falter before she saw it fail, and blasted Rio backwards to give herself time to get to a stronger position.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio landed in an undignified heap, but came back swinging, laughing all the way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made it to her circle and re-aligned the broken perimeter, casting a second spell over the first to ensure a magical attack would be unable to reach her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pouted when she saw the runes glow golden before she could breach them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This isn’t fighting, Agatha,” she groused. “It’s hiding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I didn’t think we were supposed to be fighting,” Agatha replied, crossing her arms but remaining steadfastly in her circle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The only thing worth defending is a position you can actually hold,” Rio said. “Look at where you are- a tiny spot you can’t even lay down in, no food or water. All you’re doing is giving them yourself on a platter, and time to consider how best to attack you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio fixed her with an evil looking grin. “Like this-” she said, striking at one particular spot on Agatha’s circle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The magic shattered, and Rio had Agatha pinned, knife to her throat. Rio smiled down at her, pressing the blade in just a bit harder. Agatha laughed, knowing Rio could kill her in this moment (though she probably wouldn’t).</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what’s your point?” Agatha asked, trying to catch her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Protect whatever is worth protecting,” Rio responded, removing her knife and standing before helping Agatha to her feet, holding her hand for a beat longer than strictly necessary. “And in every other situation, you have no choice but to fight your way out.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Death’s transformation into Rio seemed to be permanent. When they finally got around to finishing the lesson on transformation, Rio demonstrated on rocks, saying, “I think I like this body. I’m going to keep it for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sniffed. “It’s ok, I guess.” Rio looked at her, offended, and Agatha relented. “Ok, ok,” she said, “It’s… tolerable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squinted at her, shrewdly. “You like it,” she said triumphantly. “You think I’m beautiful!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned into Agatha’s personal space, their noses almost touching. “Unless you miss ole’ bare bones?” She wriggled her eyebrows. “What, are you into skeletons, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt herself blushing. “No! I mean, your old form was familiar.” She squirmed where she sat. “I liked you as you were. But you, as you are now?” She smiled. “I feel like I get to know you in a different way. We can share more- food, sensation, hairstyles… I’m not delusional, I know we’re never going to be-” she made a helpless hand motion- “equals, or peers. But I feel like you’re less… out of reach.” She trailed off, seeing Rio watching her, riveted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”You got pretty deep there, Harkness,” she finally said, a slow smirk crossing her face. “You’re wrong, though.” She said, taking on a serious air. “We are peers. And if you work hard enough, and play your cards right, you might be able to </span>
<em>
<span>almost</span>
</em>
<span> become as powerful as me.” She held a hand up. “You can always dream.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hit Rio on the shoulder, and Rio said, “Hey!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next thing Agatha knew, Rio was on top of her, and she was flat on her back in the grass, trying to catch the breath that had been knocked out of her lungs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had her hands pinned above her head, and was laughing down at her. Agatha stared up at her, transfixed. She licked her lips, and pulled futilely at her arms, trying to free herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Psh,” Rio said, “What a pushover you are, Agatha. We’ll have to work on toughening you up.” She began to get up. Agatha waited until she was off balance, halfway between kneeling and standing, and made her move, grasping Rio by the hips and pushing her off kilter, then rolling after her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hit the ground hard, already laughing, and Agatha landed on top, scrabbling for purchase on Rio’s hands, only finding herself holding folds of the green robe for her trouble. She tried to keep Rio down with her knees alone, but Rio played dirty, yanking at Agatha’s dangling braid. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a shocked gasp, falling sideways. Rio threw a leg over Agatha’s hip, and the two grappled, rolling and fighting for the upper hand. Agatha took an elbow to the chest, but laughed through the pain, hissing out, “Son of a bitch.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She tried twisting away, bucking her hips, but Rio had a hold on her now, and Agatha’s arms were pinned by her side in a bear hug, her legs trapped in an awkward position. Rio wasn’t letting go. Her mouth was at Agatha’s ear, her breath panting out between stifled giggles. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Say you lost, Agatha, and I’ll let go.” Rio’s hoarse whisper sent shivers down Agatha’s spine. She gritted her teeth against the feeling, growling out, “Never,” before pulling her legs free, finally, and locking them around Rio’s legs. She thought she’d be able to use her grip on Rio’s legs to lever herself out and come at Rio from a new angle, but all she managed to do was bring every part of Rio’s body closer to her own. “Fuck… off,” Agatha hissed out, gritting her teeth and trying to ignore the rising heat she felt. Her cheeks burned in spite of herself, and she knew if Rio looked her in the eye, she’d see the panicked want there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, holding tight. “That’s ok,” she huffed out, “We both know who won here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled back slightly, looking into Agatha’s face. Her face had a silly grin on it, but when she looked into Agatha’s eyes, her mouth softened, turned down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did I hurt you?” She murmured. Her mouth was so close to Agatha’s that her lips nearly brushed Agatha’s. Agatha whispered,”No, I’m not hurt.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned. “Why do you look like you’re in pain?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to laugh, but the sound that escaped her was closer to a groan- she was on fire, underneath this intoxicating, powerful woman. Her attraction had been growing for some time now, and it was impossible, but there was this magnetic draw, and Agatha was only human- flawed and weak. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d felt sure she’d be able to keep these feelings private, to avoid this exact confrontation, but now, Rio was looking at her so closely. And Agatha knew what she was seeing- pupils blown wide, lips slightly parted, and that damnable blush reddening her cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Your heart is racing,” Rio said softly, finally- </span>
<em>
<span>finally</span>
</em>
<span> loosening her bear hug and sitting back on her heels. She was now kneeling between Agatha’s legs, one hand so casually on her thigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha covered her eyes with an arm, trying to catch her breath, to find her sanity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m missing something here,” Rio said decisively. “You’re going to tell me what it is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, the desperate, hysterical laugh startling Rio, who huffed out an angry breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”So you’re going to laugh at me instead of telling me?” She slapped Agatha’s thigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”I wouldn’t do that to you, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha uncovered her face and sat up, cursing under her breath when it brought her face to face again with Rio. The other woman had never had a great concept of personal space, either in her former form or this one, but recently, things had felt… charged when she got close to Agatha like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She put one hand over Rio’s, trying to convey comfort, an apology, something to soften the hurt she heard in that voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”I’m laughing at myself.” Agatha clarified, her gaze dropping to Rio’s hand beneath her own. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm,” she sighed, “How to explain…” She tried to move back, but Rio didn’t get off her legs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha signed and stilled. “Do you remember when we talked about humans and touch and sensation. And we talked about how humans go around feeling… everything, all the time?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, and Agatha continued. “For some people, that physical touch can spark a reaction, a… desire.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned. “Is this a sex thing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned at this, appreciating Rio’s candor. “It is sort of a sex thing, like- when touch makes us feel a certain way, we want more, and in a different way. Sometimes that means we want sex, but sometimes it can just be wanting a closeness, like a hug, or a kiss, or-” she gestured at their hands, “to hold hands.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at their hands, turned them over and covered Agatha’s hand with her other hand, cradling it between both of her own. Agatha’s heart squeezed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”So, you want to have sex with me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had expected the blunt directness, but still felt floored by this conversation, and the woman she was having it with.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”I… I’m attracted to you, Rio.” She brought her free hand up to push a loose curl behind Rio’s ear. “I hadn’t planned to say anything, though, because sometimes,” she fought to continue, to give this explanation the right words- “sometimes it isn’t a good idea to pursue that kind of relationship with someone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Sounds like a bunch of human society bull,” Rio observed, a line she had previously used in regards to stockings, church, and money.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Sometimes it is,” Agatha agreed, “But in this case, it’s more than that. Our… association, our friendship, is special to me. It’s important, for more than superficial reasons.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was frowning. “I’m trying to understand, but now I just want to know about all of it. I’ve seen some of it, but I haven’t been a part of it, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She released Agatha’s hand, but the determined look in her eye put Agatha on high alert. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what’s the normal thing “friends” do, then? Aside from holding hands, which is nice, but- ugh- not enough?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”I suppose we could hug?” Agatha suggested. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok,” Rio said. She stood up abruptly, and snapped to attention as if she was a soldier on parade.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood too, and stepped closer. She reached for Rio’s hands, lifting them, and saying, “You put your arms around me, and I put my arms around you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she did, stepping into Rio’s arms with a sigh she didn’t quite manage to hide.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was silent for a moment, taking this in, before burying her face into Agatha’s neck and breathing in deeply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”And then what?” Rio asked, voice somewhat muffled. Agatha shivered at Rio’s lips moving against her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”We just hold each other,” Agatha whispered. She brought one hand up to smooth Rio’s hair back from her face, again, and kept it there, cradling her there, against her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio took a deep breath, and pulled away. “I liked that. We can hug, if you want to,” she concluded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked into those hazel eyes, molten and soft, blissed out from being held. Her self-control just about gone, she reached a trembling hand up and cupped Rio’s cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio placed her own hand over Agatha’s. “If I liked hugging, and I wanted more, what would be the next thing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The next thing,” Agatha whispered, “Is a bit more than what… friends… in the typical sense would do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio considered this, absently frowning and stroking the back of Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I feel more than friendship for you, judging by the feeling that hugging is more like an appetizer than the main meal. What comes next?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, stepping closer, and wrapping her free arm around Rio’s waist. “Kissing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Ok. Kiss me.” Rio’s voice was husky and low.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gently, so, so, gently, Agatha pressed her lips against Rio’s, her mind racing as she tried to catalog this moment, to burn it into her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Rio moaned into her mouth, and Agatha was lost.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sliding the hand on Rio’s cheek up, she tangled trembling fingers into Rio’s curls, tilting her head so Agatha could kiss her more deeply. The arm around her waist was fisted into her cloak, pulling Rio so close that there was no space left between their bodies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t seem to know what to do with her own hands, starting off holding Agatha’s hips, but then they began to wander, one sliding up Agatha’s back and finding the soft skin of her neck, nails digging in ever so slightly at her hairline. Agatha gasped against Rio’s mouth, and suddenly Rio’s tongue was inside. Her teeth bit Agatha’s lower lip, and Agatha’s knees went weak. Rio caught her around her waist before she could fall, and ended the kiss, resting her forehead and nose against Agatha’s as the two breathed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Well,” Agatha finally managed to say, “I guess we know where we stand on this topic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, and kissed the corner of Agatha’s mouth, the hollow below her cheekbone, the spot where her jaw ended below her ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio breathed against that soft, tender spot then scraped her teeth in the same place, “I’m definitely going to need to kiss you again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Oh,” Agatha gasped, shuddering at the slight pain from those teeth. “I think I’d like that.”</span>
</p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>Once she knew what kissing Rio was like, Agatha found herself hard pressed to keep her lips to herself. Luckily, Rio didn’t seem to mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have to go-” Agatha said, but didn’t quite manage to leave, leaning back down to press another kiss to Rio’s lips, admiring the way they looked red and swollen from her kisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stay,” Rio murmured against her lips, tangling insistent fingers into Agatha’s hair, mussing the curls more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha pulled away, looking back once as she ran back home, knowing she’d be missed if she stayed out longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because recently, something had changed in the town of Salem. The whispers of “witch hunter” were back, but it wasn’t the Coven talking about it this time. It was the miller, delivering a sack of flour. Then it was the barkeep, handing over a tankard along with the latest gossip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When a cart pulling a steel cage entered the town, the rumors were confirmed- the high inquisitor had arrived, and there would be a witch hunt in Salem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s trusty source, Matthew the farm boy, wasted no time sharing his meager knowledge.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”He’s come from Boston, Miss. He’s heard tell of strange things in the town- the reverend's niece seeing crones dancing in the woods, and seeing witches fly into her room at night. She took up saying all that, making a fuss, and then more girls did the same.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kept calm, maintained an expression of curiosity, and said with fear, “He will find the witch, surely? And there cannot be more than one, in a town this devoted to the Lord?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He shook his head. “No, Miss, the reverend says the devil loves pious towns full of good people- that he longs for their downfall. A witch, or many witches, may feel the same. But fear not,” he gallantly continued. “He will find the witch, and we will be safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But no one was safe during that time in Salem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Coven closed ranks, placed a ban on magic, and doubled down on meeting in the practice hall, claiming they were holding extra church services. No one left their home without a bible, a cross, and a vial of holy water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Death came to Salem.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw Rio waking down the street towards her and felt a sense of unreality shake her mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio winked at her but did not stop, or speak to her. And Agatha changed course, and followed her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a crowd gathering in the town square, whispers and muttered prayers flitting between pious heads bowed in prayer, but waiting to see death.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There, standing upon a gallows, Agatha saw the spectacle they’d all gathered to see.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A woman was being put to death. She would not confess to being a witch; little wonder, for she was not a witch. She was, perhaps, a woman too strong for this town’s comfort. She owned two taverns, and was on her third marriage, and dressed unlike the drab townspeople- but she was also a member of the church parish, and married to a wealthy landowner Agatha could not have said a cross word about. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha covered her mouth with a shaking hand as a noose was lowered over the woman’s head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No sane voice intervened or called for a stop to the proceedings, though they must have seen how unjust this situation was.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd did not see Rio as she moved towards the accused woman. She stood beside the silently crying woman and took her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was over quickly, and Agatha watched Rio walk away, hand-in-hand with the silvery figure of the hanged woman, disappearing into the ether. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked around her, then, and saw her mother watching her, frowning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed herself, bowed her head, and fled that place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>–</span>
</p><p>
<span>The children responsible for naming the witches vexing and torturing them named so many more names, Agatha lost count. Some of the accused were tried and released, others were hanged. None of the members of Agatha’s Coven came to the notice of the court.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s presence in town continued to be frequent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha learned not to betray any awareness of her, for she was always being watched. Her mother, too, can see Rio- Agatha had seen her cold eyes tracking Rio’s progress up to the Gallows on the day of another hanging. The frown on her face and the twist of her mouth betrayed her thoughts about Rio’s new form. Agatha got some small satisfaction from knowing Rio hadn’t responded to any of her mother’s attempts to summon her recently; Rio was cross at Agatha’s new limitations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”How can I kiss you,” Rio groused, before covering Agatha’s mouth with her own, and pulling back to continue speaking, “When you’re always on lockdown?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”You don’t want to visit me at home?” Agatha asked slyly, covertly undoing Rio’s rough braid to ruffle her curls free so she could grasp handfuls while they made out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shuddered. “Yes, one wall away from Evanora- very tempting, most alluring of you. Maybe we could have a nice family meal, and talk about our feelings.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, then moaned when Rio nipped at her ear lobe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could say, ‘Mistress Harkness, may I continue defiling your daughter and teaching her dark magic?’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted. “Not a situation I have on my dance card, little witch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Nor mine,” Agatha laughed, and pulled Rio’s face back down to hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>They thought they were being careful; Rio hid them while they were together in the clearing, and Agatha laid wards at the boundary to make doubly sure. But one night, returning home with flushed cheeks and kiss swollen lips, Agatha found Evanora waiting for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Where have you been,” Evanora drawled. Her eyes took in the grass in Agatha’s hair, her disarrayed cloak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hung her head, feigning shame. She said the first thing that came to mind; “Matthew, the farm boy- we’ve been courting.” She thought of Rio beneath her, allowed the blush to deepen across her cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Do not lie to me, Agatha.” Evanora pointed a finger at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do you care, mother,” Agatha asked, genuinely curious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are my daughter, Agatha,” Evanora said silkily, “And a member of my Coven. It is my job to care, my job to ask. And during these trying times, I have even more of a right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted. “So now you claim me?” Evanora reared back, as if Agatha had slapped her. “Speak with care, daughter,” Evanora said in a low tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bowed her head, gathered her strength, and spoke carefully. “I have always wanted to be a witch. I have always wanted to follow in your footsteps, Mother.” Tears pricked at her eyes. “And I have never been good enough- you have never embraced me, or given me a chance.” Agatha looked up. “I have a hard time believing you care after that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”You have never been good,” Evanora hissed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped breathing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have had my suspicions, all along,” the older woman seemed calm again, although Agatha knew it was a facade. “Prudence.” Agatha did not speak, but allowed confusion to creep across her face- “Virginia.” Agatha deepened the confused frown. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean, Mother?” Agatha asked, knowing she sounded convincing. “I thought Prudence went to visit family, and Virginia ran away.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope you know,” Evanora spoke, ice in her voice, “That I can see the ether clinging to you. I know-“ she hissed now, enraged, “That you have been consorting with Death.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”No!” Came Agatha’s immediate denial. “I wouldn’t even know how, Mother-“</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora cut her off, “My books, Agatha? Did you think you could take them without my notice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha remained calm, knowing she was not caught yet. “Is reading a crime now, Mother?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora drew herself up. “I expected contrition, perhaps even an apology. I did not expect you to all but confirm my worst fears, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She raised her hand, and a silver flash lit the room briefly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”The Coven will be here soon. Do not embarrass me by resisting them.” Evanora turned her back and left the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha waited in the dark until they came for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Two witches grasped Agatha by the upper arms, half dragging, half pulling her up that familiar path to the Gathering Place. A stake waited for her. Agatha had to admire her mother’s flair for the dramatic; that hard wooden post was the same she’d been whipped upon years ago.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, it would be the place she was executed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Beyond the circle of witches, lit by the flicker of torches, Agatha caught a flash of green robes, and realized- Rio was there. Her presence could only mean one thing, and for the first time, Agatha felt the fear crash over her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No! No-…” she pleaded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But her captors had no mercy, and they bound her to the stake on a stone platform with swirling blue magic. Her mother watched, face hard and resolute.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Agatha Harkness, are you a witch?” Evanora’s righteous anger colored every word she spoke. Of course she would lead this kangaroo court setup, as she showed the Coven she’d given Agatha every chance to defend herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes. I am a witch.” Agatha gasped out, voice strong, firm in her convictions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Yet you have betrayed your coven,” came Evanora’s accusation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>”I have not!” Agatha insisted, head turning as she sought out an ally in the crowd. She’d held these women’s babies, brought water to their homes everyday, and they had witnessed each others’ daily lives. And yet, no one met her gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In that moment, Agatha felt  every tether to this place snap. Every tender feeling was shattered.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You stole knowledge above your age and station. You practiced the darkest of magic.” Evanora layered the accusations on thick; Agatha wondered what evidence she had, how she could defend herself when the accusations were levied against her as if they were facts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”I know- I know nothing of these crimes, I swear it!” She cried. </span>
</p><p>
<span>”ENOUGH! DECEPTION!” Evanora’s scream sought to shut down any counter arguments and cut Agatha’s defense of herself off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a breath, knowing nothing she said at this moment would help her. But that rage in Evanora’s face- when had she ever had a chance to say exactly what she wanted to her mother without fearing that she’d make the situation worse?</span>
</p><p>
<span>It couldn’t get any worse than it already was… so she spoke the truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did not break your rules. They simply bent to my power.” She could not help the small smile that crept onto her lips as she thought of all the ways her power had grown, and all she’d done without this Coven’s help.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother bent her head, and gave the rest of the circle the tiniest of nods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every witch in the circle began to chant. The Latin hissed from their lips in whispers powerful and  spine chilling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In spite of herself, Agatha’s eyes widened. They were going to cast their magic at her. Bound, she could not deflect it, or shield herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pictured Prudence, agonized and desperate, then lying dead upon the grass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Virginia, snarling laugh twisting into a rictus of death, crumpled and drained.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And in spite of all the pain and loneliness she’d felt at the hands of these women, she tried to warn them, to stop them:</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Wait-! No! I cannot control it!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked desperately around the circle. No friendly face looked back, no voice faltered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrieked out one last plea, one last warning- “I- If only you would teach me! And help me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The chanting grew in volume. They couldn’t hear her any longer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha choked on the next word, failed to expel it, only letting out a puff of vapor into the cold night, soundless. She tried again- “Mother,” she gasped, “Please! Please! Mother!” She pleaded with everything she had. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Every witch in the circle stopped chanting and blasted Agatha with the full force of her power.</span>
</p><p>
<span>White hot ecstasy filled Agatha and she screamed, convinced that she’d burst into flames, that she couldn’t possibly survive being hit by that many witches at once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She burst out of her bindings, levitating into the air driven by the endless power feeding into her- worried at any moment she’d begin to feel true pain, to burn for real.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was when she imagined the well inside of herself expanding and containing anything they threw at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt the witches around her dying and watched as line after line of energy snapped as the witch on the other end crumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Only Evanora remained standing, surrounded by the dead witches of her coven.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tears in her eyes, Agatha begged her mother- whether to save Evanora, or to save herself from what she knew was coming next, she wasn’t sure-</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please! I can be good!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you cannot.” Evanora gasped out, anguished.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother attacked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried so hard not to take it in. She tried to deflect it instead, to shield herself but she wasn’t fast enough. She felt her brimming tears flood down her cheeks as her mother fell and did not move again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Gasping to try to catch her breath, Agatha stepped off the stone platform, unsteady on her feet. She walked to her mother’s body and tried not to look into that horrible shrunken face and those accusing eyes. She took her mother’s locket from the base of her neck before gathering the power she felt flowing through her veins and using it to carry herself back to her home for the last time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She did not wait to see if Rio was truly there. She did not want to hear her explanations for why she didn’t interfere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And most of all she did not want to face the silvery forms of her fallen Coven and hear their recriminations and accusations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she fled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alone in the dark, Agatha Harkness realized: she had become a Covenless witch.</span>

<p>Entering her mother’s home, knowing Evanora was gone, felt jarring. Agatha stood in the doorway, hand gently brushing the bundle of rosemary hanging just inside the entryway, a blessing on the home.</p><p>Biting back a sob, Agatha forced herself into action. She knew she had to move, and quickly. </p><p>When the sun rose, the town would find the bodies. The unnatural state they were left in would ring bells of great alarm, bringing the hounds of this new inquisition down upon her head. Even the least canny witch hunter could connect the dots between the murdered Covenant of the Separatists members, and the last adult left standing. She’d be pursued, hunted, and if captured, she would be killed. </p><p>Agatha packed knowing she could not return to this place. </p><p>She be-spelled her mother’s books, shrinking them and storing them in a pouch. In a frantic rush Agatha found flints for the fire, a bedroll, and extra clothes. She imagined nights in the woods, camping and avoiding the roads, but she couldn’t be sure what the journey would entail. Everything would depend upon how much of a headstart she could give herself; if she could travel faster than word of mouth, but she’d need to do so without leaving a trail to follow.</p><p>Agatha did not wait to see  if Rio would come find her. She knew Rio would be busy gathering up the souls of the coven, especially as many would not go without a fight.</p><p>Agatha shuddered, imagining a ghostly Evanora refusing to leave this world for the next.</p><p>Donning her cloak and settling her pack over her shoulder, Agatha took one last look in the mirror. She saw a scared girl there, barely a woman. Swiping away the tears still spilling down her cheeks, Agatha frowned, hardening the edges of her mouth and gathering the last scraps of her self-assurance.</p><p>What was done was done; she could not change things, and she did not know if she would have chosen the alternative: to die in her coven’s place. But there were consequences to her actions. She knew she’d need to be alone, and she expected to be alone for a very, very long time.</p><p>-</p><p>She traveled for three days, moving steadily west, before venturing into a town for a hot meal and a night spent out of the elements. The tavern was busy with the dinner crowd and Agatha paid for her meal and found a quiet corner. She ate with one ear to the crowd, catching snippets of news and conversations.</p><p>Plenty of chatter about horses gone lame, worries about the growing season, chatter about this ship or that, and the cargo they’d bring, but nothing about a massacre in Salem town. Agatha nursed one beer until the crowds thinned out and a space at the bar opened. She casually sidled up and ordered a fresh drink.</p><p>The woman at the bar handed her the drink, and settled into washing the dishes.</p><p>”I’m just returning from Maine,” Agatha began, “What news of Salem?”</p><p>The woman paused while washing dishes and glanced around the bar- “Do you mean- about the witches?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart plummeted. </p><p>“I’ve heard there’s been no end to those trials.” She shook her head again. “But nothing recently. I pray it will be over soon. Folks have been living in fear, worried to set a foot wrong.”</p><p>Agatha nodded sympathetically, clutching the cross she still wore as if to say, “I too find comfort in the Lord.”</p><p>”I pray we will be saved from witches, and from these winter storms at sea.” Agatha concurred, paying for her drink before settling back by the fire.</p><p>She took a book out of her satchel, and pretended to be absorbed in it.</p><p>She consulted the map she’d folded inside, tracing her journey so far. She knew she’d be expected to follow the coast, to travel by sea. But she had chosen the more grueling inland trek, seeking the sparsely populated valleys and mountains for her destination.</p><p>The door opened to the inn, and two women entered the bar and sat a short distance from her, already whispering before they sat.</p><p>”-entire Salem Coven wiped out, only the babies, children, and initiates left alive,” one of the women was saying.</p><p>”Can’t imagine Evanora Harkness being beaten-“</p><p>”And they say it was her own daughter!”</p><p>”No!”</p><p>”Yes! And-“ </p><p>Agatha had heard enough. She’d hoped that word would not have traveled this far, but it had, and she needed to keep moving. She pulled her cloak about her head and left the inn, continuing her trek westward.</p><p>—</p><p>A child of the ocean, Agatha looked at the mountains around her and saw in them the peaks and troughs of waves. This land was alien but familiar, offering many of the same plants and small game she’d been accustomed to in Salem. </p><p>She felt homesick, but did not let the feeling settle within her, turning her mind instead to the tasks she had to complete just for her survival. Gathering wood; establishing a trap line; repairing the small shed used for curing meats and tanning hides. Soon, she’d need to turn the garden and prepare for the growing season. Her hands were always busy, her days always full, and she slept each night without dreaming.</p><p>This day, Agatha surveyed the cottage she had begun to make into a home. It had been abandoned and left unclaimed; the family that had built it had been forced back to the coast by a bad growing season, and she could claim it as her own by living in it and caring for the land.</p><p>She was grateful for the cottage: it was windtight and well-built; the door was stout and strong, and the furniture was sparse but serviceable.</p><p>Agatha had already begun filling the rafters with bundles of dried herbs and flowers. Her mother’s books held a place of honor on the only shelf, a rude-cut board held in place with wooden pegs.</p><p>If she weren’t so completely alone, she would feel almost content.</p><p>Inside, Agatha kicked off her boots, then barred the door. She snuffed out the one candle, navigating by firelight to the kitchen hearth. Kneeling, Agatha banked the fire, carefully feeding it enough logs to burn through the night and leave embers for her to kindle into fire in the morning.</p><p>Satisfied with the flame, Agatha set a kettle to boil, readying her nightly cup of tea as she prepared for bed. </p><p>A sudden knock at her door made her freeze. She stepped to the small window to look outside and bit her fist when she saw the green cloaked figure outside.</p><p>Her warded door glowed gold, and she remembered that lesson in the meadow, Rio’s knife slashing down for Agatha’s arm as Rio cackled, “Defend only what is worth defending.”</p><p>Her cottage was worth defending; her life was worth defending. She almost did not answer, almost retreated within her home, wishing her solitude and uneasy peace had been able to last.</p><p>But then she caught sight of what Rio held in her hand: a single perfect flower, an exact replica of the one she’d given to Agatha the first time they’d met.</p><p>Agatha was flooded with memories, almost all good, others complicated.</p><p>From outside, Rio said, “Agatha, please.”</p><p>Agatha undid the bar across the door and slammed it open but then froze, staring. She wanted to run into Rio’s arms, wanted the other woman to hold her.</p><p>But she did not move; the first move needed to come from Rio. She crossed her arms, and waited.</p><p>Rio held the flower out to her.</p><p>“I have been trying to find you,” Rio said. Agatha saw tears in her eyes. “I- I’m not good at apologizing,” Rio said, “Especially when I know I would not act differently now. I still could not have changed what happened. But I am sorry that you were alone.” She looked at Agatha, waiting.</p><p>“I should have been by your side, facing whatever happened along with you.”</p><p>Agatha uncrossed her arms, reaching out slowly for the flower.</p><p>Holding the delicate bloom to her nose and looking up at Rio from below her eyelashes, Agatha whispered, “What took you so long?” She reached out and pulled Rio over the threshold, locking and barring the door behind them.</p><p>Rio looked sheepish. “I had a lot of cleaning up to do. And then you moved so quickly, I almost couldn’t find you.”</p><p>“That was intentional,” Agatha deadpanned. </p><p>Rio looked down at her feet. “I’m sorry. I can’t change what happened, but I’m still sorry.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her for a long moment, hugging herself for a moment before gesturing helplessly.</p><p>“I forgive you, and now, it doesn’t matter,” Agatha said decisively. “I’ve missed you.” Her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>”They’re all dead,” she whispered. Rio didn’t speak, knowing Agatha needed to feel all of this, to put the pain in place within herself.</p><p>“It’s my fault.” Agatha sobbed, falling into Rio’s arms, allowing Rio to pull her close and press her face into Agatha’s hair.</p><p>Rio held her as she cried.</p><p>—</p><p>Time dulled Agatha’s grief and guilt, and she found it was possible to go on living. She built an altar behind her home, and she left offerings there when she began to feel crushed by the weight of the deaths she’d had a hand in.</p><p>Spring came to their valley between the mountains, and everywhere she looked, Agatha saw life returning, signs of stubborn survival and joyful regrowth.</p><p>She nurtured her garden, feeling affection for the tender sprouts she coaxed from the dark, rich earth.</p><p>And best of all, she had Rio with her now.</p><p>Rio, with her wild bouts of euphoria, appearing unexpectedly and pulling Agatha up to dance with her around the small cottage, laughing as they bumped into things.</p><p>Lady Death, returning grim and pale, obviously exhausted but always offering  Agatha a flower, rare and sweet, to brighten her day.</p><p>The Reaper, endlessly powerful, tasked with delicately balancing the scales of life and death, stewarding souls from one side to the other, and never faltering in her duties, carefully holding a downy chick, Agatha’s first successful attempt at adding to her meager flock of chickens, stroking its tiny head with one long, pale finger until the tiny bird slept.</p><p>Agatha would stop, often, and just look at the life she had built for herself, knowing that she’d only had a pile of ashes to start from.</p><p>In all her wildest dreams, and all her best fantasies, Agatha could not have imagined a life as sweet and full as her life was now. </p><p>They didn’t have much, and Rio was often gone, but Agatha could practice magic whenever she wished; she could read through every one of her mother’s books by the clear light of day. And she was accustomed to hard work, and not averse to using magic to make certain things easier.</p><p>One day, Rio snuck up behind her as she weeded the garden. Ignoring Agatha’s grumbles about being sweaty and covered in dirt, Rio pulled her out of the garden, throwing her trowel to the side, and pressed her into the grass, kissing Agatha deeply.</p><p>Agatha was melting into the kiss when Rio bit her bottom lip sharply, pulling away and quirking an eyebrow.</p><p>“No!” Agatha huffed. “I’m not in the mood, Rio. Let me tend to my garden.”</p><p>But Rio just laughed, stole Agatha’s trowel, and danced away into the trees, crowing “You’ll have to catch me, then!”</p><p>“Dammit!” Agatha growled, but there was a smile on her face, and her hands clenched, eager to capture Rio and continue what they’d started.</p><p>Speed was the name of the game this time, and Agatha raced after Rio, watching her feet on the uneven ground.</p><p>She lost sight of the other woman, and paused, listening. A noise from above made her look up, and that’s when Rio dropped out of a tree, knife brandished alongside the trowel, cackling maniacally.</p><p>Agatha put up a shield and Rio glanced off, leaping to the side and rolling on the ground. Agatha chased after her, reaching her before she could gain her feet.</p><p>She quickly bound one of Rio’s hands to a nearby tree (the one with the knife, that stabby little asshole), and held the one with the trowel in place, struggling to get a grip on Rio’s legs as she kicked and twisted, trying to get away.</p><p>Rio managed to land a kick to Agatha’s chest, and she fell back, momentarily stunned. When she saw Rio reaching to unbind herself from the tree, she acted quickly, lashing the other hand to the same tree with twisting purple cords of magic.</p><p>Rio was still laughing as Agatha dropped onto her, straddling her hips to move out of range of her feet. Wary of getting headbutted, Agatha gripped Rio by the hair and tugged her head back, leaning down to place an open mouthed kiss against Rio’s neck.</p><p>If she thought the other woman had been subdued, she was wrong- “Use your teeth,” Rio hissed at her.</p><p>Agatha smiled and bit, enjoying the pained groan Rio let out.</p><p>“Masochist,” she teased.</p><p>”Mmm,” Rio groaned, “I definitely am.  Bite harder,” she demanded.</p><p>Agatha yanked Rio’s head back harder, and bit the tender spot where her shoulder and her neck met, scraping her teeth before soothing the pain with a kiss.</p><p>”Agatha,” Rio hissed, bucking her hips up. Agatha knew she wasn’t trying to get away.</p><p>Agatha sat back on her heels, pretending to be straightening her hair and getting ready to leave.</p><p>”Wait-” Rio gasped out. “Where are you going?”</p><p>“Oh, why?” Agatha asked, trailing her fingers up Rio’s abdomen, stopping just short of her breasts. “Did you need something?”</p><p>Rio gritted her teeth and growled out, “Agatha Harkness, you’re evil.”</p><p>Agatha leaned down, lips close but not brushing. “You love it,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio tried to sit up, chasing Agatha’s lips, but couldn’t quite reach her. </p><p>“Yeah, I do.” Rio said back, “I do love… your devious ways, you witch.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and kissed Rio, pressing her hips down and rolling them against Rio’s.</p><p>Rio, panting, groaned out, “If you pretend to leave again I’ll never forgive you.”</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Agatha sighed, releasing Rio’s bonds.</p><p>Hands finally free, Rio dug her hands into Agatha’s hair and kissed her greedily, rolling Agatha beneath her. </p><p>“Take me to bed,” Agatha whispered, pressing her nose against Rio’s.</p><p>Rio didn’t respond, just picked Agatha up. Agatha laughed, wrapping her arms around Rio as she carried her into the cottage.</p><p>Rio kicked the door shut behind them, and carried Agatha to the bed, laying her down and covering Agatha’s body with her own.</p><p>Rio began undressing Agatha, one layer at a time, slowly, as if she was unwrapping a present. Every time she revealed skin, she paused to kiss it. </p><p>Agatha allowed herself to be appreciated, hands reaching out to hold whatever bit of Rio she could touch. </p><p>Finally, Rio returned to kiss her, and Agatha pulled Rio’s clothes off, impatient but gentle.</p><p>”I want to feel you against me,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>”I want to feel you all over me,” Rio said back, kissing a line along Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>”I want to tie you up again,” Agatha quipped.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Over my dead body,” she sighed into Agathas’s ear. </p><p>It felt as if they’d left the play fight at the door; like they’d given each other permission to be tender and gentle for this moment.</p><p>Rio dragged her loose hair down Agatha’s body, pressing the tips of her fingers down the same path. She kissed, too, hot open mouthed kisses that blazed across Agatha’s skin and lit her up.</p><p>Rio pressed Agatha’s legs apart, making space to settle there. She looked up at Agatha, very intentionally holding her gaze as she dragged her nails from Agatha’s inner thighs towards her hips, up and in, grazing her soft skin. And then she placed a kiss to Agatha’s center, and Agatha sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>Rio smiled wickedly, before turning her full attention to the task at hand. Agatha nearly levitated off the bed when Rio added two fingers, pressing them in and moving them faster to offer a counterpoint to the soft and slow devastation her mouth was causing.</p><p>Agatha caught Rio’s hair in her fingers, and tugged gently. When Rio raised her head, Agatha rasped out, “I need you to kiss me while you touch me. Come up here, please.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I thought I was kissing you already.” She placed one final kiss on Agatha’s center before skimming her way back up her lover’s body, getting distracted along the way by Agatha’s intriguing belly button, and the soft skin of her stomach, and the shape and texture of her breasts.</p><p>”Rio,” Agatha moaned, “Please, I need you now.”</p><p>Rio did not oblige; she’d never done well with taking commands before, and she was going to enjoy every moment of ravishing Agatha.</p><p>Instead, one hand returned to the place between Agatha’s legs. Once there, Rio pushed two fingers in, sliding them in and out as she kissed Agatha’s breasts. Agatha gasped and clutched at Rio’s head. Her body sang with pleasure and it wasn’t enough. She felt herself building towards an incredible climax, but she wanted to come kissing Rio.</p><p>She pulled at that tangle of curls on that infuriating head again, and Rio finally listened, surging up and claiming Agatha’s mouth as she sped up the motion of her hand.</p><p>”Oh, Goddess,” Agatha breathed out, turning her head. Rio bit and sucked at the tender skin below Agatha’s ear, whispering, “That’s it, beautiful. Let yourself go.”</p><p>And Agatha did, unspooling and coming apart beneath Rio, crying out and digging her nails into the skin of Rio’s back.</p><p>Rio straddled Agatha’s thigh, rubbing herself there as she listened to Agatha come. She pulled back to watch her lover’s face, unguarded and lost to pleasure, and bit her own lip at the flood of emotions and sensations she felt watching Agatha’s pleasure.</p><p>When Agatha was still again, holding Rio close as she caught her breath, she opened her eyes and saw Rio, pupils blown wide, lower lip caught between her teeth, pressing herself against Agatha’s thigh.  </p><p>Agatha pulled Rio tighter against herself and rolled them. She knew Rio was too far gone for her to be slow and gentle. Holding Rio, one arm behind Rio’s back, she buried her face in Rio’s neck and slid her hand between them. She pressed two fingers gently against Rio’s clit, and Rio immediately bucked against her hand and moaned.</p><p>”Inside, please, Agatha,” Rio managed to say.</p><p>Agatha pushed her ring and middle finger into Rio, keeping contact with her clit with the heel of her hand.</p><p>Rio shuddered, and Agatha bent her head to catch one of Rio’s nipples in her mouth, circling it with her tongue.</p><p>She felt Rio’s nails dig into her back, hard, but didn’t let up, just continued pouring all her attention into the woman shaking beneath her.</p><p>Rio released her grip on Agatha’s back to clutch at the bedsheets, teeth digging into her bottom lip so hard Agatha feared she’d draw blood. And then it was Rio’s turn to come, flying apart with a cry of, “Agatha!” Back arched, toes curled, Rio’s body snapped rigid, finally falling limp again. </p><p>Agatha snuggled up under Rio’s arm, covering both of them with a blanket.</p><p>She pulled Rio down for a slow, deep kiss, fingers curled under Rio’s jaw, thumb swiping at her cheek.</p><p>”I’m in love with you,” Agatha said. Rio’s arm around her tightened, the other one coming across her body to pull Agatha closer still.</p><p>”I’m in love with you, too.” Rio whispered, sounding like she hadn’t expected to say that, like she was still in awe of these feelings.</p><p>Agatha traced a lazy circle on the back of Rio’s hand. “What happens next?” She asked, afraid of the answer but needing to know.</p><p>Rio pressed her face against Agatha’s hair, half kissing, half memorizing her scent.</p><p>”We live as you humans do: one day at a time, facing whatever comes our way together.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “You mean I’ll live one day at a time, and you’ll be here or you won’t… and I’ll love you, and you’ll love me, and we’ll end up hurting each other because we can’t give ourselves to each other fully.”</p><p>”Don’t forget your innate drive to seek and acquire power,” Rio mused. “One of your most endearing qualities, I think.”</p><p>”Can’t leave out your special trick of having complete control over life and death,” Agatha added.</p><p>”I think we don’t have any choice but to just do our best not to hurt each other.” Rio said, voice quiet and serious. “Isn’t that what any relationship is, at the end of the day? Loving each other and trying our hardest not to hurt each other?”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes before continuing: </p><p>“Do humans ever really promise forever, knowing they will eventually die? Or do they promise to love each other for as long as they are able?”</p><p>Agatha raised herself up onto her elbow to look into Rio’s face. “You know my definition of love is twisted and damaged; I’m sure nothing about this will be healthy for either of us, but I’d rather have you for all the time I can, than to not have you at all.”</p><p>Agatha looked into Rio’s face, seeing her sentiment reflected in those hazel eyes.</p><p>“All I really know for sure is that from the day we met, my heart knew you, and called to your heart.”</p><p>Rio sat up too, pulling Agatha’s hand to her chest and resting it above her left breast.</p><p>Agatha felt a steady heartbeat, as familiar to her as her own.</p><p>”You feel my heartbeat?” Agatha nodded. “It never did that, before I met you.”</p><p>Agatha took this in, feeling the weight of those words.</p><p>Rio met her gaze. “Your heart calls to mine, and my heart responds, Agatha Harkness. My heart beats for you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered, and she pulled Rio’s face to hers, kissing the other woman soundly.</p><p>”My heart beats for you,” Agatha whispered. “And I can’t promise you forever, but I can promise you today, and the next today I have is yours as well. I love you, Rio.”</p><p>”I love you today, and one day at a time, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Outside of the cottage in the woods, night had fallen. In the dark night sky, a single star twinkled, then fell in a dazzling shower of sparks, just a moment of fleeting beauty with no deeper meaning.</p><p>For now, no cosmic or earthly machinations intruded upon the small home in the woods.</p><p>And for a time, none did.</p><p> </p><p>For that time, Agatha and Rio lived happily.</p>

<em>
<span>1750, Western MA (Massachusetts Bay Colony)</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Dawn arrived in her own time, casting a blushing glow across the hilltops, glancing past the valleys. She allowed those secret places to keep their bruised shadows for now. The arms of the trees and their trembling leaves captured the last gasps of the night and held them there, hiding the retreat of the stars and the moon and the advance of the sun from those that rested, sheltered, below.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There in a cool hollow, nestled in a bed of leaves and covered casually by knitted woolen blankets, were two sleeping women. Their limbs twined together, each breathing slowly, deeply. Around them bloomed a carpet of moss, the shy white star flowers glimmering in the not-quite-light.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The remnants of a small fire, ashes now cold and white, showed that the valley had been an intentional resting place; the stones of the fire ring proved it had been used for this purpose before. Banked below the ashes, insulated from the air that would bring them to life before burning them to nothingness, coals that would light the wood for breakfast smoldered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Further away, beside a small pool, was a roughly constructed altar and shrine. The lichen kissed stones formed a small cubby, and above that was a flat surface where candles could be burned, and offerings could be made.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Small bones of the scurrying creatures of the forest were carefully displayed here. And around them, bundles of dried flowers, and sprinklings of fragrant herbs, dried now but still potent. Carved into the stone were markings showing the phases of the moon, thrown into sharper relief by charcoal that had been rubbed into the angular voids. At the center of the altar was the skull of a raven, and the tiny blue egg of a spring robin. A bowl of blood was the freshest thing there, having been given in offering just the night before by the witch performing the ritual. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was a shrine to The Green Witch; like any shrine, it offered its deity a home to abide in and an altar to take nourishment and energy from. To those who worshiped there, who observed the rituals and celebrated or mourned as the season demanded, it was a place of shelter and quiet contemplation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For Agatha Harkness, it also functioned to send what is colloquially known as a booty call.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she missed her lover too much, and needed to hold her, she would leave her cottage and bring a small gift to this altar, and Rio would appear. Last night was a full moon and Agatha had needed to feel the moonlight on her skin. The full tide of power that phase brought made her feel as if she could do anything, make anything.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, Agatha stirred, opening her eyes to see Rio, hair falling into her face, so close their noses were touching. Agatha smiled, nuzzling her nose against the sleeping woman beside her while moving one hand in slow circles along her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio woke slowly, in stages: first, her breathing changed pace, then her eyes flickered, and finally, she was smiling back at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello, my love,” Rio said, voice rough with sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, my love,” Agatha whispered back, leaning in to steal a kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long can you stay?” Agatha breathed against those addictive lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have to go soon.” Rio said, regret drenching her words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you just hold me for a while?” Agatha asked, rolling over and snuggling into Rio’s body, nestled as close as spoons in a drawer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s wordless response was to curl herself closer to Agatha, one arm slung across her middle pulling her tight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish you could stay with me,” Agatha murmured. “I wish you could be with me, always.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed the back of Agatha’s neck and the other woman shivered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d like that, but-“</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, I know,” Agatha whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She contented herself with memorizing how it felt to be held so completely, her own heartbeat striving to match Rio’s, their breathing in sync.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft breeze rustled through the clearing, and Agatha felt a strange electricity crackle over the two of them. Usually, stray magic would set both her and Rio on edge, but something about this felt familiar, comforting; like coming home to the cottage and falling asleep beside each other in their bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the feeling passed, Agatha asked, “Was that… wish magic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stiffened behind her. “I think you’re right,” she said, voice much more alert and wary. “Left over from the full moon, and swept along by the sunrise, I should expect. I wonder if the altar attracted it here, and then it heard- oh, Goddess.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I made a wish,” Agatha realized.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat up and stared at Rio, clutching a blanket to herself and feeling suddenly foolish and vulnerable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What have I done?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “Wish magic is one of the most unpredictable forms of magic. We may not know for a while yet what has changed, but we know it can’t change the innate nature of things- I am Death, and I will need to leave you to perform my duties.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly. “If I remember correctly, it is also limited by other rules- it cannot create without having materials to create with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked about the clearing, spotting the bowl of blood on the altar, now sitting empty. She cleared her throat and pointed. Agatha stood to go to the altar to take a closer look. More things were missing from the altar; bones, the egg, and the skull had all disappeared.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, that seems… ominous,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not necessarily,” Rio replied. She stood to dress. “We can’t do anything about this right now, my love. Come, give me my goodbye kiss.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha obliged happily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha’s cycle was late, she knew. She’d been feeling different, more sensitive and more emotional. She felt Rio’s absence that much more poignantly, and had to stop herself from trying to summon her lover at least once a day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She put one hand to her lower abdomen. Perhaps it was just her imagination, but she could swear she felt a difference deep inside of herself, something hard and tiny, but there, like a pearl in an oyster.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She convinced herself to wait, and didn’t summon Rio immediately. Her mind raced, considering the possibilities: had the wish magic taken her blood, and the bones she’d given to Rio, and created a tiny new life within her? She bit her lip. Was her child fatherless, or would the baby be part her and part- whatever else the materials the wish magic used to make them? </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a sudden tearing noise behind her and Rio stumbled out of the void she’d torn through time and space, clutching an entire bouquet of flowers, hair and eyes looking wild.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” She gasped out. “I know what the wish magic did…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She saw Agatha standing there, hands still pressed protectively across her lower belly, trying not to laugh at Rio’s obvious panic and dishevelment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see you may also be aware,” Rio said, trying to get herself together. “You can feel him already?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Him?” It was Agatha’s turn to gasp. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Him,” Rio confirmed. “His body hasn’t decided, but his soul has.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha said, tears beginning to fall down her face. Rio laughed and ran to Agatha, gathering her into her arms carefully, tenderly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This shouldn’t be possible,” Agatha whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wish magic,” Rio said against her neck. “Always a surprise.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>The question of whether the baby growing within Agatha was hers alone, or some magical mix of her and Rio was one that Agatha and Rio debated constantly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”It was your altar,” Agatha said hotly. “And the words of the wish were that I could have </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> with me always. A baby that was only mine would not fulfill the wish.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe the wish was only fulfilling the spirit of the wish, and not the letter,” Rio replied. “Maybe you’re just not meant to feel lonely anymore. I’m not human, and I’m not mortal. I do not think it is possible for me to make a human child.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither had any frame of reference for this situation; Agatha knew stories of Greek gods and goddesses begetting half mortal children. These demigods were cursed and blessed, constantly being torn between the mortal world and the cosmic concerns of the immortal one. While she did not wish that fate for her own child, Agatha did cherish the thought of having Rio’s child. She dreamed of a child with dark eyes and his mother’s smile. Rio teased her for suddenly becoming a fervent believer in visions and foretelling the future.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha would only smile, and say, “Cassandra was cursed to never be believed, my love. And we both know I’ve had my fair share of being cursed; I do not discount any possibility.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her hand against Agatha’s softly swelling abdomen and kissed her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whether this is my child in that way or not, I will still love him.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and rested her hand over Rio’s. “And he will love you, as I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pregnancy was hellish; she enjoyed feeling her baby move within her, and sang to him, told him about the world, and pressed her hands gently against the places she felt him flutter, then kick or turn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she couldn’t eat anything or keep food down. Her sleep was interrupted and was not restful. And her chores made her ache and cry with fatigue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to be there for her, to make things easier, but all she could really do was tend the garden and rub Agatha’s sore feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But worst of all were the nightmares.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha climbed into bed, sore and tired from another day. She woke again almost immediately, and sensed that she was again within the dream world. All around her, mist created a muffling wall. From outside of the small clear spot she sat, Agatha heard a baby crying. Instinctively, Agatha knew she was hearing her baby’s cry, and she stood and ran towards the sound. But no matter how far or how fast she ran, Agatha could not find the child. Soon, it began to sound like the crying was all around her, coming from every direction at once. She tried casting a spell to burn the fog away, but nothing happened. She tried crying out, calling for her child, but she couldn’t make a sound. She sank to her knees, tears of desperation running down her cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then she would awaken in her own bed, the small bump below her nightdress safely there, turning fitfully. Agatha would lay on her side, staring at the door of her cottage and wondering what she was so afraid of, what her dreams were trying to warn her about.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the months wore on, Agatha’s interrupted sleep began to be plagued with more and more intense feelings of fear and panic, and an impending sense of doom. She would wake covered in sweat, clutching at her belly until she felt her child move. On the nights she was there, Rio would hold her and try to comfort her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do not know the future,” Agatha said through tears one morning. “You cannot tell me everything will be alright when you cannot see that far ahead. Never once at the start of the day have you known when you’d be called away to attend to a soul’s passing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is the truth,” Rio said. “But my love, you cannot see the future either. And if you could, you’d only be that much more determined to change it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at this, nodding. “I’ve never been one to accept the way things are.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” said Rio, rubbing her hand along Agatha’s back and smoothing her hair away from her forehead. “Whatever comes our way in the future, I believe that you will find a way to see the bones fall in your favor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wiped her eyes. “Not only me- you’re a part of this baby too. Would you not fight for him?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand stilled and fell away. “Agatha…” she said tentatively, “I cannot go against nature, or allow the balance to fall out of equilibrium. Not for my own sake, or yours, or anyone else’s. The implications would ripple across this entire plane of existence, and the Next.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. She moved away from Rio, never breaking eye contact.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you saying,” Agatha said, voice ominously calm,, “That you would take him from me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down at the floor, and Agatha had her answer before she spoke again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her next words just hammered the truth home: “I would have no choice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Something jagged splintered off inside of Agatha’s heart. She imagined a crack on the surface of a frozen lake: just a hair’s breadth, but with the smallest stress it would grow, and everywhere it went it would weaken the whole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha, and Agatha knew she’d heard that crack appear in this thing between them- she could see the fear and the pain in Rio’s eyes. But there was no apology there, no ability to be reasoned with or to back down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, please- it’s a matter of millions of lives, maybe even billions.” Rio tried to reason with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“None of those lives are your own </span>
<em>
<span>son,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio.” Agatha hissed out. “Would you sacrifice your own child on the altar of your convictions, as my mother tried to do to me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood back and watched her words strike home. Rio became angry. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am not your mother, Agatha. Evanora was a monster, driven by selfishness and jealousy.” She stood, pulling her knife from her cloak. “She did what she did to shape the world she existed in to suit herself.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shredding a void into the fabric of reality, Rio delivered her final line: “I do what I do because I must. I do not have a choice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The tear closed behind her, but Agatha felt certain that something had been broken beyond repair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio returned, she found herself outside the cottage, a new boundary keeping her from being able to enter the gardens outside the small house or approach the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she called.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened the door of the cottage and leaned against the doorway, arms folded across her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” She said, ice in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raked her hand through her hair in frustration. “I cannot change this, Agatha,” she finally said. “But that does not mean your fears will come to pass.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. “It feels so real, Rio.” She said, sounding unsure. “The fear feels like a real threat is here with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a deep breath in. “Agatha, please, let me help you however I can.” She looked at Agatha, trying to telegraph everything she felt for the cold, scared, and angry witch standing in the doorway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you just promise me,” Agatha finally said, “That you’ll give me a warning, if the worst comes to pass? That you won’t just…take him?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I promise,” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let the wards fall, and Rio passed through, gathering Agatha into her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The bump of her belly between them kept Rio from holding Agatha like she wanted to, but she just gently touched the little bump and repeated, “I promise,” and Agatha hugged her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Agatha knew her time was coming, that her son would be here soon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She grew anxious as the contractions began. “I need to be alone,” she said to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned. “I don’t know if that’s a good idea,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to the river.” Agatha said, clenching her teeth against another contraction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“As the waters of the river flow, so will the waters of my labor, and the babe will have an easier time.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio handed her a small bag, nodding agreement even as she looked unhappy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here are some things I gathered to help you,” she said in response to Agatha’s unasked question. “I know a midwife- she wanted to come when it was time, but I thought you’d rather she didn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve never had good luck with other witches.” Rio nodded, resigned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kissed Rio’s cheek, and left, moving as quickly as she could, somehow feeling like she was being pursued. But when she looked about, she was alone. Still, the urgency drove her on, and she found herself running, cloak flying behind her as she searched for a suitable place to give birth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She chose a tree overlooking the water; an old willow, to lend her strength and ease her pain. The contractions were beginning to come closer together, triggering her body to bear down. She cried out, feeling like the pain would kill her, like she’d be torn asunder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>From the bag, she took a lemon- the sour fruit often given to laboring women to distract them from the pain, and to remind them that as bitter as labor was, their babies would be just as sweet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The juices running down her throat stung, her screaming having left her throat raw. She had a moment’s respite from the pain, and when she looked up, her heart stopped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood beside the river, and she held a single flower- her face was resolute, but pale and devastated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly blacked out, despair eclipsing all else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It cannot be,” Agatha sobbed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It must be,” Rio replied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind flashed through all the moments she’d shared with the tiny life inside of her, and all the plans she’d made for their future. Now, it seemed that their future together would be cut down before it could begin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you do this, I’ll never forgive you,” Agatha choked out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked as if her heart had been crushed in front of her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All I can offer is time,” she responded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How much time?” Agatha cried out as another contraction tore through her. When she raised her eyes to the spot Rio had been, she was gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A lone flower remained on the spot she had stood. Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, and bore down, screaming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she held her son in her arms. The instant she saw that wrinkled little face, her heart was lost to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was perfect: ten fingers and ten toes, squalling and moving his limbs as he cried out for warmth, comfort, food.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She bundled him against her chest and he latched as if it was what he’d been born to do. Tears of happiness and heartbreak ran down her face, and she told him, “I spoke no spell; I said no incantation. You were made from scratch. That’s what I will call you: Nicholas Scratch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Accustomed to having enemies, Agatha knew how to hide. She knew how to move without leaving a trail, and she knew how to steal the things she didn’t have or couldn’t find for herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d thought about returning to the cottage and throwing every ward and protection spell she had at her disposal around it, but she knew that would turn her home into a prison, and that inevitably, her son would grow, become curious, and leave. And he would die.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She missed Rio desperately. Nicholas filled her heart to the brim, but missing Rio left a bone deep ache. And with every reminder of Rio came a reminder of her lover, standing beside that river, ready to betray Agatha in the worst possible way. And then, Rio’s idea of a compromise had been horrific, leaving Agatha scared and desperate every single day that her son’s heart continued to beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So every time Agatha missed Rio, she reminded herself: she said she loved you, she said she’d love this child. But she would not fight for that love, would not bend on this vital thing. Is that really love?  </span>
</p><p>
<span>For that first year, she carried her child against her chest, feeling his breath on her skin and memorizing every little thing he did as he grew. But she was also looking over her shoulder, hoping and fearing she’d see a green cloak, and hating herself for hoping.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At first, Agatha didn’t have a plan for what she’d do when they ran out of time. There was nowhere on this Earth she could go to escape Death, and she knew that better than most. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But she also knew Death better than most. And she knew what Death wanted above all else: a balance in the sacred scales that governed life and death on Earth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had tried to explain it, once: that she, along with her lesser “colleagues” ensured that the souls here and the souls in the Next place maintained an equilibrium. Each soul had an allotted time, and staying beyond that time disrupted a delicate cycle. But Agatha had grown up in a world where the scales were tipped against her, and couldn’t help but wonder: if the game was rigged, could she manipulate it to be in her favor?</span>
</p><p>
<span>And, Agatha felt that old hunger for power. She knew that if she could only become strong enough, she could hide her son from Rio forever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Like a bee making honey, she would have to range far and wide to find sources of magic to steal. And she’d need to work tirelessly to make this happen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky had turned out to be the best kind of addition to her con. No one suspected a woman with a baby would turn out to be dangerous. Nicky was a colicky child. Every woman who heard his choking wails would look upon them with pity and concern; more often than not, they’d show Agatha a kindness. And when she could, Agatha would make that work to her advantage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So it was that standing in the midst of a witch settlement, surrounded by a fallen ragtag Coven, Agatha put the two together and realized she could do both, and set up her plan A: offer Death bodies to keep ahead of the curve and help maintain the balance in Nicky’s favor, and begin shoring up her plan B: become so powerful that she could rival Death herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There were moments along the way when Agatha felt like maybe she didn’t have to do this; once, over a bowl of stew at a fireside as the coven she’d infiltrated chattered and told stories, she thought, “I could be happy here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But nearby, a high thin voice began singing Greensleeves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And that yet once before I die, Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That tale of love on one side and inconstancy and abandonment on the other was a sharp reminder to Agatha that love and happiness and kindness were no shield against Death. Only power and dead bodies could hold Rio back. And only hope that she could one day truly make her son safe could keep Agatha moving forward day after day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha never managed to make up her mind: was Nicky’s resemblance to Rio comforting, or was it heartbreaking?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Seeing that beautiful, beloved face light up with the same smile that had stolen Agatha’s heart, she knew it was both.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The number of times that she cursed wish magic, only to leave an offering of honey and lavender out the next full moon, were too many to count.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wouldn’t change a moment of this piece of her life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But she wasn’t supposed to be Nicky’s mother alone, and that little piece of information cut her deeply every time she remembered. She never managed to heal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha thought of her own mother frequently, and Evanora became a sort of guidepost for what not to do as a mother to her own child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky had the voice of an angel; Agatha encouraged him to sing and told him how gifted he was. She even sang with him, making up sweet and silly little songs they’d sing to each other, their own secret melodies.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky loved animals, and begged Agatha for a pet. Agatha found a goat that produced milk, and pretended she was buying the creature to have a reliable source of milk to sell. She threatened the goat with promises to cook it should it ever stop producing. But she turned a blind eye when Nicky gave the goat a name and braided sweet grass into its beard, and she helped the boy care for the animal, smiling when the two played, laughing when they ran together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha did not know if Nicky would grow up to be magical, but she encouraged his interest in magic, and taught him the things she’d longed to learn at his age. They spent hours in the sunshine, working through the forms for spellcasting Agatha had once learned with Rio. Sometimes the look of concentration on his precious face stopped her heart, because it was Rio’s expression on Rio’s son’s face. She’d need to take a breath and remember: it was Nicky’s face and expression too, not just Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Agatha loved her son, without reservation, and without restraint. She did not place the boundary between them that many adults preferred. She did not occupy an authoritative seat above Nicky as if he were not her equal, worthy of her respect. He knew he was loved, and he was cared for, and he loved Agatha back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The nights they fell asleep sharing a cloak and a small fire were their favorites- Agatha would wake with the dawn and kiss her sleepy son’s hair until he wiggled away, sometimes laughing, sometimes grousing, but always her sweet boy, always giving her a kiss back before beginning his chores.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looked at Agatha as if he thought she hung the moon, and Agatha looked at Nicky as if she knew he did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was not always rosy between them, though. Agatha could not fully explain her need to take power to Nicky. She did not want to tell him about Rio, fearing she would scare him, or he would ask to go, that he would be too tired or in too much pain one day and would want to leave her. She worried about what she must look like to him sometimes: someone who sought out her own kind for the sole purpose of tricking them into giving her all their power, and ultimately, tricking them into dying. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She worried that the little frown that wrinkled his brow was him deciding she was a bad person, actually, and that he needed to pull away from her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sometimes she looked at him and saw the hourglass running down in his pale lips and the beads of sweat on his forehead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She worried that he suffered, and feared he felt pain.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And maybe it was selfish (certainly it was selfish) but even the idea that Nicky was in pain, that he might choose to end this life if he knew he had another option did not stop Agatha or slow her pursuit of power for her plan. She could not let Nicky go.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What mother could?</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Time, that temperamental goddess, raced Agatha every day for nearly seven years.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the end, Agatha lost that race, and she lost her race with Death at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She woke one day and Nicky was gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s anguished wailing tore through the forest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted more time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted a chance to say goodbye.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted the chance to fight Rio, to reason with her, to beg her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would kneel at Death’s feet and offer anything and everything to keep her boy with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted to take Nicky’s place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted Rio to come back and keep her promise: to not take him without giving her a warning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After she finished screaming, she started calling for Rio. She wanted Rio to face her, to look her in the eye and tell her it had to be this way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And she never wanted to see Rio again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio never showed, and Agatha couldn’t decide if she was relieved or just that much more angry. She took her anger out on the earth, gouging out one final resting place for her son. She lined it with pine boughs and covered it with stones. Finally she laid a bundle of grape hyacinths upon the lonely grave and stared at the pile, tears streaming down her cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I bury my heart here with you, my child,” Agatha sang. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t only burying her heart with Nicky; she was taking it back from Rio, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d loved them with everything she had, and everything she was, and that love had hurt her more deeply than any hate ever had. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was done with love.</span>

<p>
<span>Forested area outside Hartford, Connecticut, 1765</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sisters, come! Let us share our news of the world before we open the door to the road; for once we have set out upon it, we will not have time for idle chatter.” Agatha made a flourishing hand gesture to the other women around the fire, welcoming them to begin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Asha, didn’t you hear tell of a field of singing rocks- tell ‘em Asha,” one witch chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Asha, cheeks pink, replied hotly, “No need to make light of it, Claire. Wilhelmina told me a man out of Philadelphia city saw them himself, and spent the day making the rocks sing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did they sing Yankee Doodle?” Claire chortled into her beer mug, but Asha only scowled harder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not that I should tell you, but he said he heard voices inside the singing. Words about doors and secrets and magic.” Asha trailed off, frowning down at her lap, and another witch jumped in with her story of flying rabbits in Rhode Island, but Agatha could only pretend to listen, sneaking occasional glances at the witch called Asha- there was something there, she was sure. Her finely tuned senses for wild information others discounted that turned out to have truth in them had never let her down before. Perhaps it was the whispers of the dead she sometimes heard in her dreams, or perhaps it was survivor’s intuition, but she had a sixth sense for a lead when she heard one.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the conversation and the beer dried up, the group of witches prepared for the journey they felt sure lay ahead of them, rehearsing the words to the ballad and asking Agatha last minute questions as she led them to a clearing further from the well traveled highway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She managed to end up beside Asha, and murmured to her, “I have also heard stories of the singing stones, sister. Please tell me- where did you say they were?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Asha, flustered by Agatha’s attention, rambled on about Pennsylvania’s forests and geography for a good long while, and Agatha interjected with the occasional “Hmmm,” and “Oh, yes, very likely,” as Asha spouted off her theories and lamentations that she couldn’t make her way there from the distant land of central Connecticut.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha set a comforting hand on the other woman’s shoulder. “Fear not, Asha, after the road, you shall have whatever it is you seek.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Asha’s smile of gratitude did not stir Agatha’s conscience in the least. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Perhaps some would find her poise in the moments leading up to the deaths of five women chilling and sociopathic. For Agatha, this was just another day she lived to see tomorrow. It was another day she gave Death a reason to stay the hell away from her. But most importantly, it was another day she didn’t have to face her beloved son and beg his forgiveness for not being able to save him or to protect him from the evils of the world, and the flaws in herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the last witch in the shattered circle fell, drained and lifeless, Agatha touched one finger to her locket but did not open it to see the tiny curl of hair within it. She simply turned and walked away, heading towards her next scheme. </span>
</p><p>--</p><p>
<span>Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood in the center of a blighted boulder field. The rocks around her appeared to be unremarkable; nothing grew in or around them, and the sky above was devoid of birds, as the ground below was devoid of the usual tiny creatures that loved crevices and hiding holes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had already cursed the cobbles and the rounded surfaces of the boulders, pausing to change her comfortable walking shoes to sturdier boots with better grips on the bottom. She needed to keep her ankles healthy and whole, and the jumble of stones threatened her with a fall at any moment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the boulders were the reason Agatha was there. After hearing Asha’s story, she’d been collecting whispers and rumors, and she felt that she was very close to something here. She hefted a silver mallet, one she’d had to have a jeweler create to her specifications. Tales insisted a common hammer would suffice, but Agatha knew that magic was very particular, as were musical instruments: both required the user to account for things like materials used to yield the best results. Agatha hoped she’d come prepared. Choosing a likely looking rock, she struck the gray, unassuming surface decisively.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beautiful tone rang out from the boulder, as if Agatha had rung a bell, not struck a rock. She smiled with satisfaction. Her efforts had not been in vain, and she was in the right place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>More than the tone she’d heard, she had felt the web of energy around this place flex with the strike. There was an energy vortex here, and Agatha intended to tap into it. She spent the next days camping on the edge of the field and testing each boulder she could find. Some seemed to be broken, for they no longer rang when struck. She marked these with an X in charcoal and moved on to the next candidate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Whispers she’d heard had insisted the correct tones in the correct order would part the strands of protection around the vortex enough for the energy to begin to trickle out; and if that happened, Agatha believed her magic siphoning ability would serve her well. She eagerly pursued the possibility of a huge influx of magic, the likes of which she’d have needed dozens of covens to collect. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Each evening, she burned bundles of sweet smelling herbs as offerings to the goddesses of wisdom and luck. Her dreams at night were filled with vibrating tones that seemed to twist into words, warnings and blessings alike. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go no further,” one voice seemed to warn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Leave, while you still may,” another tolling sound cried out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Press on!” a high pitched stone’s peal encouraged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was as if the field of boulders had a crowd of people within it, all trying to communicate with her at once.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was a woman with all the time in the world for this- for continuing to pursue her plan B (edited version) of becoming powerful enough to rival Death. Agatha still couldn’t say what she would do with the power once she had it. Sometimes, she imagined a reunion with Nicky, whole and healthy. She could give him a new chance at life, she felt sure, if only she stole enough magic and grew powerful enough. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her first breakthrough finally came when she struck a rock and heard, clearly, a voice within the tone speak: </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ex virgo vita vi (from the young girl, life force)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha removed a piece of chalk from her pocket and marked the spot. Looking more carefully at the boulder, she noticed a faded pale spot, barely any different from the rest of the stones in the field, but enough that she could see several more stones nearby with similar markings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tested each, listening to their tones, and marking any with words within them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she thought she had it. She stood in the middle of the circle she had marked and directed her mallet to the stone she thought must be the first of the sequence, then the next, and the next.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before, when she had hit the rocks, the sound had come and gone quickly, but as soon as she began to hit one after another without pause, each tone reverberated through the air, overlapping the last. Instead of fading away, the sound crescendoed and rang through the air.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she heard the entire message together:</span>
</p><p>
<span>ab initial mundi (from the beginning of the world)</span>
</p><p>
<span>hoc verum est (this is true)</span>
</p><p>
<span>ex Luna circuitus (from the moon, cycles)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ex virgo vita vi (from the young girl, life force)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ex Alma mater (from the mother, nourishment)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ex vetula sapientia (from the old woman, wisdom)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ex solis vita (from the sun, life)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ex stellae scientia (from the stars, knowledge)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sic est et sic erit (so it is, so it shall be)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly needed to cover her ears, but she resisted. Her bones vibrated with the energy being untwisted and untangled around her, and suddenly, she felt it crashing upon her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The surge was like being attacked by her entire Coven 100 times over. She was ready, and tried to absorb it, but it was a torrent, a flood, and she couldn’t handle it. In desperation, she had to deflect it from herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At first she was disappointed, but then she noticed the energy wasn’t glancing off of her and disappearing. Instead she watched as the energy began to form into a shape: an intricate door made of light was appearing before her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well, well, what do we have here,” Agatha murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When the reverberations from the singing stones stopped, the door became more solid. Agatha braced herself and placed a hand upon it. When it did not turn her mad or blast her away, she pulled it open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, a room made of tightly fitted stones the shape of an upturned bowl awaited. The room was empty except for a scroll suspended in the air, a single beam of light illuminating it. Upon the scroll was a single wax seal, holding it closed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped forward. She expected defenses or traps, but nothing happened. As she took the scroll, the room rumbled, and a stone fell from the ceiling, nearly catching her on the shoulder. Agatha raced for the door, flickering now- she threw herself through the doorway an instant before the whole room collapsed. The door disappeared, leaving no trace it had ever been there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A sharp cracking noise drew Agatha’s attention back to the rocks; the rock that had rang with the phrase, “Ex stellae scientia” had broken in half. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It would never ring again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just in case, Agatha stowed the scroll within her satchel and tried to ring the stones again, hoping she’d have another shot at collecting some power, but this time, though the stones sang, their sound died away quickly, and no words could be heard within the brief tones. There would be no further harnessing of the vortex through this method again, nor would another door appear to her this way.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha had what she’d come for, and she walked away with her prize satisfied.</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first night after leaving the singing tone field, Agatha dreamed of Death; not in Rio’s form, but in the form she had first known them: a tall, pale skeleton wrapped in a green cloak standing in a dark misty nothingness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha Harkness,”</span>
</em>
<span> Death’s voice vibrated through her, as it had all those years ago in that field outside of Salem, and as the stones had the day before.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>”We need to talk,”</span>
</em>
<span> Death continued. “</span>
<em>
<span>You have gone too far, and have meddled in things you understand little about,” </span>
</em>
<span>Death pointed an accusatory finger at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha concentrated; if she was truly lucid dreaming, she should be able to take some control of this dream. At first, she struggled, feeling as if she had no mouth or tongue or teeth to speak with, but finally, she got it right- “Coward,” she screamed. “Face me as you were when you made love to me; when you told me you loved me; when you killed my child!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Death only turned their back and began walking away into the misty edges of Agatha’s dream.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ran after them, but she was only running in place. She did not move forward and could not go back. She screamed, and cried, and cursed Death’s name, but she only found herself awake in the night, alone in her tear drenched bedroll.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the morning, she weighed her options; her dreams were rarely prophetic, but she could tell when they were, and the dream last night had felt like someone was communicating with her. If it was Rio, then opening the scroll and reading its contents would surely bring that blasted woman to appear before her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But still- whatever was within the scroll had to be important enough to have gotten Rio’s attention in the first place. She only ever meddled when humans tangled with power beyond their ken, power with the ability to disrupt the sacred balance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Flexing her fingers and squaring her shoulders, Agatha broke the wax seal on the scroll and began to study its contents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>What she read was this: </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Herein thou shalt find an accounting of the teribel and truthful downfall of the Great Olde Ones, and the banishment of their anthology of darkness, the black book borne to hold all the evils they blasphemed upon this worlde.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It was in the time of Arthur, the once and future king, when the Great Olde Ones returned through the door opened for them by Morgana le Fay. The forces of good were falling before this evil onslaught as wheat falls below the hail. In desperation, Merlin cast an incantation, and from it came an Angel: a being covered in terrible eyes, and feathers made of fire, that did blind the mortal men who looked upon her. She did agree to help, and wielding an awful sword of blood and fire did drive back the horde of darkness, sending them to the frozen wastes of the outer nothing plane, where no realities exist. But behind them remained a terrible stain upon this planet: a booke, made of demon flesh, which contained all the dark and wicked arts of the Great Olde Ones, and imprisoned within is a force for chaos, a wicked demon whose name cannot be written, nor his likeness be written either, for whatsoever bears his likeness will possess the beholders.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The corrupting power of this evyl book did go to the holiest of places to be safe-kept, for neither fire, nor water, nor consumption of its pieces could destroy the binding, the pages, or the words and knowledge within it. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A wicked monke taken in by the wiles of the booke did make a copy; this bastard child of the DarkeHolde is lost to us. Whispers of evil deeds, demonic posseshuns, and outbreaks of plague, famine, and war, herald its presence before it disappears from view and awareness again. We seek the copy, for it can be destroyed, as it was made by the hand of man on the leather of a mortal beast. Until we can finde it again, none shall rest easily.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>But for now, the greatest forces of evil remain contained, guarded by the likeness of the Angel upon this Earth. It is foretold that the DarkeHolde will find a new master or mistress upon the eve of the end of the world; we pray to God he send us a holy fire to scour this scourge from the Earth.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Dimitrius, the Doomed</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finished the scroll, then hid it in the secret magical compartment within her bag beside her other magical texts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She set about placing her runes around her campsite and hunkering down. If she was to receive a visitor, she wanted to be somewhat prepared, although Rio had never struggled to tear down any protections she placed as if they were cobwebs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That task completed, Agatha brewed a pot of tea and settled in to study the scroll again. She had a lot to think about.</span>

<p>
<span>Agatha was under no illusion as to what type of magic she wielded. She was not a “light” magic user. Nor could she generously be labeled as a gray magic user: she was a dark magic witch, and she embraced that fact and made it work to her advantage. But there were limits to how far she thought she’d go. Demons, tangling with the old gods, and calling down ancient curses from long dead monks were not usually on her dance card, but then again, she’d pissed off some serious baddies already, including Death herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As if summoned, a rip tore in the fabric of reality. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sprang to her feet, purple magic already gathering at her palms, ready to blast.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped through, wearing her achingly familiar form.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Speak of the devil,” Agatha muttered, steeling herself for a fight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Hey,” Rio said, hefting her knife as if preparing to stab, “The devil is a good guy, he’s just misunderstood.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she sprang at Agatha, knife at the ready.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”You’ve been very naughty, Agatha,” Rio tutted, trying to slash at Agatha’s chest as the witch deflected her knife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’ve been a cowardly bitch,” Agatha retorted, managing to land a magic fueled punch to Rio’s jaw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok, ouch,” Rio said, rubbing at the spot before seeing an opening in Agatha’s defenses and managing to land a slicing blow to the witch’s abdomen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck you,” Agatha hissed, as the shallow but long wound began to bleed sluggishly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have,” Rio winked, “but I’d take you up on the offer again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha screamed, managing to get inside Rio’s defenses and knocking her to the ground. Rio’s knife went flying, but neither woman went for it. They were using fists and nails and teeth, gouging and cursing and rolling. Neither had the upper hand until Agatha got her hands around Rio’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Remember rule number one?” She hissed into Rio’s face as the other woman struggled for air. “Human bodies need to breathe?” Rio clawed at Agatha’s wrists, and managed to headbutt Agatha, who reflexively let go. Blood streamed into her eye from a cut on her brow, but Agatha just charged again, determined to kill or die trying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio got a grip on her wrist as she tried to punch the other woman, and bent her arm painfully behind Agatha’s back, spinning them and pinning Agatha against a tree, holding her there with her hips and thighs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is not what I came here for, Agatha!” Rio shouted into her ear, shoving Agatha harder into the tree. “As much as I love your idea of foreplay-“</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sputtered out a derisive noise-</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to call a truce!” Rio got out finally.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck-that-” Agatha ground out, struggling anew. Her cheek was being rubbed raw against the tree bark but she fought to ignore the pain. Her free hand scrabbled at Rio, looking for anything to grab, but she only managed to get fistfuls of robes, leaving superficial scratches on Rio’s back for her troubles. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You haven’t even heard my offer,” Rio purred into her ear. In spite of herself, Agatha shivered. Rio chuckled and Agatha’s anger returned. She couldn’t let Rio get to her like this, couldn’t allow her under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio was already there, and she knew it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ratcheted the arm in her grip higher up Agatha’s back, and Agatha bit back a scream of pain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know you want the Darkhold,” Rio murmured into her ear. Agatha froze. “And you can have it, once I’m done with it.” She continued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what’s your offer?” Agatha finally said. She reserved the right to continue punching Rio later, and Rio knew that fact very well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Quid pro quo- you help me, and I help you. Or…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or what?” Agatha asked, “What if I won’t help you- what if I spit in your face and walk away?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sharp tip of Rio’s knife dug into the space between Agatha’s shoulder blades.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know your game, Agatha,” Rio’s voice was low and teasing. “All this bravado and anger- it’s just a facade.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like hell it is,” Agatha choked out, the pain in her arm beginning to numb into a different type of pain, her shoulder growing cold. “Let me go and let’s have a fair fight, and I’ll show you just how real my anger is.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even if you can’t forgive me, don’t be a fool,” Rio said, her voice returning to its normal tone. “Help me and you will be… rewarded.” The knife trailed up to the bare skin of her neck, cold steel kissing tender flesh, and Agatha betrayed herself by shivering.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As if you’d ever let me have something as powerful as the Darkhold. You just said it yourself- I don’t understand the forces I’m dealing with. I don’t believe you’d let me have a book created by the Olde Ones.” Agatha tried to turn her head to look at Rio’s face, wondering if she’d be able to read the other woman’s intentions as she once had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Help me acquire the Darkhold,” Rio said, “and you can have it after I take what I need from it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio released Agatha, shoving her one final time against the tree before backing away. She adopted a wary but relaxed stance, knowing the other woman would be considering her offer and pause in her attacks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would I help you,” Agatha demanded, “When we both know I’m perfectly capable of getting the Darkhold by myself?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because,” Rio said lazily, “My brothers would tear you apart before letting you get anywhere near it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze. “Your… brothers?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, twirling her knife between her fingers. “You might know them as Famine, Pestilence, and War.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope!” Rio said cheerfully. “Zelos is Pestilence, he had a real nasty streak- used to try to strike me down with a cold until I threatened to trap him in Tartarus. Martius is a world traveler, setting the fires of war all over, and Limos is kind of like a reverse green witch, his specialty is fungus. And those are my brothers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what do you need me for?” Agatha asked again, pressing one hand to the oozing gash in her abdomen to try to get the bleeding to stop. Rio’s eyes followed the movement but she didn’t remark on the blood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need you to kill some witches,” Rio said. “A certain coven gained the Darkhold and used it to capture my three baby brothers and bend them to the coven’s will. They are bound to the Darkhold and cannot disobey the coven.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned. “Why not kill them yourself? Surely you’re stronger than them, even with the Darkhold in play?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I’m not allowed.” Rio answered matter of fact-ly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed bitterly. “Has that ever stopped you before?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio frowned. “I didn’t kill Nicky, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s entire body stiffened. “How dare you say his name,” she whispered, white hot rage coursing through her, fresh and sharp. She hadn’t been prepared for Rio to be so direct after avoiding facing her for so long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I dare,” Rio shot back, “A great many things- he’s safe, Agatha. He’s free from pain. Can’t you let that bring you comfort?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He will never be safe without me!” Agatha shouted. “Who will protect him, love him, like his own mama?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled sadly. “Me.” She said simply. “His mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, trying to dismiss Rio’s words, to deny the truth she’d known as soon as she’d seen Nicky for the first time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you want to hit me, go ahead.” Rio said, holding her arms out. “If you hate me and you want to see me bleed, we can do that until your body collapses.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to scream and punch and claw at you,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “I know you’re not a huge fan of feelings, Agatha, but most people would just give crying a chance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t know anything about my feelings!” Agatha felt sure if she said the words with enough conviction, they’d become true- as if she’d spoken a spell to make it so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s shoulders slumped. “I know you’re hurting, still. And I know that no amount of violence, stimulating though it may be, will change any of that.” Rio held her knife out, making sure Agatha was watching. She sheathed it and pulled her robes back into place. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve been running all this time.” Rio half asked, half stated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’ve been following me,” Agatha shot back, “So it would seem I had every right to act as if I was being hunted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “Not hunted, Agatha. I never meant you harm, and I would not have hurt you. That can still be true even though I had to come for Nicky. I did not want to do what I did. I will repeat that as many times as I must for you to believe me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The ears may hear,” Agatha ground out, “But the heart cannot accept.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped closer, moving into Agatha’s space. “Is this how you want to continue living out your mortal existence on this Earth?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed as those dark eyes bore steadily into her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I still see the light within you Agatha- no, do not dismiss my words. I know of your thirst for life, and of your hunt for power.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached one hand out to Agatha, showing her that she held a flower out for her to take. Agatha stared at it, unmoving.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that you fear letting another in will leave you weak and vulnerable.” Rio was murmuring again, as if addressing a skittish horse. “But trust me when I say, I do not expect anything of you. I need your assistance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped in even closer. If she leaned forward, their noses would touch. “So, you can hit me, or punch me, or stab me-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha growled, body tense, but she stayed still. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or, you can listen to me now, and tell me if my offer is to your liking.” Rio smirked insolently and raised an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As much as I believe violence is the answer,” Agatha said on a sigh, trying to release her unspent aggression, “I know that won’t change anything and that I’d never win against you. So say what you think I need to hear.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her, deep brown eyes tracing the shape of Agatha’s face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am not unaware of what you lost, Agatha.” Rio began. Agatha stiffened. She wanted to run away, to never stop until she was far enough away that Death could never find her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know you don’t want to talk about him- that you were so relentlessly protective and possessive of him,” Rio continued. “And that you were the best mama any child could have wished for. That depth of love you had for him was incredible to witness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You couldn’t know all that,” Agatha whispered, voice choking on a half-sob. “You weren’t there, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I watched you two,” Rio said softly, trying to take Agatha’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled away, shook her head no, speechless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I loved you both, missed you, mourned you, the whole time.” Rio’s voice was barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. “Lies,” she whispered. “You couldn’t love us, and separate us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “I’m sorry for the way things happened Agatha, but I could not change it, I could not give you more time. His body gave out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat on the ground, covered her face with her hands, and wept, trying to smother her sobs before Rio could hear them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated before sitting beside Agatha. She watched Agatha cry for a moment, then reached out to put her arms around her. Agatha melted into her touch, pressing her face into the crook of Rio’s shoulder, and cried as if she’d never allowed herself to mourn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stroked Agatha’s hair, murmuring, “I’m sorry, my love. I’m so, so, sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She slowly rocked the woman in her arms back and forth, giving her a safe place to cry.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha accepted the comfort, her mind racing a million miles an hour.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Could Rio be telling the truth?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Could she ever trust her again, could she believe anyone could love Nicky even a fraction as much as she had?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The habit of a lifetime kicked in and Agatha’s survival skills that had served her so well shouted to her: go along with this; act as if she forgave Rio. Let the other woman believe they were growing close again, and then- take the Darkhold as soon as the opportunity came. Screw Rio over as much as possible, and hurt her as much as Agatha had been hurt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sagged against Rio, pretending that the comfort and closeness she felt were just part of her newly hatched scheme. She ignored the way her heart raced at the familiar touch and smell of her former lover, but catalogued the way Rio reacted to her- demonstrating tenderness and a desire to be close. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After a while, Agatha’s tears subsided. She lifted a shaking, bleeding hand to her face to wipe her tears away, but Rio caught her hand before she could do so, wiping the tears away for Agatha, staring into her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knew that look and she knew how to respond to it. She let her eyes drift to Rio’s lips, and licked her own lips, leaving them wet and parted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It worked as Agatha knew it would, and Rio kissed the hand she held. The pain Agatha had been feeling there was gone, healed. Rio looked at Agatha’s face, tracing her split lip. Agatha hadn’t even noticed it happening in their fight. She looked at Rio’s face, at her questioning gaze, and nodded her assent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed Agatha. At first, it was so gentle, just a brush of lips as Rio healed her. But even that light touch, almost innocent, reminded Agatha of all the years she’d been without this. Of all the nights she’d missed Rio’s touch, longed to call for her. So when Rio tried to pull away, Agatha grabbed her shirtfront and pulled her back and kissed her again, still tentative and gentle, still asking the question Rio had asked wordlessly: “Is this ok?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio moaned into her mouth, Agatha had her answer. She felt triumph warm her belly; never mind that she was feeling as much as Rio was, Agatha knew that when the time came she’d be able to kill the tender blooms of this regrowing romance, her anger a killing frost. But for now, why not enjoy all the pleasures this game had to offer?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands were still fisted in Rio’s shirt, and she let go to wind her arms around the other woman’s neck, clinging to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled Agatha into her lap, wrapping her own arms around Agatha’s lower back, pulling them as close as they could possibly get. Agatha was the first to pull away, gasping for breath, but Rio kept kissing her, lips mapping Agatha’s jawline, tracing the prominent muscle down the side of her neck when Agatha tilted her head to give her space.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”Rio,” Agatha sighed, “Goddesses, I’ve missed you.” But she knew they weren’t ready for more than this; she couldn’t bring herself to be vulnerable with Rio yet, to open herself up so completely to this woman who had a hand in hurting her so deeply, even in the pursuit of power. Agatha may have been using the attraction and desire that thrummed so strongly between herself and Rio for her own gains, but she needed time, needed to come to terms with this new reality and organize her feelings and her plans. Everything would become too confusing too quickly if she let things go any further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She slipped her hand into Rio’s hair, cupping that beautiful face in her hands and trying to cool them both down with a chaste kiss on Rio’s closed lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rested her forehead against Rio’s, and whispered, “I’m not ready for more than this yet…” Rio turned her head to kiss Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>”I understand. I’m sorry if-“</span>
</p><p>
<span>”No,” Agatha immediately interrupted. “You were… that was exactly what I needed. I wanted that to happen, and I think you did as well.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, squeezing her eyes shut. She opened them again, looking deeply into Agatha’s eyes, scanning them as if looking for something. “I know we won’t ever be…like we were,” Rio said, cautiously, “But I do want to try to heal some of the damage I have caused.” She pulled back, looking at the minor stab wound on Agatha’s stomach. Agatha chuckled, pulling the torn fabric of her dress aside. Rio traced the wound gently, making Agatha shiver. When she was done, the skin had closed over, leaving the barest white scar beneath the drying blood.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know it won’t be as easy as that,” Rio continued, “And maybe we won’t ever be as close as we once were.” She frowned and shook her head. “But you said once that you felt a pull between us, like magnets. And I still feel that.” Rio grinned ruefully. “I find myself pulled to you, after all this time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brushed Rio’s cheek with the back of her hand. Rio leaned into the touch, kissing Agatha’s knuckles as they brushed past her mouth. Agatha watched, lips parted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that you’re mortal,” She laughed when Agatha made a ‘so-so’ gesture with her hand- “Ok, mortal but long-lived, and that I’m not meant to interfere in your life, or even interact with you, but let’s face it: we keep getting pushed together, as much as we get pulled apart. The only reasonable conclusion I can come up with is that forces bigger than us have obviously had a hand in pushing us together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. She’d often wondered at the cruelty of fate. Some twisting threads had gifted her with the love of her life, and then placed them so at odds with each other. Now she wondered: instead of being a pawn of fate, could she rise to the ranks of knighthood and have some power over this cosmic game of chess she found herself caught up in?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to fight it anymore, Agatha.” Rio admitted. “But this isn’t a choice I can make without you feeling the same way.” She shook her head. “I won’t force my presence on you, or anything else, if you don’t want me in your life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes, thoughts racing. The duality of her feelings and her swiftly forming plans fought each other, and she knew she needed to be authentic to keep Rio from suspecting she planned to double cross her. So she leaned into her emotions: the last decades of her life had been spent running from Rio, then plotting her revenge on Rio. Even when Nicky was there, everything had been about Rio. She was the sun around which Agatha’s universe spun, and Agatha was tired of running from the warmth Rio made her feel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As you said, this is a complicated situation, and there are a lot of feelings tangled up inside of that.” Agatha took a deep breath and opened her eyes. “I can’t promise that I will get over my grief.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I wouldn’t ask you to,” Rio responded immediately. “I’ve seen enough grief to know it doesn’t go away. You live with it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>”That’s been my experience as well,” Agatha agreed. “And sometimes, it makes me so angry. Homicidal, even.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “I’m aware.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So we’re both in agreement, then? Sometimes I’ll try to kill you, and you’ll try to kill me back because you’re just like that, and other times… well.” Agatha bit her lip. Goddess, this woman could make her </span>
<em>
<span>feel</span>
</em>
<span>. “Other times, maybe, we can revisit that inevitable pull between us?”   </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. “Nice way to say you’ll put your tongue down my throat when you aren’t trying to choke me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. “This is going to be really unhealthy, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, completely toxic,” Rio helped her to her feet, then didn’t let go of her hand. ”Just admit it, you’d be bored with a fairytale romance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed aloud. “Probably. I’d need to kill off the Prince to run away with his evil stepmother, or something like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio preened. “I knew you liked your ladies older.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slapped Rio’s shoulder. Rio pushed her right back. “Older is a little bit of an understatement,” Agatha reminded her. “Aren’t you as old as-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As life itself, yes.” Rio nodded. “With life, comes entropy, and with entropy, comes </span>
<em>
<span>moi</span>
</em>
<span>. Yada, yada, balance, cycle, you know the spiel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve always been ambitious,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I remember,” Rio said suggestively, eyebrows raised. “Lasciviously inclined, if I do remember.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sniffed, straightening her skirt. “I am a lady, I’ll have you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She marched ahead, leaving Rio to stare after her and call, “Yeah, a lady of the night- you took my virtue!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Long overdue, if you ask me!” Agatha called back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “She’s got me there,” she muttered, skipping after Agatha.</span>

<p>“I can’t believe this is how humans prefer to travel,” Rio said, cheerfully skipping through a muddy puddle that Agatha took great pains to skirt around. “Imagine being so short lived and slogging away your lives with all this walking!”</p><p>“Speaking of walking for nothing,” Agatha grumbled, “Can’t you just take us to wherever it is we’re going? Or can we requisition some horses?”</p><p>“I’m not allowed to ride other horses,” Rio said ominously. “Pale Steed gets jealous, and then he bites.”</p><p>“Pale… Steed?” </p><p>“Yes, my horse. Keep up, Agatha, everyone knows about Pale Steed. It’s in the Bible or something.”</p><p>“So that explains the no horse thing, but what about the-“ Agatha made a stabbing motion.</p><p>“Oh, right, the knife. Well, I suppose we could, but I was enjoying the novelty of walking.” Rio answered breezily.</p><p>“Maybe we could catch a coach?” Agatha tried not to whine, she really did; the woods of Pennsylvania were lovely, but she wasn’t looking forward to walking the entire eastern seaboard just so Rio could play at being a mortal.</p><p>“You gotta toughen up, Agatha.” Rio snapped her fingers. “Anyway, we can catch a ship soon- we need to get to Boston. I need to pick up a very special weapon.”</p><p>“Ugh,” Agatha said, disgust clear in her voice. “That backwater? Why? And I thought I was all the weapon you needed, baby,” she fluttered her eyelashes at Rio, who smiled wickedly back, dragging the tip of her knife across her lower lip.</p><p>“The coven that had the Darkhold was in France last I heard, but they had to flee after some nasty business in the catacombs. Word on the street is they came to Boston first. After that, well- I’m not sure yet.” Rio shrugged as if this was no big deal. </p><p>Agatha spluttered. “You didn’t tell me this was one of those long game adventures. This is going to be worse than the time we spent three years “getting into character” as privateers. And the entire time, you just wanted to have your way with me in a hammock. Now you’re dragging me through backwaters and into dens of ill-repute,” Agatha groaned. “Why do I get the feeling we’re about to be bathing in horse troughs?”</p><p>“Just like old times!” Rio cheered. “Admit it: you loved every minute.”</p><p>“We both got scurvy! I didn’t even know it was possible for you to get scurvy!”</p><p>“Fun times,” Rio laughed maniacally. “And this is just like that: we need to build your persona. If Agatha Harkness shows up in Boston, she’ll be burned at the stake. Now, Mrs. Emily Pritchett, come to visit her mother’s sister’s cousin? She will be welcomed with open arms. I considered giving you the persona of Madame Nightshade, renowned travelling French medium, but northerners are so mistrustful of people who commune with the dead. And the French.”</p><p>“You do have a point there.” Agatha admitted, “But I still think we could catch a ship or a coach, and work on our cover stories there.”</p><p>“You mortals always try to take the easy way out,” Rio tutted. “Now, repeat after me: One lump or two?”</p><p>“In this political climate? With tea and sugar being taxed to hell and back? You’re trying to get me mobbed, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio cackled. “Ok, you’re right. We can start with matrilineal family lines and a convincingly named string of boarding schools that failed to stamp the firebrand spirit out of you, have it your way.”</p><p>–</p><p>No sane person should have been able to believe Rio and Agatha were sisters, and yet, they had no issue making their way to Boston via carriages, ships, and more carriages under that guise. Mrs. Emily Pritchett and her sister, Mary Turner (rabidly spinsterly) had no difficulties as they wove their cover stories together. </p><p>After the (ill-advised, spine tingling, poorly considered, damnably HOT) kissing in the forest, Agatha expected Rio to attempt more of the same, but the other woman was oddly respectful, keeping her distance… except for the little ‘unavoidable’ touches. Like when Rio helped her into a carriage, and her hand touched Agatha’s bare elbow. Never had an elbow touch in public felt so scandalous as that one had.</p><p>And then there was the issue of the beds- or, in most cases, the bed, singular, that the guest rooms they found themselves in along the way offered. Agatha would fall asleep on her own side of the bed, hugging the edge. But she would wake up, deliciously warm, in Rio’s arms. She couldn’t blame Rio- Agatha would migrate to the opposite side of the bed and help herself to her bedmate’s body heat and pillowy bosom, only to wake up flustered to stammer out an excuse and flee. </p><p>The close quarters and constant time spent together put Agatha on edge. She found no time to regain her equilibrium. She suspected that was how Rio wanted it.</p><p>Agatha was always impressed at how deeply Rio managed to blend into the human world- she was not, after all, human- and she didn’t usually act like one.</p><p>But somehow she knew someone in every town they passed through, friendly strangers that offered them supplies, places to stay, and news of Boston. Rio had also found them lodgings in Boston. When they finally reached the city, a cheerful innkeeper led them to a converted carriage house, small but out of the way. It would suit them perfectly, allowing them space to talk away from listening ears. It also had a private entrance so they could come and go at all hours. </p><p>Rio and Agatha set about developing their personas’ reputations.They sat in a pub one evening, and Rio gestured for Agatha to lean in. She whispered, “There’s our mark- Mrs. Harding. She has held my sword, I can see the mark on her soul.”</p><p>“Yikes,” said Agatha. “Remind me not to touch your ‘sword,’” she snorted into her ale.</p><p>“Oh Agatha, you know that you can touch my sword anytime,” Rio winked.  </p><p>—</p><p>Rio left Boston to follow a lead about where the coven they were ultimately tracking had gone. </p><p>“You don’t need me for this part,” Rio said, “Now that you know a few people, doors will begin to open for you. But do not, under any circumstances, try to take my sword without me. Find it, tell me where it is, and I’ll get it.”</p><p>“Is that concern I hear?” Agatha teased. “Don’t you know I can take care of myself?”</p><p>“Oh I know you can,” Rio said, invading Agatha’s space. She lightly touched one loose strand of hair that had fallen from Agatha’s braid.</p><p>“But the sword is unpredictable.” Rio broke the moment, letting go of Agatha’s hair and turning towards the door. “It could kill you, or wipe out half of Boston.”</p><p>Agatha shivered. “Noted; wait for backup.”</p><p>Rio grinned, and said, “Te veo,” before stepping out the door and disappearing.</p><p>-</p><p>It was only a few days later that Agatha managed to finagle an introduction to Mrs. Harding in the market as she haggled over beets.</p><p>“Those beets must be from last winter!” Agatha said scornfully to the merchant trying to drive the price up. </p><p>Mrs. Harding looked at her gratefully. “I said the same thing! But this highway robber would rather see my family starve than part with last season’s beets for a reasonable price!”</p><p>“Fine, fine,” the seller said, looking at the frowning women in the crowd behind them beginning to take note of the disgruntled voices. “Two bundles for a ha’penny. Take it or leave it, miss.”</p><p>Mrs. Harding paid the man, and she and Agatha strolled away chatting about the horrible “price of things these days,” and how terrible it was that one couldn’t have a new dress or a cup of tea like one used to do. And Agatha chimed in that she knew some things that ladies looking for ‘alternatives’ to expensive imported goods might find helpful.</p><p>Mrs. Harding seemed doubtful and wary- a wise approach in an occupied city so divided between political sentiments. But Agatha had been prepared for doubt and mistrust. She led Mrs. Harding to an out of the way churchyard. </p><p>“Do you see that bench, there by the window?” Agatha asked, pointing to an old wooden bench below a stained glass window.</p><p>”I do.”</p><p>”Keep watching.”</p><p>Agatha called upon her magic, and levitated the bench above the ground. Mrs. Harding’s eyes opened wide and she gasped, turning to Agatha. </p><p>“You’re a w-”</p><p>“Wonderful woman you just met at the market? Yes, I am! Mrs. Emily Pritchett, pleased to make your acquaintance.” Agatha shook the shocked woman’s hand, grinning at her madly and throwing her a sly wink.</p><p>And that was how Agatha was invited to a sewing circle that was actually, secretly, an underground gathering of lady revolutionaries.</p><p>— </p><p>1766, Boston, Massachusetts</p><p>A circle of women sewed by candlelight, chattering quietly amongst themselves. Whispers swirled around the room, speaking of militias and weaponry and new British ships carrying yet more red-coated soldiers to occupy their city. And then, another word: witches. For a split second, all the candles guttered as if they might go out and silence reigned. One woman set her project aside and went to stir the fire in the hearth. There was a knock at the door. Hands stilled, then a flurry of movement: sewing baskets thrown open, contents of laps thrown unceremoniously under the lid, and smaller projects were brought out: needlepoint bible verses, socks in need of mending; small, everyday things that wouldn’t raise eyebrows.</p><p>Mrs. Harding opened the door as the room settled back into preoccupied stillness.</p><p>”Good evening,” she said to the figure at the door. ‘Would you like a cup of tea?”</p><p>”I prefer… coffee,” came the voice from below a dark hood. The room relaxed a fraction at the clear American accent, and began to breathe again as the secret phrase was delivered flawlessly. </p><p>“We have some over the fire,” Mrs. Harding stepped back, and the ritual of the revolutionaries was complete. The cloaked figure entered, carrying her own sewing basket. She lowered her hood and surveyed the room. These were the women, Agatha Harkness knew, that oiled the wheels of the machine of slowly building opposition against Great Britain. And though they did not know it, they were also unwitting pawns in a different power struggle: the one between order and chaos. And they were on the wrong side.</p><p>Agatha pulled a seat up beside Mrs. Harding, murmuring, “What a lovely pattern, Mrs. Harding. Will it be a pillowcase?”</p><p>Mrs. Harding smiled grimly. “It won’t ever be anything at all if we cannot lay down our knitting, sewing, and darning. I’ve hardly had time to put a stitch in it this last year.”</p><p>”A shame,” Agatha commiserated. She put her basket down and saw that all the women in the room had stopped to watch her. She smiled, and raised her voice to say to the room, “Can I interest you ladies in some passages from the Good Book?”</p><p>Slow smiles began appearing on the faces around the room, and Agatha brought out the Bible she kept in her sewing basket. She’d skillfully ripped the original pages out of the distinctive black leather cover, then sewn a different sort of book altogether inside of it.</p><p>“Where were we? Oh yes- The art of magic need not be mastered to be of use to you. A workmanlike understanding of runes, or a small selection of potions memorized can serve a witch as well as years of study, if she be creative enough with her application. Let us discuss the use of common kitchen herbs for magical purposes.”</p><p>After the meeting, Agatha slunk away in the shadows beyond the reach of the paltry lamps along the street. The cobblestones underfoot would have given her away if not for the soft soled shoes she wore. She finally found herself standing outside her lodgings and let herself into the dark house as quietly as she could. Soldiers doing their nightly rounds would pass by soon, and she did not want to be caught out without a purpose.</p><p>Agatha reached for the candle and flint she kept on the table and struck; the spark illuminated the room briefly and Agatha jumped at the black figure standing by the cold hearth.</p><p>The voice that came from the depths of the dark room should not have been a shock but Agatha jumped nonetheless: “Surprise,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha’s candle caught, and she could have sworn she saw white bone below Rio’s eyes, but as the flame caught and steadied, the illusion was gone.</p><p>“Back so soon?” Agatha grumbled.</p><p>“I didn’t want you to miss me,” Rio teased. “I know how much you hate a cold, lonely bed.”</p><p>Agatha blushed, trying to hide it by turning to place kindling and start a fire. But Rio came closer, sitting on the hearth so she was looking into Agatha’s face as the other woman frowned at the tiny ember she was trying to coax to full flame.</p><p>“So, how goes the mission?” Rio finally asked when she grew tired of Agatha ignoring her.</p><p>“Slowly,” Agatha sighed, feeding larger pieces of kindling into the nascent flame, “If you’d just let me do it my way we’d be halfway to France by now, but as it stands, this whole “earn their trust to learn their secrets” gambit is not yielding any joy.” She stood to reach for a log of wood.</p><p>”Well,” Rio drawled, catching Agatha’s wrist, “This isn’t one of your “wham, bam, thank you for the magical powers, ma’am” schemes.” She slid her fingers into Agatha’s palm, then between her fingers, leaving tingling trails everywhere she touched. Agatha’s eyes were locked on Rio’s hand, and Rio smirked. “This requires some… finesse.”</p><p>Agatha shivered, then pulled her hand away to rub at her shoulders as if it was the cold night air lingering in her cloak making her skin prickle, and not something or someone else.</p><p>“You’ll be pleased to know,”  Agatha said, “That I’ve received an invitation to Mrs. Harding’s home for Sunday dinner tomorrow.”</p><p>“The big home on the hill, overlooking the graveyard?” Rio asked, eyes alight with interest. “I did wonder if it was being kept underground- I’d never be able to hear it from there.”</p><p>“I still find that odd,” Agatha said, “That supposedly there’s a weapon that was carved from one of your ribs-”</p><p>“No supposedly about it, doll. I needed something as indestructible as I am, and that’s what I came up with.” Rio said. </p><p>“Right,” said Agatha, “And you can’t figure out where it is just by feel?”</p><p>“If it were in this land or the next, I could find it. But if it’s somewhere in-between? I’d never know.” Rio shook her head. “We have to find it. In the wrong hands-”</p><p>“Like in the hands of a crazed group of barely pubescent, underbaked witches with a God complex, nothing to lose, and a thirst for revenge,” Agatha cut in.</p><p>“Like the Salem Seven, yes,” Rio agreed. “In the wrong hands, it will do a great deal of damage.”</p><p>“Remind me again,” Agatha said, “How this knife-”</p><p>“Scimitar,” interjected Rio</p><p>“How is this scimitar different from your dagger?” Agatha settled into a seat beside the hearth, settling her boots on the stone in front of the flames. Rio began tracing lines and curves around Agatha’s ankles. She did her best to ignore it, staring steadfastly at the flames. </p><p>No matter how hard Agatha tried to keep space between them, Rio found ways to close the distance and touch her. She’d stroke Agatha’s hair and then, before Agatha could work out how to react, Rio would hold up a feather from a down pillow she’d pulled from the strands. Or, Rio would hand Agatha a book and caress her fingers on the hand-off, only to smile innocently. The worst moments were the ones like right now: when Rio apparently just touched her because she could- and because she wanted to. It was maddening and distracting, and Agatha couldn’t figure out how to stop wishing it would never stop.</p><p>“The first answer to that is, my dagger is stone, while the scimitar is bone. The dagger serves to slice paths through the veil between our realms; it is more of a key than a weapon.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, thinking of the many times she’d been threatened with that supposedly harmless “key.”</p><p>“Alright,” Rio agreed, “It is still a weapon- but more utilitarian than used for fighting. But the scimitar- is meant to be wielded on horseback. It deals death in large numbers. Without touching, it can snatch a soul from a body and send it to the Next place before the body hits the ground.”</p><p>Rio’s touch had become firmer, and Agatha stared at Rio’s face as the other woman unlaced her boots and began to rub Agatha’s feet. In spite of herself, Agatha sighed and leaned back into her chair. Between the cold and those damned cobblestone streets, her feet were killing her. Rio didn’t look up, pressing her thumbs deeply into the arch of Agatha’s foot. The slow, repetitive motions combined with the warmth of the fire were making Agatha feel drowsy, her eyes beginning to flutter closed even as she fought the urge to sleep. Rio’s hands moved up her calf, sliding just far enough up Agatha’s skirt that they disappeared from view.  </p><p>Agatha forced her eyes open to find Rio looking at her with unguarded tenderness. She did not shy away from meeting Agatha’s gaze, just shifting her attention to the other foot, then the other calf. Agatha couldn’t have said what emotion her own face betrayed, but she didn’t have it in her to snark or start a fight. She just watched Rio watching her, wishing those fingers would trace a burning path higher, higher- and hoping that they didn’t because she wouldn’t stop Rio, and it would complicate everything.</p><p>“I hear you have succubus powers now, Agatha,” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet chuckle. “Seduce one man of the cloth and you’re a she-devil from hell; trust me, there was no magic involved in that exchange.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Well, did you give the priest the night of his life?”</p><p>“More like the five minutes of his life. But then when he fell asleep I stole all the spell books he’d confiscated from witches. He had to explain where they went by claiming a devil had seduced him and cast him into a cursed slumber.”</p><p>The two women laughed, and Agatha ignored the fact that Rio was no longer massaging her feet, but was just holding them in her lap, unwilling to let them go.</p><p>Agatha had to be the one to pull away, as she always was. </p><p>“Well, this she-devil needs to get some sleep,” she said, pulling her feet out of Rio’s lap and standing. </p><p>Rio watched her go, one side of her mouth quirked up, and said, “Keep running away, Agatha.” She stood, stepped into Agatha’s space and watched Agatha react to her proximity- lips parting, breath quickening, eyes dropping to Rio’s lips- “Maybe one day I’ll believe you don’t want me to chase you.”</p><p>“You’re confused,” Agatha tried to sound strong and sure, but she ended up whispering.</p><p>“About?”</p><p>“I don’t want you to chase me.”</p><p>“Then why are you staring at my lips?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t have an answer, but she found herself swaying forward until her lips were inches from Rio’s. She felt Rio’s breath ghost across her lips. She moved forward.</p><p>Rio’s lips met hers as they always did, ready to take whatever Agatha had to give her. Agatha kept the kiss soft, her lips still closed as they pressed into Rio’s. Rio’s hands wound around her wrists, as if afraid Agatha would flee. Agatha lifted her hands to Rio’s face, pulling away long enough to look her in the eyes and say, “I’m not running now,” before pulling Rio closer and kissing her harder, demanding more than the teasing Rio had been subjecting her to with all those little touches and innuendos. And Rio delivered, grinning against Agatha’s lips before matching her pace and her pressure. </p><p>Rio stepped in, and Agatha was suddenly off balance, but Rio had her, arms around her waist, pulling her flush against Rio’s body. Rio breathed in deeply through her nose, not breaking the kiss to breathe, and Agatha bit down on Rio’s lower lip. The two women stumbled to the bed, still locked together. Rio laid Agatha onto the mattress, following her down.</p><p>Rio braced her arms on either side of Agatha, grinning down at the other woman. Agatha growled and grabbed Rio by the shoulders, pulling her to her. Rio’s knees landed between Agatha’s legs. Agatha’s breath stuttered. Rio pressed her hips down, and Agatha felt her self control slipping. </p><p>“I still- need- to take this slow-” Agatha gasped out against Rio’s lips. </p><p>Rio pulled back, brushing stray hair away from Agatha’s cheek. “Well, we’re both still dressed,” Rio pointed out, “And your petticoat is voluminous enough that I can’t even tell that you have legs.”</p><p>Agatha pushed herself up on one elbow. “Can we just- can we keep kissing?”</p><p>Rio nodded, pressing Agatha down into the pillows and kissing her languidly, as if she planned to spend hours mapping her mouth out. Legs tangled in skirts, hands searching for purchase, it wasn’t ideal, but neither woman stopped. Rio caught Agatha’s wrists and pinned them above her head.</p><p>Kiss drunk, lips swollen and cheeks pink, Agatha scowled up at her. “Why are we stopping?”</p><p>Rio chuckled and kissed Agatha’s lips chastely, pulling away before Agatha could pull her back in. “You need to sleep.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Boring, now where were we?” But Rio shook her head, pulling Agatha up and reaching to help her undo the buttons of her dress.</p><p>“We need to get you comfortable and get some sleep.”   </p><p>“Will you stay?”</p><p>“I will stay.”</p><p>Layers of fabric later, both women were down to their chemises. Agatha pulled back the quilt and they settled down together, Rio holding Agatha, who nestled into Rio’s body as closely as a little spoon to a big.</p><p>And that was how they slept until the sun and the sounds of the city coming to life woke them again.</p><p>—</p><p>Mrs. Harding was the wife of a rich merchant. Her home reflected her class, all neat gardens, painted clapboard, and topped off by four separate chimneys. As wealthy as her home appeared, she answered the door when Agatha knocked. </p><p>“I sent the staff home,” she told Agatha conspiratorially. “I thought they’d only get in the way.”</p><p>“A wise plan,” Agatha replied, following Mrs. Harding into a warm sitting room, where several other members of the sewing circle sat. They all murmured their greetings, before Mrs. Harding called the meeting to order.</p><p>“As you know, sisters,” Mrs. Harding began, “Many of us believe that the current state of affairs with the British will only worsen.” Dark looks passed over the faces of all assembled. “In the interest of preparing for the worst, I have sought out certain… alliances, with other organizations of like-minded women. And together,” she smiled grimly, “we have procured an object which I believe will give us an advantage should a war break out. Follow me, ladies.”</p><p>She stood, and the ladies in the room followed suit. Agatha felt the first prickle of concern: surely a weapon this vital to the rebel cause would not be a casual drawing room conversation topic?</p><p>Mrs. Harding led them down to a cellar, then through a well-concealed door and down a passageway. Agatha counted her paces, realizing the passageway did indeed lead under the road and below the cemetery beyond as she and Rio had discussed.</p><p>At the end of the tunnel, a sickly green light shone, growing in strength as the group drew nearer. </p><p>The sword sat upon a pedestal, displayed upon a stand. All eyes locked upon its wicked blade, and every woman felt the unnatural weight of the power that came from the sword. </p><p>It was not a long sword, but it looked deadly, double edged and gleaming in its own light.</p><p>And then, from within the shadows behind the sword, a black-cloaked figure materialized.</p><p>“Agatha Harknessss,” the figure hissed. Agatha immediately recognized one of the children of her former coven members: Freya, the fox witch. The sneaking witch, the one the coven sent ahead to keep watch.</p><p>Agatha braced for a magical attack, confident she could handle a lone Salem seven witch, or even one witch and the entire coven of sewing witches, but instead, two of the daughters of liberty took her arms and bound them behind her back. </p><p>The lone member of the Salem seven present glided forward, hissing with pleasure as Agatha was bound and forced to her knees.</p><p>“My sisters will join us soon,” Freya whispered sibilantly. “But that doesn’t mean we can’t begin the fun now. Hello, Auntie Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Freya. It’s been a long time.”</p><p>“Too long,” Freya growled, “Your time on this Earth should have ended long ago.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Enough banter, Freya. Let’s hear the plan.” Agatha smirked, ratcheting up the insolence in her voice. “After all, you know what happened to mommy when she tried to take me down?”</p><p>Freya snarled, and a fritz of power crackled along her knuckles. Agatha watched her, taunting her further.</p><p>“An entire coven of witches against a helpless teenage girl. Not even a trained witch. You know what they say about your mommy, Freya?”</p><p>Agatha laughed at Freya’s outraged expression. “They don’t say anything. She was so pathetic and so unremarkable that no one even remembers her name.”</p><p>Freya snapped, striding forward to grip Agatha’s throat. Choking, Agatha looked up into Freya’s cold eyes and forced a smile out.</p><p>“Enough,” came a commanding voice. Mrs. Harding stepped forward. “We need her. Let go, Freya.”</p><p>Freya squeezed once, then did as she was told, stepping back from Agatha to stand beside Mrs. Harding.</p><p>“Do you know what the weapon behind me is?” Mrs. Harding asked. Agatha stayed obstinately silent. A woman like Mrs. Harding would be used to having her every whim met and her every command followed. Agatha meant to burrow under Mrs. Harding’s skin and get on her last nerve. She’d be the one to slip if Freya wouldn’t.</p><p>“No matter,” Mrs. Harding said dismissively. “It can kill you whether you know its name or not.”</p><p>Agatha watched with some trepidation as Mrs. Harding picked the sword up and brought it closer to Agatha. The green glowing light seemed to pulse, as if it sensed her life force and longed to rip it from her.</p><p>“They say that this is Death’s own sword.” Mrs. Harding droned on. She obviously enjoyed a captive audience. “Imagine a field of battle. Muskets firing, cannons blasting, men dying in droves on both sides, others crawling away, forever maimed. But not with this sword. No- with this in our grasp, the war will be decided in one battle.”</p><p>“So noble of you,” Agatha drawled, “To worry about the loss of life and pain of soldiers. To say nothing of your husband’s trading business being able to operate unencumbered by pesky tariffs.”</p><p>Mrs. Harding pointed the sword at Agatha’s throat. “Witch killer, you speak of life when everyone in this room knows you have no respect for it. You kill and you commune with the dead.”</p><p>“Ah yes, that reminds me,” Agatha said. She narrowed her eyes at Mrs. Harding and the sword in her grasp suddenly flew across the room and struck one of the sewing circle’s members. The witch fell where she stood and chaos broke out in the room.</p><p>Even over the din, Agatha heard the sound of Rio arriving. She tore her way out of the rope holding her, and felt a searing pain in her elbow. One of the daughters of liberty had stabbed her with a knitting needle. Agatha stared at the needle still embedded in her arm, then shouted, “Really? A needle?!” Agatha swiped at her attacker, the purple magic in her fist sending the woman flying. Keeping her injured arm by her side, Agatha fought her way over to Rio, who was blasting witches left and right, trying to get to her sword. </p><p>Finally reaching Rio, Agatha stood behind her facing out so she could watch Rio’s back, blasting witches coming at them. “What took you so long?” Rio called out over the sound of witches screaming in agony and falling to the ground.</p><p>“I was a little tied up,” Agatha snarked. “I didn’t expect a blast from my past to be here- the Salem seven is involved in this somehow.”</p><p>“Brats,” Rio muttered, flicking her hand to restrain a witch with thorny vines. Finally, no witches remained to challenge them. Rio strode over to her sword, and sheathed it, the movement fluid and practiced.</p><p>“How did they manage to steal that from you anyway?” Agatha asked, yanking the needle out of her elbow with a wince.</p><p>“They had my brothers team up against me. Three on one, not a very fair fight,” Rio gritted out. “Time to get going, Agatha.” </p><p>–</p><p>Rio didn’t notice Agatha’s bleeding elbow until it finally slowed them down on the road out of Boston. Agatha staggered, almost falling. Rio grabbed hold of her upper arm and led her to a stump on the side of the track.</p><p>“I knew you had a thing for pain, Agatha,” Rio murmured, “But is this really the time for that?”</p><p>Agatha scowled, but the impact was lessened by her pale face. “We had to move,” she responded, voice hoarse. “What if the rest of the seven came?”</p><p>“Don’t trust that I’d protect you?” Rio asked, carefully running her fingers along the bend of Agatha’s arm, sending healing magic along the length and wiping the blood away to look for other wounds.</p><p>Agatha looked up at Rio from under lowered lashes. The pain and exhaustion made her angry. “I didn’t think trust was something we had between us, Rio.”</p><p>Rio frowned, stepping back. “I know you like to keep a distance between yourself and the rest of the world, Agatha, but we’ve been traveling together for months. You just entrusted me with your life in battle. You trust me to heal you,” she held her bloody hands up for Agatha to see, then wiped the blood on her hands off onto her pants. “You trust me enough,” Rio continued, voice lowering, “To allow me into your bed.”</p><p>Agatha shivered, partially from loss of blood, and partially from the memories of Rio kissing her the night before, of Rio’s body over hers, of past times Rio and she had moved together in the dark.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to regain control of her thoughts. “Lust, loneliness, and necessity.” She insisted. “I have something you want, you have something I want. We have an arrangement.” Agatha stood, swaying on her feet. Rio watched her, hands twitching at her sides as if she meant to reach out should Agatha fall again. “Trust doesn’t factor into it.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, turned on her heel, and ripped her way out of Agatha’s company with her dagger.</p><p>“Te veo,” she muttered, and disappeared, leaving Agatha alone on the edge of the road.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha muttered, collapsing back onto the stump. She took stock of her surroundings; there were no buildings, no farms, and no places to take shelter. The seven would be after her soon enough. She would have to keep moving. Struggling back to her feet, she continued on down the road, slowly and painfully, and alone. </p>

<p>
<span>Rio reappeared nearly a month later, startling Agatha enough that she yelped and dropped the book she was reading. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello to you too,” Rio chirped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Finished pouting?” Agatha asked, bending down to pick up her fallen book and dusting it off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I’ve just decided that I much prefer tormenting you from a-near rather than a-far,” Rio quipped, and stepped into Agatha’s personal space. “Did you miss me?” She tilted her head, and Agatha’s glance fell to her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha lied. “I enjoyed my peace and quiet. It is very meditative to walk by oneself with a book. One is able to notice the birds singing, and the sweetness of the spring air, and-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop talking,” Rio murmured, and kissed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmph,” Agatha said, dropping her book and grabbing at Rio, pulling her closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands were in Agatha’s hair, nails scraping along her scalp, and Agatha melted against Rio. Rio pulled back and ran her thumb along Agatha’s bottom lip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See, that’s how you say ‘hello’, none of this screeching business.” Rio said. “I figured I’d let you cool off and walk for a bit, then catch up to you later. How goes the travel?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh-” Agatha floundered for words briefly. “F-fine. I love walking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tapped Agatha on the nose and then jumped out of reach of the swipe Agatha directed her way. “Liar,” Rio cackled. “Admit it, you missed me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reddened but ignored the comment. “Anyway, nice of you to join me again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready to go to Europe?” Rio asked, completely nonchalantly, as if people just proposed months long sea voyages on a whim every day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Agatha demanded, nearly stomping her foot. “When I just spent all this time walking to- where am I anyway?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Virginia, I think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn you,” Agatha muttered. “Why are we going to Europe when I just walked all the way to Virginia?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you enjoyed the walk, killed a few witches along the way- learn any new info?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha responded sullenly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s because… the coven has returned to Europe with the Darkhold!” Rio gestured grandly, as if her news would be exciting to hear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And now we must also go to Europe?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There are a few other reasons we must go to Europe,” Rio admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought the sword was the only thing holding us back from taking on this mysterious coven, what is it now?” Agatha crossed her arms over her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio coughed, and if Agatha didn’t know better, she could have sworn that it was an embarrassed cough. “It would seem that the coven we’re chasing has figured out they’re being pursued and have decided to… split apart the pieces of the Darkhold, and scatter my brothers with them. So now, instead of finding one group of witches to kill, and one book, we have to find a minimum of three. Maybe more.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sea voyages were the worst, Agatha reflected as she tried to take a short walk around the ship’s deck. She fought the pitch and toss of the waves, and found the creaking and groaning of the masts overhead alarming. The second time she found herself tossed against the railing, she gave up and retreated to the tiny cabin she shared with Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat on top of the cabin’s single, suspiciously narrow bed, reading a book Agatha knew she’d stolen from her sea chest. Instead of commenting, Agatha curled up on the bed as far away from Rio as she could get.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio didn’t take the hint, and began rubbing Agatha’s back. “Are you seasick?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, just already feeling the cabin fever,” Agatha grumbled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never fear, we only have two months left,” Rio said cheerfully, returning her attention to her book. Agatha missed the hand on her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m already bored,” Agatha huffed. “I can’t just wander away to collect a soul when I get sick of these same four walls.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bulkheads,” Rio corrected her absently. But she put her book down and looked at Agatha thoughtfully. “Are you looking for a… distraction?” Rio asked lightly, one finger finding the sensitive skin on Agatha’s ankle, barely covered by a thin stocking. Her finger was warm, and Agatha’s entire attention focused on that small patch of skin as she tried to formulate an answer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t find the words, and found herself just watching Rio, who was watching her finger tracing Agatha’s ankle.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to talk this to death,” Agatha began, ignoring Rio’s snort, “But I worry that it wouldn’t mean the same thing to me that it would to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha’s face now, her dark eyes meeting Agatha’s as her hand stilled on Agatha’s ankle. “Maybe I don’t think it means anything,” Rio said quietly. “Maybe I just miss being close to you. Maybe you’re the only one who sees me, even if you don’t see me as the person you- have those feelings for. Maybe that’s enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up, taking Rio’s hand. “I have feelings,” Agatha admitted, “But they’re tangled and confused, and complicated. They feel like they’ve been poisoned, and I don’t want that to spill into things they don’t belong in.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or, maybe they would make things more interesting?” Rio smiled suggestively. “Like when we used to fight before we-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s a terrible idea,” Agatha immediately said, a knee jerk reaction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow. “How about a little test run?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lunged at Agatha, who suddenly found herself flat on her back looking at the wood ceiling as Rio bit into her shoulder. She hissed in pain, and shoved Rio back, knocking her head into the wall before Agatha was there, kissing the dazed expression off her face. Rio caught up, kissing back harder as she gripped Agatha by the hair at the back of her head, yanking at it. Agatha’s head jerked back with the force and Rio sucked bruising kisses into the soft skin of her arched neck. Agatha moaned, and clawed blindly at Rio’s chest, trying to find the laces holding her dress closed. Tearing at the bow at the top of the lacing, she managed to loosen everything enough to begin to push the bodice off Rio’s shoulders, pinning her arms in place. Rio groaned at being trapped and let go of Agatha’s hair long enough to free her arms, leaving her upper half clad in only a shift. Agatha promptly ripped at the light cotton neckline and tore the undergarment. Mesmerized by the line of Rio’s collarbone, she traced it with her thumb. Rio watched her, breath hitching at the sudden shift to tenderness. Agatha remembered that she was meant to be adversarial, that she was trying to untangle these soft feelings from the violent ones. She shifted her grip, pressing her fingernails into Rio’s back and dragging the sharp points down, down, watching red welts spring up. Rio growled, arching into the pain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“See?” Rio said, head tilted to the side. “No one’s bored now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached out for Agatha’s neckline, slowly undoing the first button of Agatha’s dress. Agatha watched her work from under hooded eyelids, smirking. She put her hands over Rio’s, held them at the wrists, and kissed her mouth. This time, there was a firm pressure but no pain, no teeth. Rio moaned into her mouth, leaning forward and wrapping her arms around Agatha. The arousal that had been building in Agatha’s belly turned molten and spilled over and she needed Rio’s hands on her </span>
<em>
<span>now</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she whispered between kisses, “Touch me, please.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a frenzy of clothing being pulled off, pushed down, thrown away, and Agatha felt Rio fully bare against her. She felt like the breath had been knocked out of her, all that warm, tan skin pressed against her. Rio had always been leaner, silky but muscular, while Agatha had curves and a softness. Rio was watching Agatha looking at her, eyes warm. She licked her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re so beautiful, Agatha,” she murmured,  and buried her face in the crook of Agatha’s neck, dragging her teeth along the tender spot that always used to make Agatha moan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Apparently, it still did. Rio grinned, enjoying re-learning her lover’s body. She dropped her hands to Agatha’s lower back, then stroked lower, cupping and squeezing her ass, pressing Agatha’s hips more firmly into Rio’s own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her hips into Rio’s, and Rio encouraged her to keep going, kissing her jawline as she made breathy sounds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goddess, Rio- that feels so-” Agatha’s eyes were squeezed shut, and she was biting hard at her lower lip. Rio let go of her ass and pressed Agatha’s shoulders back, lowering her to the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused, taking in the sight of Agatha stretched out beneath her, chest heaving. Rio lowered her head to Agatha’s breast, taking a hardened nipple between her lips. Agatha’s fingers twined into Rio’s hair, scraping at her scalp encouragingly. Rio stroked the soft skin of Agatha’s belly, using her teeth judiciously on the breast she was lavishing attention on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hissed, then pressed on Rio’s head, nudging her down. Rio grinned up at her. “Getting a little impatient, are we?” But she didn’t keep Agatha waiting, moving down her body and kissing the smooth skin she passed on the way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head fell back against the pillow as Rio reached her destination. Her fingers gripped at the coverlet. It wasn’t long until her orgasm crashed through her, and she cried out, “Rio!” then covered her face with her forearm, hiding her vulnerability and trying to collect herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio laid beside her, Agatha pulled her into her arms, taking on that old comfortable role of acting like she was totally in control. “My turn,” she growled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She kissed Rio, tasting herself on her lips, and falling deeper into Rio’s mouth, and into her embrace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She slipped a hand between them, touching Rio between her legs and opening her eyes to watch Rio’s face. Eyes closed, mouth open, Rio caught up in pleasure was a beautiful sight to see. Her dark hair was in disarray and her lips were red and there was color in her cheeks. And then Rio opened her eyes, and caught Agatha watching her. The two women watched each other, one hazy with pleasure, the other softened in the afterglow and concentrating on getting Rio there with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breathing was coming faster now, and Agatha murmured, “Beautiful,” and kissed her. Rio’s hips jerked and she moaned into Agatha’s mouth, coming hard on her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She buried her face in Agatha’s shoulder, and threw one leg across her hips, catching her breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dragged a blanket over them, pulling Rio closer. Both women surrendered to the need for sleep that dragged them down into the dark.</span>
</p><p>
<span>– </span>
</p><p>
<span>London was a cold, dreary city. The streets were crowded and dirty, and moving through the strictly divided class structure to get the information Agatha and Rio needed to move forward in their hunt had proved difficult until they found a foothold into the gossip grapevine through frequenting working class pubs and lodgings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, dressed in clothes Agatha considered rags, they made their way to a hole in the wall theatre to take in a casual production of The Scottish Play, Macbeth. Rio bought them pints of ale and they joined the throng in the cheap seats, standing in the gallery with the rest of the rabble.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The bard’s works just aren’t the same when men aren’t performing all the roles,” Rio murmured, sipping her warm brew.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head. “I wouldn’t know. Puritans frowned on the theatre as being vain and a waste of time that would be better spent praying to God for mercy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head. “You missed a lot of caked-on white makeup and ridiculous wigs, but modern theatre has a lot to offer. Like authenticity.” She pointed at the trio of witches cackling over a large black cauldron on stage. “Think these folks in the crowd know those are real witches?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not a chance, or this place would be in flames,” Agatha murmured back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd had not reacted favorably to the witches; their characters tended to take the blame for Macbeth’s actions, as if the man’s free will had been taken from him by the three crones. In reality, he’d been blinded by greed for power and goaded on by his even greedier wife. Agatha studied the three women on stage more closely. Clad in long black robes, each one wore plain masks studded with warts, but below the props and costumes Agatha sensed real power. These were not mere actresses with a prop cauldron; something magical was happening on stage in this crowded theatre. An ill wind ruffled the hairs on the heads of the oblivious attendees, and Agatha automatically shielded herself and Rio, who chuckled at her. Agatha flushed- she’d forgotten for a moment that Rio was impervious to most magic and immortal anyway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A man to Agatha’s left suddenly turned and punched another man in the face. As if reacting to a sign, the entire theatre broke out in scuffles and rows. Forcing their way through the crowd towards the stage, Agatha and Rio glimpsed a cloaked figure backstage avidly taking in the fights and arguments taking place in the audience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Martius,” Rio said, a grin on her face. “We’re in the right place for sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Split up,” Agatha commanded, and Rio made for her brother as Agatha made a beeline for the witches still on stage with their cauldron. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Big mistake,” Agatha muttered, dodging a fist from one rage-filled audience member and then a kick, “Sticking around to gloat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She reached the stage and with a quick twist of her hand, brought the curtain down, hiding herself and the witches on stage from the view of the audience.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had expected some kind of resistance, maybe some villainous monologuing, but the three witches on stage didn’t bother with some much as a ‘hello’ before blasting Agatha all at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed aloud as she pulled their power into her own magical core before they fully realized what was happening. The three robed figures were on their knees when suddenly, Agatha was hit from behind by a chair wielding madman. She fell to the ground, her siphoning interrupted, and rolled to face her attacker. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Clearly, Rio hadn’t been able to contain Martius, for he now stood before Agatha, flanked by several vacant looking men holding makeshift weapons- bottles and chair legs they hefted like clubs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of the witches behind Agatha struggled to her feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kill the witch,” she commanded, and Martius unleashed his goons on Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had taken beatings before, but she wasn’t a fan of physical violence she herself wasn’t inflicting on others. She held her hands up by her sides, levitating far enough in the air that the mind-controlled men couldn’t reach her with their weapons, then turned to address the witches below her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hand over the Darkhold and I may spare your lives,” she demanded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The lead witch cackled. “You are an arrogant young witch. You don’t know what forces you are tampering with.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stretched the aches from her neck in an exaggerated manner before blasting the cauldron into the witch who challenged her. She flew through the air, landing in a sprawled heap with the cauldron on top of her. Rio appeared then, walking slowly to her brother.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Late as always,” Agatha griped. Rio flipped her a rude hand gesture and then ignored her. She reached her brother and took his face in her hands, looking deeply into his eyes. Agatha watched, ready to intervene if any of the men or witches tried to get between the two. Martius’ shoulders slumped, but he did not react otherwise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fight it, Martius,” Agatha heard Rio hiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One of the witches stirred. Agatha drifted above her, drawing her attention. Her gambit worked, and she blasted Agatha, who took the opportunity to drain the witch fully. The last witch woke and found her sister witch desiccated beside her, and shrieked and attacked Agatha. Agatha drained her of her magic, and kept a wary eye on the final witch, who seemed to be the leader and was still alive beneath the cauldron pinning her to the ground. Levitating the cauldron away, Agatha glided over to the last witch standing (laying) and used her magic to bind the woman in extra ropes from the back of the stage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Meanwhile, Rio and Martius’ standoff had apparently reached a fever pitch, with Martius’ pale face covered in beads of sweat. The places Rio’s fingers dug into his chin showed slow trickles of blood. Rio hadn’t blinked since locking eyes with her brother, and Agatha imagined that Rio was attempting to lift the mind control that enslaved him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>One of the men beside Rio dropped the chair leg he held as a club. He looked around, bewildered, before running out of the room. Another of the mob did the same, then another, and finally, the last man regained control of his body and swore, then fled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Martius fell to his knees, and Rio dropped to the ground with him, holding him to her as he slumped. She looked back at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have to get him somewhere that he can recover,” she said. Agatha barely had time to nod before Rio was gone, taking Martius with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nooo!” screamed the final witch from the place Agatha had left her bound.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She tore her way out of her bindings and staggered to her feet. Bellowing something in Latin, she advanced on Agatha, power congregating in sickly green bolts in her hands. Agatha watched her come closer, the smallest smirk playing across her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You- you have no idea who you’re dealing with!” The witch reached one hand into her robes and brought out a sheaf of badly wrinkled papers that nonetheless dripped with an ugly aura of dark magic. Agatha’s eyes focused on those pages, even as the witch began reading from them. Agatha conjured a crackling shield, mind racing as she tried to figure out her next move. She couldn’t rely on Rio returning, and she wasn’t sure this would end with the witch attacking her so she could siphon her magic. Indeed, the green lightning slicing through the air around the witch seemed to be forming some sort of portal; as Agatha watched, a bony arm clad in a robe similar to Martius’s robe appeared, and Agatha realized this witch intended to sic another of Rio’s brothers on her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hit the witch with a powerful blast, knocking her back. The portal began to close, and the witch screamed in frustration and struck out at Agatha. This time, Agatha didn’t let anything interrupt the siphon until she stood over the corpse of the woman responsible for Agatha having to freeze her ass off on a shitty boat for months. She took in the withered form and spat to the side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good riddance,” she said, stooping to pick up the pages of the copy of the Darkhold. “Hopefully your sisters will be less annoying to kill.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha returned to the lodgings they were staying in, but Rio didn’t come back. Days passed, then weeks. Agatha knew Rio’s sense of time was different than her own, that months could feel like seconds to an immortal, but at the same time, she felt stung by being abandoned. They had not made plans for a next step,  and without Rio’s web of contacts, Agatha didn’t know where to start. Finally, as the bells rang out for Christmas morning and a choir of young boy carolers strolled by singing Greensleeves, Agatha made up her mind to leave London. Rio could find her when she wanted to.</span>
