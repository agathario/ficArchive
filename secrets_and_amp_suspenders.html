<b>Secrets &amp; Suspenders</b>
</p><p align="center">Chapter 1</p><p> </p><p>She is so royally fucked. So very, very fucked and it’s not even ten in the morning. On her first day of work to be precise.</p><p>Because since when do women wear suspenders? Aren’t they traditionally more male? Don’t men normally wear them underneath their suits, hiding them away? And if that is so, why is one of her very female teachers in a white shirt, with black, taut galluses strapped over her chest? And why the ever loving fuck does it do something to her, or rather to the parts of her that haven’t been taken care of recently?</p><p>Agatha leans over to the woman sitting next to her in the packed school auditorium, an elderly lady with a bit of crazy curly hair that had been kind enough to welcome her when she’d walked into the building an hour ago.</p><p>“Who is that again?”</p><p>“Miss Vidal, coaches the boy’s football team and teaches Biology,” she whispers, and Agatha finally remembers that her name is Lilia – she’d been on the hiring committee too when Agatha had landed the job just before summer.</p><p>“Thank you,” she nods, her eyes never straying far from the way <em> Miss Vidal’s </em>shirt is rolled up to her elbows and clinging to the muscles on her upper arm as she speaks about fire safety and recycling.</p><p>She later introduces herself properly to Agatha, voice deep, shoulders broad, hands playing with the suspenders, absentmindedly letting them snap. It makes Agatha swallow hard. The way she exudes easy confidence with her black hair all up in that bun and three buttons open on her shirt, a tiny silver cross around her neck, pointing downwards to things Agatha has never anticipated being interested in.</p><p>“I’m so sorry the first thing they make you do here is listening to the building safety code. The fire drill would at least have been a bit of physical exercise.”</p><p>Yes, because very suddenly any kind physical exercise that might include Miss Vidal – or <em> Rio </em>, as she’s come to learn, sounds fabulous. Exciting even.</p><p>“Oh – no that was very informative!”, she nods a little too eagerly judging by the way her opposite laughs. It sounds heavenly.</p><p>
<em> Jesus fucking Christ. </em>
</p><p>Back at her office, she lets her head thud onto the surface of her desk. </p><p>
<em> What on earth has gotten into her?  </em>
</p><p>This is not what she’d planned, where is this coming from all of a sudden? She lets out a long and gruntled moan before she raises her head again and looks at the still empty desk.</p><p>Is this some sort of late midlife crisis? Suddenly developing a very sexual interest in women? Even better – one that specifically manifests around a specific person, an employee to cap it all off?</p><p>She reaches for her phone and disregards Nicky’s questions about the Chinese leftovers in her fridge, but goes straight to Chat GPT.</p><p>“Hi – uhm good morning – is it possible to have a crush on a woman even though you have exclusively dated men all your life? For forty-seven years?”</p><p>She watches as the chat bot begins the work.</p><p>
<em> “Good morning, Agatha, yes, that is absolutely possible. In fact, many people don’t discover their interest in the same gender until later in their life. Have you gotten to know someone you are interested in?” </em>
</p><p>She growls and closes the app, finally telling Nicky not to eat her egg-fried-rice.</p><p>Maybe it will just go away? Maybe it’s just the stress – this is a new school, with new teachers, maybe this is just an overexcited part of her brain looking to make friends.</p><p>
<em> Spoiler alert – it’s not. </em>
</p><p>At lunch, and by no fault of her own, she ends up opposite her again with no chance to switch places. And while the other teachers are chit-chatting away, Agatha turns the salad leaves in her bowl over and over again until they are so soggy, she’s lost all interest in them. Instead, she tries to avoid any kind of eye contact with her – and even succeeds… though that only means she has more time looking at that tiny cross again, gently moving over the small hairs on her olive skin. She doesn’t know where the need to reach for it comes from, only that it is there and that it gets stronger with every time she lets her eyes dart between it and Rio’s lips.  </p><p>“Is something wrong with your food?”</p><p>It takes her a full, long second to register that she’s being addressed, and two more until she manages to look her opposite in the eyes.</p><p>Rio has her head tilted, smile warm, fork pointed at Agatha’s salad. It makes goosebumps erupt on her shoulders.</p><p>“Oh! I’m just not that hungry,” she lies and lets out a fake laugh.</p><p>
<em> Dang she needs to get her shit together, this is becoming a problem. </em>
</p><p>She’s relieved when administrative tasks and a schoolyard squabble keep her occupied for the rest of the day - anything to distract her from the mortifying fact that she’s already nursing a serious crush on one of her employees, despite not even having unpacked her office boxes yet. She sighs as she puts pictures of Nicky on her sideboard and mourns the fact that he will already be off to college again when she comes home that evening.</p><p>At least he has left a note in the kitchen.</p><p>
<em> Love you mom - sorry I ate your food! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The next days pass like pages fluttering in a breeze - quick, quiet, and barely noticed. All she catches of Rio are fleeting glimpses - across the football field as she barks out drills to the boys, or in the cafeteria, seated at the far end of the table: close enough for Agatha to hear her laughter, but just far enough to avoid conversation.</p><p>Once she passes her in the hallway. She lifts her right hand and smiles, talking to one of her students, and Agatha returns the gesture, thinking (no, <em> hoping </em>) that her crush will surely have passed by Halloween.</p><p> </p><p>And really, keeping the interactions to minimum seems to do the trick for a while. </p><p>At least until one fateful morning, when the sky is already grey and heavy as she leaves her house. It doesn’t begin pouring until she turns into the school’s parking lot and she moans at the realization that her umbrella is in her trunk. </p><p>When she parks, it is raining so hard she can barely see anything through her front window. Turning off the engine, she debates dashing out to get the umbrella, but it would mean getting completely soaked before she’d even have a chance to reach it. So she decides to wait (she still has another half hour before her first meeting) and leans back in her seat.</p><p>Through her wet windscreen she sees several people moving by the building. Judging from the washed out shapes, they were all smarter than her, walking around with umbrellas. At first she barely notices it, but gradually, one of the figures peels away from the group and approaches her car, stopping just beside it, knocking on her window.</p><p>And of course, how else could it be, it’s no other than Rio - dressed in a long black trench coat, a sly smile curling on her lips, holding one of those ginormous porter umbrellas over this side of the car, gesturing for her to roll down the window.</p><p>“Good morning Mrs Harkness, would you like me to walk you inside?”, she offers when Agatha opens it.</p><p>
<em> No she doesn’t - she absolutely doesn’t this is a bad idea. She doesn’t need to be pressed to the side of the woman she has a serious crush on before nine in the morning. </em>
</p><p>“Oh that would be amazing, my umbrella is in the trunk!”, she sighs in relief.</p><p>“No worries at all, mam,” she steps back and waits for Agatha to get her bags from the passenger seat before she makes sure she stays dry while exiting her car.</p><p>“Best hold onto my arm,” she offers then and Agatha swallows hard before she takes it, wrapping both her hands around Rio’s biceps, her bag over her shoulder. </p><p>The first thing that hits her is her smell - fresh perfume that still lingers on her cleavage. She isn’t particularly good at telling scents apart, but whatever it is, it is so good she wants to rub her nose over the exposed skin to collect every last bit of it.</p><p>“Did you have a nice evening?” Rio asks her as they slowly begin to walk towards the building, ripping Agatha away from her intrusive thoughts.</p><p>“Yes, uhm, very quiet,” is all she manages to say, because her glance is fixed on the small, silver cross again, sitting right between the open buttons of Rio’s black shirt.</p><p>She suddenly feels the urge to take it in her mouth, suck it between her lips, let it glide over her tongue. She wants it so much she questions if she has ever truly wanted anything in her life. </p><p>And it’s not just that. Even through the layers of clothes she can feel Rio’s muscles contract, can feel that they are big and tough. Agatha spends most of the way wondering whether she works out at a gym, and if so, whether that means she struts around in shorts and a wife-beater while lifting weights. And <em> dear God </em>, Agatha really hopes she does.</p><p>“I really like working out!”, she blurts out and Rio looks at her with a frown. </p><p>It’s a blatant lie. ‘Working out more’ is on her New Year’s resolution every January, but truth be told, she hasn’t seen the inside of a fitness studio since Nicky started daycare.</p><p>“Yeah me too actually! Who would have thought?” Rio answers with a smile, looking back down at her.</p><p>“Oh…”, Agatha nods, scaling back a little, “that’s great…”</p><p>“Which gym do you go to?”, she keeps pressing.</p><p>“Oh I just… run?” and technically that is true. Only last month did she run a lap around her house before she had given up after not even ten full minutes. She is too old for working out, it’s not going to get rid of her cellulite, and it sure won’t erase the stretch marks on her belly anyway.</p><p>“Yeah I enjoy that too! Let me know if you ever need a running buddy!” Rio offers, just before they step under the extended roof near the main school entrance.</p><p>“Yeah”, Agatha nods and finally lets go of her arm, glad that there is now an inch of space between them. Not that she would ever dare ask. She doesn’t need someone at least fifteen years younger than her (let alone <em> someone </em> this fit and gorgeous) watching her wheeze at the slightest incline.</p><p>“That is a very nice dress by the way,” Rio mentions when she closes her umbrella and stuffs it into the umbrella stand next to the door, holding it open for Agatha as the rain keeps pelting on the concrete.</p><p>And really that is what finally short-circuits her brain. It has been years since she’s gotten a genuine compliment, let alone one regarding her looks. It has been years since someone has opened a door for her waiting for her to step through. And yes, she is ready to commit to wearing nothing but tight dresses from now on if Rio likes them on her. She suddenly wants to be seen, wants to be wanted, with a hunger she’s not even sure she remembers feeling - <em> ever. </em> And now, with Rio’s eyes on her, it seems dangerously easy to forget her circumstances. She is still her boss.</p><p>“T-thank you,” she stutters and bites her lip, wondering if there is a blush forming on Rio’s cheeks, or whether it is just the warm light of the school hallway.</p><p>When she gets home in the later afternoon, her tummy is rumbling and she feels a twitching between her thighs, she isn’t used too anymore. She has to charge her vibrator first and clean the drawer-dust off of it, but when it’s done, it buzzes perfectly over her clit as she keeps setting a higher speed, the side of her other hand in her mouth as she moans.She <em> needs </em> to find a way to run her fingers over that skin, <em> needs </em> to find an excuse to lick over the pulse point on her throat. She imagines what Rio would look like with no shirt on, the suspenders taunt over her breasts. She wonders what it would feel like to make them snap, whether there would be a stifled moan, whether it would make her nipples hard and erect.</p><p>Agatha almost blacks out when she comes, bending her back upwards as she feels her walls pulse around nothing. </p><p>Afterwards she wonders whether she has ever come this hard thinking of a man. And if this is how good it is when she takes care of it herself… doing it with company might actually knock her out.</p><p>But then it’s all just a silly little dream, right? She’s forty-seven, with wrinkles, a soft belly, a failed marriage, and zero experience with women. Well if you don’t count that time she’s made out with Danielle Feldman at the Bangles concert. Come to think of it, that had actually been pretty good compared to all the times Ralph had stuck his tongue down her throat. She sighs at her own reflection in the bathroom mirror and rinses the vibrator with soap.</p><p>Later, when she’s on her couch, she opens Chat GPT once more.</p><p>“Hey Chat GPT, how do lesbians have sex?”</p><p>The software seems to flicker for a short moment until the familiar voice says: “<em>While there are a multitude of ways lesbians can engage in sexual intercourse, I’m supposed to keep my answers PG13 - I’m sorry I can’t help you with that.”</em></p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes and sips on her Merlot.</p><p>“Okay well how do I hit on a woman then? Like if I am myself a woman?”</p><p>
<em>“I’m supposed to keep my answers PG13 - I’m sorry I can’t help you with that.”</em>
</p><p>
<em> Fucking asshole. Back to good old Google then. </em>
</p><p>Only Google isn’t where she finds answers. At least not a lot of answers. Instead, she comes a second time with her hands between her legs after a thorough study of educational video material regarding sexual intercourse between women.</p><p>Great - so the late-in-life lesbianism seems to be confirmed, but that still leaves Rio as one of the teachers under her oversight. Plus, just because she dresses like a dandy, that doesn’t mean she’s into women. </p><p>So Agatha needs to find out… right? Just so she knows. </p><p>Not that this is something she can ever act on. But she can entertain the thought, right? She can keep putting on dresses if it gets her a few compliments (it’d be good for her self-esteem anyway) and she can at least try to flirt. It’s not like Rio would ever be truly interested in her anyway, age-gap and everything.</p><p>So before she heads to school the next morning she puts on a burgundy dress that has long sleeves but still hugs her curves just right over her shapewear. She drives by Target too and buys a clear lip gloss that sparkles in the right light. Just in case that is something other women are into at all.</p><p>And maybe one woman in particular does, because when she walks out of her meeting with the school board just after ten, she sees Rio standing right by the water fountain, talking to the janitor. Straightening her back, Agatha walks past her and gives her a smile, brushing a few curls behind her ear. She can see her glance linger and her lips parting gently as their eyes meet.</p><p>“Good morning,” she greets her, and Rio raises a hand in response.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gets bolder after this.</p><p>She sits down kitty-corner from her at lunch the next day, wearing another tight dress, forest green and with short sleeves that are adorned with little bows. Rio stares at her when she places her tray on the table and leans slightly forward - and if Agatha hears it right, she loses her train of thought for just a second until Agatha is settled and finally begins to eat.</p><p>“What are you drinking there?” she asks when almost everyone around them is chit-chatting, and Rio takes a big gulp from her baby-pink can of soda. </p><p>She looks up a little sheepishly, drops of the fluid still on her upper lip. Agatha wants to lick it off.</p><p>“It’s watermelon and raspberry… I get it from a soda shop in my neighborhood,” she explains almost proudly.</p><p>
<em> What a nerd. </em>
</p><p>“Can I try?”Agatha asks, squeezing her arms together under the table so it accentuates her breasts. She catches Rio staring before she hands her the soda can and their fingers brush.</p><p>She takes a big sip, lets the prickly drink run over her tongue. It’s sweet and somewhat sour. Licking her lips, she returns the can to Rio.</p><p>“I like it!” she smiles.</p><p>The next day, a pink can of  watermelon and raspberry soda waits for her in her new usual spot.</p><p> </p><p>It feels<em> so </em> good getting all of that attention, feeling Rio’s glances linger on her just a second too long, seeing that spark of pink on her cheeks whenever she brushes past her in the hallway, mayhaps closer than actually needed. It ignites something inside her she doesn’t even remember feeling way back when she had first met Ralph. Something fizzy and electric, like the pop of a soda can on a hot day. Unexpected, a little (quite a bit actually) messy, but quickly impossible to ignore. She finds herself leaning into it, wearing jewelry she hasn’t touched in months, laughing a little louder when Rio is in earshot. It’s reckless, maybe. But it’s also the most alive she’s felt in years and she won’t deny herself this little adventure. Not when it feels this good.</p><p>Not when it is so easy to sneak into Rio’s classroom before she heads home to look at the student-made posters on photosynthesis and evolution on the walls while Rio grades papers at her desk, pretending she isn’t interested in giving her any attention.</p><p>“What’s your favorite subject to teach?”, she asks, running her fingers over a bit of tree bark someone has glued to a thick sheet of green carton. The afternoon sun is illuminating the tiny specs of dust dancing through the air.</p><p>“Botany,” Rio answers and from the corner of her eye, Agatha can see that she isn’t looking up.</p><p>“So are you a 'plant mom' then?”, she walks over to where Rio is sitting and slips onto the desk, the outline of her ass now only inches from where Rio is holding her pen. It finally makes her look up.</p><p>“Uhm… I try to be,” she nods, nervously fumbling with the pen in her hand.</p><p>“What’s your favorite plant you have at home?” Agatha keeps pressing, snatching the pen from her hands and observing the silver label on it - the logo of a local biology teacher conference. Rio blushes and looks towards the windows as Agatha rolls the warm pen between her fingers.</p><p>“C’mon what’s it?”, she grins when Rio doesn’t immediately answer.</p><p>“If I say it you’ll laugh at me…”</p><p>“I swear I won’t!” Agatha promises, putting the pen to her lips in an attempt at being cheeky.</p><p>“I have a really nice Philodendron Pink Princess,” Rio mumbles, a rosy sheen on her cheeks, crossing her arms.</p><p>
<em> Definitely a nerd. But a really cute one. </em>
</p><p>“A Pink Princess?” Agatha raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“I said you would find it ridiculous,” she grabs the pen back out of Agatha’s hand, but not without lightly scraping her skin.</p><p>“I just didn’t know there were Pink Princess plants,” she retaliates, slipping off the desk and feeling a soft warmth spread in her stomach. It’s familiar by now, excitement mingling with hesitant tenderness. It’s her personal reminder that it’s time to leave before she says something she can’t take back - something like <em> ‘maybe you wanna show me sometime?’ </em></p><p>“H-hey, will I see you at the game on Thursday?” Rio’s voice resounds through the room as she’s turning to leave.</p><p>Right - it’s the football team’s second game of the season on Thursday night. She is supposed to be there anyway, but Rio doesn’t need to know that. It’s a small win.</p><p>“Well if you’re asking <em> this </em> nicely,” she bites her lower lip looking back, before she walks out the door, making sure her ass sways just a little.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<b>Chapter 2</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><p>Thursday turns out to be the nicest day of the entire week. </p><p>The late summer humidity is still manageable with temperatures in the high eighties and most people in summer dresses, relaxed hoodies, or tank tops. A gentle breeze carries the scent of cut grass and sun-warmed asphalt across the field and up to the bleachers where a small group of faculty staff has gathered to watch the game. </p><p>From where they are seated, Agatha generally has a great view over the playing field, but an even greater view at the coach. </p><p>Or rather the coaches’ legs. </p><p>Because Rio is in shorter-than-short 70s training shorts and a loose football jersey that’s stuffed into her waistband on the right side. But what catches Agatha’s eye most - nearly hypnotizes her - is the long ponytail that’s threaded through her black cap. It swings back and forth and sometimes sideways every time Rio moves, points to something on the field, shouting at her team.</p><p>The idea of wrapping her hand around it to pull it, embeds itself in her mind the first time she notices it. But it’s not just that. It’s the tantalizing allure of being on the receiving end of Rio’s commands, telling her exactly what to do and how to do it. It makes Agatha chew on her lips until the skin there is raw and tender. It escapes her, the fact that she’s never looked at a man the way she’s hungrily gaping at Rio like this: Praying her shorts might slip a little too high so she can see the round of her ass cheeks a little better, hoping the jersey might come untucked so she can check if the skin on her waist is just as caramel as that on her arms - or possibly lighter, milky and soft.</p><p>Because what else is she supposed to hope for? That this silly secret crush of hers might end up going anywhere? That as kind and friendly Rio is, she might actually have any real interest in her? Agatha sighs and chews on a bit of salty popcorn and resigns herself to the role of the peeping, pitiful cougar, ogling the beautiful, young woman way outside her league.</p><p> </p><p>She is relieved when the game is finally done, the team winning by a point, and the crowd finally clearing out. There is a little crowd that forms around Rio and her team, students, parents and teachers congratulating them to the tune of <em> Born in the U.S.A. </em> She raises her hand in hopes that Rio might see it, simultaneously saying ‘hi’ and ‘goodbye’ - but she doesn’t wait for her to notice. It’s too crowded anyway. She has better things to do.</p><p>Instead, Agatha walks up to the little food stall on her way to the parking lot, the one that sells soft serve and decides she deserves something sweet if she can’t have what she really wants anyway.</p><p>“Can you dip it in the chocolate please?”, she asks and hands the annoyed girl behind the counter a Lincoln.</p><p>Just when she gets her ice cream cone back, she feels a tapping on her shoulder and turns around.</p><p>“Hey, you’re leaving without even congratulating me?”, Rio grins and raises her palms.</p><p><em> Oh, she looks so so good </em> - strands of hair coming undone under the black cap that has a small Snoopy embroidered on its front, a bit of sweat on her nose, well-formed breasts underneath the jersey.</p><p>“You were so busy I didn’t want to interrupt,” Agatha shrugs and Rio lets her shoulders fall.</p><p>“Did you enjoy the game?”, she asks.</p><p>Agatha isn’t even sure she understands the rules properly, so there isn’t really a good answer to that question.</p><p>“It was great! Well played!” she tries to offer at least, but Rio clocks it immediately.</p><p>“You’re not really into football, are you?”, she laughs.</p><p>“No,” Agatha rolls her eyes and lets out a sigh of relief, “my ex-husband made me watch it a lot, but I never really developed an interest, I’m sorry?”</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>For a moment Agatha isn’t quite sure what the “oh” is really for… sympathy or jealousy?</p><p>“I mean that was more than a decade ago,” she quickly adds, for what reason, she isn’t sure.</p><p>“I see,” Rio nods and suddenly seems to notice something that makes her point to the ice cream in Agatha’s hand, “I think you’ve got something there.”</p><p>“What where?” Agatha twists the hand she’s holding her soft serve in, expecting a bug to have landed on the chocolate.</p><p>“Oh no right here,” Rio reaches for her arm and turns it around.</p><p>And yes, she’s right. Bits of white ice cream are running down her arm in a straight line, a thick drop at its very end. Agatha turns her head back to the stall to ask for a napkin, but the girl is nowhere to be seen, probably locking up. She is just about to ask Rio for a tissue instead, when she feels something warm and wet against the sensitive skin of her forearm. </p><p>There’s no doubt about what’s happening, yet she still stares in tingling disbelief as Rio’s tongue glides along her arm, chasing the melting line of vanilla soft serve. It is the single hottest thing that’s ever happened to her in her entire life: Rio’s hand holding her wrist tightly, nails digging into her skin, while she laps it all up, leaving a trail of glistening saliva on Agatha’s skin. The feeling of it makes every hair on her body stand in attention - and her nipples along with them. Boiling blood pulses in the very tips of her fingers. If there is air in her lungs, it doesn’t even attempt to escape. It’s stuck, just like Agatha.</p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p>Only when Rio’s tongue reaches the pulse point on her wrist does it stop, but not without one final lick that almost makes Agatha jump, the tip of the tongue grazing over her arteries. When Rio lets go of her wrist, a faint blush tints her cheeks pink. She takes a quick step back, hands behind her back, then fumbling with the Snoopy cap, taking it off and combing through her hair.</p><p>“Uhm… I think it’s gonna melt again if you don’t start eating it…” she points to the ice cream.</p><p>But Agatha hasn’t gotten that far. She’s still stuck on the feeling of Rio’s hot tongue over her skin, her spit gluing the tiny hairs together. Her mind is unable to comprehend it. Her skin tingles where the contact lingered, heat blooming under the surface with every replay in her head. It’s not just the shock - it’s the ache. The delicious, unbearable ache of wanting it to happen again.</p><p>“Right,” is all she manages to press out, her eyes finally darting to the soft serve that has started to run over her hand again in the evening warmth.</p><p> “I-I think I gotta run back to the team now,” Rio uses her thumb to point over her shoulder, putting her cap back on, “glad to have caught you before you left!”</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha nods.</p><p>She doesn’t start eating her ice cream until she is back at her car, the chocolate cover almost falling off in one piece as she attempts to take a bite. The trail of Rio’s saliva is still visible on her arm, slightly glistening in the sunlight. She has to go back inside the school to wash her hands when she is finished with her treat, but she carefully makes sure not to rinse her arm. </p><p>Instead, she lets her fingers glide over it as if it is an invisible tattoo, burned into her skin.</p><p>She thinks of it again when she is back home, her face pressed into her pillow, her vibrator softly buzzing between her legs. She wants that tongue everywhere on her body, behind her ears, over her belly button, between her folds. She wants Rio’s nails digging into her thighs as she holds her in place she wants and wants and wants so much it almost hurts. She sobs into her cushion as she comes in soft waves pulsing through her muscles. </p><p>How is she supposed to go on like this? Wanting something so much it feels nearly impossible to ignore. How is she supposed to ever walk past Rio again without thinking of what it had felt like having her lap ice cream off her body?</p><p>
<em> Oh she is in such deep shit.  </em>
</p><p>It feels like forty-seven years of longing crash down on her, a longing she hadn’t even known she was feeling. She should have said something, anything - instead of letting poor Rio walk off after that. But then Rio could have been the one to say something. Why hadn’t she? Why seductively lick soft serve off someone’s arm and then just let them go? Had she not… liked it? Had she thought it would feel better than it had? </p><p>
<em> Oh why did this have to be such a roller coaster ride?  </em>
</p><p>She should have just left it, not let her crush fester, looked for someone her age, heck possibly Ralph, to fuck it out with to set her straight again. </p><p>She grunts into her cushion before she raises her face out of it for air. First thing tomorrow she needs to speak to her - apologize for all of the flirting and improper behavior. The last thing she needs is Rio reporting her for any of it, not a single school in New Jersey would ever hire her again.</p><p> </p><p>She drags herself to Rio’s homeroom the next morning, her mind filled with images of Rio’s disgusted face. What if she doesn’t even want to look her in the eye? What if HR is already waiting there with her, ready to let her know that her contract has been terminated? With all that worry pulsing through her veins she is both relieved and surprised she doesn’t actually find Rio in her classroom.</p><p>“Coach Vidal’s in her gym office,” a boy she knows is on the football team mentions as he catches her sticking her head through the door, apparently taking pity on her. And it speaks volumes that she doesn’t even know Rio had an office by the gym, but then it makes sense.</p><p>She finds it relatively quickly too, it’s an inconspicuous door next to the boys’ changing room. She swallows hard before she knocks.</p><p>“Come in!”, she hears Rio’s voice coming from inside before she actually enters.</p><p>“Oh Mrs Harkness I wasn’t expecting you,” she clears her throat and at once rises from her chair. It doesn’t escape Agatha’s treacherous mind that she is wearing her suspenders over another white shirt again. It throws her off for a moment, the sight is just too good.</p><p>She has to physically cover both her eyes with her hands to remember what she’s actually here for.</p><p>“I wanted to apologize for my improper behavior these last weeks, I am so sorry, I really don’t know what has gotten into me to harass you like this,” she groans in agony. Somewhere behind her forehead she can feel a migraine announcing itself.</p><p>“H-harass me?” Rio points to herself in what looks like disbelief.</p><p>“The flirting - good lord, I really shouldn’t have, I’m not even … you know into women, I was married to a man and I have a nineteen year old son, I just-,” she raises her hand, pointing to Rio, all of her really, but mainly the suspenders, “I just saw you and it flipped a switch in me, and I shouldn’t have given you any wrong ideas!” she blurts it all out before she can think about any of it twice, eyes fixed on the small desk that separates them.</p><p>“So you didn’t mean anything by it?”</p><p>“Well… of course I did, because it’s not like I’d stand a chance anyway!” she sobs.</p><p>“<em> You </em> think <em> you </em> don’t stand a chance with <em> me </em>?”, Rio frowns, pointing in between them again.</p><p>“I mean look at me, I am a forty-seven year old divorcee with wrinkles, grey hair, and stretch marks,” she watches Rio slowly coming around the desk, only to lean on the side facing Agatha, “my thighs have gotten so big I just had to buy a size fourteen jeans for the first time last month and I have zero experience with women, ZERO!”</p><p>The room goes quiet for a second, following her rant. It smells stuffy, the scent of used trainers and rubber basketballs lingering in the air.</p><p>“Yeah… and all of that is so hot it genuinely keeps me up at night, Agatha,” she mumbles, scratching the back of her head.</p><p>The sound of her own name coming from Rio’s lips gives her pause, “w-what do you mean?”</p><p>“You know I-I just like older women… I like thick thighs and full hips… it’s nice to, well, to hold on to,” she shrugs sheepishly, “and I mean you are <em> so </em> pretty, <em> so </em> far outside my league, I was just thankful you were flirting with me - and when I saw you yesterday at the game… it just felt really nice pretending you were there for me.”</p><p>“So you weren’t disgusted by the ice cream running down my arm?”</p><p>Rio chuckles, “no, no I really wasn’t. I wish I hadn’t licked it off though, I haven’t thought of anything else all morning.”</p><p>“Oh…” Agatha nods, only slowly processing the words, inching just a little bit closer “so you liked it?”</p><p>“I was sad there wasn’t more to lick off.”</p><p>“Yeah me too,” Agatha moves another step closer, so close that the tiny silver cross comes into view again, shiny on Rio’s cleavage. Absentmindedly, she reaches for it, letting her fingers ghost over the metal until she holds it between her thumb and index finger.</p><p>Below her touch, Rio gulps, the muscles in her throat contracting.</p><p>And then, because she can’t help herself anymore, she simply pulls until Rio is forced to lean forward, her lips landing on Agatha’s. </p><p>She feels big hands coming up to the small of her waist, immediately squeezing her hip-dips, groping at them. In surprise, a small sigh escapes her lips, but Rio doesn’t let up. She forces her lips open with her tongue, pulls her in closer until Agatha has to let go of the cross and instead finds her hands slipping down, wrapping around Rio’s suspenders. When she pulls on them, it is Rio’s turn to moan and turn them around, pressing Agatha against the table until she sits back on it, letting her between her legs.</p><p>The first thing that comes to her mind is that she doesn’t remember any man ever tasting this sweet. Or any man’s breath ever hitching this enticingly. </p><p>“I really don’t know where you get the idea that any of this,” she squeezes the plump flesh on Agatha’s hips one more time, sucking on her neck “could be unappealing to me.”</p><p>All Agatha manages to respond with is a low moan as she pulls her in closer, biting her lip and closing her eyes at the feeling of Rio’s hands on her body and her lips on her throat.</p><p>“Please just give me just one chance,” she squeals, fingers gathering the fabric of Agatha’s dress with her fingers, exposing more skin, “I swear I can make it worth your while.”</p><p>“Mhh,” Agatha nods, loving the way Rio’s hands move under the cloth of her skirt, grazing over her skin until they find the hem of her slip.</p><p>Rio is on her knees in front of her in an instant, pulling her closer to the edge of the table. Her fingers hook under the slim lace before they yank it off, the gusset already wet and dark. She takes it to her nose and sniffs on it, her eyes dark, looking up at Agatha. Lips parted, she feels more arousal gathering between her legs. Again, she realizes that throughout her entire adult life, no one has made sniffing her panties this erotic.</p><p>“Please can I…”, she whispers as Rio lowers her glance to the pubic hair she would have shaved off had she known she’d have someone between her legs today. Rio’s arms come up behind her legs, her nails digging into the soft flesh as she lowers her face, dragging her nose along the skin and hair in tantalizing circles. Her tongue darts out here and there, teasing until she puts her mouth over the apex of Agatha’s folds, right where she’s been tingling for the past ten minutes.</p><p>As she begins to suck, Agatha lets her head fall back. A low grunt escapes her, and once again she tries to recall the last time someone has eaten her out - though never like this, not with her legs dangling off the edge of a table and strong arms wrapped tightly around the places she’s always felt most uncertain about. It’s been at least ten years, if not longer. At the thought, she feels Rio lap and bite, moaning against her clit, sending vibrations through it that make her twitch. </p><p>It feels so good, the way she builds her up, at times sucking her entire, pulsing clit into her mouth, Rio’s head bobbing between her thighs. She knows she probably sounds pathetic with all the whimpers that force themselves past her lips. She feels how Rio’s let’s her tongue wander all the way down to her entrance, gripping her tighter, until she sticks it in, her rose still rubbing against Agatha’s clit.</p><p>“Oh my god,” she moans. One of her hands finds the top of Rio’s head and she begins to stroke it, soft hair between her fingers, single strands scraping under her nails.</p><p>It’s hideous how fast she makes her wet like this, wiping every coherent thought from her mind.</p><p>“You’re being so good for me,” Agatha hears her and mewls at the praise, “do you want to come?”</p><p>“Mhm, y-yes please!”, she sobs, feeling a small tear in the corner of her eye.</p><p>Somehow, Rio manages to make her ministrations even more intense, letting the tiny knob of nerves flick between her teeth until Agatha’s entire bottom half begins to shake and she comes with the most ungodly noise, Rio never letting up and sucking her off through every wave and pulse. </p><p>When she finally stops and looks up, Agatha’s arousal is shiny on her lips. She lets her tongue glide right over it, causing Agatha’s breath to tremble again.</p><p>“I-I might need you to do this to me again some time,” she mutters, glare hazy, her hand falling down underneath Rio’s chin.</p><p>“I was hoping you might be free tonight?”, she smiles, her nails softly circling over the stretchmarks on Agatha’s thighs.</p><p> </p>
