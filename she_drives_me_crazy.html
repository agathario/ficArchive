    she drives me crazy
   </h2>
<div>
<p>
     Crisp air flows through the open windows of Agatha’s bedroom. Curtains she always fails to close float from the wind, brushing against the half melted candles arranged on the windowsill. Agatha takes a deep breath and slides her feet out beneath the comforter and they touch down on the cold hardwood. Slipping on her robe she makes her way to the bathroom, wood creaking under her steps.
    </p>
<p>
     The first day of school always fills Agatha with enormous excitement and she walks through the empty halls of the middle school. The wide grin shown on her face slowly fades away as she rounds the corner to her classroom and her eyes fixate on a dark haired woman unlocking the classroom across from hers. She’s not sure if the feeling of her stomach turning is hatred or desire but she knows it's strong enough to power this whole school for a month.
    </p>
<p>
     Hearing footsteps, the other woman turned to her, “Agatha Harkness, well isn’t it a pleasure to see you again.” The slight sarcasm and teasing in the woman's voice brings an unpleasant smile to Agatha’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where is Mrs. Hart.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh well hello to you too Agatha. Mrs. Hart had to take a leave of absence this year for personal reasons. And since everyone loved me so much last year when I subbed for her, they offered me the position full time, for the year of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha feels the rush of rage coursing through her veins, she’s sure the vein on her forehead is popping out as the other woman's head tilts with a smirk growing on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t get in my way, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh I wouldn’t dream of it.” She grins as she walks into the formerly Mrs. Hart’s classroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio fucking Vidal. Agatha closes the door to her classroom behind her and lets out the breath she's been holding. She’s dropping her belongings on the desk carelessly muttering unintelligible comments of disgust and irritation. Pacing up and down the space between the school desks with her pointer finger between her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha is dumbfounded at how this woman could waltz right into her school like she owned the place. This aggravating, distracting, captivating, bewildering, beautiful…
    </p>
<p>
     This insane woman thinks she can just walk right in and ruin Agatha’s peaceful work life.
    </p>
<p>
     She just has to get through this school year.
    </p>
<p>
     Then she never has to see Rio Vidal’s face ever again.
    </p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha likes to think of herself as a patient person who rarely loses her temper. Would her colleagues describe her as such? Well that’s none of her business. However she feels like she's going to do just fine ignoring Rio Vidal.
    </p>
<p>
     That is until Rio starts poking and prodding at every corner of Agatha’s life.
    </p>
<p>
     Every morning it's the same taunting voice saying, “Good Morning Ms. Harkness.” She’s not sure if Rio Vidal calling her Ms. Harkness is worse than just Agatha but all she knows is that she hates it. Every lunch period it’s the same “Mind if I join you?” in the teachers lounge at her table with Alice and Lilia. Until she doesn’t even bother asking.
    </p>
<p>
     And it’s the same pesky knock on the door in between classes when Rio Vidal comes to ask another useless question such as, “Where is the storage closet.” or, “What time do they lock up at night.” Things she’s not sure why she of all people has to be the one to answer.
    </p>
<p>
     Weeks of relentless teasing before she can’t help but begin to engage in the banter.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio interrupts one of her classes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ms. Harkness, can I borrow your stapler? Mine seems to have gone missing.” Her stupid face has that stupid smirk on it and she does that stupid head tilt. And she looks at Agatha with puppy dog eyes as she eagerly waits on a reply.
     <br/>
     The older woman walks over with the stapler in her hand and extends it. “Better bring it back when you’re done Vidal,” she says before continuing in a more hushed tone, “but don’t you ever interrupt one of my classes again or you’ll find yourself on the signup sheet for the most dreadful PTA event you could ever imagine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scans her face and her eyes drift down to the stapler and back up to meet the other woman’s eyes again, all while her tongue is poking the inside of her cheek. When their eyes meet again there's a hint of lust coating the deep brown eyes she’s staring into. She laughs, breathy and silent, “Noted.” As she reaches for the stapler she allows her hand to loosely wrap around Agatha’s to grip on to the stapler caressing her hand as she pulls away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Te veo.” She says as she turns around to return to her classroom.
    </p>
<p>
     What is wrong with that girl.
    </p>
<p>
     The next week she noticed every afternoon someone’s gone into her classroom to draw little cartoon animals and flowers, “Oh that’s cute who drew that.” She addresses the classroom.
    </p>
<p>
     They all look around and shrug, “It wasn’t any of you?” She sees a flash of dark hair peeking through the crack in the door and as soon as she spots it, she grabs her erasure and removes it from the bored and the figure hiding takes off.
    </p>
<p>
     —-
    </p>
<p>
     Scanning the shelves in the cramped supply closet Agatha searches desperately for dry erase markers when the door opens. The hairs on the back of her neck stood abruptly as the figure approached her. The flickering lightbulb hardly illuminates the small space, giving her no help in finding what she needs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah here we are.” Rio exclaims, a bit loud for Agatha when she’s standing so close. Grabbing the last box of expo markers on the shelf right in front of Agatha’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     She turns to face the science teacher with quite the peeved expression. “I needed that actually.” she starts, reaching to grab it right from Rio’s hands.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh uh uh I found it first.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you 12? You don’t need all of those markers. Give some to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe if you asked nicely.” Rio moves the box around to avoid Agatha’s reach, taunting her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Vidal if you don’t shut up.“ She grabs on to the wrist holding the box of markers.
    </p>
<p>
     “Make me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha suddenly becomes aware how close they are to each other with Rio sandwiched between herself and the wall, “Excuse me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You heard me.” Her head tilts deviously.
    </p>
<p>
     The lightbulb flickers out.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh god. And that’s all Agatha can take right now before-
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha places her hand on Rio’s Chest and pushes her so her back hits the surprisingly stable shelves and dives right in before she can talk herself out of it. Lips crash in a sloppy, rushed, yet intoxicating kiss. Agatha takes a deep breath in and the scent of Rio infiltrates every inch of her brain until all she hears is Rio Rio Rio echoing through her mind, body, and soul.
    </p>
<p>
     The distant sound of a box dropping could be heard to someone who isn’t entrapped in a thick haze of lust pouring out of every dark corner of her brain she previously kept under strict lock and key.
    </p>
<p>
     The hand that’s fisted around a previously pressed white linen shirt loosens its grip and slides up to find the nape of Rio’s neck. Fingers tangling in the thick dark hair as she tightens them together pulling the woman’s head back.
    </p>
<p>
     A sigh is caught in the sliver of sticky sweet air between Rio and Agatha’s lips as they both open to let Agatha slip her tongue past Rio’s. She licks at the back of the woman’s teeth, a chain reaction set off bringing Rio’s hands to grab at Agatha’s hips. One hand sliding around to her tailbone pressing Agatha’s hips closer to her own. The other hand trailing up past the older woman’s loose untucked button up shirt to graze at silky smooth skin before it’s tainted by nails dragging back down.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallows a breathy moan that leaves Agatha’s lips as their kiss goes deeper and deeper and deeper until
    </p>
<p>
     The bell rings
    </p>
<p>
     The two women jump apart, a rosy blush creeps up Agatha’s neck and finds residence on her cheeks, just barely visible in the dimly lit closet. She opens her mouth to speak but nothing comes out. Rio crouches down to grab the abandoned box of markers on the floor all while holding eye contact.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for the markers.” She gives a smile that’s a bit softer than her usual teasing grin and the clacking of her boots goes in one of Agatha’s ears and out the other.
    </p>
<p>
     The door closes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god.” Agatha pushes her hair off her face holding on to her head for a brief moment. She puts herself back together and returns to her classroom for last period. She’s not sure she even remembers the rest of class, her mind and body on autopilot while her heart is across the hall in the science lab.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha unlocks her front door and steps through the door slipping off her shoes, she lets out a sigh of relief. She lights the candles on her windowsill and pours herself a glass of wine the color of the red lipstick Rio was wearing today. The red lipstick that still stains her lips this very moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hopes that the hotter the shower water is the more it’ll burn away the memory of Rio Vidal’s nails scraping down her spine. The challenge she quickly fails when instead it just floods her senses and replays in her head like a sad romance movie. She doesn’t even register her hands slipping lower down her abdomen until she lets out a soft moan.
    </p>
<p>
     Even with the water being at the highest temperature, burning her skin and leaving it bright red, it still doesn’t feel nearly as hot as her skin felt under Rio’s touch.
    </p>
<p>
     With precise movements, slow and fast, the moments play on the back of her closed eyelids one last time. Hand holding on to the wall of the shower she comes with a stifled groan, closing the box and turning the key on Rio Vidal once again.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The weekend passes in a daze before Agatha is slipping out of her sheets once again Monday morning. Her mind still asleep as her body moves through her typical school morning routine before she knows it she’s walking through the front doors of the large building.
    </p>
<p>
     She drops her bag on her desk and her keys clink together as they join her bag on the hardwood. Making her way to the teachers lounge for a cup of coffee she absentmindedly runs her hands through her hair. The dire need for coffee is no longer required because the sight of Rio leaned up against the counter, mug in hand, is enough to fuel Agatha for the next two weeks.
    </p>
<p>
     Enough to make her heart beat faster than any amount of caffeine could ever attempt to. She freezes in place as Rio turns her head to lock eyes with her and does that stupid thing with her tongue in her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     Her stomach does a flip before she takes a deep breath and walks over to the coffee pot Rio is blocking with her entire body.
    </p>
<p>
     “Morning Agatha.” Rio abandons her conversation with Alice to greet her, eyes scanning from her loose hair cascading over her shoulders down to the flowy lilac dress she’s wrapped in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio.” She grabs a mug and reaches around the woman to grab the coffee pot, completely invading her personal space. Not caring to ask her to move she pours herself a cup, returns the carafe and exits the room.
    </p>
<p>
     A feeling of smoke pouring out the cracks of that locked box of hers floods the back of her mind. Agatha tries to swat it away as if she doesn’t want someone to see the puff of discolored air from the cigarette she shouldn’t have hit.
    </p>
<p>
     Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday passed with brief awkward interactions in the hallways and bickering in the teachers lounge during lunch period.
    </p>
<p>
     Friday rolls around and Agatha can’t even seem to look Rio in the eyes when they step out into the hallway as class lets out, classrooms situated across from each other. The only time she can bear to look her way is when Rio is focused on another student asking her a question. The second the other woman looks her way Agatha’s eyes dart back to the children passing through the hallways.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     The sun had set before Agatha even had the chance to look up from the papers scattered across her desk. Buried in a haze of double spaced lines and red ink in the silence of an empty school after hours.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you keep making that look your face will freeze like that forever.” A familiar voice jolts her from her concentration, she jumps just slightly. “Jesus, Vidal.” A glance up to find the brunette teacher leaning on her doorway fiddling with something between her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     “How long have you been standing there?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not long enough.” Agatha’s not sure if that’s an insult or a pass on her but she rolls her eyes and returns them to her scattered essays.
    </p>
<p>
     Without looking up from her desk she hears footsteps approaching and feels an ever intense presence grow closer. She glances up for a second and watches as Rio sits down on the desk, her feet just barely dangling over the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sees it now in her hands, a flower she probably plucked from one of the plants in her classroom, not that she would know what plants Rio has in her classroom.
    </p>
<p>
     She returns once again to her work but clearly the universe does not want her to continue as a voice speaks up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m working, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I mean after this.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighs, “Nothing.” She continues her scribbles tracing in red on the stark white paper.
    </p>
<p>
     “Let me buy you a drink.”
    </p>
<p>
     Is Rio Vidal asking her out?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leans back in her chair and looks up at Rio who is sat perfectly poised and polite waiting for her response with a grin spread across her cheeks. A look in her eyes with a pang of hunger. A purple flower twirling between her slender fingers, nails decorated with a deep sage green. Her hand ceases spinning the flower and extends it toward the other woman.
    </p>
<p>
     She looks down at the flower before reaching up to accept it. Fingers brush each other and the sound of a small inhaled breath is almost missed, but the building is so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Just the slight brush of fingers gave Agatha a jolt of energy and a flashing vision of them hot and heavy in the supply closet. The feeling of longing for the same touch she felt a week ago.
    </p>
<p>
     Pulling the flower closer to her face she smirks and looks back into the entrapping eyes of Rio Vidal, “Well if you’re buying.” She tilts her head and Rio responds with content hum and hops off the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     “Meet me at Loudspeaker. It’s just up the road.” she says stepping backwards holding eye contact with Agatha before spinning towards the door towards the exit.
    </p>
<p>
     A breath Agatha didn’t realize she was holding escapes as she tips her head back and stares at the ceiling for approximately five seconds.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She turns into a parking spot and shuts the car engine off. Another deep breath before she steps out of the car and into the building covered in bold lights and pride flags. Rio sits across the room at the bar with an empty seat next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Is this seat taken?” Rio turns to hear the other woman question. “I always knew you were cliché.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckles. A genuine one.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you drinking?” The younger woman asks. “A beer is fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Never took you for a beer girl.” She looks at the bartender and puts up two fingers, “Two please.” She gives them a soft smile. She drops her hand bringing her fingers to tuck strands of her dark hair behind her ear. Agatha can’t help the way her eyes travel with Rio’s fingertips.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m a mysterious woman.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So I’ve noticed.”
    </p>
<p>
     The bartender slides two chilled glasses across to them and hands reach for them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Cheers.” Rio tips her glass towards Agatha and she returns the favor.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha can feel the ice melting away with every joke Rio cracks and every toothy smile she flashes her. A small pleasure in her chest when she makes a touch of pink bloom on Rio’s cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     Plans for the holidays turns into student anecdotes which turns to childhood memories and suddenly Agatha finds herself more enthralled with the woman who sits in front of her. She’s not quite sure when the last branch gave way for her to slip down this slope. Addicted to the way Rio’s tongue moves in her mouth while she’s listening. The way her eyes move soft and slow like honey, their darkness and warmth drawing you in further by the second. And the way her fingers trace that goddamn glass sitting there empty on the counter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want to grab a smoke?” Agatha incline.
    </p>
<p>
     “That stuff will kill you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re telling me you’re a successful high school teacher who doesn’t have a cigarette at least every once in a while?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Successful, didn’t know you thought highly of me Agatha,” She smirks, “I’m only teasing yes I’d love to share a cigarette with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolls her eyes and moves from her seat, “Who said I’m sharing?” and struts towards the patio door.
    </p>
<p>
     Feeling Rio’s warmth close behind as she follows like a lovesick puppy.
    </p>
<p>
     Outside in the dim light and November chill in the air Agatha extracts a pack of cigarettes and lighter from her bag. Placing a cigarette in her mouth she moves her hand to light it but the lighter slips from her cold fingers. Rio drops down to grab it faster than she can and brings her hands up. One sparking up the lighter as the other shields the flame from the wind.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looks from the flame catching the cigarette to Agatha’s crystal blue eyes that move to meet hers. Their faces no more than six inches from each other.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here you go.” She says softly as she brings the lighter back down and hands it back to Agatha. fingertips grazing her open palm as Rio pulls her hand away and plucks the cigarette gently from between Agatha’s lips. Rio looks in her eyes as she brings it to her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Inhaling and blowing out a puff of smoke towards the sky she returns the cigarette to Agatha’s lips personally as a smile smooth as butter spreads. Agatha’s not sure how Rio has mastered this innocent playful grin she wears on her face as she makes Agatha think dirty dirty thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     “Goddamn it.” Agatha groans as she pulls the cigarette from her mouth, carelessly placing it in the ashtray as she grabs Rio by her coat collar and pulls her in.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t realize a magnet has been pulling her towards Rio since the first moment she laid eyes on her but now it's like she's sinking in a pit of quicksand and she’s not sure she wants to be saved. Agatha drinks in every last drop of Rio like it’s her last chance. She’s sure she doesn’t even need her coat with how warm her body is latched onto Rio’s. Her hand finds itself on the younger woman's cheek as she tilts her head to open the kiss wider, finding her tongue and tangling it with her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wraps both her hands around Agatha's neck, moving them up to hold either side of her face. And when they pull away Rio looks at Agatha like she hung the stars as warm fingers brush her bangs out of her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why do you hate me?” She asks sincerely, with a meekness in her voice Agatha didn’t know she had.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighs, “Oh my beautiful girl. I could never hate you.” Rio looks confused and Agatha takes her face in her hands gently.
    </p>
<p>
     “You just,” she pauses, “you terrify me. And at the same time you drive me crazy. You’re so loud with your affection, it’s admirable. And I’m afraid to get close to anyone after… I lost someone. Someone I loved more than myself.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” She rubs circles on the woman's back, “you’re not gonna scare me away. I’m not going anywhere.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kisses the tip of her nose, then on her temple.
    </p>
<p>
     “I lost my son. He was seven.” Rio’s expression dropped, a look of concern and empathy grew. “He got sick, and um, he didn’t make it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Agatha,” She pulled the older woman into a hug, “I’m so sorry.” She pulls away enough to look her in the eyes. “I mean it, I'm not going anywhere.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gives her a small smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “I made it very clear to you it’s gonna be hard to get rid of me.” Agatha kisses her softly and swears she’s floating.
    </p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha never thought the day would come that she’d allow herself the pleasure of getting lost in Rio Vidal’s big brown doe eyes. But here she is swimming in the endless sea of smooth freckled skin and eyes reflecting the sunlight creeping through the blinds in the teachers lounge over a cup of shitty coffee. She never thought she’d see the day that Rio Vidal blushes and shy’s away from a small compliment.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of Rio’s voice starting to fade away as she swims deeper and deeper and deeper and-
    </p>
<p>
     “So what do you say?” Agatha is awakened from her daze, “Huh?” She shakes her head a little.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said when are you going to let me cook you dinner?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Um..”
    </p>
<p>
     “You free tonight?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I suppose I can,” Agatha looks down at her watch dramatically then flips her hair back to raise her eyes back to Rio’s, “make that work.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grins, “Cool.” She replies like a schoolgirl with a crush. She turns to scan the counter they’re leaned up against. Grabbing a pen from the jar by the coffee maker, and a napkin decorated with a coffee stain the shape of the bottom of her mug, Rio scribbles something down and hands it to her. “My address. 8pm?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll be there.”
    </p>
<p>
     Why Agatha has nerves she couldn’t tell you. But suddenly she finds herself in her robe surrounded by half her clothes spread array across her bedroom. It’s just a simple dinner at Rio Vidal’s house. Why can’t she just pick something to wear like it’s any other day. Settling on a sweater with a wide neck that drifts to hang off one of her shoulders and wide legged slacks that would almost look silly how baggy they are if Agatha wasn’t just addicted to them.
    </p>
<p>
     A quick knock at the door and moments later it’s opened sending a waft of warm air smelling of home cooked food her way.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi.” Agatha greets her and suddenly she feels over dressed because Rio stands there in jeans and an old graphic tee with the sleeves half cut off. “You look good.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You look hot.” Rio grabs her hand and pulls her inside, leading her into the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     Dinner is nothing but pleasant with their typical banter (“So it was you who pressed in all the tips of my  dry erase markers” “Well maybe don’t steal them next time.” “Oh so you’re saying you want a next time?”) over what might be the best meal Agatha has ever eaten. They’re down to the last couple sips of the bottle of white wine they shared, their plates empty, laughter in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     “God this was delicious, I’m gonna make you start bringing me lunches.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wouldn’t mind,” Rio smiles softly “but next time I’ll make sure I don’t forget my ‘kiss the cook’ apron”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh you’re funny.” Agatha teases as she rises from her seat to grab the dishes and they both make their way to the kitchen. She places the empty plates in the sink.
    </p>
<p>
     She tries to turn around to grab more off the dining table but is immediately stopped by a reckless force. Rio begins to back Agatha against the sink sliding her slender fingers over the woman's waist over her sweater. She reaches up and smooths her thumb over Agatha’s bottom lip, pulling it down slightly to part her lips before leaning in.
    </p>
<p>
     Her tongue smoothing over where her thumb still rests as their lips meet, she kisses her soft but sensually. Inhaling in every last drop of Agatha, Rio brings her other hand to slide under the older woman’s sweater and scratch at her stomach. All in one swift move, Rio finds herself suddenly being the one pressed against the counter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wined and dined me and now this? You really know how to treat a woman, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hands are on her hips holding her rather firmly against the cool marble. One hand still on Agatha’s abdomen, the other finds itself on the collar of her sweater, pulling her somehow closer as Rio tilts her head allowing it to deepen the kiss further.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s tongue finds hers again and it's all heat until it’s cold again when Agatha pulls away. “I don’t fuck on the first date baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     Not even giving her a second to let her try to turn away, Rio latches on to her belt loops pulling her back in recklessly but stopping before their mouths meet, “Who said this was the first date.” She kisses her again. Agatha leans in to meet her lips once more before pulling away again, but not for nothing she moves her lips to leave sloppy kisses against Rio’s jawline, nipping at her ear, trailing more wet kisses down her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you forget about our heart to heart at the bar? Did that mean nothing to you?” she states sarcastically. “I did say it was my treat.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh just shut up.” Agatha doesn’t bother allowing Rio a chance to obey before shutting her up herself bringing their lips together again.
    </p>
<p>
     “If that’s what it takes to get you to kiss me like that again, I’m never shutting up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Vidal you’re going to kill me.”
    </p>
<p>
     She practically rips Rio’s t-shirt off right up over her head, tossing it aside, and spins Rio around to bend her over the counter and leave hot wet kisses up her spine to find her shoulder and the back of her neck. The younger woman is not wearing a bra underneath and her tan skin beneath the shirt turns out to be covered in tattoos, some floral and dainty that contrast the bold and gothic ones decorating her back wrapping around to her ribs.
    </p>
<p>
     Just the sight of dark ink and smooth skin sending warmth down to settle between her legs. She licks from the crook of her neck to behind her ear causing Rio to shudder in her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s your bedroom?” Agatha so easily folds to Rio’s desires, wondering how she ever lasted this long without her scent and her taste filling every last of her senses.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turns around and leads her down the hall, losing Agatha’s sweater somewhere along the way leaving her in a sheer black lace bra that has the other woman practically drooling.
    </p>
<p>
     “Take these off.” Agatha demands with her hands finding the button of Rio’s jeans to help her, “Get on the bed, now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmm you’re bossy. I like that.” Something new shines in Rio’s eyes, she looks like she could swallow Agatha whole if she tried.
    </p>
<p>
     “I said get on the bed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes ma’am.” Rio responds flirtatiously as her tongue pokes the inside of her cheek and she turns to crawl on to the bed putting on a show for the other woman. She sits down staring up at Agatha before she grabs her by the waistband of her pants pulling her to crash her weight on top of Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Lips meet and hands are reaching everywhere but Rio’s reach down to unbutton Agatha’s pants as the older woman kicks them off behind her. Slotting her thigh between Rio’s, putting just a slight amount of pressure, Agatha brings her hands down to Rio’s waist.
    </p>
<p>
     The younger woman arches her back as a moan escapes her throat. She reaches around to find the clasp of Agatha’s bra but she pauses to look at her with a desperate desire in her eyes. “Can I? Please?” fingers ghosting over the warm skin of her back waiting for permission.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes.” Agatha nods. Rio unclasps her bra, discarding it somewhere nearby. Holding the same pouting but pleading look on her face her hands drift down to Agatha’s waist and with her permission, Rio pulls her down to take one of the woman’s nipples in her mouth and sucks.
    </p>
<p>
     A soft broken moan escapes Agatha’s lips before she moves to trail wet kisses down Rio’s stomach settling down between her thighs. She licks and bites at the inner part of the other woman’s thigh, leaving marks all across her legs. Dragging her nose as she moves from one leg to another she ghosts it over Rio’s clit beneath her underwear.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio arches her back once more, her hips chasing friction when Agatha curls her arms around Rio’s thighs to hold her hips down in place.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, Agatha brushes over her clit with her nose with enough pressure to cause Rio to let a loud sound escape her throat. She grazes over it once more with her teeth, just lightly scraping over the soaked fabric.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck. Oh my god.” Rio moans desperately, “Please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looks up at her, “Are you gonna be good for me?” She caresses Rio’s thighs while she waits for her answer. “Yes I promise.”
    </p>
<p>
     Hastily, she pulls down Rio’s underwear and throws them carelessly behind her. She comes in hot and heavy immediately lapping at Rio’s folds and sucking on her clit. Agatha thinks she could spend an eternity like this, with the most breathtakingly beautiful woman under her, the taste of Rio on her tongue. She knows Rio would do anything she asked her to do.
    </p>
<p>
     She continues speeding up and slowing down and pulling away just as she feels Rio start to tense up beneath her. “I didn’t say you could come just yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio groans trying to fight the urge to squirm under Agatha’s hot breath. She peppers a few light kisses on Rio’s hips and thighs and she hears Rio take a few deep breaths and settle back down.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha returns her mouth to Rio’s overstimulated clit and slides two fingers inside her curling them to hit the right spot.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gasps and her hands reach to grip the sheets with knuckles almost as white as the fabric. She looks down at Agatha pleading with her eyes and her twisted up expression. Agatha nods, “Okay baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     With permission Rio lets go, she thinks she can see the stars through her own ceiling and maybe she could touch them too. Agatha works her through the last waves as she catches her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fuck. Oh my god.” She says in between breaths. Agatha kisses up her stomach to meet her lips in a soft kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     She brings her lips to kiss along Rio’s jawline to her ear and leans in to whisper, “I’m not done with you just yet.” A chill runs down Rio’s spine.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please. Let me ride you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well since you asked so nicely.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moves to sit back against the pillows and removes her soaked underwear. Rio straddles her and kisses her deeply, lapping at her tongue with her own. She runs a hand through Agatha’s hair which brings a moan from deep within her stomach. “You like your hair being played with?” she teases, brushing the sweaty strands back.
    </p>
<p>
     The older woman kisses her once more before grabbing her hips, “Didn’t you say you were gonna ride me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I did, didn't I?” She flashes a bit of an evil grin and brings her head down to lick a stripe up from between Agatha’s tits, up her neck just under her jaw.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifts to angle her hips perpendicular to Agatha’s and grinds her clit against the other woman’s. They’re both incredibly wet, making the friction deliciously sensual and Rio puts her whole body into it, really putting on a show for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     It feels like Rio is moving her hips at a painfully slow pace that drives Agatha mad. The damn woman is such a tease. “Faster.” She demands.
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever you want.” Rio grinds harder, picking up the pace until Agatha’s body tenses under her and she lets out a guttural moan wit Rio, following her shortly after. She shifts her body slightly, still straddling Agatha and begins to grind again.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re insatiable, Rio Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh baby I could go all night.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know we have to work in the morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Those kids are watching a movie tomorrow, trust me they’re gonna love it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughs and brings her back in to crash their lips together.
    </p>
<p>
     —
    </p>
<p>
     They really do believe they’re slick when they come in to work at separate times even though they woke up next to each other.
    </p>
<p>
     And they really don’t expect anyone to suspect anything even when Rio spends every other lunch and free period sitting on Agatha’s desk twirling her hair between her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     The students always wonder who’s leaving bouquets and love letters on Agatha’s desk. Or why their teacher is always fighting with Ms. Vidal across the hall.
    </p>
<p>
     They think they’re subtle but their coworkers aren’t idiots. “Glad you guys finally banged it out, you're a lot more tolerable these days, Agatha.” Jen admits to her at lunch in the teachers lounge.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chokes on her food while Rio snickers to herself. “Jen I’m gonna kill you.” She moves to get up but Rio stops her by grabbing her hand and pulling her back down.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t really think they wouldn’t figure it out babe.” Rio says as she brings Agatha’s hand to her lips to give a sweet kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     The bitter expression on Agatha’s face melted away, she couldn’t help it.
    </p>
<p>
     At the beginning of the year she couldn’t wait for Mrs. Hart to come back but now she kinda hopes she retires.
