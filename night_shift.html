<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha Harkness is back in Westview. Newly divorced. Working nights. She didn’t expect to see Rio Vidal again. Then again, she never really knew what to do with her in the first place.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There’s no rule against running into someone you haven’t spoken to in ten years and realizing nothing about them has changed except their hair and the exact angle of the knife they twist in your gut.</p>
<p>Agatha’s fine.</p>
<p>Agatha’s not mad.</p>
<p>She just wants to know who the fuck decided to keep that particular bit of very fucking important information classified.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello gays, it’s me, ya boi.</p>
<p>Before we get into it, a few things: if you’re here from my coffins fic-love you, always. I fought so hard not to write my OC from coffins into this… and I lost. She’s in it. That said, her relationship to Agathario isn’t the same in this one, but I missed MY FAMILY and couldn’t not bring her back.</p>
<p>Also, I got this idea after watching Platonic with Seth Rogen and by that I mean this has nothing to do with the show except that Agatha and Rio were never more than platonic… sorta… at least physically… you’ll see.</p>
<p>And lastly, let the record show: I am a huge Wanda Maximoff fan. I love her. But for the purpose of this fic, she is not a great person. Please don’t come for me lmaoo.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s it. Buckle up. Hope you enjoy the ride.</p></blockquote>

      Chapter 1: jump scare
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Night shift… Either people love it or they hate it.</p><p> </p><p>There’s plenty to hate about it, really. It wrecks your sleep cycle, jacks up your risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, digestive issues. It’s like playing roulette with your internal organs. One especially charming fact? Night shift workers can expect to lose about fifteen years off their lives.</p><p> </p><p>Even with the promise of an early death and digestive ruin, someone still has to clock in anyway.</p><p> </p><p>It’ll probably ruin you. It’ll take years off your life. It’s not healthy, it’s not balanced. But someone has to show up for it. Someone always does.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness fucking loves night shift.</p><p> </p><p>She believes that in a hospital, it’s easily the best shift. Fewer people. Quieter halls. Most of the self righteous day staff disappear when the sun disappears, and the ones who stick around tend to be too tired to keep up the act. Not that it's completely free of obnoxious coworkers, but no job ever is. That’s just the curse of shared oxygen.</p><p> </p><p>And the pay? Delightfully absurd. A few extra dollars an hour to embrace less fluorescent lighting, the occasional spiral into an existential cirsis, and losing the ability to behave like a functioning member of society during the day. Honestly? Bargain.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t love working nights for the pay or to silently push herself toward an early grave.</p><p> </p><p>She loves it because no one gives a damn if she doesn’t smile. There's no pressure to perform, no expectation of charm. She shows up, does her job, and no one asks her to pretend to be someone that she’s not.</p><p> </p><p>There’s this myth that nights are easier. That things settle down. Patients don’t crash, alarms don’t blare, nobody spirals into a medical emergency after the sun goes down.</p><p> </p><p>That couldn’t be further from the truth.</p><p> </p><p>Emergencies don’t clock out. They just get harder to see in the dark.</p><p> </p><p>And on the worst nights, when things really fall apart, there’s always a full moon.</p><p> </p><p>That part isn’t superstition. It’s consistency. A full moon shows up and everything goes to absolute shit. Machines fail for no reason. People get fucking weird. The laws of physics bend out spite.</p><p> </p><p>It’s chaos. Unapologetic and total.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t just handle it. She thrives in it.</p><p> </p><p>Order is fine, in theory. It’s neat. It’s cute. But chaos? It’s messy, brutal, and unpredictable- but it’s real.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is back on nights after over a decade away from them.</p><p> </p><p>She’s also back in Westview.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not a small town- never was. It’s suburbia with too many people, too many intersections, and too many places pretending to be important. The traffic makes no sense, the strip malls all smell vaguely like sweat and fried food, and if there’s a charming side to Westview, it’s buried under a Target, a vape shop, and a mattress store that’s definitely laundering money.</p><p> </p><p>And she loves it.</p><p> </p><p>It’s where she went to college. Where she started over after clawing herself out from under her mother’s roof, her mother’s rules, and her mother’s voice- now, thankfully, all six feet under. Westview was hers before anything else ever was, and she’s not sorry to be back.</p><p> </p><p>Westview was supposed to be permanent. And for a while, it was.</p><p> </p><p>Until Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>They met at a bar. One of those loud, overlit places where everyone’s shouting over each other and the drinks are five dollars too expensive. Wanda had a quick smile and a brilliant mind, and Agatha had been too tired to resist either.</p><p> </p><p>The first year of their relationship, Agatha gave up night shift. She’d been a NICU nurse at St. Rita’s Memorial Hospital straight out of college. She’d built her career on nights and never intended to leave them. But relationships, she reasoned, were about compromise. The second year, they got engaged. Before the end of that year, they were married and relocating to the Windy City so Wanda could step into a shiny new position.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda worked in administration, back when she still remembered what that meant. It obviously didn’t take long for ex-wife to climb. She was good at her job, knew how to play the game. Agatha watched her go from clipboard and sensible heels to executive decisions and boardroom smiles. Somewhere along the way, it changed. Wanda stopped talking about care plans and started talking about cost-efficiency. The person who once fought for nurses was now the reason they were short staffed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t follow her then wife to Chicago because she believed in the dream. She followed her because staying no longer felt like an option. Wanda was certain. She made plans, gave names to things, Agatha never had to translate her silences. And maybe that was the appeal. There were no rules to navigate, no words to interpret.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s offer came with just enough forward motion to feel like an escape. It was easier to chase a new zip code than to sit still with everything that wasn’t working. So she packed her life into cardboard boxes, told herself she’d find her footing again, and pretended it didn’t feel like she was leaving a part of herself behind on purpose.</p><p> </p><p>But it’s been long enough.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was home now.</p><p> </p><p>Back at St. Rita’s, working nights as a NICU nurse again, in a hospital that remembers her even if most of the staff doesn’t. The shifts are brutal, the halls are dim, and the chaos is familiar in a way that feels comforting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows exactly what she signed up for. And this time, she’s not leaving.</p><p> </p><p>That is, until her very first night back on nights.</p><p> </p><p>She’d trained for three months on days, but now she was back where she belonged, elbow deep in chaos at 2:30 a.m., drawing labs on a micro preemie who -judging by the flailing limbs and oxygen desats- was deeply committed to playing patty cake with Jesus anytime Agatha so much as touched his arm. Totally normal behavior for a micro. They hate being messed with, and they make sure you know it.</p><p> </p><p>She’d just finished and was now standing at the bedside computer, charting her victory, when she heard the door to the pod open.</p><p> </p><p>The whirr of the portable x-ray machine was familiar, unremarkable. Both of Agatha’s babies had morning x-rays ordered, so she didn’t bother turning around. The tech would need time to set up, and she needed to wrap up her charting. It was routine. Normal. Nothing she hadn’t done a billion times before.</p><p> </p><p>“Heard you guys were having a party… Who invited day shift?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze. Her spine went rigid at the sound of that voice.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t happening. That voice. That person. She wasn’t supposed to be here. She was supposed to be at Westview Regional, the same place that woman worked at nearly ten years ago. Out of sight. Out of reach. Out of Agatha’s goddamn life.</p><p> </p><p>She inhaled slowly, bracing herself to face the woman she had spent the better part of a decade not thinking about. Or pretending not to. Success had never really been the point. Agatha was excellent at rewriting her own narrative when it suited her.</p><p> </p><p>Denial was a river in Egypt, and she'd been floating along it with a drink in hand and no intention of docking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned around with her shoulders tall, head held high, and met the face of the last person she wanted to see.</p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal stood beside the portable x-ray machine in forest green scrubs, her hair clipped back. Those brown eyes scanned Agatha’s face with a slight arch of her brow and the faint press of her tongue into her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio’s gaze dropped. It traveled down Agatha’s body, obnoxious and obvious, before dragging back up with the same infuriating ease.</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t think Wanda let you out after dark.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio was fighting a smirk. Agatha could see it, and it made her want to rip a lead apron in half.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing here?” Agatha asked, too clipped to pass for casual.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced to the side, then back at her with mock innocence. “My job?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and scoffed just as the respiratory therapist made her way over to the bedspace to help with the x-ray. The baby was intubated, which meant it was a two person job. The RT reached for one of the heavy lead aprons hanging from the front of the portable and slipped it on.</p><p> </p><p>“How long has it been, Agatha?” Rio asked, voice light. “Since you acquired the Darkhold? You hid behind all that dark magic.”</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck are you talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped up to the isolette, flipping open the access ports without waiting for a reply. On the other side, the RT mirrored her movements, her voice bright and oblivious.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t mind Rio,” the RT said, adjusting her grip on the baby’s ET tube. “She’s always been a little odd, but she’s the NICU’s favorite x-ray tech.”</p><p> </p><p>By then, Rio was dragging the x-ray arm into position over the isolette.</p><p> </p><p>It took everything in Agatha not to snap. She could feel her jaw lock tight, every word she wanted to say caught behind clenched teeth. Instead, she forced a smile toward the RT, one that absolutely did not reach her eyes. It felt brittle. It probably looked worse.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed flatly and turned her attention to the baby instead, carefully moving the wires and leads aside so they wouldn’t show up in the image.</p><p> </p><p>“That is so lovely, Sharon,” Rio said from Sheryl's side of the isolette. She leaned in a little and added in a mock whisper, “You’re my favorite RT. Don’t tell the others.”</p><p> </p><p>Sharon laughed, clearly enjoying the attention. “Oh, Rio. Your secret’s safe with me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a disgusted sound in the back of her throat and kept positioning the baby.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved to her side of the isolette, holding the small x-ray detector in both hands. “Ma’lady,” she said with a mock bow.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped back just enough to give her room, but kept her hands inside the isolette. Rio slid out the tray that holds the detector and placed it gently into position. Her hand brushed lightly against Agatha’s stomach in the process.</p><p> </p><p>“Watch it,” Agatha muttered through clenched teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just gave a casual salute and walked back to the portable, grabbing the corded exposure button and stepping a few feet away. “You know, Agatha,” she called over her shoulder, “you really should be wearing lead.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t tell me what to do.”</p><p> </p><p>The machine powered up with a loud hum. A moment later, it beeped loudly, signaling the image had been taken.</p><p> </p><p>“How’s it look, Rio?” Sherry asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Positioning’s perfect. All required anatomy is there,” Rio said. “As for anything else, well… they don’t pay me enough to have opinions.”</p><p> </p><p>Sharon laughed too loud, clearly enjoying herself more than the moment deserved.</p><p> </p><p>Once the exam was finished, Rio walked back over to the isolette, reached for the machine’s arm, and retrieved the detector. Agatha shifted as much as she could without letting go of the baby, her body contorting at an odd angle to keep her arms steady in the isolette while making absolutely certain Rio wouldn’t come close enough to graze her again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and some name starting with an S- worked together to settle the preemie again. Carefully readjusting until the infant stopped protesting with full body fury enough for him to remember how to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Her second patient wasn’t intubated, so the RT didn’t stick around. But not before she tossed a warning over her shoulder, “You really should listen to Rio. That lead’s not just decoration.” Sharla crossed the pod to another bedspace without fanfare, her lead apron still in place, chatting easily with whoever was next in line.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Just rolled her eyes and kept her expression flat.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t that Agatha didn’t know better. The dose was tiny. But for people who stood in it every night, leaned in close, kept their hands inside while the image was taken- it could start to add up. So yeah, lead aprons and distance were habits probably worth keeping, but no one was forcing it. You did what felt right. Some people wore it every time. Some didn’t. Agatha didn’t always bother. It usually depended on the day.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved on to her next patient in the bedspace over. Rio followed, rolling the portable behind her and parking it at the isolette. </p><p> </p><p>When the very annoying RT was out of earshot, Agatha turned back to the machine and ripped the lead apron from its hook. She pulled it on, fastened it tight across her torso, and adjusted the thyroid shield around her neck without looking up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was watching her. The corners of her mouth hinted at a smile she didn’t bother to hide.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t give her the courtesy of eye contact. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha adjusted the micro into position while Rio set up the machine. When Rio came around to her side to place the detector, Agatha didn’t even look up.</p><p> </p><p>“Nope,” Agatha said simply, nodding toward the opposite side of the isolette, where no one was standing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed and rolled her eyes but didn’t argue. She circled around the machine and did exactly what she was told.</p><p> </p><p>As she worked, Agatha glanced up. She hadn’t seen Rio in ten years and for a second, she just wanted to look.</p><p> </p><p>But the second her eyes found Rio’s face, Rio looked up too. Their eyes met briefly, and Agatha dropped her gaze just as fast.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t miss it. “So,” she said, drawing it out. “How’s the ol’ ball and chain?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not your damn beeswax,” Agatha snapped. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes went wide with amusement. She said nothing, pressing her tongue into her cheek to keep from laughing as she moved back to the portable.</p><p> </p><p>When it was done, Agatha tore the lead off her body and neck, not bothering with care or quiet, and dropped it back onto the machine.</p><p> </p><p>After her x-rays were done, Agatha dropped into the high rolling chair, the seat bouncing under her with a dull thud. She focused on charting, jaw tight, while Rio made her way around the pod, hitting a few more bedspaces, talking to every nurse or RT she crossed paths with.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t dare turn around. But her ears were absolutely working overtime.</p><p> </p><p>“Those new scrubs? That color looks great on you!”</p><p> </p><p>There was a soft laugh from the nurse.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed under her breath. “Fucking flirt,” she mumbled, clicking a little harder on the mouse than she needed to.</p><p> </p><p>A few minutes passed. She kept her head down when she heard the wheels of the portable rolling toward the door. Agatha wasn’t going to look. That was the plan.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>Her head turned before she could stop it. Instinct. Old, dumb muscle memory.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in the doorway, backing out with the portable in front of her. Her smile was soft. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad you’re back.” It wasn’t a performance. There was no dig tucked into it. Only sincerity.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a nod and the flattest version of a smile she could manage. It wasn’t warm, but it wasn’t cruel either.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile widened slightly, the gap in her teeth flashing for half a second before she disappeared through the door.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned back to her charting and kept her eyes on the screen, pretending her pulse hadn’t changed at all.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio’s friendship had always defied explanation. It was subterranean. Pressurized. Preserved in a way that made it feel ancient and untouched, even now.</p><p> </p><p>There had never been a confession. Never a moment Agatha could point to and say, ‘There that’s when I knew.’ But it lived in her anyway. In the unspoken rules. In the stillness between jokes. In the way her chest still tightened, all these years later, when something reminded her of Rio and there was no one to say it to.</p><p> </p><p>They weren’t soulmates. They weren’t lovers. They were best friends in a way that ruins a person for anyone else. Best friends in the way that made everything after feel performative.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t lose Rio because of some spectacular fallout. There was no fight, no betrayal, no line crossed. Just the slow accumulation of choices that didn’t include her. The slow realization that if something wasn’t named, it couldn’t be mourned.</p><p> </p><p>Even now, divorced and hollowed out by it, Agatha couldn’t explain the loss without sounding delusional.</p><p> </p><p>They met seventeen years ago. Through other people. It wasn’t fate. It wasn’t even remarkable. But somehow they’d locked into each other instantly, like two objects caught in each other’s orbit.</p><p> </p><p>Alice had introduced her casually- Rio Vidal, Westview Regional. Didn’t say much else. Didn’t need to. Rio was impossible to miss. She had been leaned back in a cheap plastic chair, black hoodie, one converse resting on the table like it lived there. Unlit cigarette hanging from her mouth, shuffling a deck of cards. Rio glanced up only once.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“Who invited day shift?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had shown up to game night out of spite, not interest. Jen had invited her- probably as some warped professional courtesy after their first week on nights together. She hadn’t planned to stay long. Definitely hadn’t planned to notice anyone.</p><p> </p><p>But then a woman named Rio Vidal opened her stupid fucking mouth. And Agatha forgot she’d come there to be unimpressed.</p><p> </p><p>Jen tried to smooth it over, but Agatha wasn’t having it. She sat down, yanked the cards from Rio, and made it her personal mission to win everything for the rest of the night out of pure, targeted pettiness.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t speak much that night. Agatha left with a headache and no intention of ever seeing Rio again.</p><p> </p><p>Which, in retrospect, might’ve been when everything started.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t work at the same hospital. Didn’t even live in the same part of town. There was no real reason for them to keep crossing paths after that first game night.</p><p> </p><p>But somehow, they did.</p><p> </p><p>Group things, mostly. Birthdays, breakfasts and nights out organized by mutual friends. They kept ending up in the same places, standing near each other like it was accidental, even when it wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>They barely spoke at first. Just exchanged looks. Sniped a little. But Rio was the kind of person who could piss someone off without even trying, and Agatha had always been easy to provoke. </p><p> </p><p>Barely speaking turned into constant bickering. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha told herself it was the principle of the thing. That Rio was rude and needed to be humbled. That it wasn’t personal…</p><p> </p><p>…Eventually, the texts started. Then the nicknames. Then the habit of showing up for things neither of them actually wanted to attend just because the other one would be there. They weren’t friends. They were foils. That’s what Agatha told herself. Opposites. A bit. A long running joke.</p><p> </p><p>It happened so gradually, Agatha didn’t even realize she’d started checking her phone for Rio’s name without meaning to. Or that Rio had started asking what days she was off like it was logistical, not emotional.</p><p> </p><p>There was no confession. No shift in tone. Nothing overt. But Rio stopped flinching when Agatha sat too close. And Agatha stopped pretending she didn’t feel better in Rio’s presence. They didn’t talk about it. That was the unspoken rule. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped correcting people when they said Rio was her best friend. And Rio -who didn’t let anyone in, who kept people at arm’s length even when hugging them- never once pulled away from Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>They became each other’s default. Quietly. Permanently. Without realizing it had happened.</p><p> </p><p>People made assumptions, of course. About whether they were more than friends, about the way they moved around each other. Agatha always denied it. So did Rio. And neither of them were lying. But Agatha <em>would</em> be lying if she said there weren’t moments.</p><p> </p><p>Long, quiet, difficult to categorize moments. Nights where their laughter went too soft. Where Rio’s eyes stayed on Agatha’s mouth a second too long. Where Agatha didn’t move away when Rio leaned in too close and didn’t make a joke to break the tension.</p><p> </p><p>They never touched though, not in a way that would’ve changed anything.</p><p> </p><p>But it would’ve taken almost nothing.</p><p> </p><p>And suddenly the joke wasn’t funny anymore. Or maybe it was, but neither of them were laughing.</p><p> </p><p>Then came Wanda along.</p><p> </p><p>A bar. A drink Agatha didn’t like and a stranger who smiled at her.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda didn’t flirt. She asked. She invited. She followed up.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, too tired to play along and too curious not to, said yes.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda never liked Rio. Said she was arrogant. That the jokes were cruel, the calm was fake, the detachment exhausting. Said Agatha acted differently around her. Smart mouthed. Less filtered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pretended not to care. She said Wanda didn’t get it. That Rio was all bark, no bite. That their friendship was weird but harmless.</p><p> </p><p>Rio started answering texts later than usual. Started showing up less. She stopped lingering after things. Started bowing out with ‘<em>next time</em>’ instead of excuses.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha thought maybe it was just scheduling. That Rio was busy. That it wasn’t about her.</p><p> </p><p>But when she asked, offhand, if she was coming to a party Wanda was hosting, Rio just said<em>, “No,”</em> and didn’t explain. No sarcasm. No performance. Just… nothing.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when it started: the quiet.</p><p> </p><p>A distance that felt more like mercy than resentment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was giving her space. And Agatha- stupidly, blindly- took it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha told herself it was maturity. Boundaries. A natural shift. People grow up, grow apart. It wasn’t a big deal.</p><p> </p><p>It was a huge deal. She just hadn’t seen it yet.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha told Rio she was moving to Chicago, Rio didn’t argue.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say don’t go. Didn’t ask if it was what Agatha really wanted. She just nodded and said she was happy for Agatha. That was it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha realized she didn’t want support. Not from Rio. Not like that. Not when she was moving across the country with someone Rio couldn’t even pretend to like.</p><p> </p><p>They said goodbye in the kitchen of Agatha’s apartment. Wanda was in the next room, probably pretending not to listen. Rio stood by the sink with her arms crossed.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped forward and hugged Agatha- brief, careful, like she didn’t trust herself with more. Rio smelled like clean laundry. Her arms were solid, but the rest of her felt like scaffolding, like something holding itself up out of sheer will.</p><p> </p><p>When she pulled back, she gave Agatha a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. A small one. The smile people use when they don’t want to be asked how they’re doing. A smile that says, <em>‘I’m happy for you. Please don’t ask me to prove it.’</em></p><p> </p><p>And Agatha didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>She let Rio walk out the door without asking the question they’d both been avoiding for years.</p><p> </p><p>Even though something in her chest pulled so hard it felt like gravity had broken.</p><p> </p><p>It would’ve been easier if they’d fought. If someone had yelled or accused or slammed the door. But instead, they both stood still and let the moment pass.</p><p> </p><p>Let each other pass.</p><p> </p><p>Rio never asked her to stay. And Agatha, god help her, needed Rio to ask.</p><p> </p><p>But she was Agatha Harkness, stubborn and loyal to all the wrong things.</p><p> </p><p>She let Rio go.</p><p> </p><p>Now, years later, Agatha’s back.</p><p> </p><p>Back at St. Rita’s. Back on nights. Back in the NICU where everything still works the same and no one remembers her name.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t come back for closure. She didn’t come back for anyone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha came back because it was hers first.</p><p> </p><p>And now Rio’s here too.</p><p> </p><p>Not at another hospital. Not somewhere safely distant. Here. Wearing scrubs. Working nights. Acting like nothing happened.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t know how long Rio’s been at St. Rita’s, and she’s not about to ask. It doesn’t matter. It’s not like she planned her move back based on who might be on the payroll.</p><p> </p><p>But it’s still jarring.</p><p> </p><p>There’s no rule against running into someone you haven’t spoken to in ten years and realizing nothing about them has changed except their hair and the exact angle of the knife they twist in your gut.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s not mad. </p><p> </p><p>She just wants to know who the fuck decided to keep that particular bit of very fucking important information classified.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The second Agatha stepped off the elevator, she called Jen. She didn’t care if she was asleep or not.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello,” Jen answered, voice thick with sleep.</p><p> </p><p>“What the actual fuck,” Agatha hissed into the speaker, walking fast through the crowd of day shift arrivals.</p><p> </p><p>“You need-”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I need, bitch,” Agatha snapped. “I need a fucking Xanax because you somehow forgot to mention that she fucking works here now.” She was whispering through gritted teeth, eyes darting around the crowd in case someone might overhear. Not that anyone cared. Everyone was too busy on their way to clock in or dragging themselves home.</p><p> </p><p>“I tried to-”</p><p> </p><p>Before Jen could finish, Agatha yelped. Rio had materialized in front of her like she’d been summoned.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit,” Agatha breathed, hand flying to her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood there with her backpack slung over her shoulders, staring at her, teeth pressed into the inside of her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“Where the fuck did you come from?” Agatha barked, already hanging up on Jen without letting her finish.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer. She just tilted her head toward the wall Agatha had walked past- apparently where she’d been standing the whole time, probably waiting for Agatha to leave.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped around her, heading for the exit pretending she hadn’t just been jump scared in the middle of the hallway. She could hear Rio’s footsteps falling into place behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want?” Agatha snapped, not bothering to look over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice was calm, almost bored. “Special breakfast?”</p><p> </p><p>That made Agatha falter.</p><p> </p><p>Special breakfast was their thing- hers, Jen’s, Alice’s, Rio’s. Whoever had worked the same night would meet up afterward, get breakfast and maybe a cocktail, try to rinse off the alarm fatigue before heading home to sleep. It had been routine, once. Safe. Familiar.</p><p> </p><p>Hearing Rio say it now felt like being served a memory with a side of emotional whiplash.</p><p> </p><p>“Nope.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s fine. I’ll try again tomorrow,” Rio said, already falling into step beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head to look at her, jaw tight. “What are you trying to do?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. She kept walking, expression unreadable, steps easy. When they reached the double doors, she moved ahead and held one open for Agatha..</p><p> </p><p>“Walking you to your car,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t what Agatha meant.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t need someone to hold a door. She didn’t need politeness, or performative courtesy. She meant, what the hell is this? After ten years. After the most awkward, quiet, gut wrenching goodbye Agatha had ever lived through- and she was a recent divorcee, which really should’ve set the bar.  After ten years of silence so absolute that it was noticeably intentional. And now Rio was holding a door open for her, talking about breakfast, like none of it had ever happened.</p><p> </p><p>It was surreal. It was absolutely fucking insane. It was exactly the kind of thing Rio would do.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. The walk to her car stayed quiet. She wasn’t going to entertain this and honestly, she couldn’t have figured out how even if she tried.</p><p> </p><p>What she did notice was Rio shifting her backpack around to the front of her body, unzipping the same front pocket she’d always used for her keys. That small, familiar habit made Agatha exhale before she even realized she’d been holding her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up, caught her eye for a second, then looked away and swung the backpack back into place. Like she hadn’t meant to be seen. Like she didn’t want Agatha to recognize that she still did things exactly the same.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together and bit the inside of her cheek. Something else to focus on. Something else to hurt.</p><p> </p><p>“See you tonight?” Rio asked, peeling off toward the far end of the lot.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s laugh rang out behind her, loud and smug and completely unnecessary.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha kept walking, pretending it wasn’t the sound of her past catching up to her.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled into her driveway and immediately spotted Jennifer Kale leaning against the hood of her car, arms crossed, clearly waiting. She looked like she’d rolled out of bed minutes ago- sweats, a wrinkled t-shirt.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t acknowledge Jen. She killed the engine, grabbed her shit, and headed straight to her front door. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” Jen called after her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept walking. Jen’s footsteps followed, quickening behind her. “I tried to tell you-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped cold. Turned. “When?” She snapped.</p><p> </p><p>Jen raised her brow. “You serious?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. I am.” Agatha stepped closer. “I want to know when. Because I’m pretty sure I’d remember that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I tried at breakfast- more than once. I tried that day during report when I said, ‘Hey, you should probably know who’s working in Imaging now,’ and you literally said, ‘If this is about her, don’t.’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach turned. The words were familiar. She remembered saying them. She just hadn’t let herself actually hear it.</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t stop. “I tried when Alice brought her up in front of you and you changed the subject so fast it gave me whiplash. I tried when you said, ‘I don’t care what she’s doing, I don’t want to know.’</p><p> </p><p>Agatha perused her lips and said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“So no,” Jen said. “I didn’t spell it out for you because you made it very clear you didn’t want to know.” </p><p> </p><p>That was the fucked up part. Agatha hadn’t been lying when she said it. She hadn’t wanted to know. Not if it meant remembering what she left. What she didn’t ask for because Rio hadn’t offered. Because Rio hadn’t said anything. Not when it mattered. Not when Agatha was practically begging for it, in all the quiet ways she thought would be understood.</p><p> </p><p>She would’ve stayed. She knows that now. She absolutely would’ve stayed.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio had asked.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha left. Because someone had to make a decision, and it sure as hell wasn’t going to be her best friend, the one who always knew what to say until the one time Agatha needed her to actually say it.</p><p> </p><p>So no, Agatha didn’t want to know. Not after all that silence. Not after being made to feel like wanting more had been the mistake.</p><p> </p><p>And now? Now she was the one who looked like a fucking fool for not listening. Furious at Jen for doing exactly what Agatha asked. Furious at herself for meaning it.</p><p> </p><p>She exhaled slowly, like the air itself might burn on the way out. Her voice was softer when she spoke. “You should’ve told me anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>“You mean after you told me not to? Multiple times.”</p><p> </p><p>“Correct.”</p><p> </p><p>Because someone should’ve called Agatha’s bluff. Someone should’ve risked it. Because Agatha hadn’t meant it. She never fucking meant it.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Jen said quietly. “I should’ve.”</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t make Agatha feel better.</p><p> </p><p>“Does she know?” Agatha asked, keeping her eyes on the sidewalk.</p><p> </p><p>“Know about what?”</p><p> </p><p>“The divorce.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t answer right away.</p><p> </p><p>That was enough of an answer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “So she does.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alice tried not to bring it up, but you know her and Rio are close.” Jen said with a shrug.</p><p> </p><p>Of course. Alice.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s best friend. Jen’s wife. The unfortunate bridge between all of them.</p><p> </p><p>“Unfortunately,” Jen said, and her voice was wry, a little sad. “I got you in the divorce. Alice got Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her. Jen didn’t flinch.</p><p> </p><p>It hurt more than it should’ve. Because it meant everyone else had seen it for what it was when even to do this day they would both rather deny it than admit what they never had the courage to hold.</p><p> </p><p>The irony was humiliating. Everything about it was fucking humiliating.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had walked away from a real marriage, signed the papers, changed her name back, packed up the pieces of a life that never fit right and none of it compared to that split.</p><p> </p><p>Isn’t that fucking insane?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ended an actual marriage and it wasn’t even <em>that</em> marriage that made her feel like a wife walking out on the wrong person.</p><p> </p><p>She’d never even kissed Rio. Not once. You’d think Agatha would’ve gotten that much. Some small consolation for all the circling, all the silence, all the things she never let herself say out loud.</p><p> </p><p>But no. Not even that.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down at her shoes. “Funny, isn’t it?” she said, voice quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t answer. And thank fuck for that mercy. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The next night, at exactly 2:30 a.m., Rio showed up for morning x-rays.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t start with Agatha’s patients.</p><p> </p><p>In fact, when Rio walked in, she didn’t even glance her way. Not once. And Agatha- well, she definitely didn’t notice. She hadn’t spent the entire shift anticipating this moment like a goddamn countdown clock was ticking in her ear. She hadn’t gone back and forth between hoping Rio would show up and praying she wouldn’t. Hadn’t imagined every possible version of this interaction until all that was left was dread.</p><p> </p><p>No, definitely not.</p><p> </p><p>And so what if Rio hadn’t come to her first in a room full of people? It didn’t mean anything. Of course it didn’t. But still- somewhere under her ribs, it landed. Subtle, precise, like a nail set in place by the smallest hand. Like some invisible elf  had found the softest part of her and whispered, <em>‘you still feel this right?’</em> - before the first tap.</p><p> </p><p>Rio got to her last.</p><p> </p><p>She moved through the pod like it was routine like nothing about this night was different from the hundreds that came before.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio did approach, she pulled the portable beside the isolette with the same smooth, methodical rhythm she used for everyone else. Then her eyes found Agatha. They purposely dragged over her, once, twice, slowly enough to register but not long enough to be called anything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She held her ground and pretended she didn’t feel the way that look settled on her skin like it had been waiting all night for permission to look.</p><p> </p><p>“Saved the best for last,” Rio muttered, detector in hand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her. She didn’t speak. Just stared, jaw clenched, expression empty if you didn’t know how to look. Rio always had. That was the problem.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the words that got her. It was the softness in them. The carelessness that wasn’t careless at all. Like something inside Rio hadn’t gotten the memo that they weren’t allowed to talk like that anymore. And Agatha’s heart, small and treacherous, softened.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the exam passed in silence. So did the next.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Thank fuck.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>One of her babies was having a meltdown, pissed off in that uniquely preemie way that didn’t understand logic. He was flailing like he had a personal vendetta against respiratory support, glaring at Agatha through the isolette wall with all the fury his tiny face could muster. At one point, he threw a hand toward the ET tube threatening his own life in protest. ‘Do it again and I will die on purpose.’ The message was clear. The drama was exhausting.</p><p> </p><p>And still, she would’ve taken a dozen more like him if it meant not thinking about the way Rio had looked at her. Not feeling it still.</p><p> </p><p>By the time four a.m. rolled around, Agatha called out to the other nurses in her pod that she was taking her lunch and told them to keep an eye on her kiddos. They all responded without missing a beat. She got a chorus of murmured “got it”s and “you’re good,” and that was enough.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lunch was going to be a cigarette.</p><p> </p><p>That was it. That’s all she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda had made her quit two years into their relationship, and she had. Cold turkey. Swore up and down, even pinky promised like a moron. But she never really stopped. Every couple of weeks, maybe longer if things were good, she’d sneak one. A little rebellion she kept to herself. Wanda never noticed. Sue her. </p><p> </p><p>She left the unit, took the elevator down, cut through a couple of empty hallways, pushed through the double door employee exit, and headed toward her car. The air outside was brisk and damp, smelling of pavement, dew, and whatever fresh mulch they’d dumped in the flowerbeds a few days ago.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rifled through the middle console until her fingers closed around a half squished carton of Virginia Slims 120s and a scratched up purple Bic lighter. Then she made the walk, past the rows of sleeping cars and motion activated floodlights, to the far end of the lot where an old administration building sat abandoned. She ducked around the side, where the cameras didn’t reach and no one ever bothered to patrol.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled a cigarette from the carton, slipped it between her lips. The lighter took a few flicks before the flame held. She brought it up, cupping her hand around it to block the wind, then lit it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fell shut as she breathed it in. One arm crossed over her stomach, the other held the cigarette steady between her fingers- pointer and middle. </p><p> </p><p>It burned beautifully. Coated her lungs in tar and defiance.</p><p> </p><p>Smoking was the only thing Agatha never gave up completely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had given up a lot, actually. More than she ever said out loud. Night shift. Her best friend. Westview. The only life that felt like her own. Gave up so much she barely recognized what was left. </p><p> </p><p>All for a woman who mistook devotion for obedience. Who kept asking, kept taking, until there was nothing left to offer. And still, she’d asked for more. She would always ask for more.</p><p> </p><p>But this? This breath, this sting in her chest, this small, selfish mercy- was the one thing she never let Wanda actually touch. Never asked permission for. Never pretended she could live without.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda never noticed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept it hidden. Kept it as proof she still belonged to herself and still, it went unnoticed. Somehow, that made it worse. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha held it in for a beat longer then let the smoke spill from her mouth in a slow stream and let her head back against the brick wall behind her. </p><p> </p><p> No rush. No guilt. Just hers.</p><p> </p><p>“Anyone ever tell you smoking kills? You’re a nurse. You should probably know that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly launched herself into the next plane of existence. She jolted so hard her cigarette almost flew out of her hand, and for a split second, she genuinely wondered if her soul had evacuated her body.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha hissed, whipping around. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”</p><p> </p><p>And of course, it was her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio fucking Vidal, strolling out of the shadows, summoned by nicotine and bad decisions. Unlit cigarette hanging from her mouth. Hands shoved in the pockets of her scrub pants. </p><p> </p><p>“Would you stop doing that?” Agatha barked, hand still pressed to her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned her shoulder against the wall, casually plucked the cigarette from her mouth with two fingers, and looked at Agatha with mock innocence. “Doing what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Stalking me, freak.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not stalking you,” Rio said, deadpan. “This is where I smoke.”</p><p> </p><p>“How do you even kno-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t finish.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the sentence stuck somewhere behind her teeth, caught on a memory she hadn’t meant to touch.</p><p> </p><p>Because she did know.</p><p> </p><p>It started with one night. One truly god awful shift. The kind of night that left her buzzing under her skin, chest tight, hands shaking even after washing them three times. She’d texted Rio without thinking. Just said she needed a cigarette or she was going to lose it. </p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t expected a response. Rio didn’t work at her hospital then. It was just a throwaway text. </p><p> </p><p>But by the time Agatha made it outside her own pack of cigarettes gripped tightly in her hand, Rio was already sitting on the curb. Unlit cigarette hanging from her lips, legs stretched out, hood up like she’d been born for the graveyard shift. She didn’t say hello. Just offered the lighter.</p><p> </p><p>After that, it just kept happening.</p><p> </p><p>Not often. Not on any schedule. But every once in a while, when Rio had the night off, Agatha would get a text. Just four words: <em>outside when you can</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio would show up- parked in the same spot, waiting in the dark, leaning against the building or sitting on the pavement. </p><p> </p><p>They didn’t speak unless they wanted to. Sometimes Agatha would vent. Sometimes she’d sit there in silence, staring at the sky. Sometimes she cried and said it was allergies. Rio never called her on it.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t some grand gesture. It wasn’t romance or rescue.</p><p> </p><p>It was just Rio. Solid. Still. Showing up even when everything else was falling apart.</p><p> </p><p>And now here Rio was again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, eyes narrowing with a small, knowing smile- confirming the moments Agatha had remembered. </p><p> </p><p>“Got a light?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head away from her. She took another drag and exhaled. “You have one.”</p><p> </p><p>“I want yours.” </p><p> </p><p>There was no tease in Rio’s voice. It was quiet. Intentional. </p><p> </p><p>And because Agatha was a little bitch in the presence of beautiful women specifically named Rio Vidal, she handed it over without protest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t take it. She just stared at the lighter in Agatha’s palm. Her eyes dragged from the lighter back up to Agatha’s face with unhurried precision, like she was deciding whether to ruin Agatha or leave it for later.</p><p> </p><p>“What? You forget how to take it all of a sudden?” Agatha snapped. She wasn’t annoyed that Rio kept looking at her like that. It was that Agatha didn’t think she ever wanted it to stop. And that unsettled her. Because she knew the flirting wasn’t real. It was a shield, something Rio hid behind. A performance with no promise behind it. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I can show you exactly how well I can take it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even bother pretending. She let herself feel it-  that pull low in her stomach, hot and immediate, striking like a match in the dark. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s flirting was worse than she remembered. She used to be subtle about it. Sly comments, discreet looks, lines that could pass as jokes if you needed them to. But this? This was different. Blunt. Direct. Like Rio wasn’t interested in pretending anymore. And Agatha hated how much it worked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed and took another drag, cigarette back between her lips, and she let her head fall against the brick. The surface was cool through her hair, solid in a way she needed. Agatha rolled her head to the side, so she could look at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Under the dim cast of a single building light bolted to the wall above them, humming and flickering faintly, Agatha let her gaze drag.</p><p> </p><p>She took in the line of Rio’s shoulders, the angle of her jaw, the way the light touched her face like it remembered them too. And her hair wasn’t dyed black anymore. It was brown now, her natural color, pulled half up into a small little bun at the back of her head. The rest brushed her shoulders, shorter than it used to be. And still, somehow, exactly her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked older now. Not startling, just the subtle changes time leaves behind when it thinks no one’s watching. Agatha wanted to memorize all of it. She let her eyes drag, cataloguing every difference, every new detail etched into the face she used to know like her own. Then, just to make Rio squirm, Agatha let her eyes settle on Rio’s mouth. Lingering. Controlled. She watched as Rio’s lips parted, watched the way her tongue swept across them.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when she noticed Rio’s hand slipping from her scrub pocket, fingers inching toward Agatha’s waist. It paused and hovered. But Rio didn’t touch her. Her hand faltered, then fell away, retreating into the safety of her scrub pocket to tuck the impulse out of sight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dragged her gaze back to Rio’s eyes and smirked, letting the falter crown her the victor.</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised the hand still holding her unlit cigarette, tapping the filter against her lips before glancing at Agatha. “You know this isn’t the only fag I’ve been dying to wrap my mouth around.” The line was filth, but it came out like she’d been waiting to use it for years.</p><p> </p><p>Rio placed the cigarette between her lips, chin tilted in silent demand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but turned to face her fully, stuck the end of her own nearly spent cigarette between her teeth, and flicked the lighter to life. She lifted it with one hand, shielding the flame with the other. Rio met her halfway, palm against Agatha’s, thumb brushing the side of her hand.</p><p> </p><p>The cigarette caught. Agatha ripped away feeling like she’d been burned.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back against the wall and tore the crumpled pack from her pocket, fingers trembling just enough to give herself away.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled the dying cigarette from her mouth, dropped it to the pavement, and crushed it beneath her heel. Then she lit the fresh one and drew in fast, clipped puffs. Her jaw stayed tight.</p><p> </p><p>The only thing worse than listening to Rio talk was letting Rio see what it did to her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t stop watching her. She never had. Cigarette perched between her fingers, she squinted slightly, lips parted. She took a long drag, exhaled away from Agatha, then turned her head back with a smirk curling at the end. Head tilted, tongue pushing into her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>She mirrored Agatha, back to the wall now, eyes bright with amusement.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s the matter baby?” she murmured, pitch sugary sweet and just a touch cruel. “You forget how to play?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh and shook her head. “No,” she said, breath catching a little. “You’re just no fun anymore.” She flicked the ash and sparks scattered against the pavement.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch, which annoyed Agatha more than it should have. She just rolled her eyes and smirked.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” Rio said. “You love it. You prefer-</p><p> </p><p>“We don’t even know each other.”</p><p> </p><p>And that was true. Sudden and overwhelming. They’d been out of each other’s lives longer than they’d ever been in them. Strangers, technically.</p><p> </p><p>Rio took another drag and said, quieter this time, “Sure we do. You’re my ex…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused.</p><p> </p><p>“…Best friend.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so much more annoying than I remember,” Agatha muttered, not meaning for it to sound soft, but failing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded toward the cigarette between Agatha’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“Too good for American Spirits now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha side eyed her. “I prefer my cancer have a little class. Take notes.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t say the rest. That she couldn’t smoke American Spirits anymore without tasting regret. That they reminded her of cheap bars, cold parking lots, and a person she had spent ten years trying not to miss.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio’s face twisted, “Where’s your wife?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head whipped toward her. “Cut the shit. You know we’re divorced.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do I?” Rio snapped. “Because apparently we don’t know each other.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shoulders stiffened. “Why are you even here?” she snapped back.</p><p> </p><p>“I work here.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not what I meant.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, “Then ask a better question.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t. She couldn’t without giving something away. Without admitting she’d already started playing a game she told herself she was done with.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just stood there, like she was still waiting for Agatha to make the next move. Like she hadn’t already made hers the second she showed back up.</p><p> </p><p>It was a pattern. A dance. A loop they’d fallen into a thousand times before.</p><p> </p><p>Old habits die hard. And apparently, neither of them had changed enough to kill this one.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the cigarette fall from her fingers and crushed it under her shoe. “Break is over,” she mumbled, already walking away.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze. Eyes shut. A sigh caught in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>She told herself it was exhaustion. That’s why something in her spine flinched toward that stupid, fucking nickname like it still belonged to her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was off the wall now, standing like she might finally say something. Something important. Her eyes wide, her mouth half open like the sentence got caught in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha braced herself. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“I- “ Rio’s voice cracked. She cleared her throat, looked down, then back up again. “Special breakfast?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a noise that wasn’t a laugh. More a breath shoved through her teeth, bitter and stunned. She brought her hand up over her mouth and waved it. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Agatha said, not even looking at Rio now. “No.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio watched her carefully. She took drag from her cigarette, her eyes flicking down Agatha’s body. She nodded, smoke still held in her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, exhaling. “I’ll try again tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes so hard it hurt and turned back toward the hospital. She didn’t look back.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t keep letting this happen.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had come to terms with a thousand versions of herself. But this burn under her skin, this pulse in her throat, this unbearable awareness of Rio Vidal standing only feet away- this was not one of them.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t a version of herself she’d outgrown. It was one she’d locked up and buried with her own hands, swearing she’d never let it speak again.</p><p> </p><p>And now it was breathing. Loud. Alive. And entirely too fucking close for comfort.</p>

<p>When Agatha finishes report, she grabs her shit and heads out of the unit. She hits the exit button on the double doors, turns right and stops dead in her tracks.</p><p> </p><p>The squeak of her shoes gives her away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is sitting on a bench halfway down the hallway, backpack still on, smushed awkwardly between her and the wall. Legs kicked out, ankles crossed, scrolling through her phone.</p><p> </p><p>She looks up at the sound, sees Agatha, and immediately straightens. Her phone disappears into her pocket. Rio stands and then Agatha sees what she’s holding.</p><p> </p><p>An unopened bottle of Diet Coke.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything. Just jerks her head toward the elevators.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t have the energy to argue.</p><p> </p><p>They walk in silence, side by side, down the long stretch of hallway toward the far end elevators.</p><p> </p><p>At the elevator bank, Rio hits the down button, then holds out the soda.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes it automatically and looks at the bottle. </p><p> </p><p>She had told Rio they didn’t know each other anymore.</p><p> </p><p>This was a reminder. A correction.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha always drank Diet Coke. Always had, before Rio even knew her. She used to say it kept her from committing crimes.</p><p> </p><p>When she looked up again, Rio was watching Agatha like she knew exactly who she was.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say thank you.</p><p> </p><p>They rode the elevator down in silence.</p><p> </p><p>It was that stupid silence that made Agatha want to punch a wall or kiss someone she shouldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>When the doors opened, Rio stepped out first. She didn’t look at Agatha, still didn’t speak. Only walked ahead like she knew Agatha would follow. And she did.</p><p> </p><p>They moved through the hallway side by side, neither reaching for conversation. At the exit, Rio stepped forward, pushed the door open, and waited.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha walked through it without saying anything. </p><p> </p><p>“Special breakfast?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. “Answer’s still no,” she mumbled.</p><p> </p><p>It was supposed to be firm. A shut door. It fell flat.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll try again tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She kept walking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made it to her car, slid into the driver’s seat, threw her bag into the passenger seat, and slammed the car door shut. She sat there, hands on the steering wheel, keys in her lap, and jaw locked.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t shaken. Just tired. Long shift. Alarm fatigue.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had a talent for showing up uninvited and making it look casual. Holding doors. Hanging around. Tossing out the same recycled material like they were still playing the same stupid game.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed the heels of her hands into her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio thought she could pick up where she left off and Agatha would just roll with it.  It wasn’t cute. It wasn’t clever. It was fucking lazy.</p><p> </p><p>“Special breakfast,” Agatha hissed. “I will throw a brick at your car!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slumped back in the seat, dragging both hands down her face.</p><p> </p><p>She let out a breathless, furious laugh. Then slammed her hands against the steering wheel and shouted, “FUCK.”</p><p> </p><p>Of course Rio was still showing up. Acting like they’d never stopped talking. Like ten years of silence could be fixed with stupid flirting and a fucking bottle of soda.</p><p> </p><p>“You think you can just show up with your smug little smirk and your perfectly fucking timed Diet Coke and your… your… lips and everything’s just back to normal?!”</p><p> </p><p>Another smack to the wheel.</p><p> </p><p>“‘I’ll show you exactly how well I can take it,’” she mocked, high pitched and venomous. “You’re not even that hot!” She shouted at the windshield.</p><p> </p><p>A pause.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, you are. You’re so hot, and that’s the problem, and I fucking hate you!” Agatha slammed the horn and held down out of pure spite.</p><p> </p><p>She whipped the car out of the parking space,  fleeing the scene of a crime.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was fine.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t spiraling-</p><p> </p><p>BUMP.</p><p> </p><p>She hit the curb. Hard.</p><p> </p><p>“FUCK,” Agatha shouted, already driving away and ignoring it ever happened.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped her car into the parking lot. She parked crooked, didn’t fix it. Killed the engine, and took a deep breath that did absolutely nothing.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t sleep well. But she slept, which she figured counted for something. It was her third shift in a row. The final stretch. Twelve more hours and then she was free.</p><p> </p><p>Four days off. Four nights of sleep. Four whole rotations of the earth without Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed her bag from the passenger seat. Picked up her coffee. Pushed the door open.</p><p> </p><p>And immediately wished the ground would open up and swallow her whole.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in the parking lot. Leaning against someone’s bumper in black scrubs, arms crossed, laughing at something said by a woman Agatha didn’t recognize. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks-</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Fuck, she looks so good.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked radiant in that effortless, infuriating way that had always ruined Agatha- head thrown back, that familiar gap in her teeth on full display, smiling like nothing in the world had ever gone wrong. It wasn’t just the timing or the angle or the way the sun seemed to bend around her. It was Rio Vidal. And Rio had always been too much to witness without consequence.</p><p> </p><p>It was so cinematic, so obscenely perfect, that the soundtrack queued itself without permission.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Baby (I will be your father figure)…</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said, whispering aloud. “No, no, no. No.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Oh, baby (put your tiny hand in mine)</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze flicked to the woman standing beside Rio, the one who’d earned that laugh. Agatha’s eyes narrowed.  She felt her jaw shift- jutting forward, teeth clenching tight. The feeling hit low in her stomach. </p><p> </p><p>Envy wasn’t the right word. It was meaner than that. Uglier. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wrenched her gaze back to Rio. And her eyes, untrustworthy at best, moved of their own accord, dragging down Rio’s body. Her posture, her mouth, her fucking hands.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>I’d love to (I will be your preacher, teacher)-</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up.</p><p> </p><p>A needle dragged straight across Agatha’s skull and caused the record to scratch. Immediately, she dropped behind her car door, heart pounding, breath caught in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>She fucking prayed.</p><p> </p><p>Not out of belief. That was gone. But desperation doesn’t need a god. It just needs a witness. Trouble never found Agatha when she was whole. It waited until she was already bleeding and then made itself comfortable.</p><p> </p><p>Footsteps.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shot up. Slammed the car door shut. Kept her eyes on anything that wasn’t Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She had made peace with a lot of things in her life… This would not be one.</p><p> </p><p>“Clip any curbs on the way in?” Rio smugly called after her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze, her entire body seizing beneath the sudden rush of anger that surged through her. Her shoulders locked into place and for a moment, all she could do was stand there- heart pounding, jaw clenched, every breath lodged between her ribs and her throat.</p><p> </p><p>The sound alone reached in and pulled her spine taut, every nerve stung in its wake.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned around with the seething exactness of a woman who understood exactly what she could do, and had no intention of wasting it on someone who wanted a show.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t moved. She stayed still by the car, arms crossed in a loose, calculated way that made it impossible to tell whether she was entertained or just waiting. Her mouth curved, tongue pressing into her cheek, that familiar glint in her eye sharpening with the kind of satisfaction Agatha had seen at least twenty times in the past two days.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Fucking entertained.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Three strides had closed the space between them, and now they stood face to face, breath to breath, the scent of Rio’s laundry detergent was irritatingly clean and familiar in a way that made Agatha want to scrub it off her own skin.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m only going to say this once,” Agatha said, her voice clipped, every syllable carrying more control than she felt, “so you don’t get any more ideas. I’m here to do my job. That’s it. Whatever you think this is, it isn’t. And it won’t be.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, gaze dropping to Agatha’s mouth before rising again, wearing the same smirk that had long since outstayed its welcome.</p><p> </p><p>“What exactly won’t be happening?” Rio asked, voice light.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever this is- ” she gestured, coffee sloshing dangerously in her hand, “the flirting, the jokes, the Diet Coke, the standing around watching me drive like a lunatic- whatever it is, it ends here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio opened her mouth, clearly ready to say something monumentally stupid, but Agatha cut her off. She raised one finger and held it there.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha started to turn away, finished with the conversation, but stopped and faced Rio again. She lifted her brows just enough to make it clear she meant every word. “I’m not doing this with you. I want you to stop perusing me. I want you to stop making my life here hell. I mean it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move, but her shoulders straightened, her smirk faltered just enough.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for a response. She turned and walked toward the building, coffee still in hand, fingers clenched a little tighter around the cup than before. </p><p> </p><p>She kept walking and swallowed the lump rising in her throat when she didn’t hear footsteps following behind her.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>By the time 2:30am rolled around, Agatha had already angled her chair to face away from the door. She didn’t need to see Rio to know she’d arrived. The screech of that ancient portable x-ray machine was always enough to announce her like some petty parade float, and Agatha had no interest in giving her the satisfaction of a reaction.</p><p> </p><p>She kept her eyes glued to the computer screen and pretended not to notice that 2:40 had come and gone. No sound. No wheels. No obnoxious entrance. Her teeth sank into the inside of her cheek as she stared at the monitor hoping it might start charting out of sympathy.</p><p> </p><p>At 2:45, Agatha heard it.</p><p> </p><p>The machine’s familiar sound entered the pod, stopped at her patient’s bedspace, and it took everything in Agatha not to react. She breathed in slowly, gave it a full second, then turned her chair.</p><p> </p><p>The air left Agatha’s lungs all at once.</p><p> </p><p>The woman standing there wasn’t Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She was younger, paler, maybe two or three inches shorter, with green eyes that caught the light entirely different- nothing like the nauseating brown Agatha had spent the last two days trying not to look at.</p><p> </p><p>“Who are you?” Agatha asked, harsher than intended, the words escaping before she could rein them in.</p><p> </p><p>The woman blinked, visibly startled. “Sage?” she offered, her name rising like a question, clearly thrown off by the intensity of Agatha’s reaction.</p><p> </p><p>“Wher-” Agatha stopped. She had been about to ask where Rio was, but caught herself. </p><p> </p><p>This was what she’d wanted, right? Rio stepping back. Giving Agatha space. No more games, no more baiting, no more making her life hell.</p><p> </p><p>But the silence didn’t feel like relief. It felt like a setup. Like Rio had disappeared just long enough to plan something bigger, louder, harder to ignore, tailored perfectly to get under Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>Because that’s what Rio did. She walked away when it mattered. And Agatha had no one to blame but herself for still expecting anything else.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re late,” is all Agatha says to the girl- Sage, apparently.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry. ED’s a mess right now,” the girl replies, eyeing her like Agatha’s grown a second head for giving a shit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond. She gets through the exams, finishes the x-rays, and throws the whole thing out of her mind.</p><p> </p><p>Or she tries to.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t show up when Agatha steps out for her cigarette. The silence feels earned. She sits on the curb, stares at the wall across from her, and tries not to think.</p><p> </p><p>She tells herself the silence is a blessing. That distance is what she asked for. But beneath the calm, something tight coils in her chest- nothing dramatic, nothing new. </p><p> </p><p>Just the usual reminder that relief and regret speak in the same voice when no one’s around to argue it.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaves the hospital at 7:34am, alone. She tells herself the tightness in her chest is the air coming easier, lungs no longer straining after two days spent suffocating.</p><p> </p><p>Then, as she pulls out of the lot, Agatha sees her.</p><p> </p><p>Walking along the sidewalk beside the girl who took her patients x-rays, all smiles and half laughs, black scrubs loose around her, arms folded like nothing mattered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught the curb on her way out. </p><p> </p><p>If the car wanted to make a scene, it could take it up with the god who kept writing Agatha into the same one.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Over the next four months, Agatha only saw Rio in passing and rarely at that. Rio never came up to the NICU for x-rays. Instead, it had been Sage or the boy Agatha stubbornly referred to as Teen, no matter how many times he corrected her with Billy.</p><p> </p><p>And over the course of those four months, Agatha figured out which of the two talked more when they thought they weren’t being asked anything.</p><p> </p><p>It was very obviously Teen.</p><p> </p><p>All it took was a few strategically placed  questions.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha found out how the overnight schedule worked for the x-ray department. At midnight, a list of patients populated automatically, and everything had to be done before 7am.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was the one who made the lists, assigning who went where, managing coverage across every floor. Stat orders and add-ons came in constantly from every floor, and traumas ran nonstop through the ED. Only three techs worked overnight on weekends, which was both absurd and, in hindsight, completely expected. No one in management was losing sleep over the graveyard shift.</p><p> </p><p>What caught Agatha off guard was how consistent it had been- Sage, Billy, and Rio, every weekend, every time. And how, without exception, it was never Rio assigned to the NICU. Not once.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t take much effort to connect the dots. Rio was the one assigning the floors. Which meant the distance hadn’t been circumstantial. It was intentional. Rio hadn’t just stayed out of the way. She’d made sure of it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha started picking up every weekend shift without fail. She told herself that it was habit, nothing more than timing and routine, something that didn’t need an explanation. Which was a stretch, considering she made her own schedule. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha still went outside for her lunch break every night. Sometimes she smoked. Sometimes she didn’t. It didn’t matter. The spot was quiet, and it was the only place where no one needed her to do anything or be anywhere. No alarms, no crying babies, no charting. Just enough space to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t waiting for anyone.</p><p> </p><p>No one ever came looking for her.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Wanda called every so often to check in, which Agatha found deeply fucking irritating. They hadn’t ended badly. Which, in retrospect, made it harder. There was no reason not to talk. But that also didn’t mean Agatha had any interest in polite postmortem phone calls with her ex-wife. Said calls felt off half of the time. A little too performed. A little too warm. Like Wanda was reaching for something without saying it aloud.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let it happen. Maybe because she didn’t want to give Wanda the satisfaction of being ignored, or maybe because there was something easier about talking to someone who already knew the worst parts of Agatha and still kept calling.</p><p> </p><p>One night, half distracted and too tired to play along, Agatha made a mistake. She joked, “I could always fly back for that missed opportunity of break up sex. Make it a delayed full circle moment.”</p><p> </p><p>"You could," Wanda said, without missing a beat. "I wouldn’t say no."</p><p> </p><p>Then, before Agatha could respond, she added, "She back in your life, by the way? The one with the brooding and the botanical fixation. I forget her name. Always reminded me of a stray you kept feeding out of guilt."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing. Her stomach turned. She didn’t fuck with any of it- the smugness in Wanda’s voice, the calculated forgetfulness, the way she said it like she hadn’t been waiting to bring her up the second Agatha picked up the phone. Wanda hadn’t forgotten her name. She just refused to say it.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha hated that she’d ever let Wanda speak it like that at all.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was doing well. Not just functional- but like, genuinely well. She’d started going to the gym regularly, and for the first time in years, it wasn’t something she had to drag herself through or accommodate anyone else’s routine for. Wanda had always insisted on tagging along, turning it into a joint activity. This was different. It was hers. It made her feel strong in a way that had nothing to do with anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>Work felt right, too. The rhythm of night shifts in the NICU came back naturally. Jen was there most nights, and their friendship had always been unfiltered in a way only certain kinds of trust allowed. They could bicker across the unit one minute and share a coffee in the hallway the next without missing a beat. It was just them- years deep and well worn.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha made time for people, not out of obligation, but because she wanted to. She’d go over to Jen and Alice’s for drinks some nights, or have them at her house when she had the mental bandwidth to host. They still did the occasional special breakfast after a stretch of night shifts. It was never a set thing. Sometimes it was three people, sometimes seven, sometimes whoever happened to be left standing by the end of the morning.</p><p> </p><p>Every now and then, something about it tugged at Agatha. The awareness of a choice she had made and hadn’t taken back. Agatha had said no. The breakfasts still happened. Rio wasn’t part of them. Agatha didn’t know if she knew that they still happened.</p><p> </p><p>Alice had been to a few. She and Rio were still close, working in the same department now at St. Rita’s instead of Westview Regional. CT and x-ray shared a hallway down in the ED. Different control booths, different machines, but the same shared space. Agatha figured the conversation would’ve been hard to avoid. And Alice wouldn’t lie. Not to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t asked.</p><p> </p><p>But sometimes, when they ended up at the same old diner they used to go to before Agatha had moved, she’d glance toward the door without thinking. Just for a second. Just long enough to remember what it felt like before everything changed.</p><p> </p><p>And even if it felt completely wrong some mornings, Agatha didn’t take her decision back.</p><p> </p><p>Alice and Jen had been hounding her for months to make an appearance at game night. They never pressed but they asked often enough that Agatha knew the invitation hadn’t gone stale. Every time, she declined because she had no interest in risking the very specific balance she’d finally built. She knew who’d be there. And she’d worked too hard to keep that particular variable out of her life.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t running. She was protecting what she’d finally started to rebuild.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>About a month later, Jen and Agatha were in the break room, leaning against the counter with a few other nurses, trading complaints about the new resident while working through a tray of slightly crushed birthday cupcakes. The conversation had started loud, then drifted. In the lull, Jen said it casually, like she was mentioning the weather.</p><p> </p><p>“Game night’s Wednesday this week, if you can make it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth was full when she answered. “Sure. Just text me the time.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t look up from the cupcake she was still picking apart. Didn’t catch the flash of surprise that passed over Jen’s face before she nodded and said, “Will do. My lunch is over… I’ll see you back in the pod.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup,” Agatha replied, already brushing crumbs off her scrubs.</p><p> </p><p>That was it. No build up. No second guessing. No one said <em>her</em> name.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that was the point. Maybe the room didn’t have to belong to anyone anymore.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Four days later, she stood in front of the full length mirror propped against the corner of her guest bedroom. Her outfit looked casual- relaxed jeans held up by a brown leather belt, a brownish tank top tucked in, and a tan blazer worn slightly oversized, collarless, sleeves rolled once at her wrists. Her white tennis shoes were scuffed but clean, the kind of detail that made the whole thing feel thrown on without being sloppy. Casual enough. Put together without trying too hard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabbed her purse and headed down the stairs. At the front door, she reached for the handle- then stopped, her hand resting against the metal.</p><p> </p><p>She stood there longer than she’d care to admit.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t nerves. Agatha wasn’t afraid to see Rio. But the idea of walking into a space where the silence between them was still the loudest thing in the room… that was harder to swallow.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t said a word to her in five months. No stupid comments. No smug half glances in the hallway. Just space. And maybe that was what Agatha had asked for. Maybe it was even the right thing.</p><p> </p><p>That didn’t mean Agatha liked it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spent months building something that finally felt like her own. And now, she didn’t feel the need to guard it so closely.</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed the handle and pulled it open before she could talk herself out of it.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The drive took ten minutes. Agatha had moved closer to Jen and Alice than she liked to admit. At the time, she told everyone it was for the shorter commute, the neighborhood, the price. But really, it was because she liked them. A lot. Which was gross. She didn’t say that part out loud.</p><p> </p><p>It made her feel weirdly soft, like she’d accidentally built her entire adult life around the people who used to feed her boxed wine and let her drag them out to karaoke without a fuss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled up to the curb and killed the engine.</p><p> </p><p>There were a few cars in the driveway. Some she recognized. Some she didn’t. But Rio’s black 4Runner stood out instantly. It wasn’t the same beat up car from years ago but Agatha recognized it because it was parked in the exact spot Agatha expected. Tucked against the far side near the fence, tires aligned like Rio was aiming for gridlines only she could see.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had always been weirdly consistent about things like that. At the hospital, she parked in the same space every shift. Walked the same route through the lot. Never took the closer spots, even when it was pouring rain. It wasn’t convenience, it was principle.</p><p> </p><p>It was stupid. It was the kind of thing you shouldn’t still remember. Where someone preferred to park. The little compulsions no one else noticed. But Agatha noticed. Agatha always fucking noticed. </p><p> </p><p>She looked at the car and felt her chest go tight in a weird, nostalgic way she hated. It made it too easy to pretend none of the in between ever happened. That ten years wasn’t ten years. That Rio was still her Rio, in all the unspoken ways that used to matter.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away and told herself it was just a parking spot.</p><p> </p><p>From where she sat, she could see the soft halo of backyard lights glowing through the slats of the fence. Laughter floated under the hum of music. Jen had gone all out again like she always did. String lights, planters, a patio with stained wood, cushioned chairs, a built in bar that looked like it belonged in a catalog. The yard was designed to host things like this. Alice’s garage, on the other hand, was pure chaos. Couches with uneven legs. A flat screen hung too high. Tools. the permanent smell of weed no matter how much Febreze was sprayed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flipped the sun visor down and opened the mirror. Checked her face, touched up nothing, and took a breath that didn’t help at all before snapping it shut.</p><p> </p><p>She got out of the car.</p><p> </p><p>The driveway crunched under her shoes. Agatha walked straight to the side gate, where laughter spilled louder now, paired with the low thump of bass and someone yelling over a story. She didn’t need to psych herself up or fake a smile. She wasn’t pretending tonight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt like herself.</p><p> </p><p>She slipped through the gate, pulled it shut behind her, and rounded the corner of the house. The backyard unfolded in soft light of string bulbs crisscrossed overhead, a long table set up down the middle of the patio.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Game night.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Half played card games, scattered snacks, drinks abandoned mid conversation. One end was in the middle of Spoons, fast and loud, spoons already missing. The other end hovered around a Jenga tower that looked one breath away from collapsing.</p><p> </p><p>It was messy. Loud, familiar, built from rituals no one had ever written down but everyone followed anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Jen spotted Agatha first. Without a word, she stood, glass already in hand, and met Agatha halfway across the yard.</p><p> </p><p>Whiskey, neat. Just how she liked it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha accepted it without making a joke or a face. She wrapped her fingers around it, nodded once and gave Jen a look that said more than thanks ever could. She reached out to gently squeeze Jen’s arm.</p><p> </p><p>The second Agatha was within sight, someone started clapping, and the rest followed with cheers like she’d just returned from war. She rolled her eyes, flipped them off without breaking stride, as she took a long sip of the drink that warmed her throat on the way down.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped into an empty chair on the end closest to the Jenga game, settling in between Teen, Jen, and Rebecca. Yelena, the RT was perched nearby, offering loaded commentary with a beer in one hand. </p><p> </p><p>It was the safer end of the table. The side that didn’t make Agatha’s stomach knot.</p><p> </p><p>Across the table, on the louder end, sat Alice, Nat, Rio, and Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was surprised to see Sage and Teen were here. Both in their twenties, both smart in ways that snuck up on you. Agatha had gotten to know them slowly over the last five months.</p><p> </p><p>This was the first time Agatha had seen them folded into this part of her life. This table. This crowd. They looked comfortable. Like they belonged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair just enough to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>The Jenga side of the table wasn’t in any particular rush. They were technically still playing, but the game had taken a backseat to the conversation. Moves were spaced out by stories, arguments about movies, updates on hospital drama everyone wanted to hear. Every now and then, someone would make a half hearted reach for a block, pull it with caution, and then immediately forget whose turn was next.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her eyes low, letting the chatter drift over her like white noise, until something in her peripheral caught.</p><p> </p><p>Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She was half turned in her chair, head tilted just enough to listen in on whatever Sage was saying, bright orange WNBA cap pulled low over her eyes. New York Liberty was stamped across her chest in cracked white letters. It was of those vintage t-shirts people buy on eBay, just faded enough to look earned, not ironic. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t see the rest of what Rio was wearing, not from where she was sitting, but she didn’t need to. She knew exactly how this went. Rio would be in jeans, obviously. Probably the same pair she used to throw on without looking. Mid rise, soft, older than they should be. Somehow they would still fit her in the best, most ungodly way. She’d be wearing her usual black Converse too, the ones she refused to replace, scuffed in the same places as ten years ago.</p><p> </p><p>Teen’s voice cut through her thoughts, screeching enough to make her blink. Honestly, she was grateful for the interruption until she started actually listening to what he was saying.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I’m so happy you decided to come. I know an egregious amount of-”</p><p> </p><p>“Be cool, man,” Agatha muttered, barely moving her mouth. Her lips brushed the rim of her glass as she took sip, eyes narrowing just past the Jenga tower as she tried to steal another glance without making it obvious.</p><p> </p><p>Beside Rio was the woman Agatha had pointedly avoided looking at since she walked through the gate.</p><p> </p><p>She’d known who it was the moment she walked in. Same woman from the parking lot. Same proximity to the one person Agatha had told herself she wasn’t thinking about anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Currently, the woman was laughing at something, her wine glass in hand, elbow resting against the back of Rio’s chair like she belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grimaced and looked away.</p><p> </p><p>Teen, undeterred, kept talking, his words tripping over each other with the confidence of someone who was used to being the youngest at the table and had decided to treat that like a superpower.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked to the far end of the table one more time, then back to her drink. She’d looked long enough for one night.</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, she was back.</p><p> </p><p>No big shift. No deep breath. She just… fell into it. One second she was somewhere else entirely, and the next she was cutting Rebecca off mid sentence and tossing something witty across the table that made Teen nearly fall out of his chair. Jen laughed so hard she wheezed. Yelena rolled her eyes without looking up.</p><p> </p><p>It felt good.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t realized how much she’d missed this. Not just the noise or the inside jokes or the way no one ever passed the popcorn without throwing it but the way her voice still fit here. The way everything picked up when she jumped in, like it was waiting for her.</p><p> </p><p>No one paused to make room for her. She didn’t need them to. She already knew where she sat.</p><p> </p><p>The old Jenga tower in the middle of the table had been left behind hours ago. Now it was just background. Rebecca tapped at one of the blocks absently while she talked, Teen stretched his legs into someone else’s space, and no one told him to move.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled. It came easy and stayed longer than she meant it to.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rebecca, Jen, and Yelena had wandered off somewhere else for a second, which left Billy with no one else to talk at and Agatha with no real excuse to leave. He’d been sitting next to her for twenty minutes, talking without taking so much as a single breath between sentences.  She didn’t mind. He had a way of filling silence that didn’t require much from Agatha. A nod here and there, the occasional hmm to keep him going. He was a good kid, even if she wasn’t really listening.</p><p> </p><p>Across the table, Agatha noticed Sage stand up.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched Sage make her way to their end of the table, a black Juul between her teeth like an unlit cigarette. She stopped next to Billy’s chair, tapped the back of it with her knuckles, and took the vape out of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Move,” Sage said.</p><p> </p><p>Teen looked up, confused. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re in my seat,” she said, nudging his elbow with her hip.</p><p> </p><p>“There aren’t assigned seats,” he snapped, already turning back to Agatha. “Anyway- where were we?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t give Agatha a chance to answer. Not that she could. She had no idea what he’d been rambling about before Sage walked over.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve been talking her ear off for twenty minutes,” Sage said. Then she kicked the leg of his chair. “You’ve had your turn. She looks miserable. Now get up.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy turned to Agatha, offended. “We were having a great conversation,” he said, like he was speaking for both of them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t chime in. She took a sip from her drink and almost laughed.  She hadn’t minded the conversation, but watching them argue was a lot more fun.</p><p> </p><p>“She hasn’t said a single word, dude.” Sage gestured to Agatha with both hands, presenting her evidence. “This isn’t a conversation, it’s a hostage situation.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had to bite back another laugh, which came out as a snort. She covered her mouth with her hand, and when Billy whipped his head toward her, he looked slightly offended. That sure as shit didn’t stop him from doubling down.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s a listener!” he said, talking for her again. “I know that because we’re friends. Plus, she doesn’t like you. She told me.”</p><p> </p><p>Alright- friends was a stretch. A massive one, actually. And Agatha had said no such thing. But judging by the look Sage gave him, she already knew he was full of shit.</p><p> </p><p>She looked at Agatha. “You tell him that?” Sage asked.</p><p> </p><p>The way Sage was looking at her, she knew the girl wasn’t actually asking. Just making sure Billy had an audience when she called him out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t rush to respond. She looked at Sage for a beat, then said, “No.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage looked back to Teen with a smile that was all teeth. “Would you look at that? That’s more than she’s said to you all night. So scram!”</p><p> </p><p>Billy let out a long, dramatic sigh and stood up like he’d finally accepted he wasn’t winning. “Don’t forget we’re going to Eddie’s tomorrow,” he said, standing in front of Sage. “Bring your personality or whatever. I need all the help I can get.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am not a vehicle for you to make out with my friend.”</p><p> </p><p>Teen smiled at Sage and rested a hand on her shoulder, “You kind of are though.”</p><p> </p><p>Then he turned and started toward the other end of the table. “Love you,” he called over his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Sage sat down next to Agatha and grabbed a handful of popcorn like none of it had happened. After a second, she said, “You’re welcome.”</p><p> </p><p>“Care to explain why the two of you are fighting for my attention tonight?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Sage shrugged. “Billy’s a try-hard and wants you to like him. Me? I just needed an excuse to get away from Amber throwing herself at Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “That bad?”</p><p> </p><p>“She called her mysterious. Twice. Then asked if she’d ever been in handcuffs. I had to get out before I lost my will to live.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t laugh, but her mouth twitched like it wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>That sealed it. If she were ranking the overnight weekend x-ray shift, Sage had just taken the top spot without breaking a sweat.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure how they got here. Sage had pushed her chair back, legs stretched out, looking entirely too relaxed, while Agatha was sitting across from her tossing popcorn at her mouth with questionable aim.</p><p> </p><p>They were asking each other questions now. Stupid ones. To pass the time.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s the most embarrassing interaction you’ve had with a patient?” Agatha asked, tossing another piece of popcorn Sage’s way. It hit her shoulder and rolled off.</p><p> </p><p>“I was sitting in the control booth,” Sage said. “Couldn’t see the guy our assistant brought in from the waiting room- he was in a wheelchair, behind the wall. So I ask, super casually, ‘Are you able to stand for your x-ray?’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could already see where it was going.</p><p> </p><p>“Silence. Like, dead silence. And then he says, ‘I don’t have legs.’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p> </p><p>“I shot up like someone lit my ass on fire, looked through the window, and yep. No legs. I think I watched my soul exit my body and take the elevator to the morgue.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lost it. Full laugh, head thrown back, snorting. She fired off another piece of popcorn mid laugh. Sage caught it in her mouth and threw her arms in the air like she’d just won a gold medal.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doubled over, still laughing. “That’s horrible.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well,” Sage shrugged, still chewing, “it builds character.”</p><p> </p><p>“Does it?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Sage said, deadpan. “I wanted to fling myself off the roof of the hospital.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, finally catching her breath as she tossed another piece of popcorn at Sage. She caught it again and let out a loud whoop. Then came the dance. All limbs and ego, loud enough to turn heads.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed under her breath and grabbed a whole fistful of popcorn, threw it up at her like confetti.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when Agatha felt it.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t need to look to know. Her body already clocked it, same way it always did. Some internal barometer tilted whenever Rio looked at her, like a third eye rolling open, whispering: she’s looking at you.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally looked over, Rio was, of course, already staring at her. She didn’t smile or recoil or pretend to be looking somewhere else. The noise around them kept going. Alice kept talking. Sage was still dancing. Someone dragged a chair across the patio. None of it touched them.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio turned back to the group and let out a soft laugh at whatever Alice had just said. It came a moment too late, like she had to remember where she was.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook it off and forced herself to laugh along with Sage, but it didn’t reach all the way.</p><p> </p><p>Not seventeen minutes later, Rio stood up and walked over.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been right. Same jeans. Same beat up Converse.  All that time, and Rio still moved through the world exactly the way Agatha remembered.</p><p> </p><p>And for a second, that felt unfair.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna take Amber hom-”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank god,” Sage said, cutting Rio off before she could finish.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted before she could stop herself. Tried to cover it with a cough, cleared her throat, and tossed out a half hearted, “Sorry,” in Rio’s direction without bothering to sell it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was looking at Agatha. Her brow was drawn, her mouth tugged upward, like she wasn’t entirely sure what had just happened or why she was reacting to it. It wasn’t quite a smile, not fully, but enough of one to be noticeable.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved her eyes back to Sage.</p><p> </p><p>“You staying or ready for me to drop you off?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized they came to game night together. Thinking back, Sage had spent most of the night near Rio before finally walking over and kicking Billy out of his own chair. Agatha had seen the two women leaving work together a few times too -crossing the parking lot, walking ahead of Agatha in the hall- but Agatha hadn’t given it much thought.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t surprising. Agatha just hadn’t known they were that close. </p><p> </p><p>“Hard pass. I’ll hang out here,” Sage said immediately.</p><p> </p><p>“Cool. I’ll be back in a few,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved to leave but slowed, eyes catching on the Jenga tower on the table. It had been sitting there untouched, half played, half forgotten. Her gaze flicked to Agatha, then back to the stack.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached for a piece.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers slipped around one of the lower corner blocks. It was the riskiest piece left, one someone didn’t touch unless they had something to prove. </p><p> </p><p>There had been a time when Rio would have passed it over without a thought, and wouldn’t care enough to try.</p><p> </p><p>But not tonight.</p><p> </p><p>Rio slid the block free. </p><p> </p><p>The tower wobbled under Rio’s touch, but it held.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned the piece over in her hand a few times, like she hadn’t decided what to do with it yet. For a second, Agatha thought she might set it down, walk away without placing it.</p><p> </p><p>Then she looked at Agatha again.</p><p> </p><p>And placed the block on top of the tower.</p><p> </p><p>The tower didn’t collapse.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She didn’t linger. She glanced once more at Agatha, then walked toward the backyard’s gate where Amber was calling her name.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t ask what it meant. She just watched Rio go, knowing better than to pretend it hadn’t meant anything at all.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>It was Agatha’s last shift of the week. She didn’t have a patient assignment all weekend. She was scheduled as the delivery nurse, which meant she had to stay ready in case a high risk birth came through. The delivery team was made up of people who could keep their heads when things turned sideways and Agatha, for better or worse, had a reputation for thriving in chaos.</p><p> </p><p>If she was paged, she would head straight to the delivery room prepared to take over the moment a baby was born.</p><p> </p><p>Until then, she floated. She stopped by different pods, leaned over shoulders, asked how things were going and actually meant it. If someone needed help with a feed or an IV or a baby who just wouldn’t settle, she stepped in without making a show of it. Sometimes she offered advice no one asked for. Sometimes she handed someone the thing they didn’t realize they needed until it was already in their hand.</p><p> </p><p>Around 1:30 a.m., a trauma page came through: a pregnant woman, twenty-five weeks along, en route to the hospital. There was concern she might deliver before even making it upstairs to Labor and Delivery. Agatha was already moving.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t alone. A whole team moved out at once- an NP, a resident, a fellow, a few NICU nurses, several from labor and delivery. They headed straight for one of the trauma bays in the ED. The patient was seventeen minutes out. Maybe less. Until then, they stood and waited.</p><p> </p><p>Inside the room, things moved quickly. People were already calling out what needed to be ready -warmers, suction, respiratory, lines, someone call x-ray- even though Agatha had already spotted Rio leaning against the wall, arms crossed, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>X-ray always was. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had mentioned it once, years ago. How x-ray always showed up first, stood there for twenty minutes while everyone else tripped over themselves to look useful, then got waved in like they hadn’t been there the whole time. At the time, Agatha had probably rolled her eyes. After that she saw it at every trauma she’d ever gone to.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t seen Rio since game night when she left with Amber and came back fifteen minutes later, alone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pretended not to notice. Pretended the relief that hit wasn’t relief at all. Just digestion. Just ambient liquor. Anything but what it actually was. </p><p> </p><p>Though Agatha did the math- fifteen minutes wasn’t enough time to get very far, much less get away with anything. Whatever it was, it didn’t scream passion. It barely even whispered a poor decision.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t speak when Rio got back. But Agatha lingered a little closer than she had before. Close enough to watch Rio reshuffle a deck of cards with an unlit cigarette between her lips. Close enough to join the next round of blackjack, even though Agatha fucking hated blackjack.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lost on purpose… Maybe…  Hard to say.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t think about the Jenga tower.</p><p> </p><p>Not the block Rio had pulled. Not the fact that it was one of the riskiest pieces- one Agatha never would’ve expected her to touch. Not the way Rio had hesitated, turning it over in her hand. And not the way she’d looked at Agatha just before placing it on top, like the act itself might carry more meaning than she was willing to give voice to.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could’ve obsessed over it. Could’ve dissected every second the way she used to when Rio was all questions and no answers, when every silence between them felt like a locked door she hadn’t been given the key to.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let it sit. </p><p> </p><p>A choice, a moment, a tower that didn’t fall.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was Rio’s way of saying something. Or maybe it wasn’t. Maybe it was nothing at all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t need to know.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to keep reading into everything they did or didn’t do. She didn’t want their friendship to be a scavenger hunt for what might still be salvageable. She just missed Rio. Missed who they used to be when it didn’t feel like one wrong move would send everything crashing.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha told herself that not everything needed to be deciphered or had to mean more than it did.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes people just walked away.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes they came back.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes the tower held.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized she was standing still in the middle of the hallway until someone bumped her shoulder on the way past. The nurse aide muttered a quick “sorry” and slipped into the open trauma bay without looking back.</p><p> </p><p>She blinked and the space around her came into focus again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t noticed her yet.</p><p> </p><p>There was no assigned place to stand when a trauma was coming in. No rule about where she should be. The trauma bays stretched out on either side of the hallway, curtains drawn back and waiting. Plenty of places to choose from and stay out of Rio’s way.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t want them to keep dodging each other like this. Didn’t want group nights to feel like a custody arrangement. Didn’t want to keep pretending that closeness had to come with consequence.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha crossed the hallway and made her way to the portable. </p><p> </p><p>She leaned against the portable without looking at Rio, hands tucked into her pockets.</p><p> </p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Rio shift. Saw the slight turn of her head, the tightening of her jaw like she was half a second away from snapping at whoever thought the x-ray equipment doubled as furniture.</p><p> </p><p>Rio saw who it was and said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“Can someone call x-ray?” someone shouted from inside the bay.</p><p> </p><p>“They’re already here,” Agatha called back, flat and loud, not bothering to hide the irritation in her voice. Agatha rolled her eyes. It was amazing how people could walk past a machine the size of a chest freezer and still act like it was invisible.</p><p> </p><p>After a breath, she let herself glance sideways.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was already looking at her, the corners of her mouth pulling upward,  trying not to smile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head away, eyes forward again, but she felt it. That tug of a smile she didn’t bother fighting all the way down.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let it sit. </p><p> </p><p>A choice, a moment, a tower that didn’t fall.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was walking out of the building when her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, thumbed open her messages, and immediately rolled her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Alice had created a group chat. She called it Coven of Chaos. Everyone was in it.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Alice: 70s night at The Witches Road on Wednesday. Be there or end up in B Squared.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted under her breath. Stupid joke.</p><p> </p><p>B Squared was what the ED staff called the psych hallway- technically part of B Pod, but set off in its own little corridor in the middle of the department, shaped like a square.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t bother replying. Just started to tuck her phone away when another text came through.</p><p> </p><p>This one was from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Her name lit up the screen like it had never left. Agatha had changed phones at least three times in the last decade, but Rio’s number had always made the jump. She’d never deleted it. Had never even hovered over the option.</p><p> </p><p>The text was three emojis: A knife and two drops of blood.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it for a second, then opened a separate thread. Just the two of them.</p><p> </p><p>It was empty. A blank conversation. No record of what came before. A fresh start, if Agatha wanted to believe in that kind of thing.</p><p> </p><p>She typed quickly and didn’t overthink the words.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Next time wear a neon sign or something.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>There was no explanation attached. She didn’t need one. Rio would know exactly what she meant. The trauma bay. The shouting. The way the entire team acted like x-ray hadn’t been standing there the whole time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slid her phone into her pocket and kept walking.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t check her phone until the alarm blared at noon.</p><p> </p><p>After her third and final night shift of the week, the routine was always the same- go home, crash until noon, then force herself to stay up until at least nine. It was the only way to reset her schedule without spiraling into a four day blackout. Miserable, but necessary. If she didn’t do it, the alternative was she’d sleep through the next four days and wake up just in time to go back to work.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, rubbed at her eyes, already irritated before she was fully conscious. The alarm was too loud, and she was mad at it for doing exactly what she told it to do. She slapped at her nightstand until her fingers found the screen, then tapped it into silence.</p><p> </p><p>After a long breath, she pushed the blankets off and swung her legs out of bed with another groan. She grabbed her phone without looking at it and trudged downstairs, fully prepared to start the day by resenting every second of it.</p><p> </p><p>In the kitchen, she leaned against the counter while the Keurig sputtered to life. The scent hit before the cup was halfway full- burnt, cheap, slightly metallic, like comfort wearing the wrong clothes. She didn’t even like it. But it was what she drank.</p><p> </p><p>She unlocked her phone and scanned the notifications.</p><p> </p><p>One missed spam call. A dozen new texts from the group chat. Two that weren’t.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda and Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha immediately opened the group chat first.</p><p> </p><p>Most of it was chaos- people confirming they’d be at 70s night, half finished inside jokes, photos from the last game night. Agatha scrolled, not expecting to care, until her thumb paused on a picture.</p><p> </p><p>It was her and Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Sage was mid victory dance, arms thrown up in a blur, popcorn suspended in the air around her like confetti. Agatha was laughing- head tilted back, eyes shut, mouth open in a way that made it clear she hadn’t seen the camera and wouldn’t have cared if she had.</p><p> </p><p>She looked happier in that photo than she had in a long time. Happier than any picture from Chicago.</p><p> </p><p>She saved the picture without thinking.</p><p> </p><p>The next photo was from blackjack. Jen must’ve taken it too. Agatha was staring down at her hand, fully focused, bottom lip caught lightly between her teeth. Beside her, Teen was mid eye roll, his chips stacked unevenly. Alice sat next to him mid reach, stealing chips from Teen’s stack. Sage was grinning at the end of the table, one foot on the ground with the other propped on the edge of the table, her cards already tossed. And Rio was in the corner of the frame, legs tucked to her chest, cards already down, both middle fingers lifted toward the camera.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spent years trying to replicate this photo- dinners in Chicago, couples’ trips, birthdays. The pictures always looked fine. Beautiful, even. But her posture told the truth. Just a little too careful. A little too aware of where the camera was.</p><p> </p><p>But here, Agatha wasn’t even smiling. She wasn’t performing. She was just in it.</p><p> </p><p>And somehow, that looked closer to joy than anything she’d ever been able to fake.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saved that photo too.</p><p> </p><p>As she scrolled, she saw someone had replied directly to the photo of her and Sage.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>xxx-xxx-xxxx: billy i hope this pisses you off so bad.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Sage. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha saved her contact information, and scrolled further.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Teen: i’m not jealous i just think it’s suspicious how sage only experiences joy when she’s stealing emotionally significant bonding moments between me and agatha.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Teen: fine. IT SHOULD’VE BEEN ME</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, swiped out of the group chat, and opened Wanda’s message first. Bad news before the good, she reasoned.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Wanda M.: I miss you. Call me later?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Yuck,” Agatha whispered, staring at Wanda’s message. She grabbed her coffee from where it had just finished brewing on the Keurig and took a sip, hoping it would scald the bad taste left in her mouth from her ex-wife’s text.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had a hunch that game night had already made its way to Instagram. Or Facebook. Or whatever Wanda platform still scrolled like her morning newspaper.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda was chronically online in the worst way. Every meal, every milestone, every moment worth bragging about ended up posted. Agatha couldn’t count the number of times she’d been forced to smile for pictures she hadn’t wanted to take, standing in front of things she hadn’t wanted to see.</p><p> </p><p>She opened her own Facebook app. It hadn’t been touched in years and looked it. Outdated profile picture. A graveyard of old comments she didn’t care to ever look at. She typed in Jen’s name and hit search.</p><p> </p><p>Jen had posted three photos. One of her and Agatha. The popcorn moment with Sage. And a full group picture that happened to include Rio being annoyingly photogenic.  All under a caption so nauseating it should’ve come with a warning label.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>The One Where The Covenless Witch Returns To Her Coven.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>We missed you!!!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>It was the gayest fucking thing Agatha had ever read.</p><p> </p><p>That was all Agatha needed to confirm what she already suspected- Wanda had seen the post. She always saw posts like that. </p><p> </p><p>Kale could’ve posted a blurry picture of Agatha’s elbow and Wanda still would’ve found it within minutes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know what Wanda wanted and didn’t care enough to wonder. Maybe it was jealousy. Maybe guilt. Maybe some twisted attempt to reassert control now that Agatha was- what? Laughing in public? Being in Rio’s general vicinity?</p><p> </p><p>More likely, Wanda had just assumed Agatha would be miserable without her.  Westview never fit into Wanda’s plan. Neither did anything resembling hapiness. And certainly not Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>When the divorce came up, they spoke mostly in terms of logistics. Wanda suggested Agatha should stay in Chicago. Claimed she seemed happier there.</p><p> </p><p>Happier doing what, exactly?</p><p> </p><p>Chicago had offered distraction. Polite conversations, a calendar full of shit that didn’t matter, and enough self restraint to keep from screaming in public.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha only knew two things for sure: Wanda despised Westview.</p><p> </p><p>And Wanda never once tolerated Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out why her ex-wife was suddenly reaching out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t spoken to her since that phone call where Wanda agreed too easily at the idea of them sleeping together again, then pretended to forget the name of the only person she’d ever truly resented.</p><p> </p><p>"I MiSs YoU. CalL mE lAtEr," Agatha mocked, flatly, to no one.</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t to check in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t reply to Wanda’s text. She wasn’t going to. Empty sentiment didn’t warrant a response.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t opened the app in years, hadn’t posted, liked, or reacted to anything. Her profile was a digital ghost town. But if there was even the slightest chance Wanda would see Agatha’s name pop up publicly -proof that Agatha was alive, present, and having a better time than she was supposed to- then yes. Agatha would log in. She would scroll. And she would leave a comment.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s thumbs hovered for a second, then typed the comment.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Happy to be home &lt;3</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her name floated to the top of the post, right where it needed to be.</p><p> </p><p>She slid out of the app, slid down her home screen, and tapped the notifications from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Rio: tried that. didn’t work.</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<em>Rio: was thinking a flare gun next time. maybe they’d notice that.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha read it once, then again. And despite everything, she laughed.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t even get a chance to think of a response before Wanda’s contact picture covered her entire screen.</p><p> </p><p>Calling Agatha. Not even five minutes after she commented on Jen’s post.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a groan, took a long sip of coffee, and stared at the phone while it rang. She made no move to answer. When it finally stopped, she set the mug down and finished responding to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Unfortunately, that was funny.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Another text pinged in immediately after- Wanda again.</p><p> </p><p>Because of course it was.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Wanda M.: I saw the post. You look good. Really. Just wanted to hear your voice.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha locked her phone. Set it face down on the counter.</p><p> </p><p>Then it pinged.</p><p> </p><p>Once.</p><p> </p><p>She stared at it for a second. Didn’t move. Didn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>Then she turned it over.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Rio: unfortunately… i’m funny.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it, jaw tight, already annoyed with herself for grinning.</p><p> </p><p>She locked the screen again.</p><p> </p><p>Unlocked it thirty seconds later.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She hit send and, without thinking, called Jen.</p><p> </p><p>It rang twice.</p><p> </p><p>“Harkness,” Jen said, voice flat.</p><p> </p><p>“Kale.”</p><p> </p><p>A pause.</p><p> </p><p>“What now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her elbows into the counter and dragged a hand over her face. “Apparently being visible online is a formal invitation for harassment-”</p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzed against her ear. She pulled it away to glance at the notification banner at the top of the screen.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda… Again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, then brought the phone back to her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s blowing up my fucking phone, Jennifer.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t pause before answering. “That’s not new. She pulled the same shit a decade ago.”</p><p> </p><p>“Did she?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Lie.</p><p> </p><p>A big, fat, obvious lie.</p><p> </p><p>Jen snorted. “Don’t bullshit me now, Harkness. You remember exactly what happened. If she so much as heard Rio might be somewhere near you, she’d blow up your phone until you came home.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together. She remembered. Of course she did.</p><p> </p><p>“I think that’s a bit of an exaggeration.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know why she said it. Maybe to cover the fact that she'd treated a parade of red flags like they were love letters.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha. She hated Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, it wasn’t-”</p><p> </p><p>“She said, and I quote, ‘That woman is an evil Skeletor and a very gross person to be around.’”</p><p> </p><p>Silence.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.” Agatha said, already smiling. “Not that I’m defending that, but she’d just watched Rio eat a hot wing, panic, snort milk through her nose, and watched said milk flow out of her mouth and into the kitchen sink.” Agatha paused and sighed, before quickly saying, “It was horrifying and I still think about it… Fondly.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s because it was fucking hilarious,” Jen said, in full defense. “And your ex was.. is....whatever... the biggest buzzkill I’ve ever met.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, “Okay, well. It’s not like anyone told me not to marry her.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t say anything right away. When she did, her voice was quieter. “We tried,” she said. “You just didn’t want to hear it unless it came from her.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Rio</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed and took a sharp inhale, narrowed her eyes at the toaster, “Jennifer…” she sang in a warning lullaby. “Keep talking like that and you’re gonna lose privileges.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said, mocking her song exactly. “The fact I haven’t yet after that last comment already says more than you think.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t argue. She didn’t even deflect.</p><p> </p><p>Jen exhaled, “Wow. So that’s still a thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rubbed at her forehead, eyes shut tight. “Maybe,” she muttered quietly. </p><p> </p><p>And that was the closest she’d come to telling the truth.</p><p> </p><p>“You still in denial?” Jen asked, tone lighter than the question deserved.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m in denial about a lot of things.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t push. Just pivoted.</p><p> </p><p>“Well… you could come over. I’ve got wine and you have terrible dating apps. We can judge strangers until it feels like therapy.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s one in the afternoon,” Agatha said flatly.</p><p> </p><p>“And?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed. “I’ll be there in twenty.”</p>

<p>They weren’t even through their second glass of wine, and Agatha was already buzzed enough to stop pretending she had any standards. Their wine glasses had been abandoned on the coffee table entirely forgotten. Agatha and Jen sat shoulder to shoulder, thumbs ruthless. They’d made it through seven strangers on Bumble. Their commentary vicious and their judgment was swift. </p><p> </p><p>Jen suddenly gasped.</p><p> </p><p>Loud. Dramatic. Enough to make Agatha’s stomach drop.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Of course. Of course. </em>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio fucking Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>Typically this was the part where Agatha would hurl her phone into the nearest trash can, or ideally, into another universe, before her rage even had a chance to finish blooming. But there was no rage this time. She didn’t know what she felt. Only that she couldn’t look away from her phone screen.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was staring straight into the camera, head tilted, cheek pressed to her hand. Her elbow rested on a white cube- table? Box? -something intentionally abstract, like it had been staged by someone who understood angles. The lighting was perfect. Too perfect.</p><p> </p><p>Her hair was messily arranged and it screamed effort disguised as accident. A thin gold chain traced the line of her collarbone. She wore black. Thin straps. Low neckline. Could’ve been a dress, could’ve been a tank top, and Agatha hated that she couldn’t tell. She wanted to know. She needed to know how much of Rio’s skin was just out of frame.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked fucking devastating.</p><p> </p><p>Unreasonably so.</p><p> </p><p>Like the photo had been engineered specifically to ruin Agatha Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>“Who took that?” was all Agatha could manage, barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Jen hesitated. “Me?” It came out more like a question than a confession.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head slowly, narrowing her eyes. Jen looked suddenly very interested in the ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Agatha said, licking her lips, drawing the pause out like she wasn’t trying at all. “Was she, uh... in a dress? Or was it, like, a tank top and jeans situation?” She even shrugged, casual as hell.</p><p> </p><p>The most casual question in the world… By Agatha’s standards, anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t see why that matters-”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha cut in, too fast. She cleared her throat and tried again, softer this time. “No. It doesn’t. I just... wanted to know. And since you were there, I think you should let me know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for her phone, still in Jen’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>Jen pulled it just out of reach. “Agatha.” Her tone dropped. A warning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, eyebrows raised in perfect innocence. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t buy it. “What are you going to do?” she asked, slowly, carefully, like she already regretted handing over her wine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at the screen again then shifted her gaze to the traitor sitting beside her. She sucked her teeth, loud enough to make Jen flinch.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha said, reaching out. “Just give me my phone back.”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Jen yanked it farther away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a breathy laugh, all disbelief. “Jen. Be serious. Give me my phone.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am being serious. You’re making that face you make before you do something that requires damage control.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not-” Agatha stopped herself. Then, grinning wide, too wide -more wolf than woman- she tilted her head. “Tank top or dress?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not helping your case,” Jen hissed.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Alright. Fuck it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Give me the phone, Jen!” Agatha shouted and launched.</p><p> </p><p>“NO!” Jen shrieked, halfway to scrambling off the couch when Agatha tackled her. They crashed to the floor in a tangle of limbs and shrieking laughter and very real threats.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” Jen gasped, utterly betrayed, halfway pinned.</p><p> </p><p>“Give me my fucking phone!” Agatha growled through clenched teeth, wrestling.</p><p> </p><p>“No! This is why I don’t invite you over for wine anymore!” Jen shouted, twisting as Agatha climbed over her. “You get horny and scary and you make terrible decisions!”</p><p> </p><p>“You literally gave me the wine!” Agatha shouted back, lunging again.</p><p> </p><p>“I was trying to be nice!” Jen screeched.</p><p> </p><p>In the mess of limbs and shouting, Agatha somehow managed to knock her phone loose. It slid across the floor out of Jen’s reach. She threw her weight forward, pinning Jen down with her knees bracketing her sides. She grabbed two fistfuls of Jen’s shirt and shook.</p><p> </p><p>“TANK TOP OR DRESS?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s eyes went wide, arms flailing uselessly. “Dress! It was a dress! Jesus, get off me!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha instantly loosened her grip, all menace evaporating into smug satisfaction. “Huh?” she breathed. “See? That wasn’t so hard, was it, Jenny?”</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in and planted a loud, obnoxiously wet kiss on Jen’s cheek then scrambled off her, making a break for her phone.</p><p> </p><p>Jen grabbed for her legs. She almost got Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Almost.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went down hard -elbows first, a short, ugly fall- but didn’t let it stop her. She hit the floor and kept moving, crawling the last few feet because she was a woman on a mission. Her fingers closed around the phone, flipped it over, screen up. She swiped right on Rio’s profile without a moment of hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>A cheerful chime sounded.</p><p> </p><p><b>YOU MATCHED!</b> lit up the top of the screen in big, celebratory letters.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath came in short, uneven bursts, her grin stretched wide and wild as she shoved the phone inches from Jen’s face. “A-ha! Look at that- it’s a match!”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t even flinch. “Okay? And?” she snapped, swatting the phone away. “You literally said you just wanted to be friends with her when you got here. Only friends, Agatha. How is this helping that?”</p><p> </p><p>Okay, so maybe Agatha <em> had </em> said that.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe, when she first got there, wine still uncorked and self control fully intact, she did tell Jen she wanted to try being friends with Rio again. That was all. And if anything was going to happen between them, it would only be friendship.</p><p> </p><p>Completely standard. Deeply adult. Uncomplicated platonic friendship.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just... hadn’t expected to see her face. Not like that. Not staring into the camera like she'd been waiting for Agatha to find her. Like the whole profile had been made just to get under her skin. Which, obviously, it hadn’t. <em> Obviously </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Which was so much worse. Because it wasn’t bait. It wasn’t a challenge. It was just Rio on a stupid fucking dating app.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha wasn’t above taking that personally.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well… friends can match! It’s fine. It’s friendly matching.”</p><p> </p><p>And there it was again- the Nile, in all its slow, inevitable glory. Still Agatha’s favorite vacation spot, apparently.</p><p> </p><p>In Agatha’s defense -because someone had to defend her, and it sure as hell wasn’t going to be Jen- she had also mentioned, on the phone earlier, that she was in denial about a lot of things. That wasn’t a secret. It was a disclaimer. A legal warning, if you will.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha,” Jen said, flat on her back, staring up at her in disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha snapped. “I’m not going to message her. I just needed to know if she swiped right. That’s all. It’s perfectly reasonable.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen looked unconvinced.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept going. “And she did. So now I know. It’s not weird. It’s not anything. It’s just... confirmation.”</p><p> </p><p>“Confirmation,” Jen repeated, deadpan.</p><p> </p><p>“That we can be friends,” Agatha clarified.</p><p> </p><p>Jen gawked at her. “So let me get this right. You needed to match with your ex-... not-ex… almost… whatever the fuck <em> that </em>situation is- to confirm that being just friends is on the table?”</p><p> </p><p>“Bingo, Jennifer.” Agatha pointed at Jen, triumphant. “See? You’re catching on.”</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t make any sense!” Jen snapped, her arms flailing like she was trying to physically beat Agatha’s logic out of the air.</p><p> </p><p>“It does if you’re a student of platonic dynamics.” Agatha fired back, dead serious.</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell happened?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned fast. Alice stood in the entryway, wide eyed and frozen. Jen was already sitting up beside her, rubbing her ribs, blinking at the mess like she wasn’t entirely sure how they got there.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha barely registered either of them. Just sat there, wild haired and wide eyed, trying not to betray the very obvious fact that she had completely lost control of the situation.</p><p> </p><p>Because standing just behind Alice was Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped. Her mind blanked. Her heart was now sitting firmly in her ass. All the air she thought she’d been breathing was ripped from her lungs on sight.</p><p> </p><p>And then Agatha’s brain started defending itself.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t swiped because she cared. Obviously. She swiped because she was curious. And curiosity didn’t mean interest, it meant stability. That she could look the past in the eye and walk away from it. She just needed to know if Rio had swiped too. That was it. Nothing dramatic. Nothing romantic. Just proof they were both adults. That the door was shut. That it had always been shut. That they were... whatever.</p><p> </p><p>Fine. Friends. Colleagues.</p><p> </p><p>And if Rio had swiped first? That meant she was the one hanging on, not Agatha. If it was mutual, then it didn’t count. It canceled itself out. It proved the opposite of what it looked like. It was math.</p><p> </p><p>So, no- Agatha didn’t regret it. She was gathering evidence. Scientific. Reasonable. Completely detached.</p><p> </p><p>Until said evidence showed up in the doorway.</p><p> </p><p>Now the living room looked like a crime scene. Jen was holding her side. Alice was still blinking at the mess. Wine pooled beneath the table. Agatha hadn’t even realized her sweatshirt had slipped halfway off her shoulder. She looked feral.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio was just standing there. Quiet. Watching.</p><p> </p><p>She scanned Rio instinctively. No phone in hand. No screen. No proof she’d seen it.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Good. Small miracles. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agnes is what happened,” Jen announced, far too pleased with herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jabbed a finger in her direction. “I told you to stop calling me that.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agnes O’Conor.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had nothing kind to say about her. She hated that woman with a fucking passion.</p><p> </p><p>Fourteen years ago, after several regrettable glasses of boxed wine, Jen, Alice, and Rio had named the monster that crawled out when Agatha tipped past her third glass.</p><p> </p><p>Jen wasn’t wrong, though. Wine, any kind of wine, turned Agatha into a terrifying, unhinged gremlin of a person. Horny, reckless, emotionally dangerous. Agnes had no filter, no self preservation instinct, and an alarming tendency to drag Agatha’s worst secrets into the light just to watch them burn.</p><p> </p><p>Yeah. Agnes had made an appearance today. But right now, Agatha was painfully sober.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked back at Rio, who had tucked her hands into the back pockets of her jeans and was rocking absently on the balls of her feet. Her lips were pulled into her mouth, either to hide a grin or to trap whatever stupid question she was dying to ask that would absolutely, without fail, piss Agatha off.</p><p> </p><p>Possibly both.</p><p> </p><p>Alice let out a low whistle. “Hurricane Agnes makes landfall.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look away from Rio. “Don’t,” she warned, already seeing the gears turning behind Rio’s eyes. “Whatever you’re about to say, swallow it. Along with your pride, your smugness, and preferably yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised her hands in mock surrender, lips twitching but silent.</p><p> </p><p>That counted as a win.</p><p> </p><p>So of course Rio had to ruin it by stepping back, stretching her arms overhead like she had nowhere better to be, and casually announced, “I, uh… I think I’m gonna step out for a smoke.”</p><p> </p><p>The second the door clicked, Agatha shot to her feet. “Are you fucking kidding me, Alice?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice shrugged. “What? The Liberty play at four.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She followed Rio out the door before she could think better of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweet. Nothing I love more than scrubbing Merlot out of a rug!” Jen called out after her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had no plan. She didn’t know what she came out here to do. Damage control? Maybe. That would’ve required forethought, which wasn’t exactly her strong suit today.</p><p> </p><p>She turned the corner of the house and there was Rio. Leaning against the brick, one foot kicked up behind her, cigarette burning steady between her fingers. Both hands held her phone too close to her face. Her expression was still, it meant she was reading something twice to make sure it was real.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t need to ask what it was. She already knew.</p><p> </p><p>Somehow, this felt worse than if Rio had been laughing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio startled, just barely but it was there. She stuck the cigarette between her lips and she fumbled with her phone, shoving it into her back pocket with all the grace of someone pretending it hadn’t been the most interesting thing in the world thirty seconds ago.</p><p> </p><p>She took a slow drag from her cigarette, eyes forward now, like Agatha hadn’t just caught her seeing exactly what she came out here to deny.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t call her on it.</p><p> </p><p>She walked up instead and nodded toward the cigarette between Rio’s fingers. “Can I bum one?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio eyed her for a second, then pulled the pack from her pocket and tapped one loose without a word. She passed it over, cigarette still balanced between her own lips, eyes already moving somewhere else as she shoved the pack away again.</p><p> </p><p>“Thought you were too good for Spirits now?” Rio muttered around the cigarette, then reached up and pulled it free.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “A light?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio reached into her front pocket and pulled out a lighter. She sparked the flame without looking at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in and stopped.</p><p> </p><p>It was small. Purple metal. Still carried that soft shine underneath the years of being carried, dropped, and used. And on the side, scratched faint but permanent: <em>A.H. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t seen it in over a decade. But Rio had held onto it. Protected it, maybe. Or just refused to let it go. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes narrowed in on Rio, who was suddenly interested in everything but Agatha. She drew back from the flame, took the first drag, and tried to focus on the burn in her lungs instead of what keeping something like that for so long meant.</p><p> </p><p>It didn't help.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t touched an American Spirit in ten years, and now every part of it felt like Rio- the paper, the pull, the way it sat heavy in her chest like it belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>It was years of watching Rio light one without thinking. The way she would lean out of a window like she owned the sky. The way the scent would cling to her hoodie for days. It would be in the sleeves Agatha would borrow, in the collar she’d adjust without meaning to, in the room long after Rio had gone.</p><p> </p><p>There was a time when Agatha told herself she hated it. The smell. The mess. The presence it left behind. But that had always been a lie. What she hated was how much of Rio lingered- how even absence could feel that fucking loud.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, smoke curling over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“You still carry that thing around?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pocketed the lighter like there was a risk Agatha might ask for it back if she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>“You left it at my place.” Rio shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ignored the way it made her feel. It didn’t matter. Not when there were more pressing matters at hand- like Agatha’s most mortifying decision to date that was currently tucked into Rio’s back pocket.</p><p> </p><p>“We gonna pretend you were checking the weather, or are we finally gonna talk about the second elephant in the room?” Agatha tipped her chin toward the mascot stamped across Rio’s shirt - Ellie the Elephant, smiling too fucking wide.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth pulled into a slow smirk. She brought the cigarette to her lips, took her time, exhaled smoke through her teeth. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p> </p><p>Of course she didn’t. Rio would rather chew rocks than make anything easy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “What were you looking at?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio flicked her eyes over Agatha, still smirking. “Why do you care, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p><em> Agatha </em>.</p><p> </p><p>The way Rio said it had every part of Agatha’s traitorous brain dropped to its knees and begged for more. Heat shot down her spine and she hated herself so much she could almost see stars. She locked her jaw so she wouldn’t do something fucking humiliating, like tell Rio to say her name again - slower this time, closer this time. Instead, Agatha breathed through her nose and glared, holding on to her last shred of dignity with bloody nails.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t care,” Agatha said, too fast and far too loud. She shoved a hand through her hair, scraping her scalp. “Why would I? It’s your phone. You could’ve been checking the weather, Googling how to fake your own death, swiping right on every brunette in Jersey- I’d sleep like a baby.” She shrugged. “Honestly, I hope you were. Wouldn’t want you getting the wrong idea.” She smiled, quick and mean. “But I couldn’t care less.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio watched her, smiling now. She nodded, easy, unbothered, handing Agatha the rope and daring her to hang herself with it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a slow drag from her cigarette, eyes fixed on the pavement. “Look,” she said, “I’m not trying to make this weird.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tipped her head, already amused. “You’re doing a phenomenal job.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped the cigarette, crushed it under her heel, crossed her arms tight. “I think we should be friends again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. Something flickered across her face. She looked away, gave a low huff of a laugh, and when she turned back, whatever it was had been tucked neatly out of sight.</p><p> </p><p>“You told me to back off,” Rio reminded Agatha calmly.</p><p> </p><p>She snapped her head to Rio, her mouth already moving. “Well, you didn’t exactly fight it.” She blew out a breath, tried to scrape together whatever chill she had left, and kept going. “I don’t want to keep doing this. I’m tired of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tired of what?”</p><p> </p><p><em> Stupid question </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scowled at Rio. “Of seeing you every day and pretending you’re a stranger. You were my best friend. You don’t get to just-“ She broke off, biting it back, swallowing it down. “The last decade, the last five months… it was stupid. I hated it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I get it,” Rio said quietly. “I hated it too.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good. Because it’d be weird otherwise.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her eyebrows. “It’s already weird.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed. “You’re not helping.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just setting realistic expectations.” Rio took a drag of her cigarette, looking smug. “You know. As your very platonic friend.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced a breath through her nose.</p><p> </p><p><em> Platonic </em>.</p><p> </p><p>That word still had teeth. All these years later, it could still sink in, still tear at the places she thought had hardened over.</p><p> </p><p>That was what they had always been. Perfectly platonic, painfully careful. Two cowards orbiting the same fire, pretending they couldn’t feel the heat. They’d become experts at it because it was easier than wrecking the only thing they had ever gotten right.</p><p> </p><p>And still, even playing it safe, they found a way to lose each other.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean it,” Agatha snapped. “No weirdness. No… tension. None of the old bullshit.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, studying her. “You want to be friends again?” She said slowly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened.</p><p> </p><p>Friends were safe. Friends were manageable.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held Rio’s gaze, refusing to flinch. “I want you back in my life.”</p><p> </p><p>“Friends, then.” Rio’s mouth pulled into a wide grin, flashing that familiar gap between her teeth. Agatha ignored the way her chest tightened at the sight.</p><p> </p><p>“Friends,” Agatha echoed, the oldest lie she knew by heart.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Sinner, you better get ready. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio: are you coming to The Road for 70s night </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the text. Jen and Alice had been quite annoying about it the last few days. Said the bar missed her. Said it wasn’t the same without her. And clearly it had worked, because she was currently standing in her bathroom, getting ready anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Theme nights used to be her thing. She crushed them, every time- costumes, energy, all of it. Of course, it was never Wanda’s scene. Her ex-wife liked velvet ropes and overpriced cocktails and any place that had a dress code longer than the menu. Agatha used to pretend she didn’t miss the dive bars and the chaos that came with it. Agatha wasn’t in Chicago anymore. She didn’t have to pretend.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha typed out a quick reply.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Maybe. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She and Rio had been doing the friend thing for a whole two days now, which mostly meant not making it weird. After their talk on Monday, Rio had asked if she wanted to stick around and watch the basketball game with her and Alice and Jen. Agatha said yes. It went… well. They kept to opposite corners of the couch, traded jokes, let it be easy. It was nice. It was normal. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized she missed until it was handed back to her, smaller than before, but still warm in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>She shoved her phone aside, screen down, and leaned back toward the mirror to finish her makeup.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha strolled into the bar, Alice and Jen trailing behind her in their seventies best. The place was already alive, disco balls spinning from the ceiling and throwing fractured light across the walls. ABBA blasted from the speakers. </p><p> </p><p>Clusters of people were packed around the bar. Yelena, Billy, a few faces she half recognized from the hospital. Glitter and sequins everywhere. No one half assed it tonight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t any waste time. She made straight to the bar, boots tapping against the floor, her sheer black cape trailing behind her. Her sleeveless blazer hung open down the front, nothing underneath, the gold embroidery glinting every time the lights spun overhead. Her gold sequined pants caught the glow of the disco ball, flashing with every step. Fingerless mesh gloves and a decorated headband tied around her forehead finished her look.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t bother scanning the room. She already knew. Agatha felt it the second she walked in, the burn dragging across her body. Those brown eyes always managed to find Agatha first.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Some things never change. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled to herself and kept moving toward the bar without missing a step.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha! You look amazing!” Billy shouted from his stool, practically vibrating with excitement.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” she said, giving him a quick once-over. He was drowning in a massive, fluffy blue jacket that looked like it belonged on a parade float. “You look… warm.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why, thank you,” he said brightly, smoothing a hand down the front of his buttoned up shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flagged down the bartender without missing a beat and ordered a whiskey, neat. </p><p> </p><p>She turned and leaned back against the bar, one elbow resting behind her, waiting for her drink. Agatha immediately found the brown eyes she had felt burning into her since the second she walked through the fucking door. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was standing at a high top table with Rebecca, Sage, and now Alice. Her gaze dragged down the line of Agatha’s body lingering on every inch of exposed skin. Her mouth was parted, chest rising under the sheer black fabric, hand curling uselessly around her beer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back a little more against the bar, let the lights catch the gold on her hips, let Rio look for as long as she wanted. She didn’t see any harm in letting Rio stare. They were friends.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was dressed in a sheer black jumpsuit, the fabric clinging tight to her frame. The neckline plunged deep down her chest. Gold and silver diamonds in the shapes of flowers spiraled over the entire body suit, glittering in the scattered lights. A matching hood was pulled up over her hair.</p><p> </p><p>The clink of glass against the bar top pulled Agatha back. She dragged her gaze away and turned, just as the bartender slid her drink across the counter toward her.</p><p> </p><p>“Want to start a tab?” he asked, already reaching for the register.</p><p> </p><p>“Put it on mine, Max!” An unfamiliar voice came from somewhere to Agatha’s left.</p><p> </p><p>Max gave a quick nod and moved down the bar.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head and found a blonde woman sitting on the next stool over. Definitely not someone she recognized. Attractive. Dressed head to toe in full seventies flair- suede vest, flared pants, the whole deal.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dragged her drink closer, unbothered. She was single now, and she sure as hell wasn’t in the business of turning down free whiskey.</p><p> </p><p>“You work at the hospital?” the woman asked, twirling the straw around her glass.</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha smiled and plucked the tiny stir stick from her own drink, biting down lightly on the end. “You?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nah,” the woman said, smiling back at her. “Rebecca dragged me out. I’m a sucker for a good theme night.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her eyes drift over the woman’s suede vest again, then flicked them back up to meet her gaze. “Clearly.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman laughed and shifted closer, casual enough to pass for friendly if anyone was watching but not subtle enough to miss.</p><p> </p><p>“Making new friends without me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head, and found Rio standing there, hood pushed down around her shoulders, her hair pulled back into a low bun. A pink flower was tucked into it. Her gaze flicked once to the blonde, before settling back on Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Something about the way Rio had looked caught Agatha off guard- her eyes darker than usual, jaw clenched just slightly like she was holding something back.</p><p> </p><p>It stole the breath from Agatha’s lungs and left her stomach lurching in a way that felt both familiar and entirely new.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could open her mouth to respond, Rio reached out and wrapped her fingers loosely around her wrist, tugging Agatha gently.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” Rio said, her voice easy. “You’re wasting your time down here. Drinks are better at the other end.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could have stayed. She could have shrugged off the hand on her wrist, offered some excuse, reclaimed her drink, and let the woman at the bar keep flirting. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, she let Rio pull her away, pretending it didn’t mean anything. Pretending she hadn’t seen that look before, a thousand times, and known better than to call it anything. A look that Rio always held at a distance. A look that never asked, never offered. Only lingered until it faded.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught a last glimpse of her drink sitting on the bar where she hadn’t realized she left it, forgotten. The woman Agatha had been talking to was still there, turned slightly, eyes following them through the crowd with a look Agatha couldn’t quite interpret and didn’t try to.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Agatha wasn’t sure who she had walked away from, only that she hadn’t hesitated.</p><p> </p><p>It was pathetic, really- how easily she left. How little it took. No resistance, no second thought. Just a hand at Agatha’s wrist and whatever instinct that lived in her bones, telling her to follow Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned forward again and kept walking. And as she walked, she swallowed the humiliating truth that it would have taken just as little ten years ago.</p><p> </p><p>The noise of the bar washed over them, people shifting around them, and Agatha let it, let it distract her from the fact that nothing about this felt normal, not even close.</p><p> </p><p>They were halfway to the other end when she felt Rio’s hand sliding down from her wrist, slipping into her palm, and tangling their fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked once, kept walking, kept pretending she understood what was happening even though every part of her brain was stuck on the feeling of their hands linked together.</p><p> </p><p>When they reached the far end, Rio finally let go, the absence almost worse than the touch. She barely had time to gather herself before Rio flagged down the same bartender who had served Agatha earlier and tapped two fingers lightly against the counter.</p><p> </p><p>“Another whiskey, neat,” Rio said, then added, “and a Dos Equis.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed because- <em> seriously, what the fuck just happened? </em></p><p> </p><p>The bartender looked up. “You want it dressed?”</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t ask about the drink Agatha had left behind at the other end, still sweating on the bar having been abandoned mid conversation.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes- wait. No. No I- just no.” The words came tumbling out of Rio's mouth.</p><p> </p><p>The bartender nodded and turned away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing, but her eyes flicked toward Rio. </p><p> </p><p>She knew what that had been. A half step forward. A reach. An attempt. </p><p> </p><p>No matter what, Rio never ordered her beers dressed. She actually preferred it that way, but Rio hated how the salt and lime juice made the bottle sticky, which made her hands sticky, which meant the salt stuck to her lips. It was a whole chain reaction she refused to deal with.</p><p> </p><p>So Rio avoided it. Every time.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t about preference. It was about control. Quiet, specific, and impossible not to notice once you knew her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha for a second before she looked away and wiped her palms against her thighs, like the idea of a dressed beer bottle had already started to cling to her hands. Agatha caught the way she bit the inside of her cheek, trying not to look embarrassed at the fact that at her grown age Rio should have outgrown the inability to tolerate something as small as a sticky drink.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha had never cared about Rio’s quirks. Not the hand wiping. Not the need to keep things clean, even if it meant stripping the pleasure out of something she otherwise enjoyed. If anything, Agatha had always understood it. They made sense in a way most things didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>It was just a maddening fucking coincidence that it happened to reflect a much bigger, far more frustrating pattern of Rio's that Agatha still hadn’t entirely made peace with.</p><p> </p><p>The bartender slid their drinks across the bar, which gave Agatha just enough time to pretend she wasn’t on the verge of picking apart the way Rio had almost ordered her beer dressed, then bailed on it at the last second. She didn’t think about how Rio had clearly been trying to prove something again, or how pissed off and embarrassed Rio looked at herself when she couldn’t follow through.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for her glass with one hand, thoughtlessly, then she felt the faintest touch at her other wrist hanging loosely at her side. A single finger, light and careful. Agatha froze for half a second to make sure she wasn’t imagining it.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s touch was enough to be dismissed as incidental, but also lingered long enough to ask.</p><p> </p><p>This was fine. Completely fine. Friends held hands. That was normal. Probably even healthy. Certainly more normal than being cockblocked by said friend in a bar. This, at least, had plausible deniability. </p><p> </p><p>So, for the second time that night, Agatha allowed Rio to take it, offering the smallest twitch of her wrist as her answer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabbed her beer off the bar, then took Agatha’s hand, lacing their fingers together. With their drinks in hand, Rio led them back toward the high top where she’d been sitting before. Sage was still there, sipping her beer, but now the table had filled- Jen, Alice, and Teen had joined.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her hand slip from Rio’s just before they reached the table. She didn’t need anyone asking questions she technically had answers to but didn’t feel like saying out loud. They were friends. Friends who, completely incidentally, had held hands twice in one night, only two days into deciding that they were friends again. It wasn’t complicated unless someone -specifically Agatha's very lovely friend,  Jen- decided to make it complicated. Jen didn’t understand what it meant to reconnect with someone after ten years. She didn’t get that this was normal. Hand holding was friendly. Familiarity was not a crime. And Agatha was absolutely not being delusional about this.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped into the empty seat beside Rio just as Billy launched into full dramatics, attempting to shove Sage out of the chair she was already sitting in to Agatha’s left.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” he whined. “You got her at game night. It’s my turn.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t argue. She rolled her eyes and circled the high top, grabbing her beer on the way. She climbed into the chair Billy had been in, one leg settling underneath her as she leaned forward and rested her elbows on the table.  At some point, Alice had handed over her rose colored sunglasses because now they rested on Sage’s face.</p><p> </p><p>It was loud. Not just music loud, but crowded table loud. Jokes overlapped, drink orders were shouted over shoulders, and laughter came in snorts, wheezes, and full body cackles that no one bothered to contain. Teen would not stop talking. Sage kept interrupting him just often enough to tangle the details in his own story, which, bless her, left Agatha free to lean toward Rio with a grin already forming. </p><p> </p><p>They swapped comments, half teases, and dumb observations that got funnier the longer they spiraled. At one point, Rio nearly choked on her beer. At another, Agatha had to grip the edge of the table to keep from doubling over. Across the table, Alice and Jen had fully committed to singing Dancing Queen directly at each other, painfully off key and with way too much eye contact, like they were performing a duet at gunpoint. It was a mess. A perfect one.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, Rio and Sage were shouting at each other from across the table about whether or not it was acceptable to send transport for a patient at three in the morning for a non-stat spine x-ray.</p><p> </p><p>“No one wants to be dragged out of bed for a routine spine at 3am,” Sage snapped, clearly appalled that this needed to be explained.</p><p> </p><p>Rio went right back at her. “If the order’s in, I’m sending for it. I’m not ignoring it just because everyone’s tired.”</p><p> </p><p>That should have been it.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Then kept blinking as the volume climbed. They were interrupting each other, adding new points, dragging in unrelated grievances from god knows when.</p><p> </p><p>Sage leaned in, halfway to launching herself over the table. Rio cracked her knuckles and waved Sage forward like she was welcoming the fight.</p><p> </p><p>They fought like sisters. That was the only way Agatha could make sense of it. Not polite or performative, just loud and comfortable and completely without boundaries. Probably the result of too many night shifts stacked side by side, too many shared patients, too many weekends where no one else showed up. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Jen still bickered the same way. Still found each other in the middle of a shift to complain, still argued over protocol... or a Bumble match just to pass the time.</p><p> </p><p>No one else reacted. Jen took another sip of her drink. Alice and Billy were still wrapped up in whatever nonsense they’d been talking about for the past twenty minutes. </p><p> </p><p>Once it was clear no one else was bothered, Agatha stopped trying to make sense of it. Apparently, this behavior was just part of the atmosphere.</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, it was kind of impressive.</p><p> </p><p>And it was easily the funniest thing Agatha had seen all night.</p><p> </p><p>So when there was barely a breath between points, Agatha leaned in and calmly said, “I mean… Sage has a point.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t care. She didn’t even know what they were really arguing about anymore. But the way Rio’s head snapped toward her- eyes wide, mouth slightly open, genuinely offended? That made it worth it.</p><p> </p><p>So worth it, Agatha had to purse her lips and stare down at the nearly finished whiskey in her hand, still resting on the table, just to keep from laughing.</p><p> </p><p>That was when Yelena Belova walked up and stopped in front of their table, directly in front of Sage, and stared at her.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone at the table went quiet. Not gradually- instantly. Whatever conversation Billy had been loudly butchering cut off with a weird little choking noise. Jen froze with her glass hovering halfway to her lips, and Alice stopped drumming her fingers against the table and actually turned in her seat and grinned.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had no idea why everyone at the table was suddenly acting like a bomb had landed in Sage’s lap.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena didn’t greet anyone. Didn’t glance at the others. Just stared at Sage and said, flatly, in that thick, unimpressed accent, “You always look like you’re about to say something stupid.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage blinked and straightened in her seat. “Hello to you too,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena stood there a moment longer, eyes fixed on Sage. </p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t squirm.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena gave the faintest tilt of her head and said, “Buy me a drink.” She immediately turned away and walked off without waiting for a reply.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched Sage track her through the crowd, eyes getting wider the further Yelena disappeared.  She didn’t blink. Didn’t breathe. Just stared like she’d witnessed the heavens part.</p><p> </p><p>Then, suddenly, Sage launched to her feet- balancing on the foot rest of her high top chair and shouted, “HELLLLL YEAH!”</p><p> </p><p>The table exploded. Jen screamed into her glass. Alice whooped and slammed her hands on the table while Teen joined, laughing so hard he nearly fell out of his chair. Even Rio clapped.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt Rio lean in close. She turned her head just as Rio murmured near her ear, grinning. “Let me introduce you to the longest, saddest slow burn I’ve ever witnessed. She starts to foam at the mouth anytime Yelena’s in a five foot radius.”</p><p> </p><p>That’s fucking rich coming from Rio of all people, but Agatha doesn’t say that. Thankfully, Sage cuts in before she has to bite her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Sage dropped back into her seat and shot Rio a look as she reached for her beer. “Yeah. I have fucking eyes. She’s hot, she’s mean to me, and I’ve been trying very hard to get into her pants for the last two years.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice didn’t even look up, just raised her drink and said, “That’s only the second most tragic thing I’ve ever heard.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Agatha shot matching glares across the table at Alice, who raised both hands in surrender, a smirk tugging at her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“She says that with love,” Jen offered, tipping back her drink. “We’ve all been forced to watch a shit show go down like this twice.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t laugh. She reached for her glass, fingers brushing the rim but not lifting it. Rio shifted beside her, barely, but Agatha felt it.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t look at each other, but the silence said enough. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a swig of her whiskey as Rio let out a breath through her nose and leaned in again, voice low, just for Agatha. “By ‘get into her pants,’ Sage means loiter until Yelena tells her to shut up and go walk into traffic.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted into her drink. “So that was flirting?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s foreplay, sweetheart. Don’t act surprised.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned toward her, and Rio didn’t move. She was closer than she needed to be. Her thigh brushed against Agatha’s under the table, not by accident.</p><p> </p><p>That smile was still there, but it wasn’t bait. It was quiet, steady, and so familiar it made Agatha’s chest tighten. There was nothing flippant in it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look away. Her fingers were still curled loosely around her glass, but she could feel the warmth radiating from where Rio’s arm hovered just near hers.</p><p> </p><p>Sage promptly ripped Agatha out of her half second of pining. “She just told me to buy her a drink,” Sage announced, pointing after Yelena with her beer. “That’s new. That’s progress.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ripped her eyes away from Rio’s brown and cleared her throat, shaking her head hoping that it might reset her pulse.</p><p> </p><p>Sage took a long sip to finish what was left of her beer, thudded the bottle back onto the table, and stood abruptly. “Now, if you don’t mind, I will be happily spending the rest of the night being bullied by a hot blonde with a sexy accent.”</p><p> </p><p>Already halfway into the crowd, Sage called back, “If I don’t make it back alive, just know I died doing what I loved.”</p><p> </p><p>“Finally,” Teen muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Alice leaned back with a sigh. “God, I hope she gets laid.”</p><p> </p><p>“Assuming she survives,” Jen added.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to come with me to the bar? Get another round?” Rio asked, quietly to Agatha.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nodded and stood. Rio followed and moved to step in front of Agatha. She drifted backward into the crowd, walking in reverse, hand outstretched and a grin pulling at her lips.</p><p> </p><p> Agatha looked at Rio, unimpressed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wiggled her fingers, coaxing. “Come on. Wouldn’t want my friend getting lost in this massive crowd.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave Rio another dry look and pushed past her without answering. But as she passed, she caught Rio’s wrist and pulled her along, weaving them both through the flood of bodies until they reached the bar.</p><p> </p><p>They stood shoulder to shoulder, music pulsing through the room, waiting as the bartender worked his way down the line. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha noticed the slight tightness in Rio’s jaw when she notice Rio's gaze flicked over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Curious, Agatha turned and immediately spotted the woman who had flirted with her earlier, leaning casually against the bar, watching them with faint amusement. The same woman Rio had effortlessly cut off from Agatha the first time.</p><p> </p><p>“Rebecca’s friend is incredibly boring, by the way. Extremely unlikable. A real snooze fest,” Rio said, eyes still on the woman.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her lip, turning back to find Rio looking genuinely offended on her behalf as a matter of principle. Agatha narrowed her eyes, though the smile tugging at her mouth was already betraying her.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh really?” Agatha said, arching a brow. “Well, I wouldn’t know. Someone very irritating pulled me away before I could form an opinion.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio's tongue was pressed firmly into her cheek, “Take my word for it.” Then she threw her head back and groaned into the air, “She is laaaame!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but Rio leaned in just slightly, grinning. “Come on. You should be thanking me- I did you a favor.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a loud and genuine laugh. “You cockblocked me, you asshole!”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” Rio hollered, cupping a hand to her ear like an old man. “Didn’t quite catch that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her for a second. She could feel the edge of her own tongue pressing against the inside of her bottom lip, holding there, thinking too hard about something Agatha shouldn’t want.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still grinning at her, still standing there like a dumbass, showing off that pathetic gap in her teeth that Agatha hated that she fucking loved. And suddenly, Agatha-</p><p> </p><p>Well, Agatha wasn’t in the mood to be good.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Goddamn it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Agatha could play a little. They were friends. And the Road- well, the Road could be Switzerland tonight. Friendship Switzerland. No rules. No consequences.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in, close enough for her mouth to brush the shell of Rio’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand immediately found the small of Agatha’s back, fingers sliding into place like they belonged there. She tugged Agatha closer, until her front was flush against Rio's side.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled. Her breath hitched on the way out.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t push it,” Agatha murmured, lips brushing against Rio’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to look at Agatha. Her brown eyes were low, unfocused for a second, and she gave a few small nods- like she was trying to get ahead of whatever was building inside her. Agatha could feel it humming off of Rio, barely contained.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio looked back up, her gaze had shifted. Darker now. Focused.</p><p> </p><p>“Push what?” Rio whispered, voice soft and almost sweet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha never wanted to hear anything that wasn’t said exactly like that again.</p><p> </p><p>Her own personal Switzerland- a nation founded on denial, pretending things didn’t matter, and quite literally the loosest interpretation of friendship imaginable.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha’s Switzerland? It didn’t recognize war crimes.</p><p> </p><p>“You cockblocked me?” Agatha asked, breath catching halfway through the words. And yes- it was a question. A real one.</p><p> </p><p>All Agatha could hear in her head was the sound of her own irritating voice, chanting:</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Say it. Admit it. Tell me you were jealous. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, not smug this time. Not shit eating. It was big, wide, genuine, and it hit Agatha like a surge of current, live wires sinking through her chest, tearing down her ribs and soaring straight into her gut.</p><p> </p><p>Seventeen seconds ago, Rio’s body had been radiating pure, unfiltered filth. This? This was worse.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. I did.”</p><p> </p><p>And in Agatha’s mind, the most obscene moan tore through her like a fucking church bell- high, sharp, and all song. She swallowed it down, hard, forced a hum, narrowed her eyes, tried to look uncertain. Agatha tried, <em> desperately</em>, to look like she absolutely wasn’t five seconds from blowing up seventeen years of discipline just to chase Rio's smile with her own.</p><p> </p><p>The most humiliating part? Agatha wasn’t even drunk. Neither of them were. They were both still nursing the same drink they’d each gotten together earlier, waiting at the bar to order another.</p><p> </p><p>There was no blur, no excuse. Just Agatha's own heart, loud and traitorous, the same goddamn thing that had always clawed and screamed for Rio like it didn’t know better. Always pulled toward her. Always made Agatha angle her body just enough to hide the way it wanted more.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Seventeen years. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The number scraped down the inside of her skull like a dare.</p><p> </p><p>It whispered, ‘<em> haven’t you waited long enough?’ </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed Rio to keep talking. Because she wouldn’t ask. She refused to beg.</p><p> </p><p>There was still time for Rio to pull back, and Agatha knew it- could feel the possibility of it vibrating in her bones.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha did what she always did. Handed over  the exact opposite of what she meant to the universe, like it was a trade. Like if Agatha pretended hard enough not to want it, just this once, maybe it wouldn’t be taken away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still looking at her like there was nothing in the world worth hiding from.</p><p> </p><p>That made Agatha's stomach drop.</p><p> </p><p>The longer Rio chose not say anything, Agatha's heart had felt it had screamed loud enough to be heard, it was losing its voice. It had clawed too hard, too fast, and it didn’t know what to do with the light it found. It flinched from it. Started to bury itself where it had always lived- just beneath Agatha’s ribs, where no one could touch it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her eyes glance away from Rio, flicking past her, reaching for anything solid- any object, any dull fact to ground herself in. A bottle of shelf liquor. A cracked corner in the mirror behind the bar. Something safe.</p><p> </p><p>Something that wasn’t Rio Vidal and her roaring silence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t have it in me to be gracious twice.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped back to her. She didn’t mean to. It just happened like gravity, like instinct. Blue met brown, and the silence cracked. Agatha bit her tongue. Hard. Forced the sound down before it could betray her.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio asked, “Do you want me to stop?”</p><p> </p><p><em> Switzerland, </em> Agatha reminded herself for what felt like the hundredth time.</p><p> </p><p>This was still Switzerland. </p><p> </p><p>Even if it was on fucking fire underneath her feet.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said, barely more than a breath. “I don’t think I do.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded and let out a shaky breath, her whole body vibrating like she was holding too much in too tight a space. The corner of her mouth twitched- almost a smile, but not enough strength behind it to carry it through. “That’s good,” Rio whispered. “That’s really good. You look good, Agatha.” As she said it, she shifted, drawing the side of her body that was still pressed to Agatha’s a half step back. Her eyes dropped, tracking the open line of Agatha’s blazer, the exposed skin beneath it.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” Agatha’s voice was steady, but everything in it betrayed her. It sounded like control, but it ached like desperation. And Rio- </p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t looking anywhere but Agatha’s mouth now.</p><p> </p><p>One second. Maybe two. That’s all the time they had left before it happened.</p><p> </p><p>“Please let me,” Rio begged.</p><p> </p><p>And that was it.</p><p> </p><p>That was the moment Agatha heard it- the beginning chords of the Bee Gees <em> More Than a Woman </em>bleeding through the bar speakers.</p><p> </p><p>Not even the original song.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The fucking Glee cover. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Of all the songs in all the bars in the world, it had to be <em> this one, </em> dripping with sincerity and secondhand embarrassment.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her body physically reject it.</p><p> </p><p>Because no matter how much she wanted Rio’s mouth on hers -seventeen years of wondering, of pacing the edges of this exact moment- she was not going to kiss her in the middle of a packed bar with a disco heartbreak anthem screeched in a Ryan fucking Murphy musical number.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had limits.</p><p> </p><p>She had self respect.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha Harkness was going to ruin seventeen years of perfectly preserved nothing, she was going to do it right. Slowly. Selfishly. With enough detail to replay the memory like a good Catholic in the morning after, when guilt and fear inevitably showed up with a baseball bat and tried to convince her she hadn’t wanted it.</p><p> </p><p>So no. Not here.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ripped herself away from Rio in a single breath. A full body decision made in less than a second. No plan. No grace. Just the desperate instinct to escape.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“I’m going outside,” Agatha muttered, already moving- no pause, no explanation. The words fell behind her like dropped coins, left in the faint, humiliating hope someone might bother to pick them up. </p><p> </p><p>Her body reeled from the loss like Agatha ripped it away from something that always belonged to her and now it was missing.</p><p> </p><p>The night air hit her face.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the slap of reality Agatha had hoped for. It didn’t cool her down. It didn’t fix a thing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept walking, rounding the corner of the building, pulse hammering harder with every step. She needed the night to swallow her. Agatha fucking needed the dark to do what she couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Her back found the brick wall, and she pressed against it like she could force herself to stay still. Like stillness would make her stop feeling it.</p><p> </p><p>It was stupid. Loud. Entirely in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha folded her arms across her chest before she could think better of it, pulling the edges of her blazer tight, like that thin layer of fabric might hide her. Might erase the fact that her skin had been seen, wanted, touched without being touched.</p><p> </p><p>The heat of Rio’s eyes was gone, but it still burned relentlessly on her skin.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha fucking hated that she missed it.</p><p> </p><p>She heard footsteps approaching familiar in a way that made her stomach tighten.</p><p> </p><p>They stopped a few feet away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha realized right then, that she wasn’t going to think about what it meant. Not why now, not whether she’d regret it in the morning. That was for later. All she wanted -all she <em> needed </em>- was to know what Rio tasted like after all this time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha arms fell from her chest. The gesture felt heavier than it should have, like a surrender. Rio’s eyes followed the motion, falling to the strip of skin Agatha no longer bothered to cover. For a moment, Rio didn’t look away. Then she looked right back up to Agatha’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>What comes after, Agatha figures, they could deal with later.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha gave a small nod. Whether it was meant for Rio or for herself, she didn’t know. Her own voice was soft, but steady. “Come here. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>She pushed herself off the wall as Rio was already moving toward her. The space between them vanished so quickly it barely felt real. Agatha reached for Rio, fingers cupping Rio’s cheek, needing to close the gap before her brain changed its mind.</p><p> </p><p>They collided hard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fell into Rio and Rio caught Agatha without stumbling back, like she’d been waiting to do that for years. Her hands found Agatha’s hips, then circled around her waist, pulling their bodies into each other. Their mouths found each other in a rush.  It was open from the start, breathless and messy and perfect.</p><p> </p><p>The sound that slipped out of Agatha’s mouth was soft but urgent, caught somewhere between a gasp and a groan. Rio answered with one of her own, soft and whined, and the vibration of it lit something deep in Agatha’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand slid up, curling behind her neck, thumb pressing into the curve just beneath her ear as she tilted Agatha closer, deeper. Her mouth was warm, familiar in the way only something long denied could feel. Agatha didn’t hold back. Her lips parted fully, tongue sweeping into Rio’s mouth, tasting her with years of hunger behind it. She tasted beer, breath, the edge of teeth, the softness of longing turned feral.</p><p> </p><p>It was everything Agatha imagined and worse. Because now she knew. Now she couldn’t unknow it. Couldn’t untaste Rio. Couldn’t unfeel the way Rio melted into Agatha like she’d been waiting her whole life to do exactly this.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tangled her fingers into Agatha’s hair, pulling just enough to guide her, just enough to show Agatha she wasn’t going anywhere. Her kiss was generous but demanding, gentle in a way sleep is to the freezing, impossible to resist, too quiet to fight. Rio let Agatha take, and then asked for more. Her mouth mapped the shape of Agatha’s want, teased apart every breath, every sound, every tremble.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha gave her everything- every sound her mouth could offer, every inch of closeness she had left to give.</p><p> </p><p>When they finally broke apart, it wasn’t graceful. Agatha’s breath hitched in her chest, caught between a moan and a laugh. Her head spun. Her legs barely remembered how to hold herself up. Rio leaned in again, forehead brushing gently against Agatha's. They stood there like that for a few moments.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio tilted her chin and kissed Agatha- just once, slower this time. A single press of her lips that might’ve passed for restraint if it hadn’t lingered too long, if it hadn’t said <em> more </em> instead of <em> enough </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand moved instinctively, palm resting flat against Rio’s chest, fingers curling against the heat of her skin, unwillingly twitching because they didn’t want to let go.</p><p> </p><p>“We should go back in,” Agatha said, breath shallow and uneven. Even to herself, Agatha sounded entirely unconvinced.</p><p> </p><p>And neither of them moved.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t speak.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha -still breathless, still held against Rio with her pulse going absolutely batshit crazy inside her own chest- came to one very clear, very horrifying conclusion: Agatha was absolutely, irreversibly, and possibly cosmically fucked. Not romantically. Not emotionally. Not even sexually, though that suddenly felt like a very short walk. No, this was deeper. Existential. Structural. The kind of fucked that rewrote your internal bylaws and then politely asked you to reread them with feeling.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever part of Agatha Harkness had spent seventeen years building a wall around this exact possibility had just watched Agatha obliterate it with her entire mouth open.</p><p> </p><p>The fantasy she’d managed to live in, for all of five minutes, had collapsed. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s personal Switzerland had lost its neutrality. </p><p> </p><p>It had declared a state of emergency and was actively requesting international aid.</p><p> </p><p>And all Agatha could do now was fight not to be buried underneath the rubble.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha went home alone and tried not to let the kiss drown everything else. Tried not to let it bleed into places it didn’t belong.</p><p> </p><p>They were friends. The Road was Switzerland. And they kissed. That was all. That had to be all.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t let herself linger on what it meant. She couldn’t. It was too much. So she focused on the mechanics. The press of Rio’s mouth. The feeling of her hands in Agatha’s hair. The slow, certain drag of her tongue. </p><p> </p><p>Definitely not the part where seventeen years of wondering what it might feel like somehow failed to prepare Agatha for the reality of it. Not the part where it ruined every version she’d ever imagined. It left her breathless, undone, aching in a way fantasy never could. It left her starving.</p><p> </p><p>Alone in bed, she let her hand slip beneath her waistband. Came quietly, Rio’s name fell from her teeth. That was the deal Agatha made with herself: just this. Just tonight.</p><p> </p><p>By morning, Rio would be a story she didn’t tell. The kiss, a lapse in judgment. The jealousy, nothing to examine too closely- just a flicker, a glitch, a moment Rio had no right to claim and Agatha had no business wanting. She’d scrub it from her memory like it didn’t undo her. Like it hadn’t left Agatha wide awake, aching for something she was still pretending not to want.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha woke up, she didn’t dwell on it. She got up, made her bed, brushed her teeth like it hadn’t happened.</p><p> </p><p>She’d kissed Rio. Now she knew what it felt like. She didn’t need to do it again. It didn’t have to mean anything unless she let it, and she wasn’t going to.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t mean they weren’t still trying. Still figuring out how to be in each other’s lives again without making it complicated.</p><p> </p><p>They were adults. Capable of being friends. Friends who occasionally made bad decisions, sure, but friends all the same.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha wasn’t going to ruin that just because one of those decisions had left her aching for more.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Two hours later, her phone pinged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was mid sip, coffee still in her mouth, when she unlocked the screen.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio: hi </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard and set the mug down a little too forcefully on the counter.</p><p> </p><p>She typed back.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Hey. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The reply came almost instantly.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio: are we okay? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose and fired off a reply with the enthusiasm only panic could produce.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Obviously. We’re fine. We’re friends, remember? Everything’s great!!!  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the screen, watching the typing bubbles appear and disappear like Rio couldn’t quite commit. She chewed at her thumbnail, telling herself it wasn’t a big deal. The last thing she needed was for things to get awkward. She still wanted Rio in her life. As a friend, of course.</p><p> </p><p>They were trying. They were rebuilding. Two days in wasn’t enough time to screw everything up. Not even for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could spiral any further, Rio finally responded.</p><p> </p><p>A single thumbs up emoji.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at the screen, expression flat.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck,” she said into the silence of her kitchen. “That’s it?” She slapped the phone face down on the counter.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t known what to expect, exactly, but it sure as hell wasn’t that. Was she allowed to be mad? Because she was. She absolutely was. Rio kissed her and then-</p><p> </p><p>Her phone pinged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha spun around and grabbed it without thinking. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank god,” she whispered, then caught herself. “I mean. Gross.”</p><p> </p><p>She unlocked the screen.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio: you want to get breakfast? i can pick you up.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Good. That’s what Agatha wanted.</p><p> </p><p>No drama. No conversation. No rehashing anything that might have happened outside a bar under a streetlight her brain can’t stop replaying.</p><p> </p><p>Just breakfast. Just friends.</p><p> </p><p>She typed:</p><p> </p><p><em> Sure </em>.</p><p> </p><p>And hit send.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s response came in immediately.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio: cool. send me your address and i’ll head over in 15 </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sent it, then bolted upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>She took the fastest shower she could manage. She threw on jeans and a navy long sleeve with a mock turtleneck. Clean. Neutral. Not trying too hard.</p><p> </p><p>She yanked a brush through her hair, checked the mirror, and told herself it was fine.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t matter what she looked like. It was breakfast. With a friend.</p><p> </p><p>Ten minutes later, Rio texted that she was outside.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabbed her purse, took a breath, and paused in front of the foyer mirror. She looked good. Calm. Like someone who wasn’t overthinking any of this.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped outside, locked the door behind her, and headed down the porch steps.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s black 4Runner was parked dead center in front of the sidewalk, neat as ever. The windows were tinted too dark to make out much, but Agatha could see the outline of a baseball cap tilted low. Rio’s head was down- probably on her phone. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha squared her shoulders and kept walking toward the car.</p><p> </p><p>She rounded the car and slid into the passenger seat.</p><p> </p><p>It was exactly what Agatha expected- spotless. It still smelled like a new car, all synthetic leather and obsessive care. A pack of cigarettes was tucked neatly beneath the center console display, and just beneath it, Agatha’s old purple Zippo.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it for a second before looking away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in jeans and another NYC Liberty t-shirt, layered over a black and white striped long sleeve. Her turquoise Liberty baseball cap was pulled snug onto her head. She set her phone down on top of the cigarette pack and turned toward Agatha, about to say something.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha beat her to it. She wasn’t giving Rio the lead here. She needed control.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice car,” Agatha said, casual, clipped.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, shifted into drive, and pulled off smoothly. “Thanks. It’s an upgrade from that beat up Beemer I used to drive.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Please. You loved Tulip.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio side eyed her, quiet for half a second. “Yeah. I did,” Rio muttered. “That actually hurt me to say. I take it back. May she rest in peace.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit back a grin. “You wrote her a eulogy, didn’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t respond. Which was, frankly, answer enough.</p><p> </p><p>“She finally break down on you?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head. “No. Some jackass rear ended me. Totaled her.” She said it flatly. “I was devastated.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her eyes on the road ahead, lips twitching. “That sucks. When was that?”</p><p> </p><p>“About a year ago.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, still biting back a grin. Rio was dead serious. Mourning the car like it was a person.</p><p> </p><p>And honestly? That tracked.</p><p> </p><p>They pulled up to the breakfast spot, and it wasn’t where Agatha thought they were going.</p><p> </p><p>She’d assumed Rio would take them to Sam’s- the old diner across the street from the hospital, the one they always used to go to.</p><p> </p><p>But this place was different. Not fancy, just unfamiliar. It hadn’t been here ten years ago when Agatha left, and it definitely wasn’t on Rio’s usual rotation.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was a creature of habit. Always had been. She had five or six places and rotated through them like clockwork, always reading the menu ahead of time, always ordering the same thing. She didn’t like surprises. She didn’t take risks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at the building again.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> So what the fuck was this? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You been here before?” Agatha asked, keeping her voice light as she unbuckled her seatbelt.</p><p> </p><p>“Nope,” Rio said, grabbing her phone and getting out of the car.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She stared at the now empty driver’s seat, momentarily stunned.</p><p> </p><p>No. She wasn’t thrown off. Not over this. Agatha was just… surprised. That was all.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio wasn’t supposed to do things like go to new places, make different choices, take risks in Jenga, or fucking kiss Agatha outside of a fucking bar.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was supposed to be the same. That was the point. That was the story Agatha had told herself for a decade.</p><p> </p><p>That way, Agatha never had to wonder what might’ve happened if Rio had been anything else.</p><p> </p><p>And now?</p><p> </p><p>Now Agatha wasn’t so sure.</p><p> </p><p>And that, whatever <em> that </em>was… felt dangerously close to betrayal.</p><p> </p><p>She shoved the door open and scrambled out, trying to make it look effortless. Rio was already at the back of the car, leaning casually against the trunk, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha adjusted her shirt, straightened her posture, and walked over like she hadn’t just spent the last thirty seconds rethinking the last ten years.</p><p> </p><p>Everything was fine. She was not thrown off.</p><p> </p><p>Not at all.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s go,” Agatha said, striding past Rio and heading straight for the restaurant entrance.</p><p> </p><p>Rio followed without a word.</p><p> </p><p>At the door, Agatha grabbed the handle, but Rio reached around her and held it open. Agatha walked through like she didn’t notice.</p><p> </p><p>She approached the host stand and said, “Two,” before the hostess could ask. The hostess nodded, grabbed two menus, and led them to a booth.</p><p> </p><p>They slid into their seats. Agatha set her purse down and reached for the menu, casting a glance at Rio. Not because she cared. She didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just needed to know if Rio had looked at it beforehand.</p><p> </p><p>Just out of curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe.</p><p> </p><p>Rio picked up the menu, but barely glanced at it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clocked it immediately. She already knew what she was getting.</p><p> </p><p>Of course she did.</p><p> </p><p>Somehow, that settled Agatha more than it should have. She looked back at her own menu, tension in her shoulders easing.</p><p> </p><p>The waitress came by and took their drink orders. When she returned with their drinks, she took their food orders without much small talk.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was unwrapping the straw for her Diet Coke when she asked, “How’s Lilia?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia Callderu- Agatha was never quite sure whether to call the woman cooky or wispy. Possibly both. The jury had been out for years and showed no signs of returning with a verdict.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio was nine, her parents died in a car crash. No next of kin. No one waiting. She cycled through seven foster homes in under a year before landing with Lilia, who, against all odds, kept her. And, eventually, adopted her.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s good. Retired five years ago.” Rio said it lightly, her fingers skimming across the table.</p><p> </p><p>“Y’all still do Sunday dinners?”</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally escaped Massachusetts and the chokehold of her mother’s expectations, there was no family waiting on the other side. No home to return to. Holidays were just closed dining halls and couches borrowed from classmates who pitied her more than they liked her.</p><p> </p><p>Later, once she had her own apartment, she tried to convince herself it was better that way. No obligations. No travel. Just her and a pile of takeout containers, watching the world celebrate through double paned glass. It was fine. Manageable, even. Loneliness had rules, and she followed them.</p><p> </p><p>Then she met Jen. And, inevitably, Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had invited her to Sunday dinner once. Agatha had almost said no, out of habit. But she went. Lilia had asked about her family that night, not prying, just curious. Agatha had shrugged and said there wasn’t one. That was all it took.</p><p> </p><p>No one made a speech or carved her name into a chair, but after that, there was always a place set for Agatha. She started showing up on Sundays. Then holidays. Birthdays that weren’t hers. At some point, Agatha stopped flinching when coworkers asked where she was going for Thanksgiving. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha never called it home, but it was the closest thing she’d ever had to one. And it was enough. More than enough.</p><p> </p><p>And then she met Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>It happened gradually, the way most things do when you think you’ll get another chance. </p><p> </p><p>Just a few missed dinners. Conflicts, scheduling, the pull of a new life arranging itself around her. Wanda didn’t ask where she spent her Sundays, and Agatha didn’t offer. She told herself it was fine. That she’d go next week. Or the one after that.</p><p> </p><p>By then, Agatha belonged elsewhere. She was someone else’s wife, part of someone else’s plan. It was natural, she reasoned. What people did when they fell in love- rearranged their lives, let a few things go.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Sage and I work every Sunday, so we moved it to Tuesdays. But yeah, still happens.”</p><p> </p><p>Something in Agatha lurched to a sudden, terrifying halt. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Sage and I.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Since when did Sage factor into Lilia’s dinners?</p><p> </p><p>The realization hit Agatha in the gut- sharp, specific, and quietly fucking devastating. She had missed something. Something important. And worse than that, she wasn’t sure she had the right to ask for it back.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage?” Agatha asked, trying to sound neutral.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, yeah. One of Lilia’s foster fails.” Rio wasn’t looking at her when she said it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her Diet Coke.</p><p> </p><p>There it was. Something important. </p><p> </p><p>She coughed once, then again, harder, like she could force any words out of her mouth the same way the carbonation burned up her throat.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Foster fails. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>To Agatha’s knowledge, Lilia had fostered plenty of kids before Rio- but Rio was the only one she ever adopted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha remembered a dinner, years ago. Lilia at the counter, cutting potatoes:</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “She’d been through seven homes that year. Nine years old, angry at the whole damn world- and who could blame her? I don’t know what made her different. But she was. Fought me every day like I was just another stop. But I’d already decided I wasn’t. I think she figured that out eventually.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Lilia had gone right back to cutting potatoes like she hadn’t just said something that lodged itself in Agatha’s chest. She’d never forgotten it. Probably never would.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat and forced herself to push past it.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you were the only one,” Agatha said. “Lilia always said she was done after you.” She tried not to let it sound like an accusation, even if it felt like one.</p><p> </p><p>“She was,” Rio said with a shrug. “But in, like, 2014, I think? My old case agent called her. Said there was this girl who’d been in the system her whole life and needed somewhere stable. Enter Sage. The rest is kind of history.”</p><p> </p><p>And suddenly- everything made sense.</p><p> </p><p>The relationship between Rio and Sage had always been just short of explainable. Too familiar, too lived in, too goddamn synced for coworkers. And Agatha had still told herself it was just late shifts and trauma bonding.</p><p> </p><p>It was so goddamn obvious.</p><p> </p><p>The truth had tried to slap Agatha in the face a dozen times. The way they left work together. The way Rio was Sage’s ride at game night. The way Sage had practically launched herself across the table at the bar last night, and Rio had egged her on like she wanted the fight, like they’d done it a thousand times before.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t just act like sisters. They basically fucking were sisters.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had left, and she had genuinely believed, in an arrogant way, that things would freeze in place behind her. That Rio would stay Rio. That Lilia’s house would always be what it had been. That if she ever came back, nothing would have shifted too much without her.</p><p> </p><p>She felt sick. Because now, with Rio’s words still echoing in her head, the timeline caught up and it knocked the wind out of her.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> 2014. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened around her straw. She was still living in Westview in 2014. Married, yes. Distant, sure. But she was living five miles away, married and miserable, and somehow completely in the fucking dark.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her tongue to the inside of her cheek and felt her jaw tighten until it ached. Her eyes stayed on the table. She needed to breathe. Just once. Before she said something that would get her arrested. Before she lit Rio’s ass on fire for waiting thirteen years to say a single goddamn thing about this.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha looked up, Rio was already watching her with a guilty expression that made Agatha’s chest feel too tight.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh,” Agatha said, her mouth twisting. “That’s funny. I was here in 2014.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think you were busy,” Rio said quickly. “You know… with wedding stuff.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “I got married in 2013.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled, and her shoulders sank slightly. “We weren’t really talking. Things were weird. It wasn’t something I kept from you on purpose, it just… happened.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, jaw tight. “It just happened?” she asked. “The woman who raised you took in another kid while I was still here, and I was just... left out of the loop?”</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t meant to sound hurt, but she was. <em> Deeply. </em></p><p> </p><p>Not because Agatha thought she had a right to know- not officially, not in any logical way. But there had been a time when she would have. When news like that wouldn’t have found its way to her by accident, thirteen years late and tossed out in the middle of a conversation like it was barely worth mentioning.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha- look-”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re an asshole,” Agatha snapped. She exhaled through her nose, tried to swallow the heat behind her eyes. Tried to remember that this wasn’t about being owed anything.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha couldn’t say it. That Lilia had mattered to her, too. That house had once been the only place that felt like home. </p><p> </p><p>Rio fucking knew that.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at her, eyes wide and stunned. It made her look younger than she was. Her mouth opened and closed, twice, before she finally spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re right. I’m so-</p><p> </p><p>“Who knew?” Agatha cut in, her voice hard. “Everyone? Jen? Alice? They both knew?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed hard. Her eyes dropped for a second, flicked away like she was looking for a place to hide. When she looked back at Agatha, she didn’t try to spin it.</p><p> </p><p>She nodded once.</p><p> </p><p>Of course they knew.</p><p> </p><p>Of course they all fucking knew.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t even be mad properly. Not at Rio. Not at Jen. Not even at herself. The worst part was knowing she’d done it too- drifted, avoided, chosen silence when it felt easier. And this was what silence gave you.</p><p> </p><p>A name. A face. A whole person wrapped into a life Agatha used to know and no one thought to fucking tell her.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, please,” Rio said, barely above a whisper. “Just let me explain.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then fucking explain,” Agatha hissed, teeth clenched.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t think Sage was permanent. I really didn’t.” Rio started, fast. “I thought- maybe Lilia just wanted one last hoorah before calling it quits. I wasn’t living there anymore. The house was quiet. She was probably lonely.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her. She wanted to find something in Rio’s face that didn’t match what she was saying- some crack, some excuse to be angrier than she already was.</p><p> </p><p>Rio went on. “I didn’t even know Sage. She was kept to herself a lot. You and I weren’t really talking. It didn’t feel like something worth mentioning. And then weeks went by. Then months. And then you and I weren’t talking at all anymore. Then Lilia started saying stuff-.. And I… I realized she wasn’t leaving.”</p><p> </p><p>“By the time Lilia adopted her, you were already in Chicago. We hadn’t spoken in months. And it felt too late. Too weird.” Rio gave a breath of a laugh, humorless. “What was I supposed to do, Agatha? Reach out and say, ‘Hey, remember that foster kid I never mentioned? She’s still here. She’s basically family now. Thought you should know’?”</p><p> </p><p>Every word out of Rio’s mouth sounded reasonable. A perfectly logical, deeply human mistake.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha still wanted to scream.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head. “You knew what that place meant to me. What Lilia meant to me. You knew. You just didn’t want to deal with what it might’ve meant if I still cared.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio flinched at that, just barely, but Agatha saw it.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t mean to-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “You didn’t mean to,” she repeated. “That’s the problem with you. You never mean to do anything, and people still get hurt.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed hard. “You’re right,” she said. “You had every right to know. And I fucked up. I’m sorry, Agatha. I really am.”</p><p> </p><p>Well. Agatha got her apology. Rio actually took accountability for once, which was- miraculous, honestly. One small miracle in the timeline of their spectacularly dysfunctional history.</p><p> </p><p>She was still pissed. That wasn’t changing anytime soon. Agatha fully intended to hold onto the narrative that Rio was completely in the wrong and maybe also the actual devil. But for now? She was over this fucking conversation.</p><p> </p><p>“Noted,” was all Agatha said, then took a long sip from her straw and turned to stare out the window.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you still mad at me?” Rio asked, softly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked over, and there it was. That face. Those goddamn eyes- big, brown, and full of guilt and whatever the hell softness Rio always used to pull out when she felt bad about something but didn’t know how to fix it.</p><p> </p><p>Naturally, Agatha felt like shit. Because seeing Rio sad always made her feel like shit. It was like being asked to walk barefoot across miles of legos and pretend it wasn’t painful as fuck. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “No.” </p><p> </p><p>She grabbed her drink, took a sip, looked back out the window.</p><p> </p><p>“But for the record,” Agatha muttered, “you’re still an asshole.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s fair.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel Rio watching her.</p><p> </p><p>“Just act normal before I change my mind.”</p><p> </p><p>Their food came not long after, and the conversation shifted with it. They didn’t force it- they just moved on from the heavy stuff.</p><p> </p><p>They talked. About nothing, mostly. About the waitress’s attitude. About how Rio still couldn’t order anything without turning it into a ten step customization. Agatha made fun of her for it. Rio told her to shut up. Agatha smirked into her drink and took it as a win.</p><p> </p><p>It got easier as they went. Not perfect. But easier.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe it was going too well. So well that Agatha felt the familiar itch creep in that made her want to ruin it before it got comfortable. Before it could start feeling like safety again. Especially when she caught herself looking at Rio’s mouth, thinking how it looked better last night. Right after they’d kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stabbed her fork at her plate and asked, like it was no big deal, “You date anyone while I was in Chicago?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look thrown. She wiped her mouth, slid her plate out of the way, and smiled.</p><p> </p><p>“Not seriously,” Rio said with a shrug. “But a woman has needs.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grimaced inwardly. Of course Rio had flings. She always had flings. Casual. Disposable. Easy to laugh about the next morning.</p><p> </p><p>God, it was pathetic how that still managed to sting.</p><p> </p><p>“Classy,” Agatha muttered, trying to swallow the bite of food she suddenly wanted absolutely nothing to do with.</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, but didn’t take the bait. Just watched her for a beat, then leaned back and said, “Alright. My turn.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, eyes narrowing. “Your turn for what?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rested her arms on the table and folded her hands like they were settling in for a conversation she’d been waiting to have. “You asked me a question. Seems fair I get to ask one in return.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back, arms crossed. “Yeah? Better make it count.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio met her eyes and didn’t look away. “Why did you and Wanda get divorced?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned- loudly, unapologetically. “God.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a simple answer. Nothing ever was with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t been some big, dramatic moment that made Agatha realize she was done.</p><p> </p><p>It was a sweatshirt.</p><p> </p><p>Ugly. Faded. A thing Rio had tossed her once, without thinking, back when things were easier. It had lived in the back of the closet for years, buried between clothes Agatha never wore but couldn’t let go of. It was the only thing in that apartment that still felt like hers. Not because it was from Rio, but because it was untouched by Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>Sure, Agatha had never fully quit smoking. That was the one thing she held onto to keep some version of herself intact. But even that had been touched by the life she was in, folded into secrecy, kept out of sight. It wasn’t really untouched.</p><p> </p><p>But that sweatshirt was.</p><p> </p><p>Until one day, it wasn’t. </p><p> </p><p>It was just gone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had asked Wanda if she’d seen it. Wanda had smiled and said, <em> “Oh, that old thing? I donated it last week. You never wore it.” </em></p><p> </p><p>That was it. Just another edit made on Agatha’s behalf. And Agatha had smiled, nodded, said it was fine. Then went into the bathroom, shut the door, and sat on the floor until her hands stopped shaking.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda had taken so much from her. Not in obvious ways. Never all at once. It was always framed as care, as compromise. Change this. Adjust that. Make it easier, softer, more manageable. And Agatha did. She moved. She bent. She swallowed things whole.</p><p> </p><p>Then to top it off, Wanda had looked at the one thing Agatha had managed to keep for herself and saw nothing worth keeping.</p><p> </p><p>That’s what Agatha couldn’t forgive.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a revelation. It was a dull kind of disgust that settled under her skin and stayed there.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t leave right away. She made dinner. She went to work. She sent polite texts, cleared the dishwasher. She tried not to look at the empty space in the closet. The paperwork came a few weeks later, and she filled it out without thinking, as if it were just one more thing to be done.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Irreconcilable differences.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>It sounded reasonable. Like two people had simply drifted apart in a way that couldn’t be fixed. And maybe, in the most technical sense, that was true. But it didn’t come close to explaining the years she spent whittling herself down into something smaller just to make it work.</p><p> </p><p>There wasn’t a fight. There were forms. A few tense days. Logistics.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda kept asking what had changed. Agatha never answered. Because it wasn’t one moment. It was everything. Every compromise, every swallowed part of herself that was dismissed as love.</p><p> </p><p>The sweatshirt just made it too obvious to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Her fingers curled around her Diet Coke. She looked at Rio, cleared her throat and said, “I filed under irreconcilable differences. It sounded better than saying I couldn’t remember the last time I felt like a person in my own life.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “That’s it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. “Box was right there. Felt rude not to check it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a quiet laugh, shaking her head. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing. I just always figured if you two ever split, the reasons would include ‘chronic rudeness’ and ‘a deeply suspicious relationship with wine.’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “Makes enough sense.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right?” Rio said, grinning. That gap in her teeth was showing, and Agatha’s heart flipped in a way she chose to ignore. “But I must say, I do have quite the soft spot for Agnes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned and immediately threw a home fry at her. Rio dodged it without moving much at all, still grinning.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m just saying,” Rio said, unfazed, “She had a crush on me, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “She did not.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, she absolutely did,” Rio said. “Two and a half glasses in and I was suddenly being told I had the best hands on the East Coast.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed and grabbed another home fry to toss. “That never happened.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio caught it midair with one hand and looked far too pleased with herself. “It did, actually. And for the record, she matched with me on Bumble just a few days ago.”</p><p> </p><p>That stalled Agatha for half a second. She pressed her lips together like she was trying not to react, but the smile tugging at the corner of her mouth gave her away. Across the table, Rio just tilted her head and stared, tongue tucked into her cheek, wearing the exact kind of face that said, <em> go ahead, try and talk your way out of that one. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose and gave a slight shake of her head. “Yeah, well. She has issues.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shot back, “She has taste.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. “She tried to climb into your lap in the middle of a Chili’s.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat up a little, eyes wide with conviction. “Oh, you mean only the greatest restaurant in the U.S. of A.? We were at Chili’s, Agatha. <em> Chili’s. </em> It was the closest I’ve ever come to a religious experience, and I wanted to marry her on the spot.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, genuinely at a loss. “Okay. Your obsession with Chili’s has always been fucking weird. ‘The greatest restaurant in the U.S. of A.?’ Do you understand how insane that sounds out loud?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked offended that Agatha had even asked such a question. “It’s not my fault this country peaked at the Triple Dipper and free, never ending chips and salsa.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, slowly. “Jesus Christ.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Exactly.”</p><p> </p><p>The conviction alone should’ve been enough to roll her eyes and move on. Instead, Agatha found herself staring- irritated, mostly. And for reasons that didn’t hold up to any logic at all, she wanted to kiss Rio. Terribly.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could spiral, the waitress appeared beside them with a practiced smile and set the check on the edge of the table- completely oblivious to the fact that Agatha was exactly one second away from making a very poor decision because of Rio’s bizarre obsession with Chili’s.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabbed the check and pulled her wallet from the back pocket of her jeans. She was already moving like she’d planned to cover it the whole time, before Agatha could even think to offer.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t make it weird,” Rio said. “Even though, morally, I should absolutely make you pay for the Chili’s slander.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t fight her on it.</p><p> </p><p>She just watched Rio slide the card into the check sleeve, still clearly pouting over the alleged Chili’s slander.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> God, she’s so fucking annoying. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to kiss her so badly it made her jaw ache.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t perfect. The morning had been weird and tense and heavier than it should’ve been. But somehow, they’d made it through. Laughed. Talked like people who knew how to talk to each other.</p><p> </p><p>And that felt... good. Annoyingly good.</p><p> </p><p>So when Rio pulled up in front of Agatha’s house and shifted the car into park, Agatha felt that sinking feeling she used to get every time one of them left too early.</p><p> </p><p>They’d spent years knowing each other down to the breath, and for a few brief minutes, that had resurfaced. And now Agatha didn’t want to be left alone with it.</p><p> </p><p>“You can come in, if you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Because it’s easier than saying she didn’t hate the morning.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced over, one eyebrow barely raised. “Yeah?” she asked, quiet, like she was making sure Agatha wasn’t about to take it back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p> </p><p>So Rio nodded once. “Okay. Yeah. I want.”</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t need to make it a thing.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes, showing up was enough.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They stepped into Agatha’s house, and Rio started snooping immediately, eyes roaming, hands already picking things up like she was on a guided tour with no guide.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going upstairs to change,” Agatha said, already unbuttoning her jeans. “I’d rather get hit by a car than lounge in denim.”</p><p> </p><p>She paused on the steps and glanced back. “Want a pair of shorts?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Rio called, distracted- already flipping through Agatha’s mail like she paid the bills.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even bother trying to stop her. “Knock yourself out. Let me know if you find anything interesting… Maybe a coupon.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio made a noise that might’ve been a laugh. Agatha just shook her head and headed upstairs, leaving Rio to commit fraud in peace.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled on a light blue tank top with thin straps and a pair of blue and white pinstriped boxers. She grabbed a pair of shorts from the dresser for Rio before heading downstairs.</p><p> </p><p>She found Rio standing in front of the television, idly scrolling through what looked like an endless lineup of streaming options.</p><p> </p><p>“Find anything interesting?” Agatha asked as she crossed the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Your mail’s depressing,” Rio said without looking back. When she finally did turn around, her eyes barely skimmed over Agatha before she reached for the shorts and handed over the remote. </p><p> </p><p>“I’d tell you where the bathroom is, but I’m guessing you already know!” Agatha shouted after her, watching as Rio headed confidently down the hall toward the half bath without needing directions.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s classic evil little cackles echoed back in response.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, already smiling.</p><p> </p><p>She sank into the corner of the couch -the L-shaped part she always claimed- and turned on a movie, pretending it was a random pick. It wasn’t. It was <em> The Proposal </em>. A rom-com she loved far more than she’d ever admit, and had seen enough times to mouth the lines word for word.</p><p> </p><p>Rio returned a few minutes later, now in the shorts but still wearing her layered long sleeve under her t-shirt. She’d taken off the baseball cap, letting her hair fall messily around her face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio came around the couch and glanced at the screen. “Love this movie,” she said, dropping into a spot two cushions down. She tucked her legs underneath her, body angled slightly toward Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>They weren’t paying much attention to the movie. It had barely started -maybe five minutes in- when Agatha asked if Rio wanted a beer. Rio said sure. Agatha got up, grabbed two from the fridge, and handed one over.</p><p> </p><p>They started talking. About nothing, really. Nothing that used to fill entire afternoons. At some point, the conversation swerved. Agatha wasn’t sure how they got there, but suddenly Rio was saying she’d never had her ears pierced.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at her. “What, ever?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged. “Nope.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, who had more holes in her ears than she could keep track of, narrowed her eyes. Sometimes she wore earrings in all of them, sometimes just one or two. It depended on the day. Or her mood. Or the level of petty defiance required.</p><p> </p><p>She sipped her beer. “You seem like someone who’s afraid of needles.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “I’m not.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Are you sure?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not!”</p><p> </p><p>And that was all it took. Agatha sat up a little straighter.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me pierce your ears, then.”</p><p> </p><p>She said it casually, like it was no big deal. She knew how. She’d done her own years ago, in a bathroom mirror with shaking hands and too much eyeliner. When your mother is Evanora Harkness, you learn quickly what will set her off. Piercing her own ears had been the fastest way to start a fire without lighting a match. The memory still made her smile.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. Of course she didn’t. She grinned, wide and a little chaotic, the same way she always had when she’d already decided on something.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her beer slightly. “Let’s pierce my ears, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>Naturally, Agatha had supplies. She kept things like that around in case she got bored or curious or restless. It wasn’t a surprise. What <em> was </em> surprising was how still Rio sat while Agatha cleaned her earlobes with isopropyl alcohol.</p><p> </p><p>She’d knelt in front of Rio to mark both ears evenly, gauging the angles with practiced eyes. But when she looked up to double check, she faltered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was staring at her. Not in amusement or challenge- but with this quiet, thoughtful sort of focus. Like she was trying to memorize her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze, just for a second. She coughed a small laugh and cleared her throat, willing the warmth rushing to her face to go unnoticed. Agatha pretended she didn’t know how obvious it was when she blushed.</p><p> </p><p>She made sure everything was right- no crooked holes or infections under her watch. She was a nurse, after all. Sterility wasn’t optional. Gloves on. Supplies prepped. Rio’s hair was pulled back in a high ponytail to keep it out of the way, and Agatha had already broken a bar of soap into chunks- just the right size to hold behind each ear for support.</p><p> </p><p>Rio held out her hand and flicked open Agatha’s old purple Zippo. Agatha sterilized the needle in the flame.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t move,” she said, steady. “I’m gonna stab you on the count of three.”</p><p> </p><p>“One. Two-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pierced Rio’s ear on two.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a scream -high pitched and dramatic, like she was being murdered- and jerked just slightly.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t flinch. She’d spent over a decade in the NICU, poking squirmy little creatures who cried and wailed and made everything ten times harder. She didn’t mind. She was used to it. She was good at this.</p><p> </p><p>And besides, Rio had asked for it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved with the small jolt of Rio’s body, steadying herself until she was sure Rio wouldn’t flinch again. Then she sat back on her heels and smiled- breath catching a little as she took in the stunned expression on Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“See?” she said, smug and breathless. “That wasn’t so bad.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at her, mouth hanging open, eyes wide in full betrayal. It was the most <em> are you fucking serious </em> look Agatha had ever seen.</p><p> </p><p>“You said on three!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely held back a laugh, biting her lip as she reached for the jewelry. “I felt you tense as soon as I said two. I didn’t have a choice.”</p><p> </p><p>“It hurt<em>, </em>” Rio snapped, voice climbing into a register that bordered on toddler level indignation. The only thing missing was throwing herself dramatically to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just hummed in fake sympathy as she swapped out the needle for the earring- a small black diamond.</p><p> </p><p>“We don’t have to do the other one,” Agatha gently added, sliding the back of the earring into place with careful fingers.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“No- I want the other one done,” Rio shot back, just as upset that Agatha had dared suggest quitting in the middle of a mission.</p><p> </p><p>“You sure?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do it now. Actually-” Rio paused, narrowing her eyes. “On three.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held up her hands in mock surrender. “Okay. On three.”</p><p> </p><p>She prepped the second ear just as carefully as the first- soap, flame, steady fingers. Then she leaned in again, voice calm.</p><p> </p><p>“One. Two-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes squeezed shut.</p><p> </p><p>“Three.”</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, it was done.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha disposed of the needle first, carrying it to the kitchen where she kept a small sharps container tucked behind the sink. She dropped it in with a soft click, then peeled off her gloves.</p><p> </p><p>She crossed back into the living room and sank onto her knees between Rio’s legs. Her hands came to rest on the tops of Rio’s bare thighs, fingers brushing the soft skin there like they weren’t sure what they were allowed to touch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was trying not to pout. </p><p> </p><p>And God, Agatha had missed her. Missed her like it was a chronic ache. It settled in the way she would reach for someone in her dreams and wake up empty handed. In the way she would avoid certain songs. Certain memories she didn’t trust herself to touch without it stinging.</p><p> </p><p>Because it wasn’t just missing a person. It was missing <em> Rio </em>. The expressions she made when she was pretending not to pout, the way she turned toward Agatha even in silence, the reckless affection that always came a few seconds before Agatha could brace for it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t have the words for what that did to her.</p><p> </p><p>And suddenly, she wasn’t braced at all. Rio had her arms around her, pulling her in, and Agatha let it happen.</p><p> </p><p>The hug was awkward -Rio perched on the couch, Agatha still kneeling on the floor- but somehow it didn’t feel that way. It just felt like them<em> . </em> A little off center, but holding anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let herself melt into it, her arms slipping under Rio’s shoulders, hands pressing gently against her back.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t say anything. Just leaned in  and tucked her face into the curve of Rio’s shoulder. It was warm, familiar, safe. Rio still smelled like fresh laundry. And when the smile crept up on Agatha’s face, uninvited and too big to hide, she pressed it into Rio’s shoulder, and let it disappear there.</p><p> </p><p>Like a secret. Just between them. </p><p> </p><p>“I really missed you, Agatha,” Rio mumbled into the side of her hair.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. “Yeah,” she whispered. “Me too.” It was all she could manage.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back after a moment and gave her a small, crooked smile. Then she closed her eyes and tilted her head to show off both ears.</p><p> </p><p>“Well?” Rio asked. “Do I look cooler now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh. “You look fine. Go check the mirror if you need the ego boost.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned like that was exactly what she planned to do. She stood up, padded over to the foyer mirror, tilted her head this way and that, and hummed thoughtfully.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifted on the floor, turning to rest her back against the couch.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, nodding at her reflection. “I definitely shouldn’t have let you do this. I’m gonna be even more of a babe magnet now. You might have to fight the ladies off me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’ll start training immediately.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked back and dropped onto the floor right next to Agatha, close enough their knees brushed. She picked up her beer, took a sip, and squinted at the TV. Agatha caught the way her eyes narrowed slightly. Then, without any warning, she turned to Agatha and asked, dead serious:</p><p> </p><p>“Do you mow your own lawn?” </p><p> </p><p>The question was so out of place, so deeply Rio, that Agatha couldn’t help but laugh. Loud and disbelieving, the sound burst out of her before she had a chance to rein it in.</p><p> </p><p>“Be serious,” Agatha said, shaking her head. “I’ve built my entire personality around never touching a lawn mower. I pay the neighbor’s kid.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grunted and turned back to the screen, unimpressed. “Fire him,” she muttered into her bottle before taking another sip. “And please clarify if he’s also the one responsible for turning your flower beds into a botanical crime scene.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped her head toward her, eyebrows raised. “You’re very invested in this for someone who doesn’t live here.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m serious. Fire him. He’s doing a terrible job. Tell him he’s seventeen and it’s not too late to pursue literally any other calling.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s thirteen,” Agatha corrected. “And I’m not exactly drowning in other options willing to do it for fifteen bucks and a Gatorade.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her a long, almost theatrical sigh and rolled her eyes as if the answer had been obvious from the start. “I would,” she said. Her hand came to rest on Agatha’s thigh. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She didn’t even breathe for a second, just let the warmth of it sink in.</p><p> </p><p>“Free of charge,” Rio continued, still looking at the screen. “Out of pity. And to spare you from being the reason the neighborhood Facebook group starts posting pictures of your yard with captions like ‘Thoughts and prayers.’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even try to hold back the snort that slipped out. Rio looked at her and grinned, wide and self satisfied, and it made Agatha’s heart do a somersault in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not that bad,” Agatha muttered, eyes drifting back to the screen, though her focus didn’t follow. Her fingers traced the length of Rio’s arm without much thought.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a lazy shrug and made a quiet, noncommittal sound. “It’s not hopeless,” she said, voice low. “Just embarrassing.”</p><p> </p><p>She turned her palm upward in Agatha’s lap, a small but unmistakable gesture that told Agatha not to stop. So Agatha didn’t. Her fingers kept moving, tracing gently along the inside of Rio’s forearm.</p><p> </p><p>They sat in the quiet for a little while, both of them watching the screen without really seeing it. Agatha’s fingers kept brushing slowly back and forth along Rio’s arm. No teasing. No commentary. Just the hum of closeness that neither of them seemed in a rush to break.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio sat up a little straighter, shifting her body toward Agatha. One elbow came up to rest on the couch as she leaned her head into her hand, completely at ease. Agatha’s hand, the one that had been stroking along Rio’s arm, fell to her thigh instead, unsure of where else to go now that it wasn’t following the line of Rio’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio brought her other hand up and poked lightly at Agatha’s chest. “Lucky for you,” Rio said, a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth, “you know someone with a criminally underappreciated green thumb and excellent taste, who just so happens to be sitting right here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio and her fucking green thumb.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s apartment had always been full of plants. They were never loud. Never wild. One in a corner, another near the light. Something green and reaching on the balcony. Her space had always looked alive, in the most deliberate way. </p><p> </p><p>And somehow, her plants had ended up in Agatha’s space too.</p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t been a conversation. It wasn’t a gift. It was a slow collection. A potted plant on the kitchen counter. A plant in a hanging basket hooked on Agatha’s balcony one afternoon and never taken back. Agatha hadn’t asked for them. Rio hadn’t asked to leave them. But there they were.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha let them stay. She watered them. Moved them around when they got too much sun. Pretended it wasn’t a thing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio even used to hang eucalyptus in her shower. Which meant, eventually, Agatha did it too. At first it was because it smelled nice. Then because she got used to it. Even in Chicago, she’d kept it going. Currently, Agatha had some hanging in her bathroom upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>It was just a habit Agatha hadn’t gotten around to breaking. A habit her body remembered, even when her pride didn’t want to.</p><p> </p><p>And now Rio was propped up on one elbow, looking at Agatha- smirking, poking a finger to Agatha’s chest like she knew what beat there, and had no idea it had always been hers. That somehow, she’d taken up residence there without ever realizing it.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio always had a way of doing that.</p><p> </p><p>She planted, let things grow. Left parts of herself behind the way she used to leave behind plants: A pot on the counter. A hanging basket on the balcony. </p><p> </p><p>Harmless, until they weren’t. Until one day you looked around and realized they’d taken over the place. Thriving. Blooming. Tangling themselves into corners Agatha had never meant to share.</p><p> </p><p>“You offering to mow my lawn for free?” Agatha whispered, after tracing every piece of Rio that had outlived her absence.</p><p> </p><p>It was the only thing she could come up with that didn’t involve her heart falling out of her mouth and straight into Rio’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved the hand still resting against Agatha’s chest, lifted it, and gently tucked a piece of hair behind Agatha’s ear. </p><p> </p><p>“I can do more than that,” Rio muttered, barely above a whisper. “Clear out the flowerbeds. Pull up the old roots. Put down new ones. Something bright. Azaleas, maybe.”</p><p> </p><p>As Rio spoke, her hand slipped from Agatha’s cheek and settled gently over her chest again. She let it rest there for a moment, closed loosely into a fist.</p><p> </p><p>Then, again with a single finger, she tapped twice against Agatha’s heart. Like she was answering for all the times she hadn’t known what she was touching.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> So that’s what it was like- </em>an offer wrapped in a metaphor, quiet enough not to spook Agatha. A small touch, planted with intention. A gesture that left no room for misreading.</p><p> </p><p>She had spent so long waiting to hear it- then longer convincing herself she never would. And now that it had been offered, gently and without condition, she didn’t know how to trust it. It didn’t feel like a lie. That was the worst part. It felt real.</p><p> </p><p>But seventeen years had taught Agatha how to speak around what she meant. How to make herself small enough to survive disappointment. How to twist her truth into something more manageable, easier to walk away from.</p><p> </p><p>“The soil’s been neglected, you know,” Agatha murmured, almost to herself. “Things don’t root easy after that. And it’s hard to tell, sometimes. What’s dead and what’s just taking its time… And sometimes it…  sometimes it grows strange. Reaches in the wrong directions. Starts needing things it doesn’t know how to ask for.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused. It should’ve ended there. It would’ve, if she were braver.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away and added, “Probably not worth the effort if it doesn’t know what to do with the sunlight.” She reached for a loose thread on her rug, tugging at it gently.</p><p> </p><p>It was second nature to twist instinct into dismissal, building exits into every sentence just in case Agatha needed to run. The words had left her too easily, like her mouth still hadn’t gotten the memo that she didn’t want to be misunderstood anymore.</p><p> </p><p>That was the problem.</p><p> </p><p>Because what Agatha had meant, if she were the kind of person who said what she meant, was simple.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Don’t hold me at face value when I say stupid shit. Especially when it sounds like I’m pushing you away. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>But what Agatha had said instead, was that it wasn’t worth the effort.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had always been good at showing up, at presence, at staying close. But she’d never been good at hearing what Agatha couldn’t say directly. Their language always ended up lost in translation. </p><p> </p><p>And now Agatha had to wait and see if Rio heard her anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed lightly once across Agatha’s sternum. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s okay,” Rio said quietly. “I’ll try again tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>The words rang familiar in Agatha’s ears.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t known what to do with them before. She hadn’t let herself believe they meant anything more than what they said. Hadn’t let herself linger. It was easier to chalk it up to Rio being her usual brand of ridiculous- dramatic flirting, cryptic phrasing, her emotional sleight of hand. Easier for Agatha to roll her eyes than consider the possibility that any of it was sincere.</p><p> </p><p>This time, though, Agatha heard it differently. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had never just meant tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>She meant as long as it took.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tore her gaze from the thread and looked at Rio, startled by finally being heard and by the way honesty had replaced the face of fear.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat felt too tight, her chest too full, but the word still found its way out.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>It was the only word she could come up with that gave Rio permission to keep showing up. And Agatha needed her to keep showing up- even when Agatha said the wrong thing. Especially then. Because Agatha wouldn't mean it. She never had.</p><p> </p><p>And somehow, Rio had heard that. Heard it beneath the noise, beneath the old habits Agatha hadn’t quite yet figured out how to kill.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded a little. “Okay,” she whispered back.</p><p> </p><p>And that was it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted, settled back against the couch the way they had before, eyes on the screen, saying nothing else. Agatha turned back too.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard and blinked a few times, willing the lump in her throat to disappear before it embarrassed her. Seventeen years of tension, of space, of assumptions. Of telling herself Rio wouldn’t change because she never had. That no one could be that stubborn and still become someone new.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio had. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha was still learning how to move again. Still tangled in what those seventeen years had done to her. Still trying to figure out what kind of version of herself could exist now, after some of the dust had settled.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio was patient. Not hovering. Not pushing. Just there. And she would wait. For as long as Agatha needed her to.</p><p> </p><p>And for now, that was enough.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke up to her alarm at noon, groaning as she smacked her phone off the nightstand and blinked up at the ceiling. First shift of three. That meant she had just enough time to get her life in order before surrendering it to the hospital for the next few nights.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>She had about four hours to shower, grocery shop, and maybe meal prep for the weekend if she was feeling ambitious. With any luck, Agatha could finish early and squeeze in a solid hour or two of unproductive couch rotting before having to pull herself together for work.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha swung her legs over the side of the bed and sat there for a moment. Waking up always felt like a negotiation. Her body usually cooperated. Her brain, however, always took a bit more convincing.</p><p> </p><p>With one long, obnoxious groan, Agatha leaned over, grabbed her phone from where it had slipped off the nightstand, and trudged downstairs.</p><p> </p><p>On her way to the kitchen, Agatha passed the guest bathroom, when a sliver of light spilling into the hallway made her pause. The light was left on from the night before.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>She reached in, hand automatically going for the light switch, but stopped short when she saw a sticky note that was stuck perfectly to the edge of the mirror- purple, small, and unmistakably Rio’s handwriting.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s stomach did a stupid, flip thing.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>She stepped fully into the bathroom and peeled the note from the mirror, careful not to wrinkle it.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p align="left"><em> Sunlight’s overrated. I’ll plant shade lovers. </em><em>They still bloom… </em> <em> And are very much worth the effort 🖤</em></p><p align="left">
<em>                                                   -  R </em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the sticky note.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Jesus Christ.” She mumbled, reading it again for the third time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha read it again. Then once more, just to be sure it still made her stomach twist in that way she hated.</p><p> </p><p>Great. Now she was smiling.</p><p> </p><p>Only a little. Just enough to be annoyed at herself.</p><p>Agatha slid the sticky note carefully into the pocket of her sweatpants. Then she turned off the bathroom light and headed to the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped a pod into the Keurig and hit the button. While it churned to life, she pulled out her phone. She typed slowly, letting her thumb hover for a second before finishing the sentence.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> How are your ears feeling? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hit send and locked her phone.</p><p> </p><p>The Keurig finished with a final sputter and she drank it standing by the counter, not bothering to sit or pretend she had more time than she did. She had work tonight. A grocery run to fit in before that.</p><p> </p><p>Once the cup was empty, Agatha set it in the sink and headed upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>Somewhere in between tugging off her sweatshirt and reaching for a towel, she pulled the sticky note from her pocket and, without thinking much about it, stuck it to the bathroom mirror. The glass was already starting to fog. She pressed the paper flat with the heel of her hand, just enough to make sure it stayed.</p><p> </p><p>By the time she stepped back, her reflection was already starting to blur, and the note had become the clearest thing in the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t think about it.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha got all her shit done and collapsed into her sacred rot time on the couch- blanket slipping off her legs, some Bravo monstrosity droning in the background, and no plans to move unless her house caught on fire.</p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzed twice against her thigh.</p><p> </p><p>Two notifications. Both from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>The first was a photo- taken from a ridiculous angle, Rio’s arm stretched high. She was still in bed, hair twisted into a slept-on ponytail, one eye shut, head tilted just enough to show off one of her new piercings. She wore a faded black t-shirt with Audrey II from <em> Little Shop of Horrors </em> grinning across the front.</p><p> </p><p>Of course. The carnivorous plant thing. Agatha had no idea when the obsession started, but she’d learned not to ask questions about Rio’s taste for morally ambiguous flora.</p><p> </p><p>Beneath the photo:</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio: a little tender. makes me look hot af. 10/10 would let you stab me again. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha: Careful. I’ll take you up on that. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio: on second thought… i think i’m good :)  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio: save your energy. once these piercings debut i’m expecting at least three brawls and one marriage proposal by midnight. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha: Better make sure the ER is prepped. I’ve got excellent aim🔪🔪🩸🩸 </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio: so hot </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was still deciding whether or not to respond to Rio’s text when the most cursed name in her contacts covered her screen.</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Wanda M.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha loudly groaned into the air and rolled onto to her stomach, limbs sprawled across the couch, irritated that Wanda still had access to her number and that she’d interrupted what had been, up until now, a very decent evening before work.</p><p> </p><p>She let it ring. She hadn’t spoken to Wanda in months. She’d ignored the last round of erratic texts and saw no reason to reward this latest intrusion with an answer. </p><p> </p><p>Still, Agatha wasn’t sure how close she was to actually blocking her. The impulse came very often, followed by the stupid moral calculus of whether thirteen years entitled Wanda to one final conversation. Something along the lines of:<em> Free me from whatever this fucking post divorce purgatory is before I scorch what little civility we have left. </em></p><p> </p><p>The second call came a minute later. Same name. Same number. Same rising pressure at the back of her skull. Agatha let it ring again while she shoved her face into a pillow and yelled until the sound scraped her throat.</p><p> </p><p>When it stopped, she didn’t move. She waited, breathing through her teeth, hoping that was the end of it.</p><p> </p><p>It buzzed again. Then again. Two short, separate jolts. Not a call. Two texts.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha decided to check, not because she thought Wanda had suddenly learned impulse control, but because there was a chance it wasn’t her. A small, stupid, wishful chance.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew better. But she checked anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Much to her disappointment, it was exactly who she thought it was.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The second the pictures loaded, Agatha knew they were from Jen’s Facebook. 70s Night at The Witches’ Road. Wanda hadn’t even bothered to crop them.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Sloppy. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The first photo was a group shot. Everyone else was smiling for the camera, drinks held up, arms slung around shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone except for two people.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Uh oh. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was leaned in, clearly whispering something into Rio’s ear. Her brown eyes were on the table, but her mouth had started to curl like she was about to laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the picture.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Yeah. Well. That might be a little damning. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The second picture was objectively worse.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was smirking straight into the camera. Both hands were resting lightly on Rio’s shoulders. Her cape, sheer and glittering, was lifted and blocking most of their upper bodies.  Rio had her hood up, and through the shimmer of fabric, her arms were crossed tightly, as if she didn’t trust her hands and needed them tucked away to behave. She wasn’t looking at the camera.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was looking at her.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t neutral. It wasn’t friendly. It was that stupid, tiny smile- barely there, lips just beginning to curve, eyes soft lidded and steady. The expression on Rio’s face felt impossibly intimate, especially in a photo that wasn’t supposed to look like anything at all.</p><p> </p><p>That smile didn’t belong in pictures. It was private. Something Agatha had only ever seen when they were alone, never offered to anyone else, never meant to be witnessed from the outside.</p><p> </p><p>And she had always known it was hers. Not wished. Not hoped. Known.</p><p> </p><p>To see it captured like this, visible, exposed, sent back to Agatha without context or warning, felt indecent- less like a memory and more like a secret someone else had gotten their hands on.</p><p> </p><p>It was right after they’d come back inside from eating each other’s faces off.</p><p> </p><p>Jen had drunkenly screamed at them for a photo while they were still riding the high of breaking a seventeen year losing streak. Rio pulled her hood up, maybe to hide her face, maybe just to retreat a little. Judging by the look she was caught wearing, it hadn’t fucking helped.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had left not long after. She didn’t trust herself to stay. Not with Rio looking at her like that. Not with the taste of her still everywhere.</p><p> </p><p>And now, staring at the photo, she could still see it. The flush in Rio’s lips, the slight swelling, the unmistakable aftermath of something that didn’t belong to anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzed in her hands, and she flinched, only then realizing she had been zoomed in on Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>And for one deeply humiliating second, Agatha actually thanked her ex-wife for interrupting what had clearly been a very normal, very casual moment of hyper focusing on her best friend’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>Then she read Wanda’s text.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda M.: Didn’t realize you were still feeding strays… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a furious, disbelieving, “Oooooh,” as her thumbs flew across the screen, hammering out a response with enough force to threaten the lifespan of her purple iPhone’s screen protector.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha: Projection’s a hell of a thing, Wanda.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha: There’s only one stray clawing at my door these days, and she doesn’t know when to fucking quit. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha: I’ll spare you the suspense. It’s you!  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha: xoxo  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha: … bitch! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha immediately texted Jen: <em> Block her. </em> Then she opened her dusty, barely used Facebook and blocked Wanda. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slapped her phone face down on the coffee table and stormed off to get ready for work, muttering the whole way about how her rot time had been ruined. </p><p> </p><p>Which, to be fair, she hadn’t had much rot time left. Twelve minutes, give or take- but now the vibes were contaminated, and there was no salvaging them. The air felt different. Her couch felt different. Everything was tainted, and she blamed Wanda completely.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was charting. Jen, who had claimed one of the parent recliners behind her, had a juice box she’d stolen from the nutrition room and was sipping it obnoxiously loud while watching Agatha with the blank eyed intensity of a cat about to knock something off a shelf.</p><p> </p><p>“Your posture is terrible,” Jen said between slurps. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. Just kept typing, jaw tight, chart half finished and mind ten miles elsewhere.</p><p> </p><p>It was creeping up on 4am, x-ray had already come and gone, and to Agatha’s inexplicable disappointment, it had been Teen assigned to the NICU that night.</p><p> </p><p>“So you were talking about Wanda, right?” Jen asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused mid charting, turned halfway in her seat. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“That text you sent me earlier. All it said was ‘block her.’ I assumed you meant Wanda?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared. Blinked. Then delivered the flattest, driest look she could possibly summon. </p><p> </p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen raised a brow. “I don’t know. You could’ve been talking about Ri-”</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>There wasn’t even a beat between the suggestion and Agatha shutting it down.</p><p> </p><p>Jen sat up a little straighter. “Did something happen between you two?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sputtered. Actually sputtered. “Wh-” She coughed once, tried to mask it as a casual laugh, and failed so fucking miserably. “No. Why-” Another shaky little noise that came out deeply guilty sounding. “Why would you even ask that?”</p><p> </p><p>And then Agatha’s voice flattened, “Did she say something to you?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen narrowed her eyes. “Okay. Yeah. You’re going to give me every single detail.”</p><p> </p><p>“There are no details.”</p><p> </p><p>“Liar.”</p><p> </p><p>“I pierced her ears.”</p><p> </p><p>“And?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Liar.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not-”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes you are.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m really not-”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose and hissed out, between clenched jaw, “Fine. We fucking kissed.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen sat up like someone had dumped ice water down her shirt. “Oh my god.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her.</p><p> </p><p>Jen said it again, louder, “Oh my god, Agatha. That’s great!”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, great. That tone. Like it was cute. Like it hadn’t detonated seventeen years of carefully compartmentalized bullshit in one stupid kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Jen immediately backtracked. “That is great... isn’t it? Wait. Did it suck?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“It did not suck,” she said through clenched teeth. “Quite the fucking opposite.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s jaw dropped slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“And that’s the fucking problem, Jennifer.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could’ve said a hundred things- biting, sarcastic, safe. But none of them felt right. Or true. So she gave the smallest shrug she could manage without looking like she cared.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p> </p><p>“You still in denial?”</p><p> </p><p>And what a fucking loaded question- and not for the first time.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t afford to say it out loud. It was too new. Too uncertain. Saying anything now might turn it into something it wasn’t ready to be. Something Agatha wasn't ready for it to be. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m in denial about a lot of things,” Agatha said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>It was the closest thing to the truth she could give… again. </p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t say anything right away. Agatha could hear the faint rustle of her shifting in the recliner, the subtle squeak of vinyl as she sat up a little straighter.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha… you’ve been in lo-“</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swiveled her chair back around and tried to focus on the chart in front of her. “Don’t get sappy on me now, Jen.”</p><p> </p><p>And Jen, to her credit, didn’t say anything else. Just took another long, obnoxious sip of juice and let Agatha pretend her hands weren’t shaking.</p><p> </p><p>Some things weren’t ready for daylight. Not yet.</p><p> </p><p>But that didn’t mean they wouldn’t grow.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio met her outside the NICU Saturday morning after shift change with a bottle of Diet Coke in hand. Agatha’s shift had been shit- her ex-wife had set the tone for it early, and it never really recovered. And the absence of Rio, even if it wasn’t supposed to matter, had only made it worse. But there she was. Asking how the night went. Offering to scold whichever baby had been causing Agatha trouble. Agatha laughed. She didn’t say what really made the shift unbearable. Didn’t say she’d wanted to see her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked her all the way to her car. Told her she’d see her in twelve hours. Agatha groaned and told her not to remind her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went home. Slept. Came back.</p><p> </p><p>That night, she texted Rio -<em> Break in 20 </em>- and didn’t really think about what she expected. Rio was already waiting outside when she got there. They shared a cigarette and talked about a trauma case- motorcycle, crushed leg, Rio describing the way the bones moved when she lifted it. Agatha nearly gagged. Rio looked smug about it. </p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Rio walked her to her car again.</p><p> </p><p>On Sunday, she came up to x-ray the babies. Caught Agatha’s eye more than once, and didn’t bother pretending not to. At some point, when things slowed down in the department, Rio came back -not with a machine, just herself- and dropped into one of the parent recliners at Agatha’s bedspace. Said they weren’t busy, and she had time. Agatha didn’t mind. She charted, she worked, she answered when Rio said something. It wasn’t a big deal. But it was… nice. Welcomed, even.</p><p> </p><p>Every time Agatha caught a glimpse of Rio’s freshly pierced ears, something in her chest pulled tight. Not because of the piercings themselves, but because she’d done them. Her hands. Her choice. Hers. It had been hers. Brief, and maybe a accident, but hers all the same. And now it was walking around the hospital like proof. Proof she’d let something happen. Proof she’d wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>It was stupid. And fleeting. And completely impossible to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t let herself think about it too hard. She just wanted to be around Rio without turning it into anything.</p><p> </p><p>None of it was a big deal.</p><p> </p><p>Not really.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha’s alarm went off at noon on Monday. She groaned and thrashed in bed, caught somewhere between exhaustion and rage. Her body ached from the weekend -three brutal night shifts back to back- and the nap she'd taken after getting home hadn’t come close to fixing it.</p><p> </p><p>She trudged downstairs, whining with every step. She made her coffee in silence, barely awake enough to press the right buttons.</p><p> </p><p>Then she collapsed onto the couch, remote already in hand, and turned on a Real Housewives franchise at random. She didn’t bother checking which one. She let it play, loud enough to keep her from dozing off again. She knew if she slept any longer, she’d wake up feeling worse.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s phone started ringing, and the sound of it was fucking unbearable. She felt it in her skull, in her teeth, behind her eyes- like it was drilling straight into her nervous system. She groaned and leaned forward, reaching for it where it buzzed across the coffee table.</p><p> </p><p>“Please don’t be my ex-wife. Please don’t be my ex-wife. Please don’t be my ex-wife,” she muttered, dragging herself upright.</p><p> </p><p>She flipped the phone over and to her surprise, it wasn’t Wanda. It was an incoming FaceTime call from Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha answered and was immediately greeted by the top half of Rio’s face, her forehead far too close to the camera.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“What,” Agatha said, not bothering to sound polite.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you wanna hang out with me today?” Rio asked, voice slow and syrupy with sleep. At the end of the sentence, she lifted her chin just enough to flash a tight, toothy smile before sinking back down, hiding everything below her eyes again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Depends. What were you thinking?”</p><p> </p><p>“They just opened the pool at my apartment,” Rio said. “I want to rot in the sun while no one’s out there.” She blinked at the camera, then away. “Would you like to join me, goose?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squinted. “Goose?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a tired hum. “Yeah. ‘Cause you’re grumpy.” She rubbed at her face like it would help her stay conscious. “Grumpy goose.” As if it was obvious.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, whenever she was sleep deprived, had the unfortunate habit of being impossibly… endearing. She always used to get quiet and mumbly and strangely sweet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, fully accepted her role as the most irritable bird in the flock.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed. “What time?”</p><p> </p><p>Not because she couldn’t be alone. She loved being alone. Thrived in it. She was simply… outsourcing her rot today. That was allowed.</p><p> </p><p>“Whenever,” Rio murmured.</p><p> </p><p>“How far are you from me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Thirteen minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Send me the address. I’ll be there in twenty five.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yay,” Rio said, without an ounce of enthusiasm, and Agatha understood perfectly.</p><p> </p><p>They were both too tired to fake it. That was the whole point. Post night shift, nothing felt real anyway. Words came out slower. Time got weird. Agatha didn’t need conversation or plans or anything that resembled effort. Just someone else who knew what it meant to still hear monitor beeps in your head hours after clocking out. Someone who wouldn’t flinch if she went completely still and stared at the sky like it held answers. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha could pretend that wasn’t what she needed. She’d done worse.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dug her swimsuit out from the back of her closet, buried beneath a stack of clothes she hadn’t touched since she moved back. A purple bikini. She held it up, gave it a quick once over, then stripped down and pulled it on.</p><p> </p><p>She looked at herself in her bathroom mirror.</p><p> </p><p>Yeah. She looked fucking hot.</p><p> </p><p>Not in the wishful way. Not in the maybe if she tilts her head and squints way. It was fact. Her skin was soft and flushed from the shower. She looked alive. Solid. And just vain enough to know she didn’t need anyone else to confirm it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha applied her sunscreen alone in the bathroom, careful to get her shoulders and back. She absolutely could have asked Rio to do it for her. She absolutely wanted to. But she wasn’t going to hand herself over that easily. Not today.</p><p> </p><p>They were friends.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes flicked to the sticky note still stuck to the corner of her mirror. Agatha closed them for a second and repeated it to herself like a mantra.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed the lie to stay true a little longer. Just until she figured out what the hell she was doing.</p><p> </p><p>She packed fast. Towel, sunscreen, change of clothes, hair tie, water bottle. Threw it all in a canvas tote. Then she pulled on an old oversized t-shirt, slid on her sandals, and headed out.</p><p> </p><p>The drive to Rio’s was short. But the second she pulled up to the building, she clocked the difference. This place was far nicer than the last one Rio lived in. Gated, clean, almost too polished. She pulled up to the callbox, punched in the four digit code, hit the star key. The gate buzzed and swung open.</p><p> </p><p>Inside, she found Rio’s building, parked in the guest lot, and shot off a quick <em>H</em> <em> urry up </em> text to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio appeared a few minutes later, and Agatha stepped out of the car to meet her, bag over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>She looked exactly how Agatha expected her to- oversized t-shirt, sunglasses halfway down her nose, flip flops barely making a sound. A towel was draped over one arm, a small cooler slung across her shoulder with a faded rainbow strap, and a travel cup in her free hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked good.</p><p> </p><p>Annoyingly good.</p><p> </p><p>Not that it mattered. Agatha barely noticed. Didn’t care. She barely even fucking looked.</p><p> </p><p>And if Agatha’s fingers twitched with the urge to fix her sunglasses, that was no one’s business but hers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunted a greeting. </p><p> </p><p>Rio, without saying anything, handed over the cup.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it?” Agatha asked, taking it without hesitation, falling into step beside her.</p><p> </p><p>“Espresso. Promise it’s stronger than whatever you make with that Keurig.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a sip. She paused.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit. That’s good.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “It should be. That machine is the most expensive thing in my kitchen.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond.</p><p> </p><p>The walk to the pool was quiet. Neither of them had the energy to fake being awake. Their steps dragged. Their brains were still loading.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt just the edge of Rio’s hand brushing against hers. She glanced sideways. Rio was biting the inside of her lip, eyes ahead, brows drawn like she was deep in thought or trying not to be. Agatha told herself it was accidental.</p><p> </p><p>Then it happened again. Slower this time. More intentional.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head the other way, pretending to look at nothing, and let her finger skim the back of Rio’s hand. </p><p> </p><p>It didn’t count if she didn’t look.</p><p> </p><p>By the time either of them might’ve said or done something, they were already at the gate.</p><p> </p><p>The pool was nicer than Agatha expected. Sleek, bright, unnervingly pristine. A wide, shallow step spanned the far end, deep enough to let water glide over the tiles and lap at the bases of loungers that were built in. Beyond that, the pool slipped into a deeper blue. Still. Clear. Not a single ripple. No movement, no voices, no sound except for the distant hum of the heat and the faint scuff of their footsteps.</p><p> </p><p>It was completely empty.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Thank fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha claimed a table under an umbrella and dropped her bag onto it. Rio did the same- but in one blink, her t-shirt and flip flops were gone, peeled off and discarded in one smooth motion, and she was already walking toward the loungers, bare shoulders catching the sun, tan skin golden and glowing and absolutely not giving Agatha a second to prepare.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed under her breath. Rude. Honestly rude. She didn’t even get the satisfaction of watching her undress- didn’t get a single gratuitous second to linger, to drag her eyes up inch by slow inch of newly exposed- </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her gaze drop anyway, and all that annoyance vanished.</p><p> </p><p>The black bikini Rio wore was almost laughably minimal- nothing but thin straps up top and, below, a thong bottom that did absolutely nothing to protect Agatha’s sanity. The fabric curved high on Rio’s hips and disappeared entirely in the back, leaving the full view of her ass on unapologetic display. There was no room for modesty. No room for Agatha to look without consequences.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s tongue pressed into the inside of her cheek. Her eyes stayed locked on Rio’s ass, helpless. Her hands twitched at her sides. Desperate to follow.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t move, but the pull was visceral, dragging her forward in spirit if not in flesh- like a lamb to slaughter, holy and doomed, too far gone to pretend she wouldn’t kneel.</p><p> </p><p>A tiny, unbidden whimper clawed its way out of Agatha’s throat before she could stop it.</p><p> </p><p>This was fine. Normal. Agatha could exist in the same zip code as that ass without losing her grip on reality. She could be cool. Casual. Normal.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha should really look away. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t. </p><p> </p><p>She needed a minute. Maybe several.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally settled into one of the loungers, legs stretched out and Agatha had never been more jealous of a goddamn piece of furniture in her life.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look. Not at first. She busied herself with nothing- adjusting her sunglasses, smoothing the hem of her shirt, pretending the view didn’t exist.</p><p> </p><p>But she could feel it. She always could.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her eyes low as long as she could, but the weight of it pressed against her until she caved and glanced up- </p><p> </p><p>Rio was already looking at her.</p><p> </p><p>Sunglasses slid halfway down her nose, brows arched just enough to ask a question she had no intention of saying out loud. Her mouth twitched, not quite a smirk. Relaxed. Confident.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh fuuuuuuuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could’ve ignored it. Looked away. Played dumb.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she reached for the hem of her shirt and started to peel it off, slow and methodical. Not for effect. Not to flirt. Just to prove she could. The fabric clung to her for half a second before giving way, sliding over her ribs, her chest, her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>By the time the shirt cleared her head, Rio’s gaze was glued to her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio licked her lips.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t purposeful. It wasn’t a move. Just instinct. A flash of tongue, barely there, quick and unconscious and somehow worse because of it. That single flash of tongue had Agatha’s brain shorting out entirely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to press her palms against untouched skin that had haunted her for years. To stake some long overdue claim on what always should’ve belonged to her. To make sure no one else ever- </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Get a grip. Get a fucking grip. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She dragged her gaze away from Rio and started toward the lounger beside her, trying not to trip over every thought currently screaming inside her head.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped into the lounger with a dramatic grunt, limbs sprawled,  surrendering to the sun instead of the situation.</p><p> </p><p>“You good?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Yep,” Agatha said, eyes pinned to the sky.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel Rio’s brown eyes boring holes into the side of her skull. The full turn of her head, the deliberate silence- it was all so pointed it might as well have been spoken. Agatha could practically hear the smirk forming. Tongue against cheek. That stupid fucking tell Rio had never grown out of.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t see you put on sunscreen.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Here we go.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth pulled into a smirk before she could stop it.</p><p> </p><p>Of course that was the first thing out of Rio Vidal’s fucking mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had put it on at home -alone, in the bathroom, twisting to reach her back like an idiot- because it had felt like the smart thing to do. Her brain had made that call hours ago- before Rio’s face, her voice, and her insane ass had entered the equation. Now she was sitting here, half naked, bathed in sunlight and suddenly regretting every responsible decision she'd made before walking out the door.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t glance over. Just let the silence hang between them- almost daring Rio to fill it.</p><p> </p><p><em>Let her look, </em>Agatha’s brain whispered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slid deeper into the lounger, arms stretching overhead, spine arching just slightly as she adjusted her weight. One leg bent at the knee, casual. Thoughtless. A move meant to get comfortable, except she knew exactly what it looked like.</p><p> </p><p>Just enough to make Agatha feel a little less stupid for doing everything right and still wanting to be touched.</p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha turned her head and looked at Rio, tight smile, “Already applied.” her voice light and immediately looked back up at the sky.</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio could say anything else, Agatha tipped her head back and looked up at the sky again- casual, dismissive, pretending the conversation bored her.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>But that wasn’t the point.</p><p> </p><p>“Reapply,” Rio said. Her voice was slow, bored, like the offer had just occurred to her. “I’ll help.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m good.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked once. Her smile didn’t falter, but it froze- just a fraction too still. And then she looked away. She sank back into her lounger, casual, but her hands gave her away. They twitched once. Restless. Unused.</p><p> </p><p>One full second of silence later:</p><p> </p><p>“You sure?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Positive.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Right. Of course.” She crossed one ankle over the other. Her jaw worked. Like she was chewing on the words she wasn’t saying.</p><p> </p><p>Another pause, equally stupid:</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, not to brag,” Rio said, voice lighter again, “but I am exceptionally talented with sunscreen. It’s a skill, actually. Artful. Controlled. Even coverage.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed in response, not trying to hide her amusement. She turned on her side to face Rio, one arm tucked beneath her head. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t say anything.</p><p> </p><p>Just looked at Rio. Let her talk. Let her fill the silence with nonsense and jokes and whatever this nervous energy she was trying to cover.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe Agatha should’ve cut it off. Should’ve made a comment. Should’ve protected herself.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Because maybe, for once, she just wanted to stay here. Inside a world where Rio was allowed to want her. Where Rio looked at her like that and didn’t try to hide it. Where Agatha didn’t have to shrink or laugh it off or be the one who wanted more.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Agatha just wanted to know what it felt like to be wanted like this. Openly. Clumsily. Sweetly.</p><p> </p><p>To pretend this wasn’t new. That it hadn’t felt like it had taken a fucking lifetime to get here.</p><p> </p><p>So she let it happen.</p><p> </p><p>Let Rio ramble. Something about being an x-ray tech and knowing too much about radiation, so sunscreen was a moral duty. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t interrupt, didn’t fight the slow smile tugging at her mouth. And Rio, who caught it like a gift she wasn’t sure she deserved, went pink- blushing, embarrassed by her own stupidity and the fact that Agatha hadn’t looked away.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>As Rio launched into a rant about SPF ratings and preventable skin damage, hands fidgeting in her lap like she was trying not to reach. Agatha stretched her arm across the gap between their loungers and teasingly flicked at Rio’s fingers. </p><p> </p><p>She started to pull her hand back, but Rio caught it and guided it down to rest on her thigh. Agatha let it stay, her thumb brushing back and forth while Rio kept talking.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They ended up in the pool a little later, the water just above their waists. Agatha leaned back against the wall, letting the sun hit her face. Beside her, Rio faced the ledge, beer in one hand, phone in the other, the screen tilted just out of the sun. From the angle -and the muttering- Agatha could tell she was playing Connections, the New York Times word game where you grouped words into sets of four. Simple in theory. Mostly designed to piss people off.</p><p> </p><p>“‘Not Quite’ and ‘Warm’ have to go together… right?” Rio said under her breath. Her other arm stayed braced against the cement as she kept sorting tiles.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha noticed a woman passing outside the gate, walking a dog. Her gaze lingered for a second too long before moving on.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha glanced to the side. Just to double check that the water still covered what needed covering. That Rio’s ass wasn’t suddenly on full display for some random stranger and her golden retriever. </p><p> </p><p>That Rio, in her microscopic fucking bikini and complete lack of spatial awareness, wasn’t unintentionally putting on a show.</p><p> </p><p>It was. Barely.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t like Agatha minded other people looking. Rio had always been…lookable. That was just a fact.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just didn’t think a random woman walking her dog should get the same view she’d spent seventeen years earning by sheer endurance alone.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> You know. Seniority.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away before she could think too hard about why she cared. Or why she suddenly wanted to build a twelve foot privacy fence around the pool.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha started to feel cold.</p><p> </p><p>That was the only reason. Or it was the easiest one to reach for. The sun was still high, the water warm, but her skin prickled anyway. Something about the breeze, maybe.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved closer until the side of her body pressed up against Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>The sudden contact had Rio straighten a little. Then she looked over at Agatha- eyebrows raised, mouth twitching at the corners. She didn’t say anything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t acknowledge her. She grabbed the bottle out of Rio’s hand, took a swig, then shoved it back without a word.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re overthinking it. It’s ‘Not Quite,’ ‘Warm,’ ‘Close,’ and ‘Almost,’” Agatha said finally, eyes still forward. “Stuff people say when they want you to keep trying.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at her, tongue pressed into her cheek like she was turning something over in her head. Agatha heard the quiet clink of her setting the bottle down, the dull tap of her phone beside it. Then Rio stepped in front of her.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t meet her eyes. She focused just past her shoulder, anywhere but Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Something in Agatha’s brain told her to move. <em> Swim. Get out while you still can. Before you forget how. Before you stop wanting safety more than you want her. </em></p><p> </p><p>Because wanting Rio had never been safe. It was the deep end without warning. No ledge to brace against. No solid ground under her feet. </p><p> </p><p>And for years, Agatha had taught herself how to survive it- how to tread water, keep her head above surface, hold her breath, and pretend she didn’t feel the pull building beneath her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha was tired. Her limbs ached from years of keeping herself afloat. She didn’t want the distance anymore. She didn’t want to keep pretending that effort was safety, or that staying above it meant she wasn’t already in too deep.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to tread water anymore. She wanted to let go of the surface. To sink, if that’s what this was. To stop resisting the current if Rio was the one waiting at the bottom.</p><p> </p><p>She looked at Rio and braced for a ruthless undercurrent.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t moving. Just watching her. Eyes fixed on her mouth like it was already a confession, like she could hear everything Agatha hadn’t said. There was something steady in it- something dangerous in how quiet she was being. It wasn’t a stare that asked permission. It was a warning.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze climbed, slow, until it met Agatha’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“You think it’s time to reapply sunscreen?” Rio murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt it then- that slow, creeping fullness in her chest. Like her lungs were filling with water. She swallowed hard, voice barely catching.</p><p> </p><p>“Not quite,” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p><em> Stuff people say when they want you to keep trying, </em> she thought.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward, and suddenly their bodies were flush. Agatha’s breath caught at the sheer lack of fabric between them- Rio’s swimsuit barely there, her thigh brushing Agatha’s, her chest pressed close enough to steal the rest of her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands twitched. They wanted to slide to Rio’s hips, to grip bare skin where that ridiculous thong bikini didn’t cover anything. But she didn’t move. Her fingers stayed locked around the edge of the pool, elbows digging hard into the cement like if she let go, she’d disappear under water.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached up- one hand at Agatha’s cheek, the other curling behind her neck, steady and certain. Agatha’s eyes squeezed shut. Her pulse, once loud and panicked, began to slip into something slower. Heavier. Like everything inside her was sinking, pulling downward by something she didn’t want to fight.</p><p> </p><p>The effort of staying above water, <em> above this </em>, suddenly felt pointless. With Rio that close, the surface wasn’t something she wanted anymore.</p><p> </p><p><em> Swim!  </em> Her brain screamed it. <em> Swim, now. Swim fast. You’re drowning. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled her head back just enough to try and get Agatha to look at her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t let the current take Agatha slowly.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the water rush in. Let it flood her lungs. She never wanted to hear her name spoken any other way. Not ever again. She opened her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>And when she did, she was already being pulled under- willingly, stupidly, beautifully. Not fast enough. Not enough to satisfy the years of silence between them. She needed Rio to keep looking at her like that. To keep saying things she shouldn’t. To keep cracking open every place Agatha had sealed off.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha was going to drown, it had to be like this. Brutal. Beautiful. And by Rio’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t stop thinking about it,” Rio whispered, her thumb dragging across Agatha’s bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t mean to make a sound, but she did. The smallest whimper, slipping out before she could catch it.</p><p> </p><p>The space between them vanished one inch at a time, until Agatha could feel the heat of Rio's breath, and could count the seconds she had left to decide.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. Her body was no longer interested in escape.</p><p> </p><p>Their lips met- soft at first. Not all at once, but close. Just enough for Rio's mouth to brush against Agatha’s. A whisper of contact. Testing.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio pulled back half an inch, breath slipping out of her in a shaky, uneven exhale.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands, still gripping the ledge behind her, went slack.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her again, more confident this time, and Agatha felt it everywhere- at the base of her spine, in the bend of her knees, in the hollow part of her chest that had never stopped aching for this. She opened to it slowly, like the water she’d been trying not to drown in had finally gotten past her lips. She parted them, let Rio kiss her like she meant it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned, helpless, almost pained, at the way Agatha’s mouth gave way.</p><p> </p><p>She tilted Agatha’s face, just slightly, and kissed her deeper.</p><p> </p><p>There was nothing rushed about it. Just care. Hesitation. Want, edged with disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the way Rio's tongue slipped into her mouth like a question- gentle, searching, almost too careful. Like Rio was still afraid the permission might be taken back. Like she couldn’t believe she was being allowed to taste her like this a second time.</p><p> </p><p>And God, Agatha could feel it- how much Rio wanted this, how much she needed it to be enough. How Rio kissed her like she was trying to remember everything at once. Every place she’d missed. Every inch she’d never been given.</p><p> </p><p>It was different from the first.</p><p> </p><p>That first kiss had been fast, urgent, and almost clumsy in its need. They’d crashed into each other, desperate to make up for lost time, to learn every part of each other’s mouth they’d gone too long without. It hadn’t mattered what it looked like. Only what it sounded like. The breathless gasps. The swallowed moans. The quiet, stunned noises they hadn’t known the other could make.</p><p> </p><p>But this- </p><p><br/>This was slower.</p><p> </p><p>This was intentional in every way that made Agatha ache.</p><p> </p><p>She felt it in the way Rio moved, in every careful shift of her mouth. She was still learning, still hungry, but she wasn’t rushing. She was memorizing. Tracing the shape of Agatha’s lips like she wanted to be able to draw them from memory.</p><p> </p><p>It was intimate in a way Agatha hadn’t prepared for. </p><p> </p><p>She let herself be kissed like that. Thoroughly. Reverently. Like Rio was tasting the ruins of something she thought she’d never find.</p><p> </p><p>They weren’t kissing like it was new. They were kissing like they’d already drowned and decided to build something down there anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Their own Atlantis. Unbreathable. Beautiful. Quiet.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha let go- and let the current pull her under completely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her deeper, sucking on Rio’s tongue before pushing her own forward. Their mouths stayed open, breath tangled between them as they leaned into each other, bodies shifting in sync. It was a give and take, neither of them fully in control, something between chasing and being caught.</p><p> </p><p>She needed Rio in a way that felt impossible. Her hands found her hips, fingers curling tight, thumbs pressed into bone hoping they might root her there, keep her from reaching further. But Agatha’s hands had been twitching from the second she saw her- since that first look at Rio’s ass in that damn bikini. </p><p> </p><p>It was right there. Bare. Obvious. Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched. Just once. Just enough to betray her. Any lower, and she wouldn’t be able to pretend she hadn’t meant it.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could stop herself, Rio shifted. Her hips pressed forward into Agatha’s front, like she knew exactly where Agatha’s hands had wanted to go. It wasn’t bold. It wasn’t showy. It was worse than that.</p><p> </p><p>It was quiet and confident. Rio wasn’t just pressing. She was calling Agatha’s bluff. Urging Agatha to stop pretending.</p><p> </p><p>The friction dragged a groan from Agatha’s mouth and pulled a soft gasp from Rio’s in return.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s thumbnails dug into Rio’s hips beneath the water, hard enough to leave a reminder. She needed something to stop her fingers from slipping lower, even though every inch of her was begging for it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed into her again.  The force of it pushed Agatha back into the ledge, her spine scraping against concrete. It stung. It helped. Her breath hitched in her throat, and she caught Rio’s bottom lip between her teeth and licked across the full length of it shamelessly, before diving back into her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>This time, Rio fought her for it. She kissed Agatha harder, rising onto her toes, shifting her body closer until every part of her was speaking loud and clear.</p><p> </p><p>Her hips tipped forward again, pressing into the space Agatha refused to take, and stayed there. Agatha could feel the invitation in every inch of her. The way Rio pushed close and held still. It was patient. It was a body that had nothing left to prove, and still chose to ask.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha’s hands were burning with the answer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio brought both hands to her face, cupped her cheeks like she couldn’t stand the distance, and kissed Agatha again as she dropped back onto flat feet. Her hips drove forward at the same time, harder this time, deliberate and filthy. A whine cracked out of Rio, high and rough, and she didn’t bother to hide it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard it for what it was. A plea from Rio. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Stop holding yourself back. It’s yours to touch. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved her hands moved to Rio’s ass, underwater and unashamed, fingers spreading across skin she’d spent years trying not to touch. She grabbed hard, no hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Her breath caught. Not because it was surprising -she’d imagined this more times than she could count- but because the reality was far better than anything she could’ve made up in the dark.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha filled her palms completely, adjusting her grip like she was trying to get it right, trying to match memory to muscle. It didn’t line up. The real thing was warmer. Softer. Heavier. Unbelievably close. Her thumbs swept along the top, pressed in, gripped harder. Her fingers flexed. Agatha felt the shift of muscle, the curve she’d memorized with her eyes but never her hands.</p><p> </p><p>She squeezed. Rio gasped into her mouth. Agatha didn’t stop. She kept touching, kept learning, because she couldn’t stop. She wanted to laugh. Or cry. Or drag her nails across skin and make Rio gasp again, just to hear it.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, Agatha pulled Rio closer.</p><p> </p><p>Their hips met with more force, water sloshing between them, and Agatha moaned into her mouth, helpless and grateful and furious with how long they had waited to do this.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t let go.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t sure she could.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was the one who pulled away. Barely. Just enough to breathe. Her hands stayed where they were, cupping Agatha’s face, fingers warm against her cheeks. Her thumbs brushing just under her eyes like she needed to know this was real. She didn’t step back. Didn’t try to move. She just looked at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Their breathing was ragged. Sharp and uneven, and comes only after you’ve gone too deep, stayed under too long, and come up with no grace at all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lungs burned.</p><p> </p><p>Not just from the lack of oxygen, but from everything else- what she’d been holding back, what she’d finally let herself have. Her grip on Rio didn’t loosen. Her hands were still firm around her ass, submerged and certain, fingers aching from how tightly she’d held on.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t move. Couldn’t. Wouldn’t. Not when her heart was still thudding in her chest, not when Rio’s body was still warm against hers, not when she could feel every place their skin touched and every place it still wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up, soft and wide, lips parted, chest rising too fast. Her hands slid down to Agatha’s shoulders and she leaned in until their foreheads touched.</p><p> </p><p>Her breath escaped on a laugh. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t smooth. It caught in the middle like it surprised her. The corners of her mouth pulled up into a smile that looked too big for her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the sound of it more than she heard it, their bodies still close, her grip still locked on Rio’s ass.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stayed there, breathing through the smile, not pulling away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move either.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio had invited her up to her apartment casually. Agatha had said yes. Told herself it was because she was nosey. Because she wanted to see where Rio lived now. Where she went home to at the end of the day. She wanted to know if Rio still flipped light switches with the back of her knuckles, if her taste in furniture had changed or if Agatha’s absence still lived in the negative space.</p><p> </p><p>They walked in silence for a bit, the wet heat of the afternoon still clinging to their skin. Rio broke it by pointing out the landscaping along the path, listing off the types of bushes the complex had planted- dwarf yaupon holly, viburnum, some kind of ornamental grass she couldn’t name but claimed was “a diva about sunlight.”  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her talk. She was too busy cataloging everything: the curve of the path, the way Rio’s hand hovered at her lower back when they crossed the parking lot, and the click of the lock as Rio scanned her key fob and held the door open.</p><p> </p><p>Inside, the building was cool and quiet. They stepped into the elevator, and Rio stood closer than necessary. Their shoulders touched, and Rio didn’t shift away. Neither did Agatha. Her eyes were fixed upward, watching the floor numbers tick.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Sixth floor. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The doors opened with a soft ding. Rio stepped out first, her gait loose but purposeful, and Agatha followed. The hallway was long and clean, lined with muted gray carpet and identical white doors. They turned a corner, and Rio came to a stop.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Unit 69. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned and kissed two fingers before tapping them against the number plate. “Requested this one specifically,” she murmured, pushing the door open with her other hand. “For the vibes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Of course you did.” But she was smiling.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her breath as she stepped inside. The entryway was narrow and spare- just a long runner stretched across the hardwood floor, a slim table against one wall, a key hook above it, and a tall mirror that caught their reflections in pieces.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kicked off her flip flops by the door and gestured wordlessly. Agatha followed suit, toeing hers off beside Rio’s with the reluctance of someone who wasn’t sure how long they were staying but didn’t want to track in dirt. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything. She was too busy trying to listen for ghosts.</p><p> </p><p>The first time she’d been to Rio’s old place, it had been a disaster- crickety floorboards, a window that wouldn’t close all the way, plants too ambitious for the single patch of sunlight that came in sideways from the fire escape. The couch had been lopsided. A leak in the kitchen ceiling had made the light fixture unreliable. It was falling apart, but it had been full of Rio- clean, particular, always reorganizing a drawer one minute and trying to fix a cabinet hinge the next, which somehow made the whole door crooked. That apartment had felt like a stubborn kind of survival. Like Rio had carved it out with her teeth and dared anyone to call it permanent.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hung her keys on the hook with a casual flick of her wrist and padded down the hall like she didn’t need to explain anything. Agatha followed, noticing how clean the floor was beneath her feet, how the walls were unmarked by thumbtack holes or leftover tape. No signs of makeshift fixes or chaotic repairs. This place held itself up without effort.</p><p> </p><p>At the end of the hall, Rio turned right into the kitchen and flicked the light on with the back of her knuckle.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw it -of course she saw it, she was fucking looking for it- and something in her dropped. Not a fall, not a freefall, but a soft sinking. Recognition. Like remembering the rules of a language she hadn’t spoken in years.</p><p> </p><p>Rio knelt and began unloading leftover beers from the cooler, sliding them wordlessly into the fridge. Agatha didn’t follow her into the kitchen. Her eyes had already drifted forward, pulled toward the living room.</p><p> </p><p>It was warmer than she expected.  A rust colored couch sat pushed against a wall, its cushions deep and worn. A quilt was draped over the back, hand stitched by someone who cared enough to match the colors but not obsess over symmetry. Lilia, if Agatha had to guess.</p><p> </p><p>There were mismatched coasters on the coffee table, a glazed ceramic bowl full of bottle caps, and a half melted candle in a jar labeled 'tobacco flower.'</p><p> </p><p>The shelves above the couch were floating, wooden, staggered along the wall like stepping stones. One held a stack of books so dog eared they could’ve been reread a dozen times. Another, a row of small clay pots, each one housing a different kind of plant- some trailing, some upright, all reaching toward the soft light above.</p><p> </p><p>A hanging light glowed in the corner, shaped like a basket turned upside down, wicker suspended by a coiled rope that was tacked into the wall. It cast a dappled amber light over the room, warm as fire without the flame. Below it, a monstera stretched its leaves outward, broad and glossy.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t feel staged. It didn’t feel aspirational. It felt… settled<em>. </em></p><p> </p><p>And that was what knocked the wind out of Agatha most.</p><p> </p><p>The Rio she remembered had always been a little at war with her surroundings. Always compensating, always adjusting. Making do, never making permanent. And now, here she was- clearly not just living but rooted<em>. </em> Not fighting the space, but shaping it. Choosing softness. Keeping it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Her hands hung uselessly at her sides.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t the kind of place you crashed at. It was the kind of place you came home to. The kind of place you could miss<em>. </em></p><p> </p><p>And somehow, that realization hit harder than anything that happened all day.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her bag by the couch and drifted toward the curved bookcase against the wall- wooden, worn, filled with plants, trinkets, and a scattering of picture frames. Most of them were from the years Agatha had missed. The decade she spent in Chicago. A life that had gone on without her.</p><p> </p><p>The first photo that caught her eye was of Rio and Sage, standing in front of the wall outside Lilia’s house. Sage looked twelve, arms crossed with a dramatic scowl, backpack on. Rio stood behind her, arms slung around her neck, grinning like an idiot.</p><p> </p><p>It was a first day of school photo- Agatha could tell by the backpack, the timing, the wall. Even though Rio hadn’t been in school for almost a decade at that point, she still showed up for Sage, still stood there with her like it was her own first day too.</p><p> </p><p>She looked younger in it- too young. Like the version of Rio from the year Agatha left.</p><p> </p><p>Rio used to complain about those pictures, swore she only humored Lilia. But the next picture frame gave her away- third grade, gap toothed, drowning in a shirt two sizes too big. Agatha had always loved that picture. Still did.</p><p> </p><p>Next to it, a photo of the three of them -Rio, Sage, Lilia- smiling around what looked like Sunday dinner. Then another. That same dining table, but this time Sage was older. Alice and Jen were in that one too, all of them squeezed into frame, laughing at something that had already passed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest went tight.</p><p> </p><p>Then the next two photos stopped her cold.</p><p> </p><p>The first: Agatha, Jen, and Rio. They were in Rio’s old apartment- sitting on her old janky couch. Jen was on Agatha’s right, flipping off the camera. Agatha sat in the middle, knees tucked up, practically curled into Rio’s side. Her nose scrunched at the camera. Rio sat forward, bearing her teeth in a snarl, an unlit cigarette between them and Agatha’s old purple lighter gripped tightly in her hand. Natty Light cans cluttered the coffee table. They looked ridiculous. They looked inseparable.</p><p> </p><p>The second: just the two of them. A selfie. Late at night on Rio’s old fire escape, flash too bright, faces squished together. They were 23. It had been taken on Agatha’s phone. She remembered that night. Neither of them had been wearing shoes. The air smelled like rain and burnt toast from someone else’s kitchen. They were stupid and loud and close.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha picked up the frame and stared at it for a long time.</p><p> </p><p>She ached for the version of them frozen in it. The version that didn’t know what was coming. Back then, they’d been content with whatever they were, as long as they had each other. No demands. No confessions. Only that soft, unspoken loyalty neither of them dared name.</p><p> </p><p>And her heart ached- because after all this time, after everything that had happened, Rio had still kept the memory of them. Woven it into her life like it would always belong there, pain and all. A decade later, it was still there. In pictures. In her old stupid lighter Rio still carried around. Like some part of her had always known Agatha would come back.</p><p><br/>Agatha didn’t know whether to laugh or cry or lose her mind entirely at the absurdity of it.</p><p> </p><p>“If you want to take a shower, you can use mine. I’ll use the guest one.” Rio’s voice came quietly from behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flinched, quickly sliding the frame back into place. She turned to find Rio standing there, arms crossed loose over her chest, her expression caught somewhere between regret and exposure- like she'd been seen too clearly. Like she knew Agatha had noticed the quiet ways she'd been held onto by Rio, and didn’t know what to do with it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything. She turned back to the bookshelf, eyes catching on another frame she hadn’t gotten to yet-</p><p><br/>A photo of Rio and Alice at The Witches Road, both flipping off the camera like assholes. But it wasn’t that that stopped her. It was Rio. Blonde. Older. Maybe taken in the last few years. And hot.</p><p><br/>Agatha blinked at it. Then blinked at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“You dyed your hair blonde?” Agatha asked, baffled.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah. Like two years ago. It was fun.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed to herself. “Looked fun.”</p><p> </p><p>And it had. She absolutely did not hate Rio as a blonde. In fact, she looked hot as fuck, and Agatha deeply resented that she’d missed it. That she hadn’t been there to see it. That scarlet had shown up instead and ruined everything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned toward the couch to grab her things, and she could feel Rio watching her- like every step might be the one that took her out the door.</p><p> </p><p>Without looking up, Agatha nodded toward the other hallway, the one she assumed led to Rio’s bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>“Lead the way.”</p><p> </p><p>A small smile tugged at Rio’s lips. She gave a single nod and turned, guiding them down the hall. They passed two doors -guest bathroom, guest bedroom- before reaching the very back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her bag beside the bathroom door and stepped further into Rio’s room without waiting for permission. She didn’t even pretend not to be nosy. Rio had rifled through her mail the first time she ever stepped foot in Agatha’s house. Fair was fair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, eyes steady on Agatha’s back. Agatha could feel her watching, like Rio wasn’t sure if this was happening, or if Agatha might vanish again the moment she looked away.</p><p> </p><p>The room was simple, warm. A forest green comforter lay tangled on the bed, the sheets underneath startlingly white- an objectively insane choice, but somehow very Rio. A half finished mug of coffee sat on the nightstand, cold now, the words <em> “I drink demon blood” </em> printed across it. </p><p> </p><p>She let her gaze drift. A paperback lay facedown beside the mug, spine broken. One of the plants in the corner looked like it had outgrown its pot months ago, but was still thriving. Another hung from a hook by the window, leaves spilling lazily over the edge. There was a TV mounted across from the bed.</p><p> </p><p>And then Agatha saw it.</p><p> </p><p>The record player. Same one from Rio’s old place. But it was the stand it sat on top of that really stopped her- walnut, mid-century style, still scratched in the front from when Rio had scrapped it trying to get it out of the trunk. They’d found it together in the furniture section of a thrift store, sitting perfectly between a broken dresser and a glass coffee table. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had spotted the stand instantly, crouched like she was in a museum, checking the joints and the grain, already in love. She’d said, <em> “Mine,” </em>without looking back. Agatha had just sighed and gone to find someone to help them carry it while Rio stood beside it like someone might try to steal it from her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped closer, fingers brushing the wood. The cabinets were closed, but she didn’t need to look. She knew what was in there. The vinyl collection- alphabetized, obsessively so. Agatha had once tried to slip Amy Winehouse's <em> Back to Black </em>into the A’s just to fuck with Rio and she had almost lost a hand because Rio filed them by last name not first. </p><p> </p><p>She stared at the cabinet now and caught herself wondering- not if the record was still there, but if it still skipped on side B. She’d dropped it once, years ago, she doesn’t even remember how. Rio hadn't replaced it then. Said it sounded better that way.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe she was imagining it -maybe it was projection or vanity or the pathetic ache of wanting to matter- but standing here now, Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that Rio had probably played it. After she left.</p><p> </p><p>Not for closure. Just because some songs don’t stop sounding like someone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook the melody of <em> Back to Black </em> from her spine like a chill. It lingered anyway, humming somewhere deep in her ribs. She turned and walked toward the bathroom, passing Rio on the way. Neither of them said anything.</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed her bag from where she’d dropped it and brought it inside to Rio's bathroom, setting it on the counter. When she turned around, Rio was in the doorway, arms loose at her sides, gaze fixed somewhere over Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, towels are in that cabinet,” Rio said quietly. “Soap and stuff’s already in the shower.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. “Cool.”</p><p><br/>She wasn’t sure why her voice sounded hoarse. Only knew she suddenly couldn’t stand the damp cling of her t-shirt, or the cold swimsuit underneath, still wet from earlier.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded back. “Cool.” She breathed the word out. Then she stepped back and pulled the door halfway closed behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard the soft shuffle of her feet retreating, the creak of a drawer opening, the quiet hush of movement as Rio crossed her own bedroom. A moment later, her footsteps padded down the hall toward the guest bathroom. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood there for another second, alone with the echo of a scratched record and her own heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Showering at Rio’s was a terrible idea.</p><p> </p><p>Eucalyptus hung in a bunch from the shower head, slightly browned at the edges, still fragrant in the steam. Agatha tried not to stare at it. </p><p> </p><p>She stood under the water, chest turned to the spray, hair still dry- no point washing it. She hadn’t gone under water in the pool- at least not physically. That, and she couldn’t stomach the idea of using Rio’s shampoo.</p><p> </p><p>The soap had been a reflex. Agatha didn’t think about it until the scent hit her- too clean, too sweet, familiar in a way that scraped at her ribs. It clung to her, buried itself in her skin, and the towel only made it worse. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had grabbed the first one she saw, thick and worn from use. The fabric reeked of Rio’s detergent, warm and chemical and so distinctly <em> hers </em> that Agatha nearly gagged on it. She tried not to think about how often Rio had used this exact towel, how many times she’d wrapped it around herself with dripping hair and bare shoulders. It was inescapable. Even after she got dressed, her own clothes couldn’t smother it. She still smelled like Rio. It had worked itself into every seam.</p><p> </p><p>They ended up on the couch, neither of them saying much. They sat close, but not touching, a careful few inches of space between them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had picked the movie- <em> Little Shop of Horrors </em>. She told herself it was because it was there, because it was safe, because she hadn’t thought it through until it was too late. Halfway in, she regretted it entirely.</p><p> </p><p>Rio used to play it on a loop until Agatha knew every line by heart. And now, with it playing softly in front of them, she wanted to vomit.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Not at the movie itself, but at the mushiness of it all. The softness. The stupid, sentimental instinct that made Agatha put it on in the first place. She could hear Rio mouthing along to “Skid Row (Downtown)” beside her without even thinking and it made her stomach turn.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t picked it to be kind. Or maybe she had. <em>She definitely had.</em> And that was the problem. It was so unlike her. Or maybe it wasn’t, maybe it was exactly like her. Maybe that’s why she hated it.</p><p> </p><p>Too earnest. Too exposed. Too obvious.</p><p> </p><p>She kept her eyes on the screen, jaw tight, fists curled in her lap like she could wring the weakness out of her palms. Rio scrolled through her phone like nothing had changed, humming the tune under her breath, still loving the same things. Still taking up space like she always had- quietly, relentlessly, without asking.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had let her. Had invited it. Hit play like it meant nothing. Like she wasn’t hoping Rio would notice.</p><p> </p><p>Like it wasn’t, in some fucked up way, a love letter.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna ask you this,” Rio said finally, still looking at her phone. “And I fucking hope your answer’s changed in the last decade… What pizza do you like?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t help the way her lips curled and her hands relaxed. </p><p> </p><p>It was always this- pizza wars and smug grins and a total refusal to compromise. They had never once shared a pizza. Rio refused. Said Agatha’s choices were a war crime. Said she couldn’t stomach the idea of her own slice so much as brushing against the sludge Agatha ordered. They used to get two different pizza’s just to keep the peace, and even then, Rio would make a show of sealing Agatha's box closed like it was a biohazard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. “Hawaiian.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio recoiled like she’d been physically slapped. “No. No, no, no. Agatha. Pineapple? You’re still- Jesus. You’re still doing this?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s good,” Agatha said, smug now. “It’s sweet and salty. It’s balanced. Like… culinarily. It’s science.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s fruit on cheese. That’s not science, that’s a hate crime.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tomatoes are fruit. Pizza sauce is fruit. You're already eating fruit, asshole.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tomatoes are barely fruit. They don’t count.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “You just don’t like it because you’re a coward. You fear flavor.”</p><p> </p><p>“I <em> fear </em> soggy crust and betrayal. Pineapple leaks juice, Agatha. It leaks. It seeps into everything. I used to taste the betrayal on my half when you ordered that garbage.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s why we got separate pizzas every time.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Because I don’t believe in cross contamination.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so dramatic,” Agatha muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced at her, unimpressed. “I’ve had pineapple flavored crust trauma. I’m allowed to be dramatic.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still fiddling with the order, tapping her thumb against the phone screen like she was pretending this didn’t feel familiar. Like they hadn’t done this exact dance a dozen times before.</p><p> </p><p>“Same place?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Obviously.” Rio tossed her phone onto the cushion between them and leaned back, arms crossed. “Forty minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p> </p><p>They both looked at the screen again. The movie was still going- bright and absurd, soaked in sentiment.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The pizza showed up sometime after the second song in the credits, and they ate it straight from the boxes with cold beers and tired limbs. It was comfortable. Easy in the way old things sometimes were. Rio made a dramatic show of nearly retching every time Agatha reached for another slice of Hawaiian. Agatha rolled her eyes and kept eating. They talked. Nothing heavy. Only conversation that looped and meandered, full of jokes and interrupted stories.</p><p> </p><p>When they were done eating, neither of them moved. Agatha grabbed the quilt from the back of the couch and threw it over both their legs without comment. They still weren’t touching, not exactly, but they were close enough that it wouldn’t have taken much. Close enough that her bare knee kept brushing against Rio’s thigh whenever she adjusted. They kept talking. Kept laughing. Rio kept being fucking annoying.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, Rio stood and stretched, lazy and smug. “I’m stepping out for a cigarette,” she said, already walking toward the door. “Care to join?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Just stood and followed.</p><p> </p><p>The sun was nearly gone by the time they stepped onto the balcony. It was narrow but well used- two old metal chairs, a small round table with a single dead cigarette crushed into the ashtray. </p><p> </p><p>Bulb lights were strung overhead, screwed into the siding and the overhang, uneven and slightly drooping between bolts. One flickered every few seconds like it couldn’t make up its mind.</p><p> </p><p>There was only one hanging plant, a long, leafy thing by the sliding door that swayed in the breeze.  The rest were arranged along a simple wooden bench on the far end, nestled in mismatched pots- ceramic, clay, chipped enamel. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned her back against the railing, ashtray balanced beside her, cigarette lit and resting between two fingers. She took a slow inhale, letting it settle in her chest before she exhaled.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood beside her, bent over the railing, elbows resting against the rusted metal. She had a cigarette in one hand, smoke curling past her lips as she talked about how her old shithole apartment had somehow paid off. How she’d saved and waited and waited some more. How this place was finally hers. She liked it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded along, eyes drifting.</p><p> </p><p>Black hoodie. Black plaid boxers she wore as shorts. Rio’s hair was still in a loose bun at the nape of her neck, still slightly messy. Her gaze traveled up. The pieces that had fallen loose were tucked back into place, framing her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes caught on small black diamonds.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t register whatever Rio was saying by then. She cut in quietly, “Let me see how your piercings are healing.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She moved to step in front of Agatha. “They’re healing fine,” Rio said, offhand, but still turned her head to each side so Agatha could see.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached up and traced the shell of Rio’s right ear, fingertips gentle, eyes locked on the tiny black diamond she’d placed there herself. They suited Rio. Of course they did. </p><p> </p><p>Her hand fell without thought to Rio’s shoulder. Agatha took another inhale from her cigarette, turned her head, and blew the smoke out toward the sunset before flicking ash into the tray. </p><p> </p><p>“Any brawls or marriage proposals happen at work when you debuted them?” Agatha asked, lips curled into a smirk. Her fingers remained where they’d landed on Rio’s shoulder, slow, unmoving, and then, with barely any pressure, she tugged. Just once.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded like she was answering the question, even if she wasn’t. She took one last drag from her cigarette and hummed around it, then leaned past Agatha to stub it out. Her hands came to rest on the railing, one on each side of Agatha’s body, and she stepped in. Closer. A few inches between them now. Not even that. She blew the smoke to the side, her voice low. “So many, Agatha. I was fighting women off all night. It was vicious. Bloody.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fake pouted, lips curved. “Poor baby.” Her fingers moved along the seam of Rio’s shoulder lazily.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Poor me.” Rio’s voice dropped a little, teasing. “I was promised backup, and someone bailed.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was working,” Agatha said, amused. “Keeping babies from trying to crawl toward the light.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm.” Rio squinted like she was pretending to weigh that. “Valid. But I’ll have you know it got dicey out there. I almost died.”</p><p> </p><p> “Eh. You survived.” Agatha shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“By the skin of my teeth.” Rio grinned and snapped her teeth in Agatha’s direction like she might actually bite her.</p><p> </p><p>The gap between Rio's teeth had never once stopped being endearing, not even when Agatha tried to pretend it had.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snuffed her cigarette in the tray beside her and shook her head. “Weirdo.” She was still smiling, cheeks aching from it.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t see you complaining,” Rio said, nodding between their bodies like their closeness was all the proof she needed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. Instead, she let her hand drift from Rio’s shoulder, fingers trailing up to the back of her neck.  She didn’t think about whether it was a good idea. She didn’t calculate the fallout. She just did what she wanted to do. For once. Without justifying it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>Their mouths met gently, and Agatha held there- without urgency, without force. Just the soft, certain press of her lips to Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch or fall back. She breathed out against Agatha’s mouth and kissed her again. This time longer. This time with more certainty.</p><p> </p><p>Then again.</p><p> </p><p>And again.</p><p> </p><p>Each one a little fuller than the last. Each one asking a question and receiving the same answer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let it happen. Let herself want it. She didn’t rush or overthink it, didn’t try to force meaning onto the moment, but she felt the way her body stilled into it. The way her hands softened where they touched Rio. The way the air around them seemed to narrow until all she could feel was Rio’s breath, her mouth, the way she kept coming back like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally pulled back, she didn’t go far. Her hands found their way to Rio’s waist, resting there for a beat before curling under the hem of her hoodie. She glanced down at the space between them and how little of it there was. The fabric gave easily, and her palms slipped beneath, coming to rest against Rio’s bare back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled when Agatha touched her like that- fully, soundlessly. When Agatha pulled her in, arms wrapped around her like she had every right. Rio went without resistance.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let herself explore. Her fingers traced the familiar shape of Rio’s spine, nails lightly dragging as if to mark her place. She didn’t know why she was doing it except that she could. Rio’s arms closed around Agatha’s shoulders like a sigh. Agatha felt the brush of lips against her hair.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. She had to. Everything in her felt like it was turning inside out. The closeness. The stillness. The goddamn kindness of it. Not just now, but all day. Every stupid softness she'd let herself accept. She breathed out shakily, trying to reel herself in. Her voice, when it came, barely cleared her throat. “I should probably go home.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move at first. Then she shifted back just enough to meet Agatha eyes. “I want you to stay,” Rio said softly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes slammed shut this time, too fast, trying to block out the words by refusing to look at them.</p><p> </p><p>Once, she would’ve done anything to hear that. Would’ve set the world on fire to be wanted like that. And now here it was, handed to her plain and unadorned.</p><p> </p><p>And she couldn’t even look at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio must have seen it- the way Agatha’s body stilled, the way her hands gripped tighter like she was bracing for the impact of something unspoken. She pulled back even more, softening her tone like she could smooth it over.</p><p> </p><p>“Just to hang out,” Rio added quickly, eyes flicking down and then back. “That’s all. If you want.” A pause. Then quieter: “You should stay.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha whispered. </p><p> </p><p>That would’ve always been the answer. No matter the time. No matter the cost. If Rio ever asked, the answer would always be yes. It had never been anything else.</p><p> </p><p>But still, Agatha played at indifference. Still, she pretended her heart hadn’t just fallen out of her mouth and landed -whole and stupidly willing- in the hands of the one person she’d never been able to take it back from.</p><p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Howdy, ladies, gays, and theys. Before y’all dive in, a quick note:</p>
<p>It seems I may have… mathed incorrectly. Not that I’m surprised, but it turns out that not only am I terrible at math but also remembering what year it is, which is why I’ve kept most dates and ages vague on purpose. That said, I did go back and make a few small adjustments- Agathario’s “fifteen years of knowing each other” is now seventeen, and I also tweaked the year Wagatha got married/Sage got adopted. Will the timeline still make perfect sense? I can only hope for the best. But the beauty of fanfiction is that it doesn’t have to.</p>
<p>So if you notice the math isn’t mathing, I beg you! look away! And please forgive me! I knew not what I was doing (iykyk hehehe).</p>
<p>Lastly, there is now a Pinterest board for this fic. It’s entirely unhelpful and all vibes, but my gf told me to make one and because I am her bitch… I did. Happily. Here’s the link, if you want to check it out: https://pin.it/4472qG25I</p>
<p>Hope it works.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It had been two weeks since Agatha kissed Rio on the balcony and then, for reasons she hadn’t fully justified even to herself, decided not to kiss her again.</p><p> </p><p>They hadn’t talked about it. Which, in Agatha’s opinion, was <em> technically different </em> from how things would’ve gone ten years ago. It was just easier to let it exist somewhere else. This was different. It was space. Breathing room. A mutual pause. Acknowledged, if only by the fact that neither of them pretended it hadn’t happened. And that, Agatha told herself, was something. </p><p> </p><p>She’d stayed the night, that first time. On the couch. With Rio. Which wasn’t romantic so much as logistical… and incredibly stupid. They'd both insisted it was fine, and then promptly not slept. At some point, Rio’s arm had ended up across her legs, the blanket twisted halfway off the couch, and Agatha had woken up sore, annoyed, and still not ready to leave.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hung around the next morning. Rio made her coffee, which she begrudgingly admitted was leagues better than the sad, watery excuse her Keurig had been churning out for months. Then Rio made breakfast like it was no big deal -eggs, toast, something green Agatha absolutely refused to identify- and somehow, neither of them commented on the fact that she hadn’t left yet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t end up leaving until sometime after one. On her way out, she hovered by Rio’s curved bookcase, pretending not to stare at the photo of her, Rio, and Jen in Rio’s old apartment. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced toward the hallway. Rio was still in her room, on the phone with Sage, her voice was muffled.</p><p> </p><p>Without thinking, Agatha reached for the frame and slipped it into her bag.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a power move. Or petty. She just… wanted it. Like how people steal rocks from beaches or pens from restaurants. Except this one had her face on it, so she figured that made it fair game.</p><p> </p><p>Rio came out just as Agatha was sliding the photo into her bag. Agatha looked up and offered her best <em> no, I did not just commit mild sentimental theft </em> smile.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio noticed the empty space on the shelf, she didn’t mention it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked her to her car. And Agatha got in. Drove off. Didn’t look back.</p><p> </p><p>The photo stayed tucked in her bag, pressing lightly against her side the whole way home.</p><p> </p><p>After that, they kept seeing each other.</p><p> </p><p>Not every day. But often enough that it stopped feeling incidental. The <em> thing </em>they’d fallen into didn’t feel like a return to the past- it felt like a negotiation. Like Agatha was learning what it meant to let someone back in without forfeiting ground.</p><p> </p><p>She’d been to Rio’s place three times since that morning. Once for dinner. Once while Rio did laundry and Agatha pretended to read. And once for no reason at all- just to be there. That one sat with Agatha the longest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had come over, too. Helped her put together a shelf, though it was less collaborative and more Agatha watching while Rio quietly did all the work. They ate takeout on the floor and put on a movie neither of them cared about. Agatha could barely remember the title. What she remembered was the way their knees stayed pressed together the entire time.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t kiss again.</p><p> </p><p>But there were touches that didn’t excuse themselves. Glances that lingered a second too long. A knee brushing hers under a table. Fingers grazing across a countertop. Rio’s palm resting between Agatha’s shoulder blades when she leaned forward to say something in a loud room.</p><p> </p><p>They went to game night separately. Sat next to each other anyway. Agatha laughed too hard at something Rio said and had to excuse herself.  She didn’t come back until her face stopped betraying her. She avoided the pointed stares from Jen and Alice for the rest of the night, both of whom looked ready to extract confessions through physical force if necessary.</p><p> </p><p>One Sunday, there was a special breakfast with coworkers. Agatha had invited her on the walk to Agatha’s car. It was a passing offer, barely even a sentence but Rio’s face had lit up so entirely unfiltered and stupidly honest. Rio tried to smother it, tried to play it cool, but Agatha had already seen it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had to look away. Her chest was too full. Rio’s face alone had nearly taken her out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio ended up across from her at the table, then next to her when someone else wanted the seat so they could talk to Jen. Their knees touched under the table. Neither of them moved.</p><p> </p><p>And still, they hadn’t kissed again.</p><p> </p><p>It would’ve been easy. That was the thing. It would’ve been so goddamn easy to lean in. To let it happen again, under the right conditions, with the right excuse.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>And this wasn’t because she was spiraling. This wasn’t slipping back into a version of them that had already failed once. She’d kissed Rio three times- once would’ve been forgivable, twice unfortunate, but three? That was a pattern. That was admitting she wanted more. So she didn’t do it again. She didn’t ask. Didn’t lean in. She told herself she was being careful. Smart.</p><p> </p><p>But some days, the panic still curled around her spine- hot, insistant, hard to ignore. Not about the past but about what this might be turning into. About the terrifying possibility that they were actually doing something right this time.</p><p> </p><p>So she kept space in her life on purpose. Made time for herself. Said yes to drinks with Jen. Spent her evenings at the gym, earbuds in, volume high. She didn’t cut herself off from Rio, but she didn’t disappear into it either.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed to believe she had kept something of herself untouched. Just so there’d be something left of her to walk away with incase this ended. </p><p> </p><p>Then maybe Agatha could say it hadn’t meant everything. </p><p> </p><p>Even if it had.</p><p> </p><p>But deep down, beneath every lie Agatha could almost believe, something quieter lived: the certainty that what was untouched had already been seen. And worse- welcomed.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat cross legged on the bed, the bottle of black nail polish uncapped on a towel between them. She had just started painting Rio’s left hand, holding it gently as she dragged the brush across each nail. The other hand, already finished, rested on her knee. It had been there for a while. Neither of them mentioned it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still, suspiciously still, as she painted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing. She kept her eyes down, painting each nail with careful, practiced strokes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, of course, couldn’t let that last.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s play twenty questions,” Rio said, casually. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said without looking up.</p><p> </p><p> “Cool. I’ll go first.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose. “That’s not-”</p><p> </p><p>“Am I bad kisser?”</p><p> </p><p>The brush paused, mid air. Agatha blinked once, then looked up, “Why?”</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Rio shrugged, eyes sliding to the side.  “Oh, well. You know. Someone asked, and I thought- hm. Why don’t I ask Ag-”</p><p> </p><p>“Who the fuck is wondering about your kissing skills?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, caught off guard. “What? No- no one important. And that wasn’t the question.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw locked. Her vision whitened at the edges. She wasn’t jealous. That would have required giving a fuck. It was just ridiculous. Who asked something like that? Who thought they could?</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t get to skip mine,” Agatha said flatly.</p><p> </p><p>“I asked first! It’s a yes or no question. So… yes or no. Am I a good kisser?”</p><p> </p><p>“I just don’t get why someone needs to know. Like is there a follow up planned? Are they trying to kiss y-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught the end of the question as it twisted out of her mouth. She didn’t stop because she lost her nerve. She stopped because she finally heard how she had sounded. The edge in her voice wasn’t neutral. It was personal, and it was obvious. Her own question wasn’t about the game anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Rio said nothing. Only looked at Agatha, shoulders loose, lips pressed together like she might smile, like she might say more if Agatha gave her an inch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned back to the bottle. Tapped the brush once against the rim.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know it was up for peer review,” she muttered, and moved on to Rio’s middle finger. </p><p> </p><p>“No one’s asked,” Rio admitted quietly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt something in her shoulders let go. She pressed her bottom lip between her teeth, held it there, and didn’t say anything. It was a stupid thing to feel relieved about. She felt it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted. and Agatha could feel her staring.</p><p> </p><p>“I just… think maybe you aren’t answering because… I don’t know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose and kept her gaze locked on Rio’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>“We haven’t, you know. Since-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t take the bait. Just moved on to the next finger. Perfect strokes. Steady hand. Her face, however, was getting warm.</p><p> </p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “It’s fine if you don’t want to. I just… figured if it was because I sucked, I’d rather know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand with more pressure than necessary. It wasn’t a mistake. It was a warning. </p><p> </p><p>“Ow,” Rio said lightly, trying to make a joke of it. “Cool. Torture me in silence.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re the one who brought it up,” Agatha muttered. </p><p> </p><p>“Because we kissed.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally looked up, brows raised. “And now you want me to give you a grade on it?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio flushed and looked away. “Forget it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went back to painting, jaw tight. The next nail came out smudged. She wiped it clean and started again.</p><p> </p><p>Fuck, she was annoyed. Annoyed that for one stupid second, she thought someone else had wanted to kiss Rio. Annoyed that it got to her. Annoyed at the way Rio’s big, miserable brown eyes burning a hole straight through her forehead. And most of all, she was annoyed because the hand resting on her knee had gone slack -like Rio had pulled away, or was about to- and that ache in her chest wasn’t subtle anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated the whole thing. The look. The silence. The part of her that cared. She knew she was being unfair. </p><p> </p><p>“Just so you know,” Agatha said flatly, not looking up, “you’re not bad at it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, trying and failing not to sound too pleased. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Two seconds of silence.</p><p> </p><p>“Are we gonna kiss again?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her then.</p><p> </p><p>Of course she wanted to kiss Rio again. She always had. That had been the problem from the very start. It wasn’t just once, or twice, or the last time. It was every version of her. Every glance across a room. Every time they got too close to saying something they shouldn’t. Every silence that squeezed tight like a hand around a throat.</p><p> </p><p>There had never been a version of Rio Agatha didn’t want.</p><p> </p><p>That was the part Agatha could never quite make peace with. It never dulled, never gave her room to outgrow.  And somehow, it still caught her off guard. Every single time.</p><p> </p><p>She looked down at the last nail and corrected a smudge that wasn’t there. It gave her something to do. Something to control.</p><p> </p><p>“If I say yes, will you stop talking?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Fine. Then yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled. “That a real yes?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood. “It’s a shut up before I change my mind yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Still counts.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look back. But her ears were warm. And she absolutely knew it still counted.</p><p> </p><p>She took the bottle of black polish and walked into the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>The drawer was already open. Everything inside was lined up- nail files, cotton pads, cuticle oil, everything in its place. The polish had a designated spot.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it for a second too long, then set the bottle down and closed the drawer quietly.</p><p> </p><p>When she came back, Rio was leaned back against the headboard, legs stretched out, watching some documentary about the ocean.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat beside her. Not too close. Not far either. She tried to focus on the screen.</p><p> </p><p>A narrator droned on about migration patterns and instinct. Something about the way certain fish followed the same path every year, even when they didn’t know why.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha crossed her arms.</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” Rio said, eyes not leaving the screen. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her gaze forward, but every part of her had turned toward the sound of Rio’s voice. It always did. </p><p> </p><p>“I quite like kissing you.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha hated how her pulse reacted.</p><p> </p><p>For years, everything between them had existed in what they didn’t say. That was how they survived it- through silence, through the comfort of what never had to be spoken. That was the one thing Rio had always understood. She used to live inside it with Agatha, as if the quiet was sacred.</p><p> </p><p>But lately, Rio had started breaking the rules. She had started letting the quiet fill up with real words. Saying things out loud that were never supposed to be spoken. Things they used to leave alone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t figured out how to stay intact when that happened. She could manage silence. She was built for it. But this left her exposed in ways she didn’t know how to cover.</p><p> </p><p>Though Rio had figured it out, hadn’t she? That if she talked enough, Agatha wouldn’t have anywhere left to hide.</p><p> </p><p>And if there was nowhere left to hide, it got harder to move anywhere that wasn’t toward Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha thought about answering. She thought about denying it or joking or acting like she hadn’t heard. But none of those options felt available anymore. Not when Rio said things like that without fear.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha stayed where she was, her posture careful, her jaw set.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said, as evenly as she could manage.</p><p> </p><p>A moment passed. Rio reached over and rested her hand on Agatha’s thigh, fingers splayed gentle and careful, mindful not to smear the half dry polish on her nails. Her thumb pressed into Agatha’s thigh. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She didn’t breathe too hard. She told herself not to react.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio spoke again.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to keep talking?” she asked, softly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her gaze drop to Rio’s hand resting on her thigh. She followed the shape of it- the curve of Rio’s knuckles, the pale blue veins running up her wrist, the black polish Agatha had painted there. It was perfect. Hers.</p><p> </p><p>She shouldn’t have cared about that detail. But she did.</p><p> </p><p>It was proof of something. Another mark that was Agatha’s. Another small thing added to a life that hadn’t felt like hers in a long time. Not when she was married. Not when she was making decisions that belonged to other people. But this- this was different. Agatha had put that color there. Her hands had made it so.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard and looked back at the screen. She forced herself to breathe evenly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded once.</p><p> </p><p>Because yes. She wanted Rio to keep talking. She wanted to hear every word she’d missed, every thought Rio hadn’t said until now. She wanted it so badly it made her ache. But the only thing she could give her was that single, careful nod.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look at her, kept her eyes fixed on the screen. Her thumb stayed still, pressing into Agatha’s skin. “I want to kiss you again,” Rio said softly. “I think about it all the time. More than I probably should.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled, eyes fluttering shut.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was a siren, and Agatha would follow her straight into the ocean if it meant that voice was the last thing she ever heard.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thumb began to move, brushing gently back and forth. Agatha’s skin rose to meet it- goosebumps followed instantly. Rio must’ve noticed; her hand paused, lifted slightly. Agatha imagined her studying the reaction her touch had caused.</p><p> </p><p>A moment passed, Rio’s fingers returned, tracing a path up and down Agatha’s thigh. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek to keep quiet. But her body didn’t cooperate. Her thighs shifted, parted slightly, unthinking. She forced her eyes open, needing to see it. The way Rio’s hand moved. The shape of it.</p><p> </p><p>“I think about it in line at the store, walking to my car, sitting at work with nothing to do,” Rio said, voice even. She paused, exhaled a shaky breath, then added- quieter this time, “Pretty much anywhere I exist.”</p><p> </p><p>She felt the shift when Rio turned toward her, subtle but unmistakable. Her hand left Agatha’s thigh, and for a second, Agatha mourned the loss of it- right up until her other hand found her cheek instead. Warm. Undeniable. A soft tug, asking without words for her to look. So Agatha did.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes landed on Rio’s mouth before they found anything else.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thumb traced lightly across her cheek as she tilted her head, eyes a darker shade of brown than usual. “I’d like to kiss you now,” she murmured. “If that’s okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck yes,” Agatha breathed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled her in without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>There was nothing tentative about it. Rio’s tongue pressed for entry instantly, and Agatha gave it to her willingly. </p><p> </p><p>The moment she let Rio deepen the kiss, Agatha moaned- helpless and so fucking desperate. It felt like Rio needed to taste every part of her, like she’d been starved of it. There was no room for doubt in the way Rio’s mouth moved against hers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely had time to catch up before Rio’s hand slipped from her cheek and found her hip. Her fingers toyed with the hem of Agatha’s shirt before slipping underneath, nails dragging lightly across skin. She found the curve of Agatha’s hip bone and anchored herself there, thumb pressing firmly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t go further. She just held her there, thumb stroking once, steady, like that single point of contact was enough.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe it was.</p><p> </p><p>Because for all the fire in Rio’s mouth, her hand stayed still. Grounded. Rooted. Like she was reminding them both this wasn’t about rushing. It was about having. About being allowed to want, and finally -finally- getting to touch. </p><p> </p><p>And the feeling crept in slowly.</p><p> </p><p>The realization of what would happen if Agatha didn’t stop this. If Agatha let it keep going. If she let herself believe there was a version of this that could last longer than the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t mean to. Her hands moved without her. Just enough pressure against Rio’s shoulders to make her stop.</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused, lips still close, breath brushing Agatha’s skin. She hadn’t pulled back fully. Her eyes were still on Agatha’s mouth, and she looked like she’d follow it anywhere.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest ached. She had spent so long knowing absence that presence -real, safe, offered freely- felt almost violent.</p><p> </p><p>“I think…” Her voice caught. She cleared her throat, tried again. “We should probably move to the living room.”</p><p> </p><p>There it was.</p><p> </p><p>The softest escape route Agatha could find.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped up, finally meeting hers. There was a flicker of something there, hurt, maybe, or understanding, but it passed quickly. She nodded once, careful.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s okay,” she said, barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t push. She didn’t ask why.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha heard the rest anyway- unspoken but deafening.</p><p> </p><p><em> I’ll try again tomorrow. </em></p><p> </p><p>And beneath all her restraint, beneath all the armor she hadn’t meant to put back on-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hoped she would.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They did move to the living room. And true to form, Rio didn’t make it awkward. She steered away from the moment entirely, settling Agatha in the smallest, most deliberate ways. She turned on trash reality television. She made space for Agatha on the couch. She kept the mood light. There was no pause in her laughter, no dimming in her eyes. She was still herself and somehow that made it easier for Agatha to follow. To laugh. To pretend nothing had happened, at least for now.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, Agatha’s eyes drifted toward the curved bookshelf. She had avoided it until now. That wall of Rio’s apartment had become a quiet threat. She hadn’t wanted to see the empty space where the photo used to be. The one she stole. She hadn’t wanted to risk a question Rio might ask.</p><p> </p><p>But the space wasn’t empty anymore.</p><p> </p><p>A new frame had taken its place. This time it was a group photo from a game night at Jen and Alice’s rental over a decade ago. Jen was in Alice’s lap, beaming. Agatha sat on the couch, mid laugh. And Rio was on the floor between Agatha’s legs, flipping off the camera with both hands.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched. The urge to steal it hit fast and familiar. She wouldn’t. Or at least not yet.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had practically launched herself out of the apartment. She told herself it was casual but the truth was she couldn’t sit there any longer without doing something she’d regret. They’d only been watching TV, but that hadn’t stopped her brain from drifting somewhere else entirely.</p><p> </p><p>It kept drifting, circling back to the bedroom, to Rio’s voice, to the memory of her mouth. Not even the show could distract her- though Rio had looked genuinely entertained by middle aged women throwing wine at each other, cool as a fucking cucumber.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, meanwhile, couldn’t focus on a single damn word.</p><p> </p><p>It was infuriating.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted Rio’s attention so badly she could feel it buzzing in her teeth. Every time she looked over, her eyes snagged on black nail polish and her brain would spiral again. Just glancing at them felt like they were taunting her like a fucking billboard:</p><p><em> Best Hands on the East Coast- Declared by Agnes, Confirmed by Vibes. </em></p><p> </p><p>Her whole body burned with it. She hated how easy it was for her mind to go there. She hated how much she wanted to be touched, how badly she wanted it to be Rio.</p><p> </p><p>It was humiliating, the way her body responded to absolutely nothing but possibility.</p><p> </p><p>Which was exactly why Agatha had to leave.</p><p> </p><p>And now here they were. Rio walking Agatha to her car.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the sharp edge of the picture frame digging into her side through the fabric of her canvas bag. Good. Let it hurt. She needed the distraction. </p><p> </p><p>When they got to the car, Rio lingered with her arms crossed, tongue pressed into her cheek. Not the usual smug, flirty look- this was different. Thoughtful. Cautious. Agatha knew Rio was turning something over in her head but hadn’t decided if it was worth saying out loud.</p><p> </p><p>“Tomorrow’s Tuesday,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p><em> Fuck.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Of all the things that could come out of Rio Vidal’s fucking mouth. It had to be that.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s Sunday night dinners- now Tuesday night dinners.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She stared out across the parking lot, jaw tight, shoulders tense. She gave a small, noncommittal hum, just enough to acknowledge she’d heard. Not enough to engage.</p><p> </p><p>She already knew what her answer was going to be. But she would let Rio try. That much, at least, Agatha could give her.</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia misses you,” Rio said. “You should come.”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t cruel. It wasn’t defensive. Just… simple. Honest.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia… well. Fourteen years was a long time to let bitterness sink into your bones. Agatha knew that feeling. She had nurtured it herself.</p><p> </p><p>Even if Lilia did hate her -which, deep down, Agatha knew wasn’t true- she couldn’t walk back into that house and pretend the walls didn’t remember her. The chairs. The table. The way everything would look the same, but not.<br/>Sage would be there now. Maybe others.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t want to witness how easily the world stitched itself back together around her absence. Lilia’s house had once been a salvation, the first place that had ever truly felt like a home to come back to. She had spent two years of holidays, of Sunday dinners, cradled in that warmth because she had nowhere else to go.</p><p> </p><p>More than anything, Agatha didn’t think she could survive seeing a seat at the table saved for her.</p><p> </p><p>She saw it sometimes in her dreams, always the same: an empty table, stripped of food and noise and life, just one chair pulled out like an offering. A light that would fall only there like a spotlight on a stage. The chair didn’t beckon. It didn’t accuse. It just existed- quiet and certain, like it still believed she might return.</p><p> </p><p>And every time, Agatha woke up feeling like she’d left something behind she was never meant to.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said again, quieter this time. Rio hadn’t repeated the invitation, but Agatha still had to say it.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, with a nod. “No worries. Maybe next week.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t sound hurt. She didn’t sound surprised. She sounded like she understood.</p><p> </p><p>And just like before, Agatha didn’t hear the words exactly, but they echoed anyway.</p><p><br/><em>I’ll try again tomorrow.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother saying her answer would still be no next week.</p><p> </p><p>“I should probably get home,” Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. I’ll see you soon?”</p><p> </p><p>That question Agatha could answer without thinking. She’d see Rio again. She didn’t know when or how or under what excuse, but it didn’t matter. It would happen. Of all the things in her life that felt uncertain, Rio wasn’t one of them.</p><p> </p><p>Not anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded and stepped forward to open her car door for her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tossed her bag into the passenger seat and started to climb in. She didn’t look at Rio because nothing had changed. She still wanted her. Still ached for her. It was the easiest thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p>But if Agatha let it happen there’d be no pretending left. No careful pacing. They’d have to talk. About everything. About the years they lost and the silences they built and the ways they both let it happen. She’d ask why Rio never said anything. Why she didn’t. Why it took them this long to get here.</p><p> </p><p>And then what?</p><p><br/>If they finally gave in and it didn’t work?</p><p> </p><p>They’d ruin it for real. Not like before. Before was passive. Before was silence. Before was a slow forgetting.</p><p><br/>But this would be active. Final. Something they couldn’t take back.</p><p> </p><p>They managed to destroy their friendship without ever touching the truth and Agatha wasn’t sure she’d survive watching it die because they finally did.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio poked her- two fingers to her shoulder, light and annoying on purpose. It was a touch that said ‘<em> I could be serious, but I’d rather let you decide.’ </em> Her other hand rested on the edge of the car door. “Are you okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned fast, startled by the break in silence. It took her a second to register the question. Her mind was still tangled in whatever she hadn’t let herself say. When she did, her eyes flicked up, catching the way Rio’s fingers tightened just slightly on the top of the door, the way she held her posture like she was bracing for impact. But none of it showed in her expression. Her face stayed soft, unreadable. Like she was waiting to be told what came next and had already decided she wouldn’t fight it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled. “Yeah, I’m just-” She huffed a short, breathy laugh, then shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>Two seconds. </p><p> </p><p>That’s all Agatha gave herself before defaulting to the biggest lie she’s ever told herself. </p><p> </p><p>And she had always been a bit wicked.  </p><p> </p><p>“We’re friends. Right?”</p><p> </p><p>A reminder. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was trying to say it before someone else could forget. A line being redrawn- not to punish, but to protect. Maybe not even Rio. Maybe just herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows lifted slightly, and her mouth pressed into a thin line. But other than that her expression didn’t change much.</p><p><br/> “Yeah.” </p><p> </p><p>A pause.  </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice softened, “Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Whatever Agatha needed to believe in this moment, Rio would give her.<br/><br/></p><p>And Agatha didn’t regret saying it. Not exactly. It was the only way she knew how to pull back. However, beneath all that carefully managed distance, she hoped Rio heard the space between Agatha’s words and would wait for her there.</p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha already knew- by the time morning came, she’d want to take it back.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe again the next day.</p><p> </p><p>And probably the day after that, too.<br/><br/></p><p>Fortunately for Rio, Agatha had always had a soft spot for invasive species- the type that take root quietly, spread without permission, and somehow make the place feel more alive once they’ve ruined everything else.</p><p> </p><p>Didn’t mean she wouldn’t fight them every inch of the way. Rip them out. Pretend she hadn’t watered them. Act surprised when they kept coming back.</p><p> </p><p>Some things thrive under neglect.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, apparently, was one of them.<br/><br/></p><p>Just as Agatha opened her mouth to affectionately threaten Rio about closing her damn door before she floored it and peeled off-</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved.</p><p> </p><p>Closed in, actually.</p><p> </p><p>At a pace far too fast and nowhere near fast enough. One of those agonizing, unmistakable trajectories that gave Agatha ample time to react, deflect, maybe even mock. But she didn’t. Couldn’t. Wouldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand found her cheek and tilted her mouth up- gentle, weirdly practiced, utterly self assured. Their mouths collided like an argument neither of them wanted to win.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, the brilliant, miserable idiot that she was, met her halfway like a girl starved. No pause. No restraint. Just opened her mouth for Rio, wide and warm and easy.  Honestly. She didn’t even try to make Rio work for it.</p><p> </p><p>Her right hand slid into Rio’s hair, fingers curling at the nape to pull her closer, deeper. Rio hummed into her mouth, low and pleased. Agatha felt it in her teeth, her throat, somewhere ancient in her ribcage that hadn’t stopped aching since they were stupid and younger and ruining everything by doing absolutely nothing about it.</p><p> </p><p>It was obscene. Awkward angle, too much tongue, entirely too desperate. It wasn’t graceful. It wasn’t gentle. It wasn’t even supposed to happen.</p><p> </p><p>And still-</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally pulled back, Agatha stayed frozen- fingers still tangled in the back of her hair hoping her grip might keep time from moving forward. Rio’s lips were pink and swollen, her breath puffing against Agatha’s mouth, and then because god has no mercy and hated Agatha Harkness:</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face split into that maddening grin- white teeth, gap toothed, eyes bright with victory.</p><p> </p><p><em> Smug. So fucking smug. </em></p><p> </p><p>And then, to make matters exponentially worse, Rio opened her stupid fucking mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“See ya later. <em> Friend</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The word hung there, deliberate and poisonous. </p><p> </p><p>Rio punctuated the insult with a kiss pressed to the corner of Agatha’s mouth like a signature. Then lingered there, just long enough to make sure Agatha leaned into before whispering in her ear:</p><p> </p><p>“Klepto.”</p><p> </p><p>Then she was gone. Door shut. Tapped the window like some kind of post heist flourish. A thief of breath and reason and time. Confident as ever.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat motionless behind the wheel, mouth slightly parted, eyes locked on Rio’s ass in the side mirror until it disappeared from view.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck,” she muttered to herself.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced at the passenger seat. Half the picture frame had slid out of her bag. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the new photo. Not the fresh one Rio had clearly just added to the shelf- an obviously replaced snapshot from game night at Jen and Alice’s rental house from years ago. That one had been carefully placed, practically staged, so conspicuous in its positioning that Agatha hadn’t dared touch it. She knew Rio well enough to recognize bait when she saw it. That frame hadn’t lived in the apartment long enough to gather dust. It was too new, too self aware, too obviously asking to be taken.</p><p> </p><p>And if Rio expected her to take it… if she’d left it out like some sort of offering? Then Agatha couldn’t possibly accept it. That would make it a gift, and Agatha had never stolen anything freely given. She had principles. Or pride. Or maybe just spite.</p><p> </p><p>So, instead, Agatha had taken the other one.</p><p> </p><p>The one Rio wouldn’t expect her to go for.</p><p> </p><p>Just the two of them, curled up on that rusted fire escape with their cheeks squished together. That photo had lived in Rio’s apartment long enough to matter. It had survived different eras. Different silences. Different versions of themselves.</p><p> </p><p>And that, as far as Agatha was concerned, made it fair game.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, it also made it personal.</p><p> </p><p>Which is exactly why she took it.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio had baited her. And Agatha, naturally, had refused to bite. She had standards. Which is why she responded with equal pettiness and more precision. She didn’t steal what Rio wanted her to steal. She stole the thing Rio would actually miss.</p><p> </p><p>That felt earned.</p><p> </p><p>And fine, maybe she hadn’t thought about her history with petty theft in years. It had never come up in conversation, mostly because she had never needed to explain it. Not to Rio. Certainly not to herself. But that didn’t mean the impulse had disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>It had always been specific. She didn’t have sticky fingers in general- just when it came to Rio’s things. It started as a joke. A spoon gone missing. Then another. Rio had exactly four of silverware, and Agatha made it a point to disrupt the symmetry. Eventually it became a habit. A sweatshirt. A hoodie. A paperback. A pen. Trinkets. Lots of trinkets. </p><p> </p><p>Then two full boxes of Rio’s stuff never made it to Chicago, not by accident. One last sweatshirt survived the culling, and even that, eventually, had disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t about sentiment. Not entirely. It was about the comfort of possession. The power of keeping a piece of someone without having to ask.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the frame a moment longer, then shoved it deeper into her bag and adjusted the mirror like it might help her regain composure. It didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her head fall back against the headrest.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s never letting that go,” Agatha muttered under her breath, voice flat.</p><p> </p><p>Another beat.</p><p> </p><p>“God, I hate her.”</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t true. Not remotely.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha still wasn’t giving the picture back.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha woke to a low, mechanical sound that took several seconds to register. It wasn’t a car. It wasn’t the AC kicking on. It was steadier than that, with the rough churn of something deliberately cutting through resistance. She turned over and groaned into her pillow, hoping she could drown out the sound. </p><p> </p><p>It persisted. </p><p> </p><p>Fully awake now, her brain pieced it together with increasing dread. A lawn mower. Not distant. Not someone else's problem. It was coming from her own yard.</p><p> </p><p>She reached for the clock on her nightstand and squinted. <em> 7:34. </em> On a Wednesday. Which ruled out Lucas, the neighbor kid, who should have been putting on his sneakers for school, not mowing her fucking lawn. Which meant-</p><p> </p><p><em> Oh no. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had made good on her promise.</p><p> </p><p>After one very long exhale, Agatha pushed herself upright, threw her comforter back, and trudged toward the window. She yanked her blackout curtains open and peeled apart the blinds.</p><p> </p><p>There she was.</p><p> </p><p>Not in some lazy excuse for yard work attire. Rio didn’t do anything half ass. She wore brown duck bib overalls, already streaked green at the knees. A black tank top was tucked beneath them, high at the neckline and sleeveless, showing dirt smudged arms. Her boots were scuffed, her hair was pulled back in a low bun, and her earbuds were tucked neatly in place. Every inch of her posture radiated focus. She pushed the mower with even, deliberate rows, pausing to turn only when the geometry demanded it.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze drifted toward the curb. Rio’s 4Runner was parked alongside the sidewalk with a full size U-Haul open trailer hitched to it. On it, everything was packed with purpose: gardening tools, a neatly rolled tarp secured with clips, several bags of soil stacked evenly, and a full flat of nursery plants arranged by height. Even edging stones had been strapped into place with bungee cords. A clipboard propped against the back tire of the trailer, probably covered in notes and underlines and god knows what else.</p><p> </p><p>Of course Rio brought a U-Haul. God forbid she show up to flirt without honoring at least one lesbian stereotype.</p><p> </p><p>Of course Rio brought a fucking clipboard. </p><p> </p><p>Of course Rio showed up to her fucking house trying to make Agatha forget that she was in the middle of a seventeen year long slow burn powered exclusively by emotional repression, catastrophic timing, and spite.</p><p> </p><p>And now Rio was out there being soft and stupid and useful, like that would fix it.</p><p> </p><p>It was excessive. It was overthought. It was thorough in a way that couldn’t be passed off as impulsive.</p><p> </p><p>It was perfectly Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood there, silent, unwilling to admit how attractive it was to watch someone do something well. She watched as Rio continued mowing with precision, not stopping to stretch or check her phone. She didn’t glance up. Didn’t acknowledge Agatha’s house. Her jaw was tight, her brows drawn, her pace unwavering.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, then muttered under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>“Well. Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>This was not a quick favor. This wasn’t a twenty minute trip with a borrowed mower. This was a full scale project, an entire day of Rio Vidal applying manual labor to every corner of Agatha’s neglected yard. A renovation plan. An execution. A statement made through soil and sweat and painfully competent hands.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha would be forced to witness it. Every hour. Every choice. Every quiet act of order being imposed on a space Agatha had long since stopped believing deserved care.</p><p> </p><p>And the worst part was how clear it already was that Rio hadn’t done this out of compulsion or obligation. She had planned it. She had sourced it. She had chosen every item with intention and brought it here.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>By mid morning, the mowing had stopped. Rio wheeled the mower back into the trailer and pulled out the weed whacker. She started it without fuss and worked her way along the sidewalk. She paused only once, her back to the house to pull out her phone. It took her all of five seconds before the thing disappeared back into her pocket and the weed whacker started humming again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzed against the side of her coffee mug she was holding.</p><p> </p><p>She let the blind fall back into place. Set the mug down and unlocked her phone.</p><p> </p><p>A photo. The top half of Rio’s face, clear plastic safety glasses smudged with dirt, her eyes squinted from the brightness of the sun.  A sliver of sky above her. And behind her, just visible in the background, the front of her house and the unmistakably lifted blind in the window where Agatha had been watching.</p><p> </p><p>The message underneath:</p><p> </p><p><em> Rio: come say hi, friend. maybe toss in a kiss if you’re feeling generous... i hear friends do that now👀 </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it. Then at the window. Then back at the screen.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t respond.</p><p> </p><p>She also didn’t throw the phone across the room, which felt, under the circumstances, like a remarkable act of restraint.</p><p> </p><p>What Agatha did do, however, was throw herself back into bed and open her Ring app. The front yard camera came up immediately- installed by Alice when Agatha moved it. </p><p> </p><p>There she was. </p><p> </p><p>Rio. Weed whacking. Hair pulled up, biceps flexing just enough to piss Agatha off, and wearing brown overalls and safety glasses that had no business being that fucking attractive.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched in silence. Not lurking, exactly. Just… observing. Just using what was available to her.</p><p> </p><p>She zoomed in.</p><p> </p><p>Just a little.</p><p> </p><p>Then closed the app and dropped her phone on the bed next to her.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t going down there. That would be encouragement.</p><p> </p><p>Let Rio work. Let her sweat. Let her wonder.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha would stay exactly where she was.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>By the time noon rolled around, the noises outside had stopped, and Agatha peeled herself off the couch to check the window.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t alone anymore. Parked in front of her car was the ugliest thing Agatha had ever seen, a faded yellow 1978 Subaru Brat. It used to belong to Lilia, and as far as Agatha knew, it hadn’t run in years. Rio had talked about fixing it up once, and evidently she had, because now Sage seemed to be the one driving it. The two of them were perched on the open tailgate, legs swinging, sharing a greasy paper bag of food and absolutely zero decorum.</p><p> </p><p>Sage chucked a fry at Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. She just reached over and dragged a greasy hand down the front of Sage’s face.</p><p> </p><p>Sage recoiled in horror. Rio laughed maniacally.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Because apparently this was normal. Apparently it had been, for a long time.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had missed it.</p><p> </p><p>Not just Sage. Not just the story of how she fit into Rio’s life. But <em> this </em>. This new version of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spent years knowing Rio in the most specific way a person could know someone else. Reading the silences. Interpreting what was withheld. They’d built an entire friendship on implication and unsaid things. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had always been a fortress, and Agatha, somehow, had been the only one ever allowed past the gates.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t realized how much she’d clung to that fact. How much she’d built her idea of Rio around it.</p><p> </p><p>And now, from across a window, she was watching a different version entirely. One that laughed without restraint. One that let herself be messy. Affectionate. Known.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t imagined Rio like that.</p><p> </p><p>And she hadn’t been there to see the change, hadn’t been invited into the process of it. No warning. No bridge. Just a new Rio, fully formed, sitting where the old one used to be.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the curtain fall, slowly. Then stood there for a moment longer, unsure what to do with the heat crawling under her skin.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t jealousy. She didn’t want what Sage had… obviously.</p><p> </p><p>She just hated that it had happened without her. That Rio had crossed some invisible threshold, became someone more whole, more open and Agatha, who had once been the closest person to her in the world, hadn’t even been a footnote in that transformation.</p><p> </p><p>That absence felt louder than anything.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Thirty minutes later, Sage was gone. Rio stood alone, leaned back against her trailer, one boot crossed over the other as she looked over whatever was attached to that stupid clipboard. A cigarette burned between her fingers. She looked focused -annoyingly so- and entirely at ease.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her from the peephole for longer than she’d admit. The unopened water bottle in her hand was sweating, slipping slightly against her palm. She took a breath that didn't do anything, then opened the door and stepped outside.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced up, her expression unreadable except for the faint twitch at the corner of her mouth, a smile she clearly wasn’t giving Agatha the satisfaction of seeing. Her eyes dropped back to the clipboard, mouth pursed.</p><p> </p><p>Once she was close enough, Agatha reached for the cigarette in Rio’s hand and took it without asking, placing the water bottle directly on top of the clipboard in a gesture that was neither generous nor polite.</p><p> </p><p>A mason jar sat on the trailer beside Rio, half filled with sand and already hosting a few used cigarette butts.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a drag and leaned against the trailer beside her, mirroring Rio’s position without thinking.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, unfazed, set both clipboard and water bottle on the edge of the trailer behind her. Then she reached into the chest pocket of her overalls and pulled out a single cigarette. She slid it between her lips, crouched to rifle through one of the lower leg pockets, and came back with Agatha’s purple Zippo.</p><p> </p><p>While Rio lit the cigarette, she mumbled around it, “Fired your neighbor’s kid this morning,” she said. “Figured you’d want that handled.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed. “And how did he take that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pocketed the lighter and took a slow drag, nodding.  “Great. Said you were terrifying. Claimed you were lowballing him for, and I quote, ‘the disastrous monstrosity that is your yard.’” She exhaled slowly, aiming the smoke up and away through a grin she didn’t bother hiding this time. </p><p> </p><p>Then Rio turned to face her fully, shifting her stance so she was squared toward Agatha now, shoulder brushing the trailer, the mason jar sitting between them on the ledge.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “That right?”</p><p> </p><p>“He actually looked really heartbroken about it.” Rio said, immediately. She flicked ash off the end of her cigarette into the jar, adding, almost offhand, “I gave him a hundred bucks just to get out of my face.” She took another drag and muttered looking away from Agatha,  “And then I hissed at him.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barked a laugh. She tried to smother it behind her hand, but it was too late. It cracked straight through her irritation and landed somewhere in the middle of her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“He ran away so fast,” Rio said, smirking. “Made me feel less bad about firing him.”</p><p> </p><p>“You should feel bad,” Agatha shot back. “What if landscaping was his dream?”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I did him a favor. He’s objectively shit at it.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s thirteen!”</p><p> </p><p>“And?” Rio asked, full offense. “Fuck that kid. He shouldn’t be out here mangling the lawn of an incredibly hot woman anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted, “You’re awful.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head slightly, exhaled smoke through her nose, and shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to stay annoyed. Really, she did. But then her eyes dropped, against her better judgment, and lingered. First to Rio’s throat, damp with sweat. Her collarbone. The curve of her shoulder. Grass clung to her forearms, and flecks of dirt stuck to the skin around her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth went dry. She blinked, once, slowly.</p><p> </p><p>By the time she looked back up, Rio was already grinning- wide and unbearable, her teeth too white against the sunburn starting to creep up her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away fast. “You’re disgusting.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh,” Rio said, dragging on her cigarette. “I don’t think you actually believe that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t flatter yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have to,” Rio said, blowing smoke off to the side. “You’re doing a great job of it for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, jaw tight, lips threatening to betray her again. “I hate you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I miss you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “That doesn’t even make sense.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio dropped her cigarette into the mason jar and crossed her arms. “Would you like me to be more specific?”</p><p> </p><p>She was baiting Agatha. Intentionally, unmistakably. And Agatha- Agatha walked right into it without meaning to.</p><p> </p><p>Because her eyes had already dropped to Rio’s mouth. Because her brain, already working against her, had filled in the blanks before she could stop it.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“I miss your mouth,” Rio said, flat as fact. Her eyebrows lifted, daring a reaction. “Clear enough?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched around the cigarette she wasn’t smoking. For every way Rio proved herself different now, Agatha still managed to find herself surprised by it. </p><p> </p><p>She looked away. Long enough to sound amused when she said, “Now, Rio... is that how friends talk to each other?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t miss a beat. “Do friends kiss each other?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Great. Then as your best friend, I think we should kiss. Immediately.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at her, unimpressed. “Desperate?”</p><p> </p><p>“Painfully.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tragic,” Agatha said, dragging from the cigarette before dropping it into the mason jar. She gave Rio a mock pout, lips pushed out. “Guess you’ll have to suffer.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed through her nose, but Agatha was already walking past her, not bothering to wait for a response, cutting straight through the yard to the flower bed- still overgrown, still an eyesore, miserable and begging for attention.</p><p> </p><p>She crouched down and reached for the extra pair of gloves Rio had laid out earlier- set neatly on the edge of the tarp alongside a shovel, a hand trowel, and a wheelbarrow already half filled with cleared debris.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t turn around, but she felt Rio’s stare. The quiet. The question. She focused instead on the roots of her flowerbed, brittle with neglect, tangled too deep in soil that hadn't been touched in far too long.</p><p> </p><p>“You gonna keep moping or are we pulling weeds?” Agatha called out without turning around. </p><p> </p><p>There was no mention of what Rio had said the last time this bed came up. Agatha didn’t acknowledge what it meant that she was here now, in the dirt, doing it with her. Didn’t ask if Rio still believed something brighter could grow here, if she still thought pulling everything out meant there was a future worth planting. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t ask, because she didn’t want the answer. Not out loud.</p><p> </p><p>She just sank her hands into the soil and pretended it was about the weeds.</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Rio blinked once, then pushed off the trailer.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Hours later, they were covered in sweat and dirt, forearms streaked with soil, backs aching.  The sun hadn’t budged, still hanging high overhead.  Rio had handled most of the heavy work- shoveling, hauling, carving out the shape of the bed like she already knew what it was supposed to become. Agatha had floated in and out, helping where she wanted, offering commentary more than effort. Rio never said a word about it. If anything, she seemed... content to let her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha asked once how much it all cost.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer. Didn’t crack a joke, didn’t look up, didn’t so much as blink. She just started pulling off the price tags. One after another, a finality that made it clear the conversation was over. </p><p> </p><p>The answer was already in front of Agatha, buried in every shovel mark, every row of plants, every quiet detail handled without fanfare. Rio hadn’t skimped. Not on the effort, not on the cost, not on the time it clearly took to make her yard feel new. </p><p> </p><p>Affection, in Agatha’s life, had always arrived in messier forms. Conditional. Performative. Loud enough to echo, yet never quite landing where it should. It came tangled in expectations, handed out in pieces, then held just out of reach. She’d learned to take what she was given and act like it was enough. Rio had been part of that once- no matter how gentle her hands seemed, showing up had always come with silence.</p><p> </p><p>Here Rio was. Stubborn in the heat, dragging new life into a flower bed that had nothing left in it. Keeping her word without fanfare. Holding to the promise she’d made- that it would be different this time. That <em> she </em> would be different. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t ask again. </p><p> </p><p>Now, Agatha sat beside Rio, arms resting loose over her knees, offering commentary no one had requested. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re planting them too close together,” Agatha said, eyes on the cluster of purple azaleas Rio was tucking into place.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, wrist deep in soil, didn’t look up. “No I’m not.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her, then down at the neat, thoughtful curve Rio was shaping with the last few plants. The mulch had already been spread behind them, carefully kept clear of the stems. The soil was dark, well turned. Everything smelled green and damp and alive.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t comment on any of that.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she sniffed. “You should’ve gone with white.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally looked up and sat back on her heels. Her face was flushed from the sun, brow damp, but her voice stayed even. “You like purple.”</p><p> </p><p>“I like being difficult,” Agatha shrugged, eyes on the azalea. </p><p> </p><p>Rio peeled off a glove, wiped her wrist on her overalls, and pulled out her phone. “Nursery’s still open,” she said, checking the time. “I can go back and get white, if that’s what you want.”</p><p> </p><p>“You serious?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why wouldn’t I be serious?” Rio asked, genuinely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a short breath, frustrated with herself more than anything. “Because it’s stupid.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused, not hurt, but clearly trying to understand. “It’s not stupid if it’s what you want.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what I want!” Agatha snapped before she could stop herself.</p><p> </p><p>The silence that followed wasn’t awkward, just… weighted. Rio studied her, one glove still off, dirt smudged along her wrist.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio said finally, with a nod. “Then we don’t have to decide anything right now.” She glanced back at the flower bed, then toward the curb. “We’ve still got a few left to plant. If you want to go look at something else before we do, we can. I’ll unhitch the trailer.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched as Rio peeled off her other glove. Then she stood, dusting her palms once before turning toward the trailer.</p><p> </p><p>It made Agatha irrationally annoyed.  Not because it was irritating. Because it wasn’t. Because Rio was calm, deliberate, patient in a way that didn’t demand anything in return.</p><p> </p><p>She made it three steps toward the trailer before Agatha spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to do that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped. Glanced back.</p><p> </p><p>“They’re fine.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned fully, one brow raised. “Fine?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. Just picked at the grass. “They’ll live.”</p><p> </p><p>“They’ll do better than that.” Rio walked back without waiting for a response and kneeled beside the next plant, hands bare now, moving with purpose. “But if you hate them tomorrow, we’ll rip them out and try again.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p> </p><p>A solid twenty minutes passed where neither of them said a word.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t helping. She wasn’t talking. She just sat there in the grass beside her, too aware of the space between them, of the way Rio hadn’t looked at her since kneeling down again, hadn’t so much as spared her a glance. And it shouldn’t have mattered. It shouldn’t have made her feel like this.</p><p> </p><p>She could feel the sun on her neck, could feel her own skin prickling from sitting still too long, but it wasn’t just the heat. It was how fine Rio seemed with all of it. It didn’t make any fucking sense, because Agatha had been the one to pull back and Rio had kept her hands to herself like a fucking saint. Rio had respected every boundary, every pause, every breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was about ready to pull her fucking hair out becuase she was sitting right here and Rio couldn’t even be bothered to look up from a fucking clump of dirt. She clenched her fists in the grass, swallowed the heat rising in her throat, and tried -genuinely tried- not to say something.</p><p> </p><p>The silence held too long.</p><p> </p><p>“I am literally sitting in the dirt with you!” Agatha shouted, cutting through it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head jerked up, startled, and her hands stilled. Her eyes found Agatha’s, wide, but not in alarm. More like quiet, amused confusion and didn't quite understand why she was being yelled at. </p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Rio said after a second, the corner of her mouth twitching upward. “It’s hot.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth parted. She shut it again. Swallowed. “That’s not- You can’t-” She shook her head, exasperated. “You <em> cannot </em>just say shit like that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why not?”</p><p> </p><p>That -<em> that </em>- was the issue.</p><p> </p><p>Because there was no reason. None Agatha was willing to admit. Nothing she could say that wouldn’t sound like an accusation against herself. Because Rio was playing fair. Rio had played <em> only </em> fair. She had done everything right, said all the right things, pulled back when asked, waited, respected every unspoken rule.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, furious, not because Rio was doing anything wrong but because she wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe she’d been horny for weeks, maybe she hadn’t been able to scratch the itch no matter how many times she’d tried. Alone, unsatisfied, fingers aching with frustration. But it wasn’t like she could say, <em> I can’t get off anymore and I think it’s your fault. </em></p><p> </p><p>And really, it wasn’t just that. It was the proximity. The restraint. The sheer discipline of Rio’s hands as they disappeared into the soil instead of sliding over her skin.</p><p> </p><p>It was the silence. And the stillness. And the way Rio could make her feel like she was suffocating without ever raising her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s expression shifted, softening just enough to give Agatha whiplash. “Do you want me to stop?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she answered, with such disgusted immediacy it made Rio laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Then, without needing permission, Rio shifted forward on her knees until she was close enough that Agatha could feel the warmth of her, the stupid comfort of her, the presence that never asked to be let in but always managed to get there anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her eyes trained somewhere to the left, resolutely not looking at her. She didn’t want to see the ease in her face, the gentleness she hadn’t earned, the patience she hadn’t asked for but was now drowning in.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Still, Agatha didn’t look. </p><p> </p><p>Rio rested her dirty ass hand on Agatha’s bare leg- warm palm against sun warmed skin, fingers smudged with soil- and dragged her thumb over it like she had every right to. Agatha’s eyes dropped immediately, breath catching at the contact. Her tongue pressed hard into her cheek as she stared at the hand on her leg. And then, slow and begrudging, Agatha looked up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s expression hadn’t changed. She was still just <em> there </em>, impossibly calm, maddeningly steady, as if the tension hanging between them wasn’t heavy enough to split the sky.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby.” Rio said, devastatingly honest. “Come on. Give me something to work with.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s entire nervous system short circuited under the weight of that single word, delivered casually, affectionately, as if Rio had been calling her that her whole life.</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth went dry. Her heart picked up like it had been waiting for permission. Her thighs tensed, and she hated how much she felt it in her chest, in her stomach, in the throb between her legs. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha absolutely fucking hated how much she wanted to lean in, to let that word slip inside her mouth and have it stay there.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t call me that,” she whispered, too late and too breathless to make it sound convincing. A flimsy attempt at control that neither of them believed.</p><p> </p><p>What Agatha meant: <em> Don’t stop. Don’t take it back. Don’t ever fucking call me anything else. </em></p><p> </p><p><em> Gay, but whatever.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curled, soft and smug, and she nodded like she understood exactly what Agatha hadn’t even said aloud.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio said simply.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glared at her, hating the fact that her body was still humming. Hating the fact that Rio hadn’t taken her hand back. </p><p><br/><br/></p><p>“Seriously. Say that again and I’ll-”</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>“You’ll what?” Rio cut her off, eyes dark with challenge and something warmer underneath.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>“I’ll-” Agatha tried again, bluff crumbling mid sentence. “I’ll-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice dropped, perfectly timed. “Kiss me?”</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Couldn’t. Her eyes already fell to Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held still, heart pounding like she might actually die if it didn’t happen… but at the last second, Rio diverted, brushing past her cheek to murmur directly into her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned. </p><p> </p><p>No control. No covering it. It left her throat before she could even think about stopping it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back with a satisfied little hum.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh.” Rio tilted her head, pretending to consider something, lips pressed like she was trying not to smile. Then she looked off for half a second, just long enough to sell the performance, before turning back and raising one idle finger in the air. “You know,” Rio said thoughtfully, “Pretty sure friends don’t react like that.” she shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>God. Okay. Fine. Agatha gets it. This is about the other day. She called them friends. Big fucking deal. Rio’s bruised pride, front and center. Was Agatha being an asshole? Yes. But was she being honest? Also yes. Because it’s too much. It’s always been too much. Even when they did nothing at all, it was still loud.</p><p> </p><p>And honestly? That was safer. Silence was safer.</p><p> </p><p>Because if Agatha called it what it felt like, if she let herself want what it was already turning into, and Rio walked away again?</p><p> </p><p>No. Absolutely not. She wouldn’t recover. She knows that. She knows exactly what that would do to her, and she’s not interested in bleeding out over a mistake twice.</p><p> </p><p>This has to stay small. Manageable. Contained.</p><p> </p><p>Safe.</p><p> </p><p>Even if that’s a lie.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha scoffed, crossing her arms. “Are you seriously pissed off about that? That’s what we are, Rio. Friends.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged a little and kept hand exactly where it was on Agatha’s leg, thumb brushing up and down like a fucking counterargument.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, she said, “If calling this casual, if calling <em> us </em>friends, makes it easier for you to live in that terrifying genius brain of yours, go for it. Call it whatever you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. Didn’t raise her voice. But Agatha caught the barely there change in her posture, her breath, the way she stopped making eye contact halfway through the sentence.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not asking for a label.” she went on, quieter now. “ I just want you to kiss me when you want to. Without dissecting it to death before the impulse even makes it to your mouth.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly through her nose, jaw tight.</p><p> </p><p>“Just…” Rio’s voice softened again. “Stop lobotomizing yourself every time you look at me.”</p><p> </p><p>What the hell was Agatha supposed to say that?</p><p> </p><p>Rio had dropped it so casually, as if it wasn’t the most accurate insult she’d ever recieved. Like Rio had been watching her do it this whole time and was finally tired of pretending not to notice.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared out across her lawn, at nothing in particular. Anything but Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t angry. If she were angry, she’d know what to do. She could roll her eyes, say something cruel and clever, get up and walk inside. But this wasn’t anger. It was something quieter and more dangerous. Something with a pulse of its own.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so different now,” Agatha said quietly. It wasn’t a compliment. Or maybe it was. She didn’t know. It just came out and she hated that it sounded a little like awe.</p><p> </p><p>“Good.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for the strap of Rio’s overalls and gave it a small tug. It was barely an indication, more a reflex than a decision. And still, Rio came willingly with the certainty of someone who had always known where they belonged and was done being quiet about it. </p><p> </p><p>Their mouths met in a soft collision with teeth grazing, lips parting on instinct. The type of kiss that didn’t ask for permission or pretend to be anything less than what it was- undeniable, rooted, exact. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t clumsy or rushed. It fit. Rio’s lips moved with a steadiness that made Agatha’s spine tense and her chest loosen all at once.</p><p> </p><p>She broke it first. Let her forehead rest against Rio’s, eyes shut, breathing uneven. Rio smelled of cut grass and sun drenched flowers, of dirt and open air, and somehow clean. Nothing harsh. Nothing artificial. Just real, and unfairly good.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled and shoved her back with a hand to her chest. “You stink,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, smiling with another victory that made Agatha want to ruin her.</p><p> </p><p>That was her cue to leave. She stood without a word and went inside to shower and glare at the stupid fucking eucalyptus still hanging in there, like it had any right to remind her of Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>As if she needed one.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was never getting out.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed in the shower for nearly an hour, letting the water scald her skin while she tried to scrub the noise out of her head. The water was too hot, but she didn’t turn it down. Maybe Rio was right. And Agatha was too tired to fight it, too tired to think, even though every part of her still screamed to run in the opposite direction of Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>When she finally stepped out, she blow-dried and brushed her hair until it stopped looking feral. Then she pulled on pajamas. A white tanktop with the word <em> dyke </em> written in tiny red cursive across the chest, and a pair of white and red plaid boxers.</p><p> </p><p>By the time she peeked out the window, the sun had dipped low, casting soft gold across her freshly cleaned yard. It looked amazing. Peaceful. And very empty. No obnoxious x-ray tech.</p><p> </p><p>She stood there a moment longer, then grabbed her phone off the bed.</p><p> </p><p><em> Agatha: I’m hungry. </em></p><p> </p><p>Thirty minutes later, the doorbell rang.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t think about it. She didn’t analyze it. Didn’t rehearse what she’d say or check her reflection or brace herself for whatever version of who might be standing on the other side.</p><p> </p><p>She just got up. Walked barefoot to the foyer and opened the door.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood on her porch in gray shorts and a navy sweatshirt, her hair still damp from a recent shower. She held two pizza boxes in one hand, a six pack of Dos Equis tucked under her arm.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you know,” Rio said, as if they were already in the middle of a conversation, “that it’s a universally acknowledged truth that a night shift nurse cannot be good at her job and have a healthy personal life at the same time?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled before she could stop herself.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Rio Vidal was a simp for Agatha Harkness.<br/> </p><p> </p><p>And that was one thing Agatha never had to pretend not to love.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They ate on the floor, backs to the couch, knees pulled up, feet half tucked beneath the edge of the coffee table. Two boxes spread open between them, steam rising slowly in the dim light- one properly respectable, the other still catching flack for the pineapple. It had become a recurring bit, an argument without stakes, and neither of them felt like stopping it. Agatha chewed slowly, unfazed. Rio gestured dramatically with her crust, appalled. </p><p> </p><p>The air had cooled slightly since sunset, enough to raise goosebumps where skin met skin, but neither of them suggested a blanket. The television hummed in the background, some menu screen flickering, long ignored.</p><p> </p><p>After clearing off the coffee table, Rio’s hand landed on Agatha’s thigh.  Not with any intention. Just placement. The most natural place for it to land.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t cower. She didn’t even look at it. Her own hand found it without effort, covering the back of it loosely, her thumb tapping once against a knuckle before going still.</p><p> </p><p>They stayed like that while Rio pulled up a YouTuber she liked- some fast talking game streamer with a chaotic editing style and absolutely no chill. Her whole thing seemed to be screaming about terrible pull rates while opening blind boxes and somehow always getting the one she hated. Agatha had no real interest in it, but the chick was funny in a way that felt oddly specific, and it was something Rio was into. So she watched it. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, they made their way onto the couch. Agatha claimed her usual spot- the corner of the L-shaped sectional, where the cushions dipped because her ass had sat there so much, the shape practically molded to her. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio moved to take her place on the cushion beside her, Agatha caught her wrist and gave a small, silent nod toward the open space between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t question it. Just grinned, muttered something smug under her breath, and grabbed a pillow on her way down. She adjusted it over Agatha’s thighs, shifted until her head was in place, and sprawled out.</p><p> </p><p>She let her hand drop into Rio’s hair. Ran her fingers through it without paying much attention, just because she could. Rio flipped through options and eventually landed on <em> Practical Magic </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t mind.</p><p> </p><p>Not the closeness. Not the movie.</p><p> </p><p>Not any of it.</p><p> </p><p>Not when they were halfway through the movie and Rio turned her face slightly, cheek pressing deeper against her thigh. Not even when Rio brushed her nose along the inside of it.</p><p> </p><p>The contact was fleeting, accidental. But it sent a rush of goosebumps across Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>She felt the way Rio went still. The way she stopped breathing for a second, like she’d crossed a line she hadn’t meant to. Agatha could feel her start to pull away, already retreating before she could say anything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught the side of Rio’s jaw with a single finger. She pressed gently, guiding Rio back without a word.</p><p> </p><p><em> Come back. </em></p><p> </p><p>She hoped that was enough. Enough to say she wasn’t upset. That she didn’t need an apology. That she didn’t want Rio to move.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha’s brain chose to turn on her later then so fucking be it.</p><p> </p><p>She had survived worse than her own thoughts. She’d learned how to breathe through guilt. How to keep moving even when her brain was tearing itself apart for sport. She knew how to classify the damage, how to flatten it into something clinical, containable, distant.</p><p> </p><p>She would deal with it. She always did.</p><p> </p><p>But right now, none of that mattered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spent the better part of seventeen years trying not to think about this- and failing, every time. Lately, she hadn’t even been able to get herself off. Not for lack of trying, not for lack of effort, but because her hands, her toys, all of it had become useless. Inadequate. Nothing was enough. Not when her body had narrowed itself down to one person, one body, one impossibly specific absence. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t just desire anymore- it was refusal. The ache in her had grown smart, insistent. It knew what it wanted. And it was done pretending to settle for anything else.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled against her, the warmth of it spreading against Agatha’s skin. She could feel Rio waiting, breath steady, lips hovering close.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Agatha used her left hand to brush her thumb against the edge of Rio’s jaw. Her right hand remained tangled in Rio’s hair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted just enough to drag the bridge of her nose along Agatha’s skin again. Rio stayed where she was after that, face turned into the inside of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her hand drift, her fingers threading through the strands of Rio’s hair again. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips grazed the inside of her thigh like a question. Agatha let her legs fall open a little wider in answer.</p><p> </p><p>And when Rio pressed a kiss there. Agatha’s fingers curled gently in her hair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed her lips into it again, then again. One kiss. Then another, softer. The third, open mouthed, lingered- heat and breath and the unmistakable slide of tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath caught and her hips jolted. </p><p> </p><p>She’d been resting there, sprawled between Agatha’s thighs, head turned lazily into her skin. She watched Rio readjust until she was kneeling between her legs. Rio’s hand reached for the pillow she’d set there earlier and pulled it out of the way, dropping it to the floor without a sound.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands skimmed the outside of Agatha’s thighs, thumbs pressing in, tracing the curve of muscle and soft skin.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio leaned in and kissed just above the waistband of Agatha’s boxers- open mouthed, slow. Her tank top had ridden up, exposing a strip of bare skin along her stomach, and Rio’s tongue dragged up it deliberately, leaving a slick line of heat in its wake.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hooked her fingers into the waistband and looked up. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her hips. Rio smiled and pulled the boxers down- teasingly slow. She bent her knees without being asked, feet flat against the couch, thighs falling open for Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio eased down until she was stretched out on her stomach between Agatha’s legs. Her hands slid beneath her thighs, wrapping around them to grip her hips, anchoring Agatha there.</p><p> </p><p>The position sent a jolt straight through Agatha- how natural it felt, how easy it was to let Rio have her like this.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio whispered, voice catching. “You’re so wet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands flew into Rio’s hair before she could stop herself.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers flexed against Agatha’s hips. She pressed her forehead gently to the inside of Agatha’s thigh, trying to catch her breath, and then she whined against Agatha’s skin, soft and desperate, “Please, Agatha… let me taste you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head dropped back against the couch and a moan tore out of her before she could stop it. </p><p> </p><p>Her legs trembled around Rio’s shoulders, and she felt heat rush to her face. She exhaled, slow and shaky, the desperation in Rio’s voice had punched the air right out of her.</p><p> </p><p>Every time Agatha thought she had heard the worst of it, the part that might finally break her completely, Rio found a new way to speak. A new voice, a new angle, a new version of herself that made Agatha ache with want and something else entirely. Devotion, maybe. Hunger, certainly. </p><p> </p><p>A sound Agatha heard once and knew she would spend the rest of her life chasing.</p><p> </p><p><em> ‘Seventeen years,’ </em> Agatha’s thoughts murmured. ‘ <em> Seventeen years spent waiting for Rio to say your name like that.’ </em>And her heart -far less reasonable, far more cruel- pleaded with every beat to keep it sacred. Keep it hers. Let no one else ever speak it that way. Let it belong only to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down, chest heaving, eyes dark. “God,” she gasped, voice shaking. “Yes. I want it- I want you.”</p><p> </p><p>The last word cracked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved the second she heard it. Her mouth was on Agatha in an instant. </p><p> </p><p>Flat tongue, full contact up the entire length of her slit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned, her head slammed back against the cushion. Her thighs twitched hard against Rio’s shoulders, her heels digging into the couch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned into her, arms tightening around her thighs, dragging her closer, locking her in place. Her tongue flattened and dragged again, then circled her clit and when Agatha whimpered, Rio did it harder.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck- Rio- ”</p><p> </p><p>Rio dragged her tongue down and pushed inside of Agatha. Agatha’s legs clamped around her head, breath coming in short, shallow gasps. Agatha was soaked. She could hear it. Feel it. The mess of it. The want of it.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled out just enough to lick up everything she’d coaxed out of Agatha, then pressed a kiss directly to her clit again, tongue swirling, relentless.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands were in Rio’s hair, her grip tightening as her hips rolled up into Rio’s mouth, chasing every stroke.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved one hand away from her hip, dragged it down between them, and slid two fingers through the mess she’d made of Agatha. She pressed inside in one slow, steady push, sinking into her knuckles. Her mouth sealed around Agatha’s clit, tongue moving in hard, quick circles while her fingers fucked Agatha- deep and relentless, every thrust matched to the movement of Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha choked on a cry. “Don’t stop,” she gasped, voice cracking. “Rio, please- don’t fucking stop-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned like she was about to come just from hearing Agatha say that. Her fingers curled inside, again and again, hitting the spot that made Agatha see stars.</p><p> </p><p>The sound of Rio fucking her was obscene. Wet, fast, unrelenting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s orgasm ripped through her, violent and sudden, her whole body seizing, thighs crushing Rio’s head, mouth open on a broken scream. Her hands tightened in Rio’s hair, pulling hard, but Rio didn’t stop- she kept licking, kept fucking her, drawing it out, making her ride it all the way through.</p><p> </p><p>Rio slowly eased her fingers out, careful, her touch gentler now. She pressed a kiss to the inside of Agatha’s thigh. Then another, higher up. Then finally pulled back, sitting back on her knees.</p><p> </p><p>Everything was too much. Agatha’s pulse throbbed in her ears. Her skin was flushed and damp, her legs sticky and trembling, her mouth dry.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her head forward. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips were parted, breath coming in shallow, her hair stuck to her face. Her cheeks flushed, mouth wet, pupils blown so wide they barely looked human.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart kicked harder in her chest. Her thighs twitched where they still rested open. She reached out and dragged her thumb slowly across Rio’s bottom lip, wiping through slick wetness.</p><p> </p><p>The second Agatha’s thumb dragged across her lips, Rio whimpered- soft and broken, barely audible. Her mouth parted further under the touch, breath stuttering out of her in a shaky exhale, and her lashes fluttered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s whole body was tense with restraint, but her mouth was open, wanting, and helpless under Agatha’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>She looked up at Agatha like she was waiting to be told she was allowed to keep breathing.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus,” Agatha whispered. “Look at you." She swallowed hard. Her thumb stayed at Rio’s mouth, but her hand trembled. She needed to feel Rio. Needed her closer.</p><p> </p><p>“Come here, please.” Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p> </p><p>She moved and climbed into Agatha’s lap, legs sliding around her, knees pressed into the cushions on either side. Her thighs bracketed Agatha’s hips, and she settled over her without a word, without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her hands and cradled Agatha’s face. Her thumbs brushed along her jaw, her fingers resting just beneath her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut for a second, overwhelmed by the intimacy of it- the weight of Rio in her lap, the warmth of her hands, the way Rio looked at her like she wasn’t sure if this was real.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha opened her eyes again, Rio was still staring.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed, her voice laced with need.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s response escaped in a humiliating squeak, too high, too soft to take back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s forehead dropped to hers. Their noses touched.</p><p> </p><p>“Kiss me,” Rio whispered, pleading threaded through every syllable.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for Rio’s wrists, where they still cradled her face, and held them. Then she tilted her head just enough to let her nose skim the curve of Rio’s cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth parted in waiting.</p><p> </p><p>The first kiss she gave Rio was small. Just a brush of mouths. Agatha pulled back just enough to breathe, then went back in before Rio could chase her.</p><p> </p><p>The second kiss was intentional.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha parted her lips and fit herself to Rio’s mouth. Her fingers threaded into the hair at the nape of Rio’s neck, holding her steady as Agatha tilted her head and deepened the kiss. Her tongue slid against Rio’s, unhurried, coaxing, and that was when Agatha tasted herself.</p><p> </p><p>She tasted herself on Rio’s mouth, and something in her burned at the filthy intimacy of it. It made Agatha groan.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed every trace she’d left behind. Needed to burn it into her mouth so she’d never forget what Rio tasted like with Agatha on her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her back with no hesitation. Her hands tightened at Agatha’s jaw, nails biting into skin, mouth opening wider like she didn’t want to miss a second of it. She moaned into Agatha’s mouth -high, needy, broken- and Agatha swallowed it down like a reward.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands slid from Agatha’s jaw to her shoulders, fingers toying with the straps of her tank top. She traced the dip of the neckline, unsteady and slow, following the edge where skin met fabric. Then lower, down to the hem, where her fingertips slipped just beneath, a silent question trembling against Agatha’s stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha answered without a word. She pulled back just enough to let Rio lift the shirt over her head and toss it aside.</p><p> </p><p>The second it hit the floor, Agatha leaned in for another kiss, but Rio caught her with flat palm against her chest. She eased Agatha back into the couch cushions.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brown eyes were wide, hungry, almost pained as they dragged over every inch of Agatha’s bare skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let Rio stare. Let her linger, drink her in, fall apart over her. There was power in watching Rio tremble just from the sight of her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart was pounding beneath Rio’s palm.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked once and swallowed hard. She shook her head like she was trying to reset herself. She whispered, “You’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped up to Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>The room stilled, or maybe time did. For a breath, all she could hear was the rush of blood in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look away. Didn’t smirk. Didn’t soften the blow of what she’d said with a joke, the way she used to when things got too real. She just sat there like she meant it. Like she hadn’t just ripped the air from Agatha’s lungs with a single sentence.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to say something, but there was nothing clever waiting on her tongue. Only the echo of Rio’s words and the ache in her chest that said: <em> This is dangerous. </em></p><p> </p><p>So instead Agatha said, quiet and far too honest, “You can’t say things like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze moved to the place where her hand rested, fingers spread over Agatha’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>Her thumb moved once, slow.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve swallowed that sentence more times than I can count.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to throw up. Not really. Not at all, actually.</p><p> </p><p>She just couldn’t think about what it meant. Not right now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still in her lap, still in her stupid shorts, legs warm and bare against her own. That was something. Something to look at.</p><p> </p><p>It helped. Not much.</p><p> </p><p>Because if she let herself think too long she’d open her mouth and everything would come out. All of it. The years. The feelings. The truth she had buried so deep it started to feel like fiction.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha couldn’t afford that.</p><p> </p><p>Because the moment she spoke, it would stop being about want and start being about everything else.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t push.</p><p> </p><p>She let Agatha kiss her. Let her pretend the silence was choice and not fear. Her hand stayed exactly where it was, still resting over the beat of Agatha’s heart.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed the corner of her jaw, then her cheek. She thought if she stayed close enough, if she stayed busy enough, maybe that sentence would stop echoing in her head.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her sweatshirt herself and pulled it over her head, slow enough that Agatha had to watch. Had to see every inch of Rio revealed like a confession.</p><p> </p><p>The fabric slipped up and over, baring skin inch by inch- first the soft curve of her stomach, then the line beneath her ribs, then-</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha rasped, her hands gripping Rio’s thighs, squeezing hard enough to make her gasp.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let the shirt fall to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands slid upward until her palms rested just beneath Rio’s ribs. She leaned in and pressed her mouth to her collarbone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. Her hands gripped Agatha’s shoulders, pulling her closer, and their chests touched. The sudden contact made them both gasp.</p><p> </p><p>Years of silence collapsed in that breathless press of skin, in the ache of what they could’ve had and never did.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back enough to kiss lower, took Rio’s nipple into her mouth and sucked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned and her whole body arched in response. Her hands flew to Agatha’s hair, holding her there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t stop. She licked, then sucked again, rougher this time, until Rio whimpered. Then she moved, dragging her mouth across Rio’s chest and pressing a kiss just above her heart.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted Rio to feel it later, when she was alone, when Agatha wasn’t there to do it again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips sealed around skin that pulsed beneath her, and she stayed there until the bruise bloomed under her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>She kissed it after, gently, then moved- trailing her mouth along the sharp line of Rio’s collarbone, up the side of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tipped her head back and let her, her fingers curling tightly in Agatha’s hair, pressing her closer with a shaky exhale that turned into a low, desperate whine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha licked a line up Rio’s throat, then closed her mouth just below Rio’s jaw and sucked another mark into place. This one even darker. Possessive.</p><p> </p><p>When she pulled back, Rio was gasping, lips parted, throat flushed and bruised. Agatha’s hands slid down over Rio’s ribs, her waist, until they reached the waistband of her shorts. She moved  one hand on Rio’s thigh, the other sliding between them.</p><p> </p><p>She pressed her palm over the fabric, right where she knew Rio wanted her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s body jerked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave her one slow grind of her hand, enough pressure to make her hips jolt again, then gripped the waistband of her shorts with both hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Take these off,” Agatha said, voice rough.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her hips in Agatha’s lap, hands fumbling for the waistband.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha helped, dragging the shorts down her thighs, her fingers grazing skin as she worked them off and tossed them aside.</p><p> </p><p>Rio settled back into Agatha’s lap.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in and pressed a kiss to the underside of her jaw. Then another, a little higher. She teased Rio, barely brushing her knuckles over the heat between Rio’s thighs. When Agatha finally touched Rio she fully cupped her and the sound Rio made wasn’t even human.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was soaked. Drenched. So fucking wet. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha moaned, mouth right at Rio’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>“For you,” Rio said breathlessly. “It’s all for you.”</p><p> </p><p>The sound that tore from Agatha’s throat was guttural, half whine, half sob, ripped straight from her chest. Her head fell against Rio’s temple. She lined two fingers up, and pushed inside. Agatha groaned, her free hand grabbing at Rio’s back as her fingers sank fully in, knuckles deep. </p><p> </p><p>“You feel so good,” Rio whined into Agatha’s ear. “So fucking good. Please, don’t stop. Please.”  She rocked her hips harder now, fucking herself on Agatha’s hand. Rio’s thighs trembled around her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t. She couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio moaned.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her- messy, open mouthed, lips dragging across her cheek, her throat, her mouth. She could barely keep up. Not physically, her body knew exactly what to do. It was the rest of it. The sound of Rio moaning her name. The way Rio felt around her fingers- tight, wet, pulsing. The way Rio’s skin burned against hers.</p><p> </p><p>Her name came out of Rio again, low and hushed. “Agatha… baby.”</p><p> </p><p>It sounded so desperate Agatha almost stopped entirely because of the way it made something in her chest twist.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever Rio was holding in, it wasn’t meant to come out. Agatha felt that before she even heard the words.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you ever think about me while you were fucking her?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s body kept moving, her hand still buried deep inside the woman she hadn’t stopped wanting, but everything else -her mind, her heart, the tightness in her chest- froze.</p><p> </p><p>She felt Rio tense in her arms like she’d only just realized what she said. Her fingers dug into Agatha’s back in fear, probably bracing for the fallout.</p><p> </p><p>“I- ” Rio’s voice shook as she tried to take it back.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t let her. She brought her hand to the back of Rio’s head, fingers sliding into that familiar mess of hair. She tugged gently until Rio’s eyes met hers, brown and full of panic. And Agatha kissed her. Sloppy, breathless, desperate.</p><p> </p><p>Because she had. Not always. Never just in passing. Never just once. Agatha had thought about Rio in the places where regret thrived- when someone who loved the outline of her, but never really what lived inside it, when she stopped recognizing herself in the mirror and wondered if anyone else ever had. She had thought about what it would’ve felt like if they hadn’t been so careful. If one of them had just said something. Reached. Stayed.</p><p> </p><p>Lying would be a cruelty, and this truth felt like the only thing Agatha had left to offer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whispered against Rio’s mouth, “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>The second the word left her mouth, Rio came hard around Agatha’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Her whole body seized, her breath tore out of her throat, and every muscle in her legs locked around Agatha’s hips. She buried her face in Agatha’s neck and held on, nails pressing into her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned aloud, caught off guard by the sudden slick heat flooding her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still trembling, still pulsing around her, small aftershocks chasing each other through her body as she clung tighter to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed where she was, fingers still inside, now slow and steady, guiding her through it.</p><p> </p><p>She kissed the side of Rio’s head, then her temple, then the corner of her mouth. No rush to move, no need to speak.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t lift her head. Her breath came in warm waves against Agatha’s throat.<br/><br/></p><p>The question still echoed in Agatha’s mind. And the answer had already been written into every part of her body and soul:</p><p> </p><p><em> There had never been anyone else. </em></p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t let it linger. She didn’t want to think. Not right now. She didn’t want to hand this over to her unforgiving mind, let it turn it over and pick it apart until nothing soft was left.</p><p> </p><p>They sat there in silence. Agatha’s fingers still inside Rio. And Rio still curled into her neck, body warm, breath slowing against her skin. The worst of the aftershocks had passed, but neither of them moved.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio shifted her hips, just enough, and Agatha eased out of her slowly. Rio inhaled sharply at the loss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back into the couch and reached behind her for the throw blanket. It took a little maneuvering with one arm still half wrapped around Rio, but she managed to drape it over both of them, even if it barely reached past their knees.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted, reaching down to fix the blanket. She unfolded it properly, adjusting the blanket until it covered them both. Then she stretched her legs out along the couch and settled back in, one arm draped across Agatha’s waist, her head tucked beneath her jaw.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want some water?” Agatha asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head and pressed closer, mouth brushing against Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for the remote buried in the cushions and restarted <em> Practical Magic </em>. The opening credits rolled again. She didn’t expect them to watch it. But it gave her something to look at. Something to do with her eyes while Rio stayed pressed against her.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>They’d moved upstairs not long after the movie ended. Agatha blamed it on the- what? Afterglow? Temporary insanity? Some kind of blissed out, post orgasmic daze that made her forget how to pretend she didn’t want this exact outcome. That she hadn’t spent just three years short of half her life trying not to want it.</p><p> </p><p>No. Not quite… actually, it was much worse than that:</p><p> </p><p>
<em> When the credits started to roll and Rio sat up, reaching for her shirt without saying a word, Agatha didn’t need to ask what she was doing. She saw it in the way Rio kept her head down, in the way her fingers brushed the fabric like she was stalling. It wasn’t guilt. It wasn’t shame. And it sure as hell wasn’t indifference- not after what they’d just done.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha wasn’t stupid. She knew exactly what this was. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fear. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Quiet. Unmistakable. Deeply fucking sad. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It reminded Agatha of someone trying not to wake a house they didn’t think they belonged in. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> And it made her fucking sick. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Because Rio didn’t believe she was wanted. She was trying to leave before Agatha could ask her to. And maybe if Agatha had been in a different mood, with more distance between them and less truth in her mouth, she would’ve let her go. But it was insulting. Gentle in the worst way. An exit that assumed she wasn’t worth the mess. Pathetic in its silence. Infuriating in its certainty.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha all but barked at her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “What are you doing?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio froze, her shirt curled in one fist. She didn’t look up. She didn’t speak right away. She just held still, like she was waiting for something to break.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I didn’t want to assume,” Rio said finally. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> That was all. No accusation. No self pity. Just the most honest explanation Agatha could’ve imagined, and the most infuriating one. Because Rio had meant it. She wasn’t being coy. She’d already made peace with the idea that she wouldn’t be asked to stay. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha rolled her eyes, not because she was annoyed, but because the alternative was saying something that sounded too close to ‘please stay’. She wasn’t going to beg. She wasn’t going to soothe someone who’d spent months getting under her skin only to cower the second they got in. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Don’t be an idiot.” Agatha got up,  ass naked, and walked upstairs without waiting for a response. She didn’t check to see if Rio was behind her. She didn’t need to. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> But still, it sat wrong in her chest. Because if Rio hadn’t followed, Agatha would’ve let her walk away. That much she knew. And she would have never forgiven herself for it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> They made it up the stairs and to the hallway before something in Agatha froze. She stopped walking without realizing she had, and when she turned around, Rio nearly ran into her. For a moment, they just stared at each other. Rio opened her mouth, maybe to explain, maybe to apologize, but Agatha didn’t give her the chance. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha grabbed her by the face and kissed her- hard, uncoordinated, anything but graceful. Her hands moved without thought, dragging through Rio’s hair, pulling her closer until Agatha felt her back hit the wall. It wasn’t about control. It wasn’t about heat. It was the only way Agatha knew how to tell Rio that she was wanted here. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She wanted to erase the look on Rio’s face before it settled in too deep. That ridiculous, horrible look that said she hadn’t understood what any of this meant. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha kissed her as it was the only language she trusted. She didn’t care if it made sense. She didn’t care if it helped. She just couldn’t let Rio believe, even for a second, that it had been a mistake.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> And maybe it wouldn’t survive the morning. Maybe neither of them would know what to do with the sunlight.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha had wanted Rio before, when neither of them said a word, and silence was the only thing they ever dared to share, in every version of Rio she’d never been brave enough to touch. She wanted Rio in the silence after, across years and cities and the life she built without her. She wanted her now, in whatever came next, in every future version of herself that still didn’t know how to say it out loud.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She would always want Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Even if it wilted by daylight, even if she never learned how to keep it alive, Agatha would tend it through the dark- long enough to feel it bloom beneath her fingers, if only once. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She woke slowly. Sleep clung to the edges of her vision as she opened her eyes, then narrowed them against the light slipping past the curtain. It was soft and indifferent. Morning, probably. Maybe later. She didn’t check.</p><p> </p><p>Her body registered the heat before anything else. Skin overheated in a way that had nothing to do with the weather. She was too warm, too bare, and not alone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It wasn’t a fucking dream. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still here, currently operating as Agatha’s personal furnace. Which, fine, wasn’t new. She’d always run hot.</p><p> </p><p>Years ago, when they were only what they allowed themselves to be, it was Rio’s legs- always on fire, always stretched across the mattress at impossible angles until they found Agatha in sleep. Or her back, warm and solid, pressed against Agatha’s without invitation.</p><p> </p><p>Some mornings, Agatha would wake to find her. A leg thrown over her hip. An arm slipped around her waist. Fingers curled in the fabric of a borrowed shirt like they’d never let go. Once, her back pressed flush to Rio’s chest, her nose tucked into the curve of Agatha’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>It never felt intentional. Not at first. But over time, Agatha noticed the pattern- how Rio always found her even in sleep. Always reached for her. Always stayed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha used to complain about it.</p><p> </p><p>But this.. <em>this</em> was different.</p><p> </p><p>This was the first time Agatha had woken up to Rio Vidal naked in her bed. Head tucked under Agatha’s chin. One thigh hooked over her own. A hand draped low on her stomach, thumb twitching occasionally, like even asleep, Rio couldn’t fully shut off.</p><p> </p><p>At some point they made it to Agatha’s bed last night, dragging each other across the sheets, too far gone to care what it looked like. It wasn’t gentle. It wasn’t rough. It just didn’t stop. It was messy. Wordless. Too much, and somehow not enough. They didn’t stop moving until Agatha couldn’t tell where her limbs ended and Rio’s began.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had assumed she’d wake up choking on reality. That she’d find Rio tangled around her and feel claustrophobic, suffocated by too much body heat and the implications of what they’d done. That some part of her would flinch and start pulling it apart until it resembled something she could leave behind without consequence.</p><p> </p><p>But that didn’t happen.</p><p> </p><p>There was no rush of shame. No scramble to break it. Just the weight of Rio against her, warm and steady, and the startling realization that she could still breathe. That her chest didn’t feel tight. That she didn’t want to move.</p><p> </p><p>For years, Agatha had told herself a story about other versions of this. Other universes, other lives where things were simpler. Where the timing was better. Where one of them had said something early enough to change the ending. She used to find comfort in the idea that somewhere out there, they got it right.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, that fantasy had begun to feel offensive. Condescending. As if there was a less fucked up, more deserving version of her who had earned the thing she couldn’t have. As if it was ever about deserving.</p><p> </p><p>She’d started to believe they were built to break- across every timeline, every life, every shape their story might’ve taken. That something in them would always buckle before it held. And somehow, that was easier. Easier than believing there was a world where they didn’t fall apart. Where it hadn’t been this hard. Where someone else got to keep what she could barely admit she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed still. Pressed her mouth to the crown of Rio’s head and let herself breathe.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Freely. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Because seventeen years into whatever twisted, diabolical form their friendship had taken, this felt, if not right, then less wrong. A small, improbable moment carved out of a timeline that had otherwise gotten everything backwards. And for once, she didn’t want to question it. Not yet. Not while it was still warm in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t naïve enough to think it would last. The universe, or whatever bored cosmic bastard with a sadistic sense of humor, had never let her get away with much, least of all this. And if she was being honest -which she wasn’t- she could admit it probably wasn’t the universe at all. But honesty didn’t serve her here. It never had. It was easier to call it bad timing, bad luck, bad design. Easier to believe the fault was structural rather than personal. That someone, somewhere, had rigged it from the start.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe the truth was: it had been Agatha all along. That she had written the rules. Changed them. Refused to play by them. She’d protected herself so well that she never had to admit she was the one laying down the pieces. Always pretending it was a game someone else started.</p><p> </p><p>And that was something she refused to look too closely at.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her palm flat against Rio’s back, let her thumb move in the smallest brush she could manage. A small act of proof. That she was here. That neither of them had left.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t care if it was temporary. She wasn’t interested in permanence or promises or whatever came next. Not when everything in her had finally gone quiet from the effort of trying not to ruin it. Not when Rio was still sleeping against her like this was safe. Like Agatha had ever known how to be that for someone.</p><p> </p><p>She could live inside this moment a little longer. Safe. Uncomplicated. Before the universe remembered who they were. Before she did.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers moved. Slid slowly, brushing up and down the length of Rio’s spine, lightly.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>In response, Rio pressed in closer, her nose brushing Agatha’s collarbone.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Finally.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held still. Pressed her mouth firmer into the crown of Rio’s head and didn’t breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Tension had settled across her body, but now it vibrated- electric in her toes, in her chest, between her ribs. Every molecule alert, buzzing, ready to misread.</p><p><br/>Then-</p><p><br/>Movement. Small. Intentional.</p><p> </p><p>A thumb brushed across a top her ribs. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand had stayed there all night, resting soft and possessive in the space between them, like even in sleep she’d been waiting for the moment Agatha might reach back. Her breathing was still steady. Not quite as deep as before.</p><p> </p><p>Her thumb brushed again, slower this time. Then her whole hand moved, skimming forward to the side of Agatha’s ribs. Palm flat. Warm. Testing.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t stay there. Instead, she dragged her hand back the way it came, retracing the curve of Agatha’s ribs, then forward again. And again.</p><p> </p><p>A pattern. A line drawn and redrawn across Agatha’s skin until it started to hum.</p><p> </p><p>And every time Rio’s hand swept down, she let it drift, inch by inch, closer to the soft of Agatha’s stomach. </p><p> </p><p>A silent question. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her body answer for herself, her hips rising just enough to tell Rio yes, this, again, now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t rush. Didn’t change her rhythm. Her hand kept moving in the same slow pattern, only now her thumb pressed deeper, dragging firmer with every pass. And Agatha could feel her heart hammer between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth pressed into the side of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered out too fast, her chest rising before she could stop it. The tension in her body rewired itself in a second, heat pulling upward into her jaw, her scalp, her spine.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed. Blinked hard. She wanted to stay still. To keep the anticipation suspended just a little longer.</p><p> </p><p>“You awake?” Agatha whispered, breath catching halfway out of her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>Which was generous, considering what she actually meant was: ‘<em> you better not fucking be asleep for this, because I swear to god…’ </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed into her skin.  Her hand dipped lower, found the edge of her hip, then slipped to the other, pressing flat, deliberate in answer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand shot to the back of Rio’s head. She threaded her fingers through her hair and pulled, dragging her in, anchoring her there. Her body felt traitorous- tuned too tightly, wound so close to breaking that even the drag of air across her skin felt dangerous. She pressed her mouth and her nose into Rio’s hair, clinging to the scent like it could anchor her.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t graceful. It was reflex. A desperate attempt to stay grounded, to keep her body from arching up and chasing the friction of fucking nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Seventeen years. That’s all. No big deal.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was actually going to lose her fucking mind. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted against her grip, nudging her way upward, unfolding from where she’d been tucked beneath Agatha’s jaw. Her body was flush against Agatha’s side, eyes still puffy with sleep. The sleepiness of her face softened every line and made her unbearably beautiful. </p><p> </p><p>Her hand slid between Agatha’s legs, confidently. </p><p> </p><p>So Agatha opened her legs wider.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved again, up and over, situating herself between them. She leaned down until their foreheads touched. Until breath mingled between them. Until the silence was its own kind of homage.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had known their silences. She’d worn them like a second skin, tasted them in the back of her throat, bitter and metallic, made from all the things she never let herself say. They lived in the air between them. She’d felt them when Rio left a room, in glances that never lingered long enough, in every touch that almost happened and didn’t. </p><p> </p><p>Their love had always arrived through absence. It was never spoken, never claimed. Only endured.</p><p> </p><p>Love by omission.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her hand without thinking, touched Rio’s jaw with something too careful to be called want, too certain to be called fear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>Slow. Unforgiving. Unfamiliar.</p><p> </p><p>Even now, there were parts of Rio Agatha had never touched. Not with her hands. Not with her mouth. Not with any part of herself willing to admit what this was.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, disgustingly reckless, learned them one kiss at a time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back. She didn’t say anything. Just shifted enough that she could see Agatha’s face, to let Agatha see hers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried not to look. She tried to fight it, to study the arch of Rio’s cheek or the line of her jaw or anything else that might soften the blow. But it was too late. She was already in it.</p><p> </p><p>She was already drowning in the brown of Rio’s eyes, already being pulled under.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time, they didn’t look away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand cupped her, full and firm, and rocked her hips into the pressure. She held there. Firm. Steady. Letting Agatha feel the weight of it. Then moved again- her other hand sliding beneath Agatha’s knee, guiding her leg up and around her waist, opening her further with an ease that felt insanely intimate.</p><p> </p><p>And briefly, Agatha thought, maybe they should just invest in a strap on together. Co-own it. Name it. Build a shrine. Skip the therapy. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to be fucking ruined.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio rocked her hips again, hand still pressing between her thighs, and Agatha’s head fell back against the pillow, a sharp gasp tearing loose from her throat.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t delicate. It wasn’t planned.</p><p> </p><p>It was the sound of a woman losing an argument with her own body.</p><p> </p><p>She gripped Rio’s ass, fingers flexing, trying to keep her close. Trying to chase friction, chase pressure, chase anything she could get her hands on.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t pretending anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Rio adjusted -still watching, still fucking watching- and finally slid two fingers inside of Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>A moan tore through Agatha, loud and sudden, and before she could stop it, Agatha’s eyes slammed shut. Her head snapped back, chin colliding with Rio’s. Above her, Rio grunted, steadying herself with one arm braced next to her head, the other still caught between them. Rio adjusted her position slightly and drove forward, harder this time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into Rio’s ass- possessive, frantic, almost cruel. She couldn’t help it. Every thrust forced a whimper from her throat, the sound guttural and breathless, barely recognizing the sounds falling from her own mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Look at me,” Rio begged under her breath, voice coming apart as it hit Agatha’s chin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did. Stupidly, desperately- she looked.</p><p> </p><p>And the way Rio looked at her tore through the last of her defenses.</p><p> </p><p>She was just there, stripped down and terrifyingly sure, and Agatha felt it land deep, right where she couldn’t afford it. And Agatha, who always needed a reason, suddenly couldn’t remember what she’d been fighting so hard to protect.</p><p> </p><p>Another moan broke loose from Agatha’s chest, louder this time, raw from the weight of being seen.</p><p> </p><p>“God, Agatha,” Rio whimpered, her voice rising, trembling. “You’re gonna make me- fuck, I can feel you.”</p><p> </p><p>All Agatha could do was hold on. She hadn’t realized until now that Rio was chasing it- grinding into her own hand, fucking into Agatha with growing urgency. Each movement deeper, rougher, more precise. Her hips snapped forward with intent, as if she knew exactly what Agatha would need and wouldn’t stop until she gave it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to scream. Wanted to sob. Wanted to pull her down and never let her leave.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio’s voice broke again- wrecked, desperate, pleading.</p><p> </p><p>“Say my name. Please. Just say it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did.</p><p> </p><p>It tore from her like a confession wrung from bone laid bare before the only force that had ever stood a chance of answering her the way she needed. The way no one else ever could.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said it again as if it were scripture. As if it were gospel. As if it were the name she was made to kneel before. A name she’d carried in the hollow of her chest for seventeen years, silent and sacred, hoping -one day- it would be safe to speak aloud.</p><p> </p><p>When she did, Rio came. Shaking, gasping, hers.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha followed. Undone, not by the force of it, but by what it meant to worship and be met.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the morning passed without urgency. Time didn’t stall. It just moved differently after. Slower. Warmer. A little too easy.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, they dozed off- barely an hour, not long enough for Agatha to stop feeling everything. She woke up warm and sore and unreasonably aware of the fact she HAD stayed curled into Rio’s side the entire time.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio slipped out of bed, Agatha didn’t follow. Didn’t look. Didn’t ask where she was going or what she needed. She wasn’t listening for answers. She stayed exactly where she was, sheets tangled at her waist, the air still thick with whatever was happening between them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wandered back into her bedroom barefoot, two mugs in hand, wearing nothing but Agatha’s old Westview U t-shirt, and not a trace of shame. Her tongue was tucked into her cheek as she glanced at the coffees, then back up at Agatha with a glint that said, '<em> look what I brought you.' </em>She walked in to Agatha's bedroom, looking entirely at home, and Agatha let her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio climbed onto the bed and crossed her legs, her knee pressing into Agatha’s thigh. Agatha, still naked, shifted upright against the headboard with an ease that suggested familiarity, even if none of this had ever happened before. She wasn’t overthinking it. Her body just responded, unbothered, as if this was always how the morning was supposed to go. She watched as Rio took a sip from the mug and held it in her mouth for a moment, staring at Agatha unblinking. Then, without a word, she leaned forward and spit the coffee back into the mug in a slow, steady stream, the sound of it dribbling loud and vaguely offensive in the quiet of her bedroom. Agatha didn’t even blink. She’d expected exactly that. Rio muttered something dry about it being impressive for it being entirely water, and Agatha let out a quiet laugh, took the mug from her hand, and drank from it without looking away. Rio stared at her, wide eyed and trying not to grin. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio took the other cup and chugged it just to get the caffeine in her system, obviously not for taste. At some point after that, Agatha decided she wanted her shirt back. No reason. No real one, anyway. She just tugged the shirt up and off Rio and tossed it across her room. If she had to sit there exposed, then so did Rio. She told herself it was about fairness. Equal exposure. Civilized nudity. Feminist logic. Whatever.</p><p> </p><p>They stayed like that for hours.</p><p> </p><p>Not touching, but always touching. Elbows, knees, a foot curled under a thigh. They talked. Not about anything that mattered. At some point, Agatha had her phone in hand, scrolling through her work schedule for the month that had just been uploaded to the hospital’s portal- only half paying attention when Rio pulled a face, wild and obnoxious in the middle of her story. Agatha raised her phone and took a picture of Rio without really meaning to. It was too close, all teeth and blurry movement, the edge of Rio’s bare shoulder suggesting more than it showed. Agatha didn’t delete it.  She also didn’t explain it.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, Rio mentioned that everyone was going bowling tonight instead of game night at Jen and Alice’s. Agatha barely processed it at first. Bowling? As in- <em> rented shoes that had been on hundreds of strangers’ feet and the smell of cheap beer and frozen pizza baked into the walls </em>? The word dropped into the room like it belonged to someone else’s afternoon. She didn’t respond right away. Mostly because her brain refused to process the idea of anything existing outside the four walls they were in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The thought of a bowling alley -sticky floors, fluorescent lights, other people talking- felt violently offensive and so far removed from the bubble they were in. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t want to put clothes on. She didn’t want to see anyone. She didn’t want to leave her house. She didn’t want to wash her sheets. She didn’t want to put a bra on and pretend she hadn’t spent the last twelve hours letting Rio do whatever she wanted to her. She didn’t want to be perceived. By anyone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio said something about only going if Agatha went. Something she had heard before, in what felt like a hundred different lives. Back when they were too proud and too scared and too unwilling to admit they were following each other into places just to be close. It meant more now. Or maybe less. Maybe it was just habit. Agatha couldn’t tell. Only that something small and traitorous inside of her liked the sound of being followed. Of being chosen.</p><p> </p><p>She ended up agreeing, eventually. Of course she did. Because that was the problem with bubbles- they always popped.</p><p> </p><p>But before that, before reality returned, she let herself enjoy the moment for what it was. It was domesticity, she guessed. Or a version of it that involved two naked idiots drinking terrible coffee in bed and pretending it wasn’t a big deal. </p><p> </p><p>What Agatha didn’t say though -what she wouldn’t dare speak into existence- was how much she liked this. Not just the sex, though that had been… a lot. But the after. The stillness. The dumb things. The way Rio kept touching her thigh absentmindedly. The way they didn’t flinch when their skin brushed. The ease of it. The lack of disaster.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, against all better judgment, believed she could handle it. Really. As long as they didn’t talk about it. Not the past, not what it meant, not how good it felt. If they avoided eye contact during any and all emotionally charged moments, if they stuck to jokes and coffee and maybe kept the shirtless photography to a minimum- this could work. She was sure of it.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe, <em> maybe </em> , no morning sex again. Because this morning’s had been <em> really </em> intimate. Like ruin your life intimate. Which was fine. Once. Briefly. But doing that twice would set a precedent Agatha wasn’t prepared to manage. Not yet. Probably not ever. Definitely not before bowling.</p><p> </p><p>Which seemed like a reasonable boundary.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe.</p><p> </p><p>As long as they didn’t talk about it.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha was ready for bowling. </p><p> </p><p>Probably.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They were at Rio’s apartment. Rio didn’t have a single piece of clothing at Agatha’s place, and Agatha had made the executive decision that she would not be seen in public, least of all at a bowling alley, escorting Rio around while she wore Agatha’s clothes and looked freshly fucked. That was not going to happen. She had limits.</p><p> </p><p>After Rio had showered in Agatha’s bathroom -without saying a word about the stupid eucalyptus she definitely saw hanging from the showerhead. Agatha had, for reasons still unclear to her, decided they could show up to bowling together. Together, like a unit. One arrival, one exit. Same car, same time, same breath. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know why. The only explanation she could come up with was that her brain had melted and was now dripping out of her ears.</p><p> </p><p>“I swear to god, if you don’t stop moving, I will beat you with this beauty blender,” Agatha muttered, digging her thumb into Rio’s cheek, dabbing concealer on her jawline with more force than necessary.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, who was currently sitting on her own bathroom counter with her fingers curled into Agatha’s belt loops, had been swinging her feet like an overstimulated child for the past ten minutes. Agatha was close to snapping.</p><p> </p><p>The hickeys weren’t subtle. There was one under her jaw, two along her throat, and another blooming up the edge of her chin like a badge. The worst of them was lower, pressed into the skin over Rio’s sternum, right above her heart. That one was safely hidden under her shirt, but Agatha couldn’t stop thinking about it. She tried to pretend she was relieved it didn’t need makeup. She was not. She was the opposite of relieved.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t even mad at the marks themselves. She was mad that they existed in the first place. Mad that she had let herself fall into this so easily. Mad that she still hadn’t figured out what she was doing or why she cared so much about how it would look when they walked in together.</p><p> </p><p>They hadn’t left Agatha’s house all day. They’d had sex the night before. Then again after the movie. Then again before terrible coffee. Then again before they had left and Rio had bent her in half and turned her into something that could only be described as spiritually unwell. And now here Agatha was. Doing her makeup. Fixing her shirt. Pretending she wasn’t crawling out of her skin.</p><p> </p><p>They had left their bubble, and Agatha hated it. Every second of it. She hated the thought of stepping into a bowling alley and pretending this wasn’t real, pretending she hadn’t spent the last twenty-four hours touching someone in every way that mattered and still couldn’t say out loud what any of it meant.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated how it had never once felt like a mistake.</p><p> </p><p>“I think you should try breathing,” Rio murmured, maddeningly amused, like she could hear every thought screeching through Agatha’s skull.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze, blender still in hand, and gave Rio a murderous look. “They’re everywhere,” she hissed, jaw tight. As if the evidence wasn’t the loudest thing in the fucking bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, absolutely unfazed, leaned in until their faces were inches apart. She smiled, slow and smug, and entirely too aware of what she was doing. “And whose fault is that?” she murmured, gaze dropping to Agatha’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw locked. She forced herself to stay still, to keep her eyes where they belonged, to not replay what that mouth had done to her. “Some idiot who didn’t think about you having to show your face in public,” she muttered, voice rough.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin stretched wider, all teeth and sin, like she was proud of herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to ignore it. She didn’t need this right now. She needed to finish hiding the proof of her own bad decisions and somehow pretend she wasn’t seconds away from climbing back into Rio’s lap just to shut her up.</p><p> </p><p>There was still bowling to survive. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio had driven. Parked in the farthest, most forgettable corner of the lot, shaded and empty, like she was doing them both a favor. Like she already knew Agatha wouldn’t be able to keep her hands to herself.</p><p> </p><p>What followed was a blur.</p><p> </p><p>Fast, messy, and completely her own fault. Not in a guilty way. Just in the technical sense. Her hand had ended up on Rio’s thigh. Her mouth had found Rio’s neck. She’d said something, maybe nothing, and then Rio was in her lap, straddling her. Agatha’s hand was down the front of her jeans. Their mouths pressed so tightly together it felt like trying to breathe underwater. Rio was riding her fingers like the only thing that mattered was how fast she could come. Which, apparently, was very. Faster than Agatha wanted. Faster than felt fair. But they were already late.<br/><br/></p><p>Then Rio was gone.<br/><br/></p><p>Not metaphorically- literally. Off her lap, out the door, already standing in the parking lot like her bones hadn’t melted over Agatha’s hand two seconds ago. Like nothing had happened at all. </p><p> </p><p>“Ready?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t moved. Her fingers were still wet. Her hand still hung awkwardly in the space Rio had left behind. She didn’t know what she was supposed to do next. Rio’s come still clung to her knuckles. She could still feel it. On her skin. Under her nails. <em> Rio.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced down, clocked the pause, and reached across to the console. She pulled a pack of wipes from the glove box. Because of course she had them. Rio had everything figured out, always. Agatha had used to hate that about her. She hated it more in this moment than ever before.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped the pack into Agatha’s lap and peeled a few out, but didn’t hand them over. Instead, she took Agatha’s hand gently, offering her service. First, her mouth- slow, deliberate, obscene. Rio’s tongue dragged along her fingers, cheeks hollowed, jaw tight with effort. It made Agatha’s skin felt hotter than it already was. Her lungs felt wrong. Agatha whimpered. </p><p> </p><p><em> Embarrassing </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Then the wipes. Cool. Sterile. Functional. Erasure.</p><p> </p><p>And just like that the evidence, it was gone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel it happening. The return to the real world. The pop in the bubble. The crawl of something colder up the back of her neck. She could see the bowling alley from the car windshield. The people, the lights. She could feel the words clawing up her spine, burning their way out of her mouth:</p><p> </p><p>“We’re still frien-”</p><p> </p><p>“Friends,” Rio said simply. “Yeah. Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was zipping her jeans, reaching for her baseball cap in the floorboard Agatha had knocked off somewhere between moaning and forgetting her own name. Rio settled it back onto her head, kissed the corner of her mouth like she was sealing something shut for Agatha’s sake, and gave her a tight lipped smile that didn’t touch her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t hot. It wasn’t cold. It was... polite.</p><p> </p><p>A thank you.</p><p> </p><p>A goodbye for now. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed around the knot in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said and her throat burned hot. </p><p> </p><p>Just her name, but Agatha packed every plea she could into it.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Slow down. Look at me. Take this seriously. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t say a word. No screaming from the rooftops that I finally fucked Agatha Harkness. I promise.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost said thank you. She bit down on her tongue hard enough to taste blood.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want anyone to say anything,” Agatha said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “They won’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t promise that.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio agreed. “But I can tackle whoever tries.”</p><p> </p><p>That startled a laugh out of Agatha. Brief, sharp, ugly. “Yeah, because that wouldn’t make it obvious.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled. “Then I’ll make sure it’s worth it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything else. She couldn’t. Her tongue felt too thick. Her brain couldn’t hold all the parts of her trying to split open. She’d wanted Rio to act like it was nothing, and Rio had. Perfectly. Respectfully.</p><p> </p><p>And she hated how much comfort she took in it. Hated how badly she needed Rio to treat it like nothing so she wouldn’t have to admit it had been everything.</p><p> </p><p>Now Agatha had to sit with what that felt like.</p><p> </p><p>She wiped her palms on her jeans and got out of the car, pretending that the ache in her chest was just leftover adrenaline. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tightened her jaw and followed Rio in silence. The parking lot was loud. A bass line from somewhere inside was already thudding through the pavement, vibrating up through Agatha’s shoes. She rolled her shoulders back, tried to remember how her face was supposed to work. Neutral expression. Mild interest. Like she hadn’t just fucked Rio in her car. </p><p> </p><p>At the entrance, Rio held the door open without looking at her. Agatha stepped into a rounded atrium glowing with soft pink light, casting a sheen over polished concrete floors and curved metal trim. At the center stood a circular desk with staff in black polos moving quickly behind it- scanning people in, handing out shoes, pulling up pre-booked lanes on mounted tablets.</p><p> </p><p>Rio headed straight for the counter without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha followed. She kept her gaze moving, scanning the layout- instinct. To the right, the arcade sat behind a pane of tinted glass, pulsing with retro lighting and what looked like a trillion different arcade games. To the left, past a velvet rope and an arched hallway, there was an outdoor lounge tucked under string lights and heat lamps, like the place hosted live music or influencer birthday parties on the weekends. </p><p> </p><p>The whole thing was too nice. Too designed. It left Agatha weirdly alert.</p><p> </p><p>When they reached the counter, Rio leaned forward slightly, already speaking to the attendant. She rattled off something about a reservation under Kale. The attendant nodded, tapping quickly at the screen, and asked about shoe sizes. </p><p> </p><p>“Eight,” Rio said. “And seven.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at her, but didn’t say anything.</p><p> </p><p>The attendant nodded again, turned, and pulled their sizes from the shelves, sliding the shoes across the counter. A total was given. Before Agatha could reach for her purse, Rio had already pulled out her wallet, slipping her card into the reader. A receipt was handed over. A lane number. No questions. No discussion. It was all handled before Agatha even remembered she might’ve offered to split it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned and handed her the shoes, brushing the edge of Agatha’s fingers. Her hand was warm. She kept the other under her arm.</p><p> </p><p>“You good?” Rio asked, softly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. It wasn’t a lie, but it also wasn’t not her mutely acknowledging the fact that Rio had just handled the entire interaction without even checking in.</p><p> </p><p>She could’ve been annoyed. Should’ve been, maybe. But instead, she felt the smallest, sharpest relief. Like she hadn’t realized she’d been holding her shoulders that tight until Rio made space for her to breathe. </p><p> </p><p>Which was horrifying. </p><p> </p><p>Together, they stepped away from the desk, shoes in hand, and headed toward the lanes.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like she was walking into a fucking fever dream. <em> Pink Pony Club </em> was playing over the speaker system, the bass thumping through the floor like it was trying to rearrange her spine. Neon spilled across every surface- walls pulsing magenta, bar lights rotating in slow blues and purples.</p><p> </p><p>They rounded the corner toward their assigned lane, and the first thing Agatha saw was Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Standing on a couch. Not sitting. Standing. In socks with a beer bottle in one hand, her back to them, throwing her ass around with full dedication as she shouted the lyrics loud enough to drown out the speakers. Not one ounce of shame anywhere in her body.</p><p> </p><p>Billy nursed a violently pink cocktail with three straws, somehow managing to look both horrified and enchanted. Alice clapped along like she was front row at a drag show. Jen stood off to the side, filming the chaos with a grin. Yelena stood near the bar, completely ignoring whatever Nat was saying in her ear. Her attention hadn’t moved once from Sage, a stunned grin tugging at her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Their section was a mess of half finished drinks, abandoned shoes, and the quiet thrum of too much energy too early in the night. Everyone else seemed to take it in stride.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did not.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t panicking, exactly. But she was absolutely aware of every single choice she had made in the past twenty four hours, and how they had all led, very directly, to this moment. </p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped beside her and brushed their arms together. Let her elbow linger against Agatha’s. And when Agatha didn’t move, she turned her head slightly, just enough that her voice could reach her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve seen her do worse,” Rio said. “This is actually pretty tame, considering.”</p><p> </p><p>It was stupid, how effective that was. Agatha felt her body start to unwind without permission. Her shoulders dropped. The static in her chest eased. She could still hear Sage yelling over the music, still see Jen grinning with her phone out, still feel the dozen pairs of eyes that might eventually swing her way. But none of it carried the same charge it had a minute ago.</p><p> </p><p>This was ridiculous. Absolutely, unarguably absurd. But it was also fine.</p><p> </p><p>She had stepped into it willingly- into the noise, the chaos, the weird orbit of people who clapped when Sage got up on furniture. She had invited it. She’d opened the door and let Rio back in, and maybe she hadn’t planned for what came after, but she was here now.</p><p> </p><p>And strangely, impossibly, she didn’t feel out of place.</p><p> </p><p>Let the music play. Let Sage keep dancing on furniture. Let the whole night spiral into chaos if it wanted to. None of it mattered- so long as no one said her name and Rio Vidal’s in the same goddamn sentence.</p><p> </p><p>Because if they did, Agatha was going to jail. </p><p> </p><p>When Sage turned around and spotted them, her eyes lit up like someone had just handed her fire.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, well, well,” Sage shouted over the music, pointing her beer bottle directly at them. “Look who finally decided to show their faces.”</p><p> </p><p>It was an announcement that made the entire group turn. Heads swiveled. Conversations paused. Jen lowered her phone, grinning already. Alice let out a dramatic gasp. Even Billy perked up, eyes locked on Agatha with a cartoonish smile. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha considered turning on her heel and walking straight back out the door, but she knew better. That would only draw more attention.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in slightly, elbow still touching hers. “Too late to run,” she murmured, entirely unbothered.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Rio was already peeling away from her side, heading toward the couch like she didn’t feel every single person in the room watching her go.</p><p> </p><p>Sage hopped down with zero concern for physics or beer spillage. She barely landed before setting her beer down and launching herself at Rio with both arms outstretched like she was aiming for a tackle. Rio, instead of ducking, caught her and promptly dragged her into a chokehold, arm looped loosely around her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Sage shouted something unintelligible and shoved at her ribs, but Rio only tightened her grip a little and muttered something into her hair that made Sage bark out a laugh. Sage broke free and shoved Rio with both hands, grinning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched from where she stood, utterly still.</p><p> </p><p>They were absurd. Loud, physical, tangled up in each other’s space without apology. It was juvenile. It was annoying.</p><p> </p><p> It was exhausting just to look at.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had come here for bowling. For shoe rentals and hoping for low stakes small talk and something that didn’t ask her to feel anything she couldn’t walk away from. And now here she was, pretending she could stand at the edge of Rio’s life without wanting to be pulled all the way back in. </p><p> </p><p>She wanted access to it. Full fucking access. She wanted to know the version of Rio that didn’t belong to her anymore. The one that kept showing up in pieces she didn’t recognize- comfortable, rooted, known by people who weren’t her. That was all. Nothing serious.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t let the thought linger. She couldn’t. And besides, Teen was already headed her way, pink drink in hand, eyes lit up like he was about to say something she didn’t have the patience for. She stepped forward before he could say anything, cutting him off with pure efficiency, and dropped onto the couch to deal with the shoes. They were hideous. She tied them with the precision of someone preparing for combat.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever else was happening tonight, she was still here to win. </p><p> </p><p>Winning was the only thing that made any of this tolerable. It always had been. Bowling, cards, trivia- she didn’t care. The sooner she got on a lane, the sooner she could stop thinking about Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Or, failing that, at least pretend wanting to sit beside her had something to do with strategy.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The next hour passed without incident. She was in the lead, obviously. Rio was close behind her, which felt both predictable and vaguely offensive in its irony. Of course she was chasing her. Agatha didn’t bother keeping track of the others. They existed purely as background noise. Her focus was fixed, single minded, and competitive enough to be borderline pathological. Stay ahead. That was the game. That was always the game.</p><p> </p><p>To her surprise, Jen hadn’t pounced the second they were alone. She hadn’t asked about Rio, hadn’t pried, hadn’t so much as raised an eyebrow about how they’d shown up together. And that, somehow, was worse. Jen knew her too well not to notice and Agatha knew better than to mistake it for oversight. This was Jen throwing Agatha a bone, and Agatha snatched it like she hadn’t eaten in weeks.</p><p> </p><p>They were wedged together on the couch now, Jen deep in the trenches of workplace gossip while Agatha sat rapt, drinking in every petty detail. She didn’t care if it made her a terrible person. Gossip was currency, and she wanted to be rich. Jen had just started in on a particularly scandalous rumor about one of the newer residents when Jen’s name was called, and she stood with a groan, muttering that she’d finish the story later.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely had a second to process the absence beside her before she felt the shift. That brief, eerie stillness like the top of a rollercoaster. Across from her, Sage and Billy were seated on the opposite couch, both their eyes had snapped to the newly vacated seat and then immediately to each other. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed. “Jesus Christ.”</p><p> </p><p>They moved in tandem, limbs clashing as they scrambled to beat the other across the short distance. Billy led with his shoulder, aiming to brute force his way in, but Sage was faster, meaner, and had clearly come prepared to humiliate him. She shoved him backward with enough force to send him crashing back into his seat, then stepped onto the low table between the couches, using it as leverage to hurl herself into the empty spot. She landed hard next to Agatha, planted and smug, barely breaking a sweat. </p><p> </p><p>The whole thing unfolded in less than five seconds. It was insane. Absolutely uncalled for. But at this point, not remotely surprising.</p><p> </p><p>Billy flailed dramatically across from them, scowling as he adjusted his shirt. “You’re insane,” he snapped.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t even look at him. “You were in my way.”</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus, you’re so aggressive-”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, do you want me to be gentler next time? Maybe write you a poem while I kick your ass?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy scoffed. “You’re gonna die alone.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage smiled. “Maybe. But at least I’ll die a winner.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage turned to her just as Agatha watched Jen’s ball roll straight into the gutter, hopeless from the moment it left her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t really spoken to Sage since the adopted sister reveal. That particular bomb had been dropped with no warning and even less tact, and Agatha still wasn’t sure what to do with it. Sage kept trying- always cheerful, always conveniently nearby. She showed up in the NICU with x-ray orders and thinly veiled small talk, acted overly casual at game nights.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rarely gave her anything back. It wasn’t personal. Or maybe it was. She wasn’t sure. The whole situation felt like a trick she hadn’t realized she was falling for until the pieces were already in place.</p><p> </p><p>“Billy’s starting to think you like him more than me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t like either of you.” Agatha glanced at her, then immediately looked away.</p><p> </p><p>Sage hummed under her breath, unconvinced. “You’re upset with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s ridiculous.” Agatha scoffed, unwilling to look at her. </p><p> </p><p>“You won’t even look at me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Maybe that’s because you bamboozled me.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage let out a soft laugh. “Bamboozled you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally turned to face her, eyes sharp. “Yes. Bamboozled. Hoodwinked. Strategically misled,” she hissed, the words clipped and fast. </p><p> </p><p>Sage blinked, obviously thrown. “What are you even talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>“Game night.” Agatha snapped. “You knew exactly what you were keeping from me. Was that the plan? Get in first, play nice, make it easier to stomach the fucking info bomb she dropped on me? I don’t fuck with being played.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage nodded along, dragging out the sound. “Ohhh.” It was theatrical. Mock realization. Then, flatly- </p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, waiting for more. </p><p> </p><p>Sage only shrugged. “I’d heard a lot about you. I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about.” Her tone wasn’t defensive- it was honest, maybe even a little proud. “Didn’t say anything because I figured you’d write me off before I got a word in.”</p><p> </p><p>“So you thought deception was the best way to introduce yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t deceive you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t correct me.” Agatha shot back. </p><p> </p><p>“Was I wrong to do that?”</p><p> </p><p>Absolutely yes. But also no. If she’d known then what she knew now, it wouldn’t have been silence- it would’ve been scorched earth. She would’ve stayed long enough to ruin the energy, to make sure they both understood exactly how fucked it was.</p><p> </p><p>Or maybe not. Maybe she would’ve done nothing at all. At this point she doesn’t really care.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, considering. “I don’t know.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t clarify. She wasn’t offering more. It was just the truth- ugly and incomplete.</p><p> </p><p>Sage nodded. “Cool. Great talk. Can you stop being weird now?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not being weird.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re absolutely being weird. And it’s making me weird, which I don’t like.” She nudged her heel against Agatha’s foot. “So let’s move on before it gets anymore awkward and I have to light myself on fire.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed, “You wouldn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“I would. I’ve got matches in the car. Let’s bowl and pretend none of that happened. For your sake, not mine. Oh, and tell Billy you like me more than him… Strictly for morale.”</p><p> </p><p>It pulled a laugh out of Agatha before she could stop it- brief, involuntary, too real to take back. Sage caught it and didn’t gloat, just nodded like that was the outcome she’d been aiming for all along.</p><p> </p><p>Then Sage stood, grabbed a ball off the rack, and as she turned toward the lane, she tossed over her shoulder, easy-</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia keeps asking about you, by the way. It’s starting to get sad. Don’t make the woman beg, Agatha.” Sage didn’t wait for a reply. Just lined herself up at the edge of the lane, eyes locked on the pins.</p><p> </p><p>No pause for effect. No fishing for a response.</p><p> </p><p>Just a hit and run. The way Rio would’ve done it.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha sat there and watched, dumbfounded- like a fucking fool.</p><p> </p><p>Infuriating. Effortless. Entirely intentional. Undeniably related to Rio fucking Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood in line at the snack counter, arms crossed, posture rigid, and fully committed to pretending she cared about ordering a Diet Coke. She didn’t. She wasn’t thirsty. She wasn’t hungry. She just needed something to do that didn’t involve throwing a bowling ball at someone’s head. Not anyone in particular. Just… in the general direction of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing about Rio’s behavior was overtly wrong. She hadn’t been cold. She hadn’t been distant. She had been polite. Friendly. Reasonable. Fucking normal. </p><p> </p><p>It was psychotic.</p><p> </p><p>And fine- Agatha had wanted her to keep it quiet. She’d set the boundary. That was fair.</p><p> </p><p>But did Rio have to be so fucking good at it?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha crossed her arms and shifted her weight, and clenched her jaw. She imagined grabbing Rio by the collar and demanding to know why she hadn’t even bothered to flirt with her tonight. Why she hadn’t been insufferably up Agatha’s ass. Why she had stopped acting like Agatha was the most interesting person in the room.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had decided to behave. Which was apparently the worst thing she could have done because Agatha hated her for it. </p><p> </p><p>Not really. But enough to stand in this stupid line and stew about it. She wasn’t going to look for Rio. She wasn’t going to say anything. This was exactly what she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>So why did it feel less like control and more like loss?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took one step forward in the line. She could feel her own expression curling into something unpleasant. She knew she looked mad. She didn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>And then she felt that familiar presence she couldn’t ignore even if she tried behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha straightened automatically, but she didn’t turn around. She didn’t say anything. She just stared at the menu and reminded herself that throwing a tantrum in public was generally frowned upon.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Rio said nothing. She just stood there, close enough to be a presence but not enough to push it. Then her voice came, low and maddeningly casual.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart.” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes didn’t move from the board. She could feel the heat in her neck immediately, the pressure building behind her eyes and in the tight corners of her jaw. She didn’t want to respond. She wanted to keep pretending she had the upper hand, that she was the one who had walked away unaffected, that she hadn’t been mentally screaming since the moment Rio stopped paying attention to her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not mad,” Agatha muttered, voice stiff and entirely unconvincing.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Rio said simply.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not,” Agatha repeated, now fully aware of how juvenile she sounded but too deep in it to stop.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>That was it. That was all she got. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha half turned her body, whipped her head around, and stared at Rio fucking stunned.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was just standing there. Relaxed. Polite.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned back slowly, jaw clenched, pulse thrumming in her throat. She wanted to scream.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re pissing me off,” Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m doing what you wanted,” Rio replied, calm as anything.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, it’s pissing me off.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, like that amused her. “Come smoke with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” She folded her arms tighter. “I don’t think I will.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, Agatha’s body betrayed her. Her shoulders eased, barely, as though they’d been waiting for permission. That tone. That inflection. No one else ever said her name like that. She didn’t answer. She let her eyes close, slow and controlled, maybe if she moved carefully enough she wouldn’t have to acknowledge what it did to her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped in, too close now, her breath warm at the shell of Agatha’s ear. Not touching, but close enough to feel it.</p><p> </p><p>“I miss you,” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lip curled.<em> That was better.</em></p><p> </p><p>“I know.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t moved. Was still standing there, probably poking her tongue against the inside of her cheek the way she always did when she didn’t know if she was losing or winning.</p><p> </p><p>Good. Let her wonder.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything else right away. She let the silence stretch, let the tension settle again. She liked the way Rio was holding still, like any sudden movement might ruin it.</p><p> </p><p>“You gonna say something else that’ll make me feel better, or just stand there breathing on me?”</p><p> </p><p>“You want me to beg?” Rio said, voice infuriatingly steady.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t care what you do,” Agatha shot back, adding a shrug for effect. Unbothered. Not insanely aware of how turned on she was. Not at all.</p><p> </p><p>There was a pause. Then Rio leaned in, closer than she had all night, her body leaning in just enough to press up against Agatha’s back. Not hands. Not hips. Just the faint pressure of crossed arms brushing against the middle of Agatha’s back- light, contained, like she was trying not to touch her at all and failing on purpose.  </p><p> </p><p>“Stay at my place tonight,” Rio said, soft. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked.  She could feel Rio straining under all that self control, her body betraying her in the smallest, most satisfying ways. And fuck, it felt like winning.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I don’t know,” Agatha said lightly, loading it with just enough condescension to make herself feel powerful. “We have work tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>And she expected that to be the end of it. Expected Rio to back off. To take the hit and behave, like she’d been doing all night. Good girl. Gold star.</p><p> </p><p>But then- </p><p> </p><p>“Please.”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t even a word. Not really. Just breath, hot against her ear, low and dangerous and too fucking soft.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, baby. I’ll do anything.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a sound. It wasn’t intentional. Wasn’t dignified. It punched out of her in a pathetic little gasp- high in her throat, half a whimper, half a groan, fully, irreparably fucking humiliating.</p><p> </p><p>She went still.</p><p> </p><p>Fully frozen. Eyes wide, chest locked, brain freshly wiped by the horny wrath of god.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Alright. Wrap it up. Wrap it the fuck up, Agatha.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” she snapped, too loud and too fast, already turning away like the sound hadn’t come from her at all. Because if she didn’t walk off right then -immediately, with purpose- she was going to do something catastrophic. Something irreversible. Something she would absolutely not be able to explain to security.</p><p> </p><p>She stormed back toward their group with her jaw tight and her hands clenched into fists at her sides, walking like she hadn’t just nearly collapsed because a woman said please.</p><p> </p><p>It was fine.</p><p> </p><p>She was fine.</p><p> </p><p>Totally calm. Totally in control. Definitely not seconds away from hauling Rio into the nearest disgusting bowling alley bathroom and dropping to her knees. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Jesus Christ. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed a Diet Coke and a fucking lobotomy.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was standing, grabbing the last of her shit, counting down the seconds until she could get out of this godforsaken neon lit purgatory with Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was on the far side of their section, leaned up against the plastic high top counter. It was one of those built in setups, too high to sit at comfortably, with stools and the open racks underneath for bowling balls, like some bastardization of a bar and a storage unit. She had her arms crossed loosely, talking to Sage and Alice like nothing was out of place. Like she hadn’t whispered ‘<em> please, baby. I’ll do anything.’ </em>against Agatha’s ear earlier and then gone right back to looking like a smug, patient son of a bitch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had tried -<em> tried </em>- desperately not to notice her. Not to track every change in posture, every glance, every small movement that reminded her exactly how far she was from losing control in public. It hadn’t worked. Of course it hadn’t. Rio was right there, in the same goddamn bowling alley, being hot and polite and pretending like she didn’t know Agatha was one more breath away from losing her shit.</p><p> </p><p>Teen was on the couch beside her, talking at length about… Agatha doesn’t fucking know. But she was nodding along like she could hear it. She couldn't. She was too busy focusing on the clock, on her breath, on the promise of being done with this place and in Rio’s car. The night was almost over. She was almost free.</p><p> </p><p>And then- </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>She felt her stomach drop so violently she was sure she had just shit it out of her own asshole. </p><p> </p><p>It came from the wrong direction. It came from a voice that should not, under any circumstances, have been here.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned slowly, already knowing what she would see and still unprepared for it.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Not in Chicago.</p><p> </p><p>Here.</p><p> </p><p>In the middle of a bowling alley in fucking Westview, New Jersey.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her ex-wife, eyes locked and expression neutral, even as her brain started screaming: <em> No, I want more time! </em></p><p> </p><p>It was grief, like something sacred being ripped out by its roots. A primal, internal protest against the inevitability that nothing Wanda touched ever survived. Even permanence learned to wilt beneath it. </p><p> </p><p>“Can we talk?” Wanda asked, soft.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, mouth dry, heart shredding through her chest. She didn’t have an answer.</p><p> </p><p>Still, her fingers twitched -just barely, just once- in the direction of Rio Vidal, who was not looking at her. Of course. Classic. Same reach as before. Still pathetic. Still unanswered. And yet, apparently, her body hadn’t gotten the memo, because here it was again. Subtle. Stupid. Waiting around like a little idiot, just in case Rio fucking Vidal wanted to notice this time.</p><p> </p><p>This was what it looked like when the universe put a hand between her shoulder blades and whispered, <em> ‘You don’t get to have that.’ </em></p><p> </p><p>But Agatha saw it in her periphery- a blur of motion veering straight toward her ex-wife. She didn’t bother looking. Just let her eyes fall shut and waited.</p><p> </p><p>A shout followed. Wanda’s voice, loud with disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha opened her eyes, Rio was standing in front of her. A little out of breath from crossing the room. Or maybe from thirteen years of trying to get here in time.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, still a little winded. “Sorry I’m late.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned to look behind her. Agatha followed her gaze- Wanda, soaked. Sage crouched beside the fallen pitcher, scrambling, mouthing a series of apologies that couldn’t have sounded less genuine. Beer everywhere.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked back at Agatha, a small smile pulling at her mouth like she didn’t regret a single second of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Had to improvise.” Rio said, with a shrug that felt too easy to be innocent. She reached out slightly, a fingertip grazing the back of Agatha’s hand. “Let’s go back to mine, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Rio?” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>None of it felt real. The sounds, the lights, the clatter of pins- it all fell away. All she could feel was the flood in her chest, unasked for but absolute, at the sight of her. That dumb, beautiful face Agatha had been pretending to outrun, while tracing its outline in every life that never felt like hers.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio breathed. “I’m sorry it took me so long.” She said it again, quieter this time, as her pointer finger reached out and curled around Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>“I-“ Agatha started, but stopped. She swallowed, glancing over Rio’s shoulder. Sage was making an absolute scene, and somehow, Wanda looked genuinely rattled by it.</p><p> </p><p>Good. </p><p> </p><p>She looked back. Rio hadn’t looked away.</p><p> </p><p>“Get me the fuck out of here.”</p><p> </p><p>“My fucking pleasure,” Rio said, a breath of relief slipping through her grin as she grabbed Agatha’s hand fully. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand tightened around her own, her thumb brushed across her knuckles, and tugged gently, coaxing Agatha to follow.</p><p> </p><p>They wove through the mess of rental shoes and drunk adults. Rio didn’t stop. Not even when someone shouted “Hey! Private party!” </p><p> </p><p>They’d just made it to the carpet when Agatha heard it. It came from behind them, cutting through the noise with an ease that made Agatha’s stomach turn.</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t think you had it in you, Vidal! Honestly, I’m impressed. After our last conversation, when you slunked off with your tail tucked, I figured you’d have the sense to stay gone.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped cold.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha walked directly into her back and startled at the contact, but Rio didn’t budge. For a second, she thought she had misheard.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Last conversation. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The word landed like a misstep on a staircase- ordinary until it wasn’t, until her stomach dropped and nothing made sense.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What the fuck was Wanda talking about? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, trying to make sense of it. Wanda’s words didn’t fit anywhere. They bounced and bumped against her skull like that old 3D Space Cadet pinball game she used to play on her mother’s computer. Flashing lights and endless dings, where once the ball started moving, you just sat there and watched it spiral out of control.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. Her skin went cold.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio’s hand was no longer in hers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned because she always did. Because she had learned to chase the silence without ever meaning to. A reflex. Her heart, stupid and unrelenting, lurched after Rio like it always did- clawing, screaming, desperate to be held by the only hands it had ever called home.</p><p> </p><p>She looked, just in time to see Rio moving straight toward Wanda. Her jaw was locked. Her fists were curled. Her shoulders were squared in a way Agatha had never seen before.</p><p> </p><p>That was the part that rattled Agatha most.</p><p> </p><p>She had spent years trying to get a rise out of Rio for fun. She had pushed her, cornered her, just trying to get her to react. To snap. To yell. Anything. But Rio had always been infuriatingly calm. Even in their worst moments, she never looked like this.</p><p> </p><p>There was no mask left. Just a fury so sharp it looked like it didn’t belong to her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood frozen, caught in utter disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s shirt was soaked through, clinging to her chest. She looked wrecked and triumphant, like someone who had nothing left to lose and had decided to aim carefully.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw Sage scramble upright, already moving before Rio could take another step.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t!” Sage shouted, and then she crashed into Rio with her full weight, arms hooking around her shoulders, with a force that made Agatha flinch.</p><p> </p><p>A thud, a breath knocked loose, the squeak of shoes. They staggered back, off balance for a second, but didn’t fall.</p><p> </p><p>“You stupid, miserable fucking cunt!” Rio yelled over Sage’s shoulder, her voice loud enough to draw attention.</p><p> </p><p>Pins clattered somewhere in the distance. A child near the snack counter started crying. Music still played overhead, far too cheerful for what had just been said.</p><p> </p><p>It was the first time Agatha had ever heard Rio raise her voice like that.</p><p> </p><p>Sage shoved Rio. Hard. “Hey- get a grip,” she snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio!” Agatha shouted.</p><p> </p><p>That single word pulled Rio’s gaze immediately. She looked at Agatha, breathing hard. Still furious. Still shaking.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes were wild- glassy, burning, like she was barely holding herself together. And for a heartbeat, Agatha didn’t recognize her.</p><p> </p><p>Not this version.</p><p> </p><p>This was not the person who used to tuck every feeling away behind a mask, who could disarm with a glance and disappear behind silence before anyone got too close.</p><p> </p><p>That Rio was gone. Burned through, actually.</p><p> </p><p>Who stood in front of Agatha now was raw and exposed, rage crackling beneath her skin and carved into the lock of her jaw.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re done,” Agatha said softly. “Come with me.”</p><p> </p><p>For a breath, nothing.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio exhaled and gave a single nod.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her arm and signaled Rio forward.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved.</p><p> </p><p>They walked together, shoulder to shoulder, past stunned faces and spilled beer, past the blur of noise behind them. Agatha heard Wanda call her name. She didn’t turn around. She kept her eyes ahead, her pace steady.</p><p> </p><p>Two security guards brushed past them, heading toward the noise. Somewhere behind, Jen’s voice rang out, sharp and clear. Then Alice, angrier, more direct. Agatha didn’t look back. Her friends had it handled.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” Wanda again, louder now. “Don’t you dare leave with her!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was at her side, then slightly ahead of her. She was breathing hard.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m your wife!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s stride lengthened. Her jaw was still tight. Agatha didn’t need to see her face to know what that voice was doing to her. She could feel it. Every part of Rio’s body was tense, she was holding herself in check, every step a decision not to turn around and make it worse.</p><p> </p><p>They rounded the corner.</p><p> </p><p>The sounds behind them dulled. The light changed. The entrance’s atrium was quieter, colder. Rio kept moving. She was several steps ahead now, walking fast, like her body was trying to outrun her mind.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever Wanda had meant by ‘<em> last conversation’, </em> Agatha had no idea. It didn’t make sense. Rio and Wanda had barely ever spoke. That much Agatha knew. If anything ever happened between them, it happened when Agatha wasn’t looking because she hadn’t thought she needed to look.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know what was true. She didn’t know what Rio had kept from her.</p><p> </p><p>And now wasn’t the time to find out.</p><p> </p><p><em> Priorities </em>, Agatha reminded herself. First: out. Then: Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Because right now, Rio was still walking ahead of her because she needed to be somewhere else before she could breathe properly.  She needed distance. From the building. From the shouting. From whatever scar had torn open inside her and started to bleed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha would wait. She would walk behind her, through this ugly stretch of silence, until the shaking in Rio’s hands stopped.</p><p> </p><p>Rio barreled through the double doors, her stride relentless, but even then, she paused just long enough to hold the door open for Agatha. A gentleman, to the last. Not that Rio waited for thanks. The moment Agatha stepped through, Rio turned away and cut across the parking lot with purposeful steps that didn’t once falter or look back. </p><p> </p><p>They reached the car. Agatha slowed, arms folding loosely over her chest as she watched Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Rio flung the driver’s side door open and ducked inside.  Her hand reappeared with a battered pack of cigarettes, one of which she shoved between her teeth before slamming the door shut behind her. She leaned back against the car like it was the only thing keeping her upright and brought the purple zippo to her mouth, fingers trembling so violently the flame refused to catch. Once. Twice. Three times. Still nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio snapped. Her voice had gone hoarse somewhere in all of this.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha approached slowly. She set her purse beside Rio’s feet and moved in front of her. The streetlight caught the edges of Rio’s face, but she  refused to look at Agatha. She kept trying to light the cigarette with growing frustration, her jaw tight, her focus narrowed to the task.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>No response. Just the click of metal and a flicker that never turned into flame.</p><p> </p><p>She reached out and gently took the lighter from Rio’s hand, expecting a protest, a scoff, a flinch- anything. But Rio let her. Her fingers uncurled so easily it made Agatha ache. She flicked the lighter once. The flame caught instantly. Rio leaned forward, inhaled, and let the smoke fill her lungs. Again. And again. She pulled the cigarette away, dropped her head back against the car, and exhaled into the sky with her neck exposed and her jaw clenched.</p><p> </p><p>The skin of Rio’s neck caught the light- some of the concealer Agatha had aggressively applied earlier had worn thin. Not all of it, but just enough for Agatha to see what was underneath.</p><p> </p><p>And oh, how Agatha wanted to reach out and wipe the rest away. Strip it down to truth. To Rio’s truth. To hers. And God, part of Agatha wanted to rewind time to this morning. To yesterday. To every moment before their bubble popped. But it wouldn’t help. Wanting never did.</p><p> </p><p>So, Agatha did the next best thing and stepped forward until their bodies touched. Until she could feel Rio flinch in surprise. Her head snapped down and suddenly brown eyes locked onto Agatha’s- endless, pleading without asking for anything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her own body soften, tension draining from her frame because, somehow, Rio’s pain had always made more sense than her own. </p><p> </p><p>She reached up and took the baseball cap off Rio’s head, let it fall with the lighter on top of her purse. Then both hands lifted to cup Rio’s face. Softly. Carefully. Tender in a way that made herself want to cry. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s free hand flew up to clutch Agatha’s wrist, as if she were afraid this was a dream she’d wake from too soon.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tucked strands of Rio’s hair behind her ears. Her fingers found their way into the roots, lifting to the back of her head, guiding her in. She pulled Rio into a hug. One arm curled around her shoulders, the other cradling the back of her head. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t fight it. She gave in completely- slackening against Agatha’s chest and letting her breath shudder out against her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the press of Rio’s mouth against her shoulder first- soft, seeking, not quite steady. One arm wrapped firmly around Agatha’s waist while the other remained limp at her side. </p><p> </p><p>Then came the faint sound of a dull hiss of ember meeting pavement. The cigarette. Rio let it go. </p><p> </p><p>A moment later, both arms were circled around Agatha’s back, drawing her closer with desperation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha melted into Rio. Pressed every part of herself forward until there was no space left between them. Her face leaned into the side of Rio’s head, and for a moment they stood like that, almost swaying.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Agatha finally pulled back, it wasn’t much, barely an inch, just enough to see Rio’s mouth, her eyelashes, the tiny tremble in her lip. Her hand found the side of Rio’s face, her thumb grazing her cheek. Agatha dipped her head, slow and cautious, letting the tip of her nose brush against Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. Fast. Breath catching in her throat like it hurt.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>She pressed her mouth into Rio’s with no force, no urgency. It didn’t come with heat or hunger, only stillness. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t want anything from her. She didn’t need anything. She only wanted to erase whatever her ex-wife had ripped open and remind Rio, gently, that Agatha was here.  </p><p> </p><p>She pulled back slightly, just enough to breathe, and then kissed Rio again- softer this time. Then her mouth found the corner of Rio’s lips. Then her cheek. Then the place just beneath her ear, where her jawline gave way to her throat. Each kiss pressed with a purpose.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha’s lips found Rio’s again, she stayed for a moment. Then pulled back just far enough to whisper, “I’m sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Another kiss.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m so sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Another.</p><p> </p><p>Each apology landed between them as if Agatha’s mouth knew how to beg better than her voice ever could.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t speak. She leaned in every time, chasing Agatha, her hands clenched behind Agatha’s back, holding tight, nodding faintly between kisses. Her breath hitched every time Agatha pulled away. Her grip never loosened.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha kept going. She only wanted Rio to stay here- to let go, even if only for a moment. </p><p> </p><p>To let herself be cared for. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha would stay. As long as it took. As long as Rio needed. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha would stay. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The drive back to Rio’s apartment was quiet, but not awkward. Rio drove one hand on the wheel, her other hand curled around Agatha’s in her lap, thumb brushing the inside of her palm now and then, like she needed to make sure she was still there. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had offered to drive but Rio gave her a look so wild and immediate that it bordered on offended. A silent <em> absolutely not </em> paired with an unspoken <em> I’m not letting you kill us before we get home </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Which, fair. Agatha wasn’t exactly known for her driving. It was probably their second longest running joke, right after whatever punchline they’d always been.</p><p> </p><p>By the time they got inside, neither of them had said much beyond the necessary. Rio showered first. Agatha followed after, rinsing off everything except the weight that had settled across her chest the second she saw Rio’s body still in that god forsaken bowling alley. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had on a t-shirt, underwear, and socks. Always with the socks. She’d been weird about that for as long as Agatha had known her. Something about not being able to stand the feel of crumbs or dirt on her feet, the horror of some invisible particle touching skin. If she was home, she’d change into a clean pair right before getting into bed, even if the ones she had on were practically new. It wasn’t optional. She never slept without them. Agatha never understood it. Still didn’t. But she’d watched it for so many years, the ritual stopped needing a reason. It was just Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chose to wear one of Rio’s sweatshirts- oversized, soft, lived in, absolutely would be coming home with her- and nothing else but underwear.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha wandered out into the living room, Rio was already sunk into the couch, phone to her ear, murmuring some half distracted responses. “Mm. Uh-uh.” Her eyes flicked up, and without missing a beat, she reached out an arm toward Agatha like she was just getting home- expected, familiar, wanted. Not even a question.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a breath through her nose and moved toward her without a second of hesitation. She sank into the space Rio had made, leaned into the warmth waiting there. </p><p> </p><p>Rio, still on the phone, murmured a quick, “Love you, Petal. Thanks again,” before hanging up and tossing the phone onto the coffee table like it had never existed.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t say it was Sage. Didn’t have to. Agatha already knew.</p><p> </p><p>Rio curled into her, one arm slung across Agatha’s stomach, remote in hand, flipping through channels. Agatha mumbled something half hearted about <em> Housewives </em>, and Rio, without protest, put it on.</p><p> </p><p>They got maybe fifteen minutes into the episode before Agatha started chewing at her thumbnail. </p><p> </p><p>Not subtle. Not pretty. It was a nervous habit she never quite managed to break. Her eyes stayed on the screen, but her mind had already left the room.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t want to ask. That was the truth of it. She didn’t want to know what Wanda had said to Rio. Not because she was afraid of the answer, but because she already had too many. Too many versions of their story, too many angles on the same wound. The past didn’t need clarifying- it had been clear enough when it hurt. She didn’t want the knife turned again under the excuse of context.</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, Agatha was good at holding her tongue. Especially about things that mattered. Especially when silence kept her from doing damage. </p><p> </p><p>When it came to pain, Agatha tended to be precise. Efficient. Her cruelty was rarely accidental. She knew exactly how to find the soft spot and press- except with Rio. That was the one place she never quite managed to fully weaponize. And somehow, Wanda had pulled it off in a single conversation. A few words. A single glance. Whatever prior conversation she had referred to, it landed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the question rising again. It had been sitting at the base of her throat since the parking lot. Waiting for any moment to sneak out. But she didn’t give it the room. She swallowed it back down. She didn’t want to drag it between them. Not now.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to drag Wanda into this room. Not into Rio’s apartment, not onto this couch, not into the strange, careful space the two of them had managed to build without even directly saying they were trying.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t until she felt Rio’s fingers gently wrap around her wrist that Agatha had realized she was still biting her nail. Rio gently guided her hand down and didn’t let go. Just held it, thumb tracing over the back of Agatha’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Then, without even looking away from the TV, she lifted Agatha’s hand and kissed it. Soft. Barely there. Like breathing.</p><p> </p><p>And that was it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest eased without her permission. Her jaw unclenched. Her shoulders finally dropped. It didn’t fix anything, didn’t undo the knot in her stomach, but it quieted her mind. </p><p> </p><p>She let Rio keep holding her hand. Let herself settle. Let the question drift back down to where it came from.</p><p> </p><p>It could wait.</p><p> </p><p>This couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>“What if we called out of work this weekend,” Rio murmured. Her cheek was mashed flat against Agatha’s shoulder, as she traced lazy shapes into the back of Agatha's hand.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t call out.” Agatha said, while her other hand moved automatically, smoothing down Rio’s back, fingertips tracing the hem of her t-shirt, eyes fixed on the TV.</p><p> </p><p>“I could,” Rio said, slower now. “For a good enough reason.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a small, skeptical laugh. “That so?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t laugh with her. She just nodded into her neck. “Yeah. I don’t know. I thought maybe we could get out of town for a bit… just us.”</p><p> </p><p>At first, Agatha hadn’t been sure Rio was serious, but there was something careful in the way Rio said it, like she didn’t want to ask for too much. And that, more than anything, made Agatha answer.</p><p> </p><p>“What did you have in mind?”</p><p> </p><p>“Swartswood Lake.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha breathed out slowly through her nose. </p><p> </p><p>That made sense. Remote. Quiet. Not too far, but far enough. It wasn’t about the lake. Or the weekend. Or the idea of calling out of work. It was about space. Distance. A place Wanda wouldn’t be. A place where Rio could breathe without checking over her shoulder, and where Agatha wouldn’t have to pretend she was unaffected.</p><p> </p><p>“Swartswood,” Agatha repeated.</p><p> </p><p>“Never mind,” Rio mumbled. “Dumb idea.” She pressed in closer, burying her face into Agatha’s shoulder like she wanted to disappear there, to make a home out of her and stay hidden.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t say that,” Agatha replied softly. She slid her hand under the hem of Rio’s shirt, her fingers skimming warm skin before her nails lightly dragged downward.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.” The breath left Rio in a soft puff, barely audible, but Agatha felt it against her collarbone.</p><p> </p><p>Genuinely, Agatha didn’t mind the idea. A getaway. Just them. Somewhere far enough that the world couldn’t follow. Somewhere Wanda wouldn’t show up. No group hangouts. No coworkers. No expectations.</p><p> </p><p>It sounded... simple. And simplicity had started to feel like luxury.</p><p> </p><p>But it also felt like a threat to everything Agatha had so carefully built. Time alone meant space to speak. And space invited honesty. It dismantled excuses. She knew how it would go: long silences, then the questions- first quiet, then louder. And beneath it all, the risk that one of them might actually answer honestly.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not participating in any outdoor activities,” Agatha said finally, voice dry. “No fishing. No glizzy roasting. If you even think about handing me a metal skewer and tell me it builds character, I’ll drown myself in the lake.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s laugh was sudden, surprised- beautiful. Agatha startled slightly at the sound, bit her lip to kill the smile that tried to follow.</p><p> </p><p>“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Rio said, her voice already softer from laughing.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t do tents or any other camping bullshit,” Agatha added flatly, her fingers dragging a little rougher at the base of Rio’s spine as penance for even putting the image in her head.</p><p> </p><p>“No tents,” Rio promised. Agatha could hear the grin in her voice. “There’s a lakehouse. Sybil’s place. She bought it a few years ago, rents it out sometimes. It’s beautiful. On the lake. You’d like it.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Sybil.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s younger sister. Agatha remembered her vividly- silver hair down to her waist, always barefoot, always rich, with no discernible source of income. Looked like she wandered out of a 1970s music video.</p><p> </p><p>She was hot. Undeniably so. And Agatha, being twenty-four and chronically annoying, may have announced that within five minutes of meeting her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had lost her mind. Not in any useful, productive way- just sulking and theatrics. Spent the entire weekend accusing Agatha of betrayal and dramatically refusing to pass her things. At one point she even called her a homewrecker, which didn’t even make sense.</p><p> </p><p>Anyway, Agatha never took it back. And she didn’t regret it. Sybil had that whole barefoot-witchy-goddess thing going on and… it was a confusing time for everyone involved.</p><p> </p><p>“And what makes you so sure I’d like it?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>A pause.</p><p> </p><p>“Because the second I saw it, I thought of you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand stilled for a beat against Rio’s back. She closed her eyes for a second.</p><p> </p><p>She could pretend it didn’t affect her. She’d always been good at that- at arching an eyebrow and swallowing every ache behind the guise of a joke. But there was something deeply unfair about being remembered like that. About being imagined into spaces she’d never seen or been to before. About being the first person Rio thought of when she found somewhere beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>But there was something cruel about it, too. God, she ached for the version of herself who might’ve seen it too. The one who might’ve gone with Rio the first time. If either of them had known how to be brave.</p><p> </p><p>“Is Sybil still hot, by the way?” Agatha murmured eventually, keeping it light. Barely. “I assume she’s only gotten sexier with age.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned, muffling it against her shoulder. “I will suffocate myself in your tits. I’m so serious.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked, amused. “What do you want me to say? She smelled like jasmine and was a real sight for sore eyes. If I remember correctly, you were very dramatic about the whole thing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Dramatic?” Rio asked, clearly offended. “You were in love with my aunt.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, now that…” Agatha waved a hand. “That is not true. You were just jealous.”</p><p> </p><p>That made Rio lift her head and look at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course I was,” Rio said, like it was obvious. Like it wouldn’t have taken a full federal investigation to get her to admit that fifteen years ago.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha studied her for a beat.</p><p> </p><p>“So just to clarify… we’re staying at your hot aunt’s sexy magical lakehouse, and I’m not allowed to acknowledge that she’s hot?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, and for the first time since the Wanda disaster, Agatha saw the gap in her teeth again and her heart kicked hard at the sight.</p><p> </p><p>“Correct,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a slow nod, eyes stuck on her mouth. “Right.” She swallowed, looked back up. “And have you taken other women to this sexy magical lakehouse?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised her brows, practically glowing at the opportunity. “Ohhh, now look who’s jeal-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pinched Rio’s calf with her toes. Hard.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Fuck- what was that?” Rio yelped but didn’t pull away, laughter in her voice now. “Did you just- did you pinch me with your feet?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm,” Agatha shrugged. “Maybe.”</p><p> </p><p>She reached behind Rio’s head and tugged her back down. Rio landed with a soft grunt, cheek back against her shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>“To answer your question,” Rio said, voice calm now, “no. I haven’t taken anyone else there.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a breath. “Lucky me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted again, settling in like she was always meant to be there. Her voice came quieter this time, “I’d like to take you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head slightly, just enough that her words would land where Rio could feel them.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d like that.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was back at home and packing clothes into her duffle. She’d just gotten off the phone with the day shift charge nurse, who now believed, with zero suspicion, that Agatha was far too sick to work the entire weekend. It had been an Oscar worthy performance, complete with fake coughing and a mumbled<em> ‘probably something viral.’ </em> She hadn’t even needed to sell it that hard. Everyone knew the hospital was a germ factory. </p><p> </p><p>She had left Rio’s early this morning. Not because she wanted to. Rio had woken her up with espresso in a mug and kissed the corner of her mouth before pulling back like it hadn’t happened. That had been it. No follow up. Nothing else, which shouldn’t have bothered Agatha as much as it did. But it had. She didn’t bring it up. Just drank the coffee, told Rio she’d see her later, and tried not to make it weird.</p><p> </p><p>Still, they ended on a good note.</p><p> </p><p>Pulling into her driveway and seeing no sign of Wanda only made it better. No car, no notes, no weird passive aggressive clues that she'd been by. Nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Now her bag was packed, zipped, and sitting by the door. No trace of her ex-wife. No shift waiting to be clocked into. Just a weekend ahead, and Rio, and maybe the smallest chance to pretend things could be simple.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had about an hour to kill before Rio was supposed to pick her up. Enough time to deal with the few dishes still sitting in the sink and grab the mail she hadn’t checked in… honestly, who knew how long. Once that was done, she could rot peacefully on the couch until Rio got here.</p><p> </p><p>The dishes were easy enough, except she somehow managed to soak herself halfway through. Her shirt clung to her stomach by the time she finished rinsing the last plate. She peeled it off, muttering under her breath, and changed into something dry before heading to the door to finally grab the mail.</p><p> </p><p>She swung it open and immediately wished she hadn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Of course.</p><p> </p><p>Of fucking course.</p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha hadn’t expected it. Because she was in a good mood. Because the universe had the worst sense of fucking humor.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda said, breath catching like she’d been holding it. Her smile was small and nervous, and she sounded too relieved for someone who shouldn’t have been here in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Then she blinked again. Then she said, flatly, “Nope.”</p><p> </p><p>She started to close the door, but Wanda was faster. One hand pressed to the edge of the door, the other braced against the frame like that would somehow earn her the right to stay.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait- Agatha, please,” Wanda said quickly. “Just give me a second.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said, pushing back with more force. “Let go of my door frame.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know how else to reach you,” Wanda said. “You blocked me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right,” Agatha said. “I blocked you. And instead of taking that as a hint, you flew across the country to corner me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not here to corner you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Look at my front door! This is the definition of cornering!”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s expression shifted, only slightly but Agatha didn’t miss it. That flicker of indignation masked as calm.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I come in?” Wanda asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barked a laugh that didn’t sound amused. “Absolutely not.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Wanda said, voice dipping. “I know you don’t owe me anything, but I just want-”</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha said, firmer now, “move your hand.”</p><p> </p><p>“I just need five minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re about to need a hand surgeon if you don’t move it.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>“I was your wife, Agatha. You owe me a conversation.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t owe you shit according to the miserable state of Illinois.” Agatha snapped. “And if you’re smart, you’ll buy the fastest plane ticket back there before I break your hand in this door.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw the fury gather behind Wanda’s eyes and bit down on a grin. It was still satisfying. Still fucking thrilling. No matter how far they’d fallen, no matter how clear the line was now, Agatha never got tired of watching Wanda lose it. </p><p> </p><p>“You told me nothing happened between you two,” Wanda snapped, voice pitched and rising. “I let you convince me I was paranoid. Do you know how fucked up that is?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. “I didn’t lie to you. You were paranoid. That’s your default setting.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re unbelievable.”</p><p> </p><p>“Correct.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s nostrils flared. “You let that girl spill beer all over me-”</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could register what was happening, Wanda shoved past her, shoulder first, and crossed the threshold into her house.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t hit Agatha right away. The violation of it. The complete fucking audacity. She blinked, stunned for half a second, then turned fast, slamming the door behind her.</p><p> </p><p> “Are you out of your fucking mind?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda whirled around, voice already climbing, eyes wild. “And then you left with Rio Vidal. Jen’s got pictures of you all over Facebook like you’re some happy little couple. What the fuck am I supposed to think?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped closer, jaw tight. “You’re not supposed to think anything because, again, I don’t owe you shit. We’re divorced!”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda laughed, bitter and ugly. “You’re not even denying it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have to. It’s none of your business.”</p><p> </p><p>“I asked you,” Wanda hissed. “Over and over. You told me there was nothing between you and-”</p><p> </p><p>“And there wasn’t,” Agatha snapped, cutting Wanda off. “There was nothing because I chose you. Every time, I chose you. Even when I didn’t want to. I never fucking wanted to.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re lying.”</p><p> </p><p>“Am I?”</p><p> </p><p>“Then why the hell did you even marry me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because she didn’t stop me!” Agatha shouted.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe she should’ve,” Wanda spat. “Would’ve saved me years of coming in second to someone who didn’t even want you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled then- slow, ugly, and dangerous. “You must’ve been <em> so </em> lonely,” she crooned, head tilted, mouth curled. She stepped closer, closing the space between them. “All that time, playing house. Lying next to me. Watching me shut my eyes and pretend. Knowing who I was thinking about. Knowing who I really wanted.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop it, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“I thought about her every single day I was with you. While I kissed you. While I fucked y-”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re fucking evil,” Wanda spat.</p><p> </p><p>They were close now, too close. Agatha could feel the heat of Wanda’s breath against her chin.</p><p> </p><p>“So. Are. You.” Agatha didn’t raise her voice- just let the words rot in her mouth as she gave them to Wanda, slow and vicious.</p><p> </p><p>Then Wanda leaned in and kissed Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Their mouths met and Agatha didn’t stop it right away.</p><p> </p><p>She kissed Wanda back. Only for a second. Only because some ugly part of her wanted to ruin it. Wanted to prove she was still that person- the one who pushed good things away and reached for whatever would hurt most. But even in the thick of it, her body knew better. Nothing fit. Not the mouth, not the memory. Her hands stayed still at her side. Her heart didn’t move at all. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha broke the kiss and shoved Wanda away hard enough to make her stumble back.</p><p> </p><p>“Get out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for a response. She turned her back, walked to the front door, and opened it. She stepped aside, one hand braced on the edge of the door. Then she tipped her chin toward the porch.  “I don’t want you here.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda stood frozen, blinking. “Agatha, wait- I didn’t mean to- ”</p><p> </p><p>“You did.”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda didn’t argue. She didn’t try again. She looked at Agatha once, brief and unsure, then walked out the door. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slammed it behind her.</p><p> </p><p>And no amount of shame on Agatha's lips could make her forget the ones she'd meant to taste.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha paced the kitchen, barefoot, arms folded tight against her chest. The house was quiet except for the sound of her own steps- short, uneven, reversing back on themselves every few seconds.</p><p> </p><p>She was trying to figure out how to explain kissing her ex-wife without sounding delusional.</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t a defense. She knew how it would sound. She’d rehearsed it three times already and still couldn’t get past the part where she admitted it had happened at all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t hear the knock. She barely registered the sound of the door opening.</p><p> </p><p>She froze at the sound of Rio’s voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?” came the call from the foyer, casual but edging toward concern. Footsteps followed and then: “Why did I just see Wanda pulling out of-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned the corner into the kitchen and stopped cold.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>For the second time in twenty-four hours, she had to scrape her heart off the floor from where it had violently dropped out of her goddamn asshole. </p><p> </p><p>Everything Agatha could say sounded worse in her head. Excuses stacked on top of explanations she didn’t believe in. She hadn’t kissed Wanda because she wanted to. She hadn’t wanted to at all. She just… did. Out of instinct. Out of panic. Maybe out of some dying, desperate part of her that thought it would feel like something that wasn’t constantly screaming for Rio.</p><p> </p><p>But boy, did Agatha learn her fucking lesson.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze fell immediately to her mouth. Her jaw shifted, tongue pressing into her cheek. Then she gave a few small nods like she had just added something up and didn’t love the answer.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Now why the hell was Rio doing that? How did she even know?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t said a word. Hadn’t explained. Hadn’t confessed. Jesus- was she leaking guilt out of her pores? She felt herself start to sweat. She still smelled faintly like someone else’s perfume, and the realization made her sick.</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked to the sink without a word.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer. The water ran steady, too loud in the silence. She stood with her back turned, hands braced on the edge of the counter, posture rigid. Her knuckles tightened until they went pale, a subtle shift that gave away more than anything she might have said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t look away. She wasn’t sure what Rio had reached for, wasn’t paying attention to the movement. Her focus had narrowed to the slope of Rio’s shoulders, the way her body held tension like a loaded spring. There was no outburst. No slammed drawers or raised voice.</p><p> </p><p>And then, because Agatha’s body had no sense of occasion, her stomach swooped- and turned over in a way that was absolutely not helpful. Definitely not the time to feel anything that even slightly resembled arousal. </p><p> </p><p>The worst possible moment, the most inexcusable timing and still, Agatha’s body reacted.</p><p> </p><p>The water stopped.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned, slow and deliberate, her expression unreadable. There was no heat in her eyes, no demand for an explanation, no trace of anger Agatha could cling to and argue against. The stillness Rio carried did all the work. Every part of Agatha felt seen, cornered, and aching to be touched.</p><p> </p><p>She crossed the kitchen and placed a hand flat against Agatha’s chest. The contact wasn’t rough or confrontational. There was no pressure behind it. Only a direction, guiding Agatha backward until her hips bumped against the edge of the counter.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. </p><p> </p><p>Then Rio lifted her other hand. A paper towel, damp and trembling between her fingers. She wiped Agatha’s mouth, slowly. Like removing a stain. Like she couldn’t stand the sight of it.</p><p> </p><p>When she was done, she pressed the crumpled paper towel into Agatha’s palm and whispered it- low and lethal:</p><p> </p><p>“Her lipstick is still on your fucking mouth.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The paper towel in her hand felt damp and useless, and her fingers stayed curled around it and she had no idea why she was still holding it. Her fingers just wouldn’t let go. Her mouth opened. Closed. Her voice barely came out. “It didn’t mean-”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snapped her mouth shut. She bit down hard, lips pressed tight, because anything she said now would make it worse. Would sound defensive. Would sound pathetic.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned and walked away without another word. She leaned back against the far counter, arms folded, her body loose in a way that looked practiced. Her eyes were glassy, but not in a falling apart kind of way. Just enough to make Agatha feel like shit.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me ask you something,” Rio said, voice even. “If I went out and kissed someone I used to fuck, would you be okay with that?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. “No.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded slowly. “Didn’t think so.” Her gaze dropped- slow, dragging over Agatha like she was memorizing her just to make herself sick with it. “Don’t fucking do that again.” Rio said it so softly it was barely a warning. There was no bite in it. No fight. A tear escaped down Rio’s cheek. She wiped it away fast, almost impatiently. Like it embarrassed her more than anything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest caved in on itself. The paper towel slipped from her hand and hit the floor without a sound.</p><p> </p><p>She crossed the kitchen in a heartbeat, closing the distance. Her hands found Rio’s face, fingers trembling as she cupped her cheeks, pulled her in, pressed their bodies together. The second her fingers touched skin, Rio’s hands flew up- gripping her wrists, holding Agatha there.</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t,” Agatha whispered, leaning in until their foreheads touched. “I swear I won’t. I promise.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice shook. Her chest was too tight. She could hear how desperate she sounded, how stupid and frantic- and she didn’t give a single shit. Not right now. </p><p> </p><p>“Please don’t be upset with me. I hate this,” Agatha’s words tumbled out too fast, all at once. “I hate when you look at me like this. I’m sorry. I’m so fucking sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She just stood there, gripping Agatha’s wrists like she needed the contact more than she wanted to admit, brown eyes locked on hers and full of that same awful sadness Agatha had never known how to deal with.</p><p> </p><p>It was the worst thing about Rio. Always had been. The way her sadness lived in her eyes -wide, glassy, too still- like she didn’t understand why it hurt so much, only that it did.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha hated it. Hated how that look always made her feel so unbearably sick she could barely breathe. It didn’t matter what started it, didn’t matter who was to blame. That look on Rio’s face always gutted her.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t mean to hurt you,” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out the softest breath.</p><p> </p><p>“I know.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled Agatha into a hug. Her arms wrapped around her with that strange mix of care and exhaustion that only Rio seemed capable of. Agatha went without resistance, sinking into it, chest pressed to chest.</p><p> </p><p>She felt Rio’s breath against her ear before she heard the words.</p><p> </p><p>“I need a cigarette.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed, the sound muffled against her. “Me too.”</p><p> </p><p>They stood like that a moment longer. Then Rio shifted slightly, her voice quieter, barely above a breath now, “Do you still want to go to Swartswood with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to look at her, brow furrowed. “Do <em> you </em> still want to go with <em> me </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. “Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I still want to go with you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good.”</p><p> </p><p>They stared at each other for a beat too long.</p><p> </p><p>“If you try to kiss <em> me </em> with ex-wife breath, I swear to god- ”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shoved her lightly. “Don’t make me regret saying yes.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The drive to Swartswood is quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Not uncomfortable, just... muted. Like they’re both trying not to breathe too loud.</p><p> </p><p>They don’t talk much. Rio keeps the radio low, some soft, moody playlist. Every so often she hums, off tune and under her breath. Agatha catches herself listening for it.</p><p> </p><p>About forty minutes in, Rio pulls off the highway and stops at a gas station without saying a word. Agatha doesn’t ask. She knows Rio wants to smoke by the way she taps the steering wheel sometimes, like she’s counting the minutes until she can.</p><p> </p><p>Rio disappears inside. Comes back with a new pack of American Spirits, two waters, and a bag of violently sour candy that Agatha’s pretty sure is designed to hurt people. She doesn’t argue. She eats three and immediately regrets it.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the drive is soft around the edges. They don’t talk about Wanda. They don’t talk about what happened. But something eases. Slightly. Enough.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had expected the lake house to be beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>The house stood tucked into the hill, anchored in the slope just above the lake, with a wide wraparound porch and wood siding turned soft gray with age. No clutter. No mess. Just thoughtful touches- glass wind chimes turning slowly, sun catchers hanging in the windows, a driftwood mobile suspended beneath the eaves.</p><p> </p><p>The back lawn rolled down toward the water, soft and freshly cut, with wide stone steps leading to a dock that extended clean and straight into the lake. There were two chairs at the end of it, angled just slightly, waiting for people who hadn’t arrived yet.</p><p> </p><p>Closer to the shoreline, black willow branches leaned low over the bank, their leaves whispering against the surface. A single sycamore stood to the right of the dock, its pale bark flaking in broad patches, casting shifting light through its canopy.</p><p> </p><p>A fire pit was set into the ground with smooth stones and mismatched chairs arranged in a circle- old Adirondacks, some painted in sun faded colors, one with a tye-dye throw draped over it. There was a small iron rack stacked neatly with firewood.</p><p> </p><p>It was beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood still for a long moment, feeling the wind move across her shoulders, lake lapping steady against the dock, and thought about Rio’s words from the night before.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Because the second I saw it, I thought of you.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The inside of the house smelled like incense and citrus peel. Not a scent pumped out of a diffuser- real smoke, steeped into the wood grain over time. It felt warm.</p><p> </p><p>The floors were wide-planked and bare except for a few worn rugs, deep reds and washed out ochres, the kind that held onto heat and stories. Plants hung from macramé slings in the windows, leaves brushing glass. The light filtering in was soft and low, catching on floating dust.</p><p> </p><p>There was wood everywhere. Old wood. Tables, chairs, shelves -none of it matching, all of it solid. On one wall, a turntable sat beneath a mounted shelf of records. The speakers were tall and heavy and clearly mattered. There was a stack of books on the floor -alchemy, plant medicine, astrology- next to a sculpted brass ashtray and a bundle of half burned sage.</p><p> </p><p>A drift of dried flowers hung from a beam near the kitchen, tied with twine. The kitchen itself was open and spare.</p><p> </p><p>There were crystals on the windowsill. A hand carved tarot box on a side table. A glass bowl of matchbooks from places that might not exist anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“You like it?” Rio’s voice came from behind Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“I love it.” Agatha turned her head. Rio had kicked her shoes off by the door and was setting her duffle down gently. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the weight fall off her shoulder and set her own bag down next to Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Allegedly, like, a trillion years ago she and Lilia went on some witch cult retreat and tripped absolute balls on shrooms. Lilia swears the lake spoke to her and told her to tell Sybil to buy property here. And obviously Sybil took that completely seriously.”</p><p> </p><p> “That tracks.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right?” Rio moved past her toward the kitchen, moving like she belonged there. “She considered Atlantic City, but said it was too noisy- spiritually and otherwise.”</p><p> </p><p>“God forbid.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned. “She’s in Portugal right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course she is,” Agatha said, exhaling. “Parading barefoot through a vineyard, yelling about sacred geometry to a man who doesn’t care.”</p><p> </p><p>“Probably seducing him too.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “Disgusting.”</p><p> </p><p>She glanced down at their bags, then at the hallway that led to the bedrooms. Before this morning, she’d figured they’d be sharing a room. That had been the assumption. Now she wasn’t sure. She didn’t want to ask, didn’t want to assume anything. Especially not now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned against the counter, watching her. “Wanna sit on the dock for a little?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, her voice quieter than before. “Yeah. Sure.”</p><p> </p><p>She followed Rio toward the door, unsure whether the ache in her ribs was something she’d carried in, or something the house had reached in and touched.</p><p> </p><p>As they stepped out onto the porch and started down the stairs, Agatha spotted a blue heeler tearing up the long gravel driveway at full speed- barking, ears back, paws kicking up dust. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha halted, one foot hovering above the next step, already calculating if she had enough time to turn and sprint back inside before she could get mauled by a fucking farm dog. </p><p> </p><p>“Jasper!” Rio called, bright and unbothered, picking up speed as she took the steps two at a time, speeding up to meet the dog at the bottom.</p><p> </p><p>Right. So the dog was friendly. Probably.</p><p> </p><p>A faded baby blue truck followed up the drive behind him -old and sun worn, rattled more than it drove- but Agatha barely glanced at it.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes were on Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Always on Rio.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio hit the gravel, she dropped to her knees, and the dog crashed into her- barking, spinning, licking her face with all the energy in the world. She laughed. Giggled, even. Stupid and bright and real.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared, helpless. She wanted to kiss her. Right there. Dog breath and all. It didn’t matter. Nothing mattered except the sound of her laugh and the curve of her smile.</p><p> </p><p>She’d fucked everything up. So bad. And now she just stood there, hands useless at her sides, watching Rio- because what else could she do?</p><p> </p><p>Her throat tightened. She wanted to cry. She wanted to throw up. She hoped Wanda’s plane got stuck on the runway forever with no air conditioning and a child behind her screaming and kicking the seat.</p><p> </p><p>“Vidal!”</p><p> </p><p>The voice was unfamiliar. Agatha blinked, tore her eyes away from Rio, and finally noticed the woman climbing out of the truck and walking straight toward her.</p><p> </p><p>“Charlie!” Rio shouted, too excited for Agatha’s liking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her jog across the gravel, meeting the woman halfway, arms already out. Then they were hugging.</p><p> </p><p>Not a polite hug.</p><p> </p><p>A real one.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, the back of her neck going hot. Rio hadn’t looked that relaxed all morning.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What kind of fuckery is this? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The woman had curly red hair under a crooked baseball cap. Messy, effortless, unfairly good. Better than her ex-wife’s, not that it mattered. </p><p> </p><p>She was wearing pinstriped pants and a cut up band tee, one side tucked in like she hadn’t meant to but left it anyway. Rings on nearly every finger. A bunch of layered necklaces that didn’t match, but somehow made sense. The hat looked stolen from a gas station. </p><p> </p><p>The whole look screamed I don’t try that hard and I still look better than you.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved before she could think too hard about it. Bolted down the steps, cut across the gravel.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello!” Agatha said, loud and pointless, stepping right into the middle of whatever the fuck was happening. Both women turned to look at her.</p><p> </p><p><em> Good</em>.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Let them look. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Who’s this?” Charlie asked. Her voice was raspy and confident and instantly fucking irritating. Or maybe just irritating to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Who are you?” Agatha shot back, not bothering to soften it.</p><p> </p><p>Charlie blinked, then gave an easy smile. She glanced at Rio and muttered, “Sheesh,” under her breath, clearly entertained.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, tone light. “Agatha, this is Charlie. She lives down the road, keeps an eye on the place when Sybil’s off doing Sybil things.”</p><p> </p><p>Charlie gave a small nod. “I’m the unofficial groundskeeper and the highly recommended weed dealer. Sybil and Rio keep me in business.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed out a laugh. Agatha clenched her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed on, eyes flicking between them. “Charlie, this is Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused for just a second too long. Looked right at Agatha before turning back to Charlie.</p><p> </p><p>“My very best <em> friend</em>, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Okay. Maybe Agatha deserved that. Fine. She gets it.</p><p> </p><p>Because It hurts. It fucking hurts to be called that when it’s so clearly not the whole truth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s an asshole. The biggest fucking asshole. And she regrets every single time she ever threw that term at Rio like it didn’t matter. Like it wasn’t loaded.</p><p> </p><p>Charlie laughed. “Ahh, okay, that tracks. When Sybil said Rio was coming up here and bringing someone, I thought I was hallucinating. Rio Vidal? Settling down? Dating someone? Yeah, right.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave her the tightest fucking smile she could manage. She was about five seconds from tearing this woman’s throat out with her teeth. </p><p> </p><p>Charlie and Rio kept talking. Laughing. Something about garden pests or deer or fuck knows. Agatha couldn’t hear a thing over the ringing in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Then Charlie shoved at Rio’s arm -playfully, familiarly- and Rio laughed, full body, head tipped back, the gap between her teeth showing. Charlie’s hand landed on Rio’s shoulder and stayed there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw white.</p><p> </p><p>“We fuck!” Agatha blurted.</p><p> </p><p>Loud. Too loud. It came out before she could stop it, and the second it left her mouth, a whole flock of birds exploded out of the trees. </p><p> </p><p>Both women snapped their heads to look at Agatha, eyes wide, like she had fired off a gun into the air. The silence that followed stretched long enough to make her want to crawl into the ground and die.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Perfect.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, tried to act like that hadn’t just exploded out of her. “Me and Rio,” she said, a little stiffly. “We… yeah.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked stunned. Charlie looked entertained, still grinning, her hand very much still on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah. Got it,” Charlie said, drawing out the words. “So, like… friends with benefits?”</p><p> </p><p>“We’re not friends,” Agatha snapped, before she could stop herself. “We’re-“ She glanced at Rio, who was just staring at her now, eyebrows up like she couldn’t wait to hear how this ended. “It’s complicated,” Agatha muttered, finally, wiping her nose with the back of her hand. “So that means…” She gestured vaguely to Charlie’s hand. “Paws off.”</p><p> </p><p>Charlie smirked, stepping back with both hands lifted. “Alright. Message received.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was staring down at the ground now, mouth pulled tight like she was trying not to laugh, and Agatha could feel her ears burning.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I just came to say hi. Rio, good seeing you. Agatha, pleasure. And good luck with…” Charlie gestured between them, “…whatever this is.”</p><p> </p><p>“Eat my ass,” Agatha said, deadpan.</p><p> </p><p>Charlie barked a laugh and patted Rio lightly on the arm as she turned. “I like her, Vidal. Feisty. Try not to screw it up.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, believe me,” Rio said, under her breath, “I’m not the one screwing it up.”</p><p> </p><p>Charlie just gave a wave and called out, “Jasper!” The blue heeler tore across the gravel from wherever he’d disappeared, already barking and lined up to leap into the truck before the door even opened.</p><p> </p><p>As Charlie drove off, gravel kicking up behind her ugly truck, Agatha turned to Rio and snapped, “I’m sorry, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Then, softer. “I’m really sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>And it wasn’t just about Wanda. It was about everything. About the way she’d said the wrong thing too many times, the way she’d acted like it didn’t matter when it clearly did. She didn’t even know what part she was apologizing for. </p><p> </p><p>She just wanted Rio to look at her the way she had when she woke Agatha up this morning. She wanted to be back in Rio’s bed. Wanted her mouth. Her hands. Wanted Rio, fully, without the ache of this in-between place they kept landing in.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything right away. Just watched her, careful and quiet, then finally gave a small nod. “I know.” Then Rio reached out her hand. “Come on.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. She took it, tangled their fingers together, and let Rio lead her toward the dock.</p><p> </p><p>And somehow, just holding Rio’s hand made it easier to breathe.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>The dock reached across the water like a held out hand- sun bleached, splinterless, too perfect. The lake below barely stirred, all glassy surface and small betrayals of wind that never quite made it ashore. Trees lined the far shore like sentries, branches curling inward, as if they, too, were leaning in to listen.</p><p> </p><p>They sat at the edge in silence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s skin looked warmer out here, her hair pinned back, and her sunglasses pushed onto her head. Her legs dangled over the side, toes skimming the surface. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat beside her, legs pulled to her chest, arms wrapped tight around them. Her chin rested on her knees. She didn’t know what to do with her hands. Or her mouth. Or any of the thousand thoughts buzzing through her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not good at this part,” Agatha said, breaking the silence. “The whole… having a conversation where I don’t pretend everything’s fine.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice is quiet, “Try.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not-” Agatha’s voice catches. She tries again. “I don’t have anything to say.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice is so even it makes her nauseous. “Why were you so angry?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughs under her breath, bitter. “Take a wild guess.”</p><p> </p><p>“I want to hear you say it.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, you don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“I do.”</p><p> </p><p>“What was Wanda talking about at the bowling alley?” Agatha shot back.</p><p> </p><p>She asked because she knew Rio wouldn’t answer. That was the point.</p><p> </p><p>This version of Rio was harder to outrun. So Agatha reached for the instincts that had always protected her. A quick jab, a change of subject, a question she didn’t want answered. Anything to drag them back into a language she understood, where silence counted as control and no one had to say what they meant.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t fair.</p><p> </p><p>But it was familiar. And familiarity, even at its worst, had always felt safer than hope.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally looked at her, and for a flicker of a moment, she looked caught, like she hadn’t expected Agatha to aim there, not so directly.</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth parted. Then closed again. Her jaw tensed, throat working around whatever answer she wouldn’t give. She turned back toward the lake, eyes cast low, lashes fluttering. Her grip on the dock edge tightened- quiet, controlled, but Agatha saw it. The strain in her knuckles. The flush rising on her cheeks… Rio looked embarrassed.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not important,” Rio said, her voice barely carrying. She said it to the water. Not to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Bingo. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not fair,” Agatha said, too quickly. “You can’t ask me to sit here and try, and then pull that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a short huff, a sound that might’ve been a laugh, but came out bitter and hollow. “We’ve never been fair to each other.”</p><p> </p><p>She said it simply. Not as an excuse, but as fact. As if to say, ‘<em> I see what you’re doing. And I’m not going to play along.’ </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio saw straight through Agatha. That much was expected. She had long since run out of disguises Rio couldn’t see past. What actually unsettled Agatha was that Rio didn’t follow her into the space she had created. She didn’t take the bait or meet her where it was safe and familiar.</p><p> </p><p>She was giving Agatha the honest result of a dishonest question, leaving her to rot alone in the echo of her own avoidance. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw. “Right.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t speak right away. Just sat there, still as ever, watching the water move.</p><p> </p><p>“I came back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned fully toward her. “You- what are you talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>The words flew from her mouth fast. She said it without thinking, but the second she heard Rio say that her stomach dropped.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had a feeling this was the moment right before the raft she’d been floating on for years gave out. The one she’d patched, ignored, convinced herself would hold. She could feel it splitting underneath her. And all that water was about to come rushing in.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. Teeth half bared, like she was daring herself to keep going. The noise she made was almost a laugh, except it sounded like it hurt coming out.</p><p> </p><p>“The night we said goodbye in your kitchen-”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cut her off. No reason, except that the truth was circling like sharks in the water, and she suddenly wanted to throw up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at her. Lip caught in her teeth, brow slightly drawn, torn between saying it and protecting them both from what might come next.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand found Rio’s thigh. Her fingers dug in, not gently, but to anchor herself to the present so that maybe it could keep the past from rewriting itself.</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda answered the door,” Rio said, quietly. “And, uh… said you were in the shower.” She looked away. Her hand reached for the back of her neck, tugged once, then dropped to cover Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been in the shower. She remembered because she had queued Back to Black’s entire tracklist on full volume like it was a war hymn. She had just wanted to mourn and cry without an audience, which was ambitious considering her then wife was in the next room and pretending not to notice that her spouse was openly having a breakdown to Amy Winehouse.</p><p> </p><p>At the time, she had told herself it was heartbreak. Normal, platonic, I’m-losing-my-best-friend-to-the-abyss-of-time heartbreak. Not the other kind. Not the kind that might’ve been avoidable if either of them had just said one honest thing out loud.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spent years convincing herself there was nothing to be embarrassed about. That Rio had walked away, and she’d let her. It wasn’t a tragedy- only what happened when someone doesn’t want you and you finally believe them.</p><p> </p><p>Except now Rio was sitting here saying no, actually. It was a tragedy. Just a very quiet one.</p><p> </p><p>“You came back?” Agatha whispered. The words didn’t feel real even as she said them, but the desperation that laced through every one rang loud and clear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked up to meet hers, and there was no room left to pretend. She gave the smallest, tightest smile, and a little hum caught in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, quick. “No.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It came out all breath. This wasn’t how the story went. It couldn’t be. She needed Rio to say she was wrong. That she’d misunderstood. That this was actually just some bitter, elaborate twist- one final joke played by a universe that never seemed to get tired of making one out of them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her a look so tender it hurt. It held no defense, only apology. Not for what she was saying now, but for rewriting the version of them Agatha had protected for so long. For not keeping it safe.</p><p> </p><p>“I sat in the parking lot for a while,” Rio said quietly. “I told myself to leave. Over and over. I tried. But the second I put the car into drive, something in me fought it. My whole body felt wrong-”</p><p> </p><p>“Like gravity had broken,” Agatha whispered, cutting her off.</p><p> </p><p>The words came without thinking, pulled from somewhere deep and buried. She hadn’t thought about them in years, hadn’t even let herself revisit that night with any real honesty. But she remembered the sensation so clearly now… the hard pull in her chest as Rio walked out the door, the way the world tilted, the way nothing had felt right after.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio breathed out.</p><p> </p><p><em>‘After our last conversation, when you slunked off with your tail tucked.</em> <em>’ </em>Wanda’s words echoed in Agatha’s ears, sickening now in what little context she had been given.</p><p> </p><p>And it left Agatha burning. Anger. Theft. Something that had been stolen from Agatha before she even realized it was hers.</p><p> </p><p>“What did she say to you?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth opened, then closed again. She shook her head, frustrated. “It doesn’t matter. You were married and I was a fucking idiot to even-” She cut herself off, looked away, pressed her fingers hard to the bridge of her nose. She inhaled deeply, like she was trying to shove the rest of it, then turned back to Agatha. Her face was tight. Her voice came out through clenched teeth. “It’s fucking humiliating, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t care. I want to know.”</p><p> </p><p>“What difference does it make now, Agatha? I was a coward. I let her say something I should’ve ignored- and look at what it did to us. Look at what we became!” Rio said, voice breaking on the words. “It’s taken us seventeen years to get here. What someone said to me a decade ago isn’t going to change that.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry- do you think you can just drop something like that and move on? Ten years, Rio. I thought you left. I thought I <em> let </em> you leave. Do you understand how fucking insane that is?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head snapped toward her, eyes dark. “She said you called me deadweight. That I was some obsessive freak you kept around out of guilt. That people who actually care don’t choke on the truth for years. And if I actually gave a fuck, I’d stop showing up just to dump all my mental garbage on you.”  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha jerked back, eyes wide.</p><p> </p><p>The idea that Rio had believed it -that Agatha would ever say something like that, to Wanda of all people- made her stomach turn. That Rio had been walking around with <em> that </em> version of Agatha, for years, made her want to crawl out of her own skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha would have bitten through her own tongue before giving Wanda anything real about Rio, especially something so cruel.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda had never understood Rio. She hadn’t needed to. All it took was one slip. Agatha going still for half a second too long when Rio’s name came up and Wanda locked onto it.  From then on, it was constant. Weird. Possessive. Like Rio had pissed all over her territory once and Wanda could smell it years later. There became this conviction that Rio had touched something in Agatha that Wanda never could.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe Wanda wasn’t wrong.</p><p> </p><p>But just because Wanda had seen it didn’t mean Agatha admitted it. She hadn’t. She’d denied it so thoroughly, called her paranoid, delusional, jealous. </p><p> </p><p>But that was the problem, wasn’t it?</p><p> </p><p>Nothing had happened. No kiss. No confession. No proof. Just silence and tension and whatever lived in the space between. There was nothing Wanda could point to, and Agatha made sure to keep it that way. </p><p> </p><p>Any time it came up, Agatha saw white and would lash out. And Wanda, always so sure of herself, took that as proof. She mistook Agatha’s fury for confession, when really it was the opposite.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda gave them so much weight. Too much credit for what it actually was. She talked about it like Agatha had actually gotten to have Rio. Like the thing Agatha wanted most had been real enough to ruin.</p><p> </p><p>But it wasn’t. It never was.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone else seemed so sure she’d had Rio when all Agatha ever did was want her.</p><p> </p><p>Now Rio thought she’d handed her over to Wanda like a secret worth selling.</p><p> </p><p>That was worse than any of it. That was the part Agatha couldn’t stomach.</p><p> </p><p>“And you believed her?” Agatha asked, horrified.</p><p> </p><p>“You were fucking her. How could I not?” Rio muttered. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fucking. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>That was all Rio saw it as. An entire chapter of Agatha’s life, reduced to one single, contemptuous word. </p><p> </p><p>And yet, some sick part of Agatha liked it. She found it obscenely attractive that Rio boiled her whole marriage down to something crude and forgettable. That even saying ex-wife would’ve made it sound more important than it ever was.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha digresses. </p><p> </p><p>The point is, she chose Wanda. She built a life with her. And in doing so, she stopped being Rio’s person. And to top it off,  Rio believed that she went and sold whatever they did have -regardless of how incomplete- to the fucking devil.</p><p> </p><p><em> Valid </em>, Agatha supposed.</p><p> </p><p>“Well I’m telling you now. Whether you think it still matters or not… I never fucking said that about you. Ever. Especially not to her.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that now.” Rio’s voice dipped, almost petulant. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched Rio try not to squirm.</p><p> </p><p>She could tell Rio hated admitting it at all, embarrassed that she had believed it in the first place. </p><p> </p><p>“How long did it take you to figure that out?” Agatha asked. What she meant was: <em> how long did you think I was capable of something like that. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio looked down, rubbed the heel of her palm over her thigh. “A while.”</p><p> </p><p>“How long is a while?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know.” Rio exhaled slowly, eyes on the water. “I was angry for a long time. It felt easier than being confused. And I already felt… lost, I guess.” Rio swallowed hard. “Like I didn’t know who I was when you weren’t looking at me.”</p><p> </p><p>The air stilled. There was no self pity in her voice. Only fact. As if she’d accepted a truth she couldn’t outgrow. </p><p> </p><p>Rio started to fidget with Agatha’s fingers, which still rested against her thigh, tugging gently.</p><p> </p><p>“I always felt so at war with everything,” Rio said, quieter now. “I thought staying still was safer. I thought that was me trying.” She glanced at Agatha quickly then, almost sheepish. “Obviously it backfired.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard her heart shatter, clean and sharp, like glass on tile.</p><p> </p><p>“I tried. I tried to show you I was- God, I don’t know- actually interested. I even-” Agatha broke off, breath catching. “I tried to kiss you. Do you remember that? Because I do. You looked at me like I’d set the room on fire.”</p><p> </p><p>All the signs had been there. Rio looking at her mouth, not with a teasing glint, but with something quieter, something almost afraid. And Agatha, stupid, hopeful, starving for it, hadn’t pulled away. So Agatha had leaned in. Let her nose graze Rio’s cheek. Let herself feel the warmth of her breath, let herself believe, just for a second, that all the circling, all the almosts, all the years of aching tension had finally, finally led to that moment.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had let herself believe she wasn’t alone in it.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio had pulled her head back and those wide, terrified brown eyes were locked on Agatha like she had just broken something forever. So Agatha had left. Immediately. With haste. Never turned around, not even when she heard Rio call after her.</p><p> </p><p>It was humiliating -spectacularly, irreversibly humiliating- and Agatha did what any sane person would do: shoved the memory into the furthest corner of her brain, slammed the door, and pretended it never happened. Ideally, it should’ve stayed there forever, gathering dust next to every other brilliant decision she’d ever made. </p><p> </p><p>“You think I forgot? That I didn’t think about it every night for months?” Rio asked, defensive. </p><p> </p><p>“How would I have known that, Rio? We never talked about anything. You could’ve said something. Literally anything and you didn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“You met someone the next day.”</p><p> </p><p><em> Wanda </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head. “No. That’s not fair.”</p><p> </p><p>“You gave up before I even had the chance to say anything,” Rio said, frustrated. “I went after you, Agatha. And you didn’t stop long enough to look back.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t give up,” Agatha snapped. “I got tired of waiting for someone who didn’t have the balls to want me back.” The words came too fast, too loud. She hated how breathless she sounded. Hated that she was even talking about this. “I waited for you,” She said, harsher now. Her face flushed hot, shame hitting right behind anger. “You have no idea how long I waited for you.” It slipped out quieter, like the fight had gone out of it but not the disbelief. Not the anger curled tight in her chest, still burning from shit that happened over a decade ago.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had waited. Pathetically. Furious with herself. Even when she was someone else’s wife. Even in a life she’d built without Rio in it. She waited. For Rio to knock, to call, to barge in uninvited and say it - ‘<em> Sorry I’m late’ </em> - like she had in the bowling alley. Like nothing had changed. Like everything had.</p><p> </p><p>From the moment Agatha met Rio, her life had split clean down the middle. Not by years. Not by cities. Not by marriage. By her. There was <em> before Rio, </em> and there was <em> after. </em> And Agatha had spent every moment since trying, and failing, to pretend that wasn’t true.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked Rio dead in the eye.</p><p> </p><p>“And you gave me nothing.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. Her face didn’t change, not really, but her hand tensed ever so slightly over Agatha’s. Then: </p><p> </p><p>“You never let me.”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a defense. It wasn’t even angry. It was soft. Broken in places. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned away, eyes fixed on the lake. Her jaw was tight, her chest was still burning, but she didn’t move her hand from where it rested on Rio’s thigh.</p><p> </p><p>They just sat there, still tethered. Wrecked. Holding on, even now, to what neither of them had the language for a decade ago.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m so sorry.” Rio whispered. “I didn’t mean for it to feel that way.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry too. That was a shitty thing to say,” Agatha said, not looking at her. “I’m sorry… for all of it. I know I made it hard.”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t just about the events of the day. It was everything before that too- how she ran, how she waited without ever saying it, how she made herself impossible to reach. </p><p> </p><p>They’d both ruined it, in different ways. Rio had been too scared to move and Agatha had never stopped running, even when she wanted to. They both had blood on their hands. Different mistakes, same loss.</p><p> </p><p>“Will you look at me?” Rio asked, barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look away from the water- still, sunlit, unbothered. If she turned now, the salt behind her eyes might spill into it, and she couldn’t bear to muddy something that calm.</p><p> </p><p>She felt Rio’s hand slip away from hers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost pulled back on instinct, but didn’t. Not when Rio shifted closer, not when her hands gently cradled Agatha’s face and turned her toward her.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes slammed shut, and her hand flew to Rio’s wrist- reflexive, trembling. She already knew what was about to be said. What Rio meant. What had been sitting between them for nearly two decades, untouched.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t say it.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, her thumb brushed softly across Agatha’s cheek, and she leaned in, barely breathing the words:</p><p> </p><p>“Won’t you just let me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” she breathed.</p><p> </p><p>She heard Rio’s breath catch, the smallest hitch like she hadn’t expected the answer so easily. Her voice caught a little when she said it back, almost laughing through it. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yes.” She was already leaning in before she finished saying it.</p><p> </p><p>Her lips found Rio’s without apology- mouth open, breathing against her, catching and pulling and chasing. </p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her back instantly, hands framing her face. She tilted her head and pressed deeper, matching every movement with one of her own. </p><p> </p><p>They kissed like they’d been interrupted a million times and this was the first time no one was going to stop them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her hand fall from Rio’s wrist and slid it around her back, pressing her closer until their bodies were as flush as they could be sitting on the dock. She felt Rio’s chest press against hers with each breath, every inhale a little shakier than the last.</p><p> </p><p>Tongues slid together, again and again, mouths breaking and returning, as if they hadn’t been allowed to miss each other but had anyway. Her hand slid up Rio’s spine, slow, deliberate, just to feel the way she breathed.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha didn’t know how long they stayed like that, hands wandering, mouths meeting in that same soft rhythm over and over. She only knew the sun was setting- bleeding color into the lake, staining the sky with gold and pink and orange so rich it didn’t look real. She only knew the light caught in Rio’s hair, in the lines of her face, in the corners of her eyes when she opened her own between kisses, just to be sure it was all still there. It was. Rio was. She was.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t thinking about what would come after. She wasn’t thinking about what they were, or what they weren’t. She wasn’t bracing herself for an inevitable ending.</p><p> </p><p>She was just kissing Rio. Still, for what felt like the first time. </p><p> </p><p>And the sun was setting.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They had made out on the dock for what felt like hours, tangled in some pathetic imitation of a romcom Agatha would have rolled her eyes at if it weren’t happening to her. The whole thing had been stupid. Or sweet. Or both. Agatha hadn’t decided yet.</p><p> </p><p>At one point, they’d tried walking across the length of the dock with Agatha’s feet planted on top of Rio’s. Her back against Rio’s chest. Rio’s chin hooked over her shoulder and her arms around Agatha’s waist. Giggling like idiots. Testing how many steps they could manage that way, drunk on nothing but each other. They made it a few clumsy steps before Agatha called it, breathless from laughing, too warm, too aware of the way Rio hesitated before letting go.</p><p> </p><p>Now they were standing on the porch, each with a cigarette in hand. Rio had <em> Connections </em> pulled up on her phone, the screen tilted slightly toward Agatha, who was tucked into her side, shoulder against her, quietly looking on.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re just clicking things,” Agatha said, smoke curling from her lips as she leaned in closer, not bothering to hide her amusement.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m following my instincts,” Rio muttered, eyes narrowed at the grid.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re guessing,” Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged with one shoulder. “Same thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed and brought her cigarette to her mouth. Rio got another group wrong, grumbled under her breath, then locked the screen and set the phone down on the railing beside the ashtray.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re bad at that game,” Agatha said, almost gently.</p><p> </p><p>“You were distracting me,” Rio said as she reached for the hem of Agatha’s shirt and tugged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped in front of her without a word. She took a final drag of her cigarette, stubbed it out in the ashtray next to Rio, then took one more small step forward, closing the space between their bodies.</p><p> </p><p>“Distracting you?” Agatha said, voice low. “That’s the excuse you’re going with?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio took a slow drag from her own cigarette, hummed and nodded, and turned her head to exhale. When she looked back at Agatha, her eyes were steady.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re very pretty,” Rio said simply, and one arm slid around Agatha’s waist, holding her there.</p><p> </p><p>“You think calling me pretty is going to make up for how bad you are at that game?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>“It should,” Rio said. “Because I’m sweet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed under her breath, but she didn’t pull away. Her fingers had found the collar of Rio’s shirt, idle and unthinking.</p><p> </p><p>Just as she was about to open her mouth to respond, a dog barked in the distance.</p><p> </p><p>Jasper. </p><p> </p><p>And suddenly, she was remembering how familiar Rio and Charlie had seemed. Charlie’s hand resting on Rio’s shoulder. The way she’d laughed too easily. The way it had made perfect sense for her to assume Agatha was just a friend.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched before she could stop it.</p><p> </p><p>When she looked back at Rio, she had her cigarette raised to her mouth, eyes narrowed- not in confusion, but like she was waiting. Like she wanted Agatha to ask.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her tongue into her cheek, looked away, then back at Rio. Her chin tipped up slightly. “You told me you didn’t bring other women here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. She turned just enough to stub out her cigarette, but her arm stayed where it was, resting around Agatha’s waist like it belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>“She lives down the road.” Rio said. “You made a hell of a first impression.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha already knew that. And Rio knew she knew.</p><p> </p><p>Fine. She’d spell it out.</p><p> </p><p>“Have you fucked her?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded once, slow. “Good,” she said. “Because that would’ve made you a liar.”</p><p> </p><p>“And what would that make you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Drop it,” Agatha muttered.</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Rio’s hand slipped under the hem of her shirt, nails dragging slow down the curve of her lower back. “Say it,” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her. Jaw tight. Mouth set. Furious at how much she felt.</p><p> </p><p>“You want me to say I was jealous?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine. I didn’t like her touching you.” Agatha rolled her eyes. “Happy now?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled her lip between her teeth, shook her head slightly. The smugness was gone. The momentum shifted. And Agatha suddenly felt like she was standing on the edge of something else entirely.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shit. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t move. Didn’t breathe. Just stared at Rio’s face, waiting for it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand stayed right where it was, low on her back, thumb brushing once against bare skin like a quiet warning.</p><p> </p><p>Then, softly- </p><p> </p><p>“I’d like to know what happened this morning.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t pretend not to understand.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t ask before,” Rio continued, eyes steady. “But I want to know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled. “She kissed me.”</p><p> </p><p>She felt Rio’s fingers press harder into her back, firm, like she was holding herself in place.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t stop it right away,” Agatha said. “It lasted two seconds. Maybe less. And I shoved her off.”</p><p> </p><p>“You kissed her back?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha winced. “Barely.”</p><p> </p><p>The word hung there. She hated how small it sounded.</p><p> </p><p>“We were arguing. I was pissed. I don’t know-” Agatha exhaled, short and hot. “I think I let it happen because some part of me wanted to ruin this. All of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a bitter breath. “Because that’s what I do.” She shook her head. “You said it yourself- I make myself impossible to reach. I shut down, run, and then get pissed when you don’t come after me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice was quiet. “I never said that.”</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t have to,” Agatha glanced past her, out at the lake, jaw tight. “You know it’s true.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything.</p><p> </p><p>“I felt out of control. With you. And for half a second, it felt easier to ruin it than deal with what it actually meant.” She met Rio’s eyes again. “But I stopped it. I didn’t want her. I wanted you. I’ve always wanted you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes were darker now. They dropped to Agatha’s mouth, then lingered.</p><p> </p><p>When her gaze lifted again, slow and deliberate, Agatha felt her stomach flip.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Agatha,” Rio said, voice low, nodding.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth went dry. “Okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio slipped her hand out from under Agatha’s shirt. Reached up. Found Agatha’s wrists still resting against her chest and wrapped her fingers around them, gently pulling them away.</p><p> </p><p>Then she stepped to the side.</p><p> </p><p>Laced their hands together.</p><p> </p><p>And without saying another word, guided Agatha inside.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio led them inside, grabbing only her duffle on the way. Agatha didn’t say anything. Words felt useless now. She just followed, pulse high, throat tight.</p><p> </p><p>She let Rio guide her down the hallway and into a bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>The bedroom was dark, lit only by the silver spill of moonlight through the window. Rio dropped her bag near the door, then brought Agatha to the center of the room. She let go of her hand and turned away, kneeling to dig through the duffle.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood where she was, breath shallow, nerves buzzing. She didn’t look at the room. She didn’t need to.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled something out, tossed it onto the bed, and turned to face her.</p><p> </p><p>Then she started undressing.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha understood.</p><p> </p><p>She reached for the hem of her shirt and tugged it over her head, let it fall to the floor. Her fingers slid behind her back. She unhooked her bra, slipped it off, and dropped it with the rest. She unbuttoned her jean shorts. Pushed them down.</p><p> </p><p>Once they were both completely undressed, Rio turned back to the bed and mess with whatever she had set there moments ago. Agatha watched her move in the low light, her focus sharp and unblinking.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned around slowly, and Agatha’s eyes dropped to what was hanging from her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>A harness. The straps dangled from her hand, the silicone cock already attached, swinging slightly with the motion.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose and tilted her head back, eyes fluttering shut. Her entire body went tight. The sound that threatened to leave her chest was ridiculous, loud, and way too easy, so she bit her tongue to keep it in.</p><p> </p><p>By the time she looked back at Rio, her entire body was humming.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped in front of her, and Agatha opened her mouth to speak- she wasn’t sure what she was going to say and she never got the chance to figure it out.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio dropped to her knees.</p><p> </p><p>The sound that tore from Agatha’s throat wasn’t graceful. It escaped before she could stop it, pulled from somewhere deep. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She just reached for her.</p><p> </p><p>She lifted Agatha’s leg gently, guided it through the first strap, then the second. The harness hung loose until Rio’s hands began working the buckles- tightening, adjusting, fitting it to her hips like it mattered. Like Agatha was hers to dress.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest rose with each shallow breath. Her hands hovered uselessly at her sides. She tried to focus on something other than the way Rio’s fingers brushed against her thighs, her stomach, her hips, but there was nothing else. Just that.</p><p> </p><p>“Whe-” The word broke off. Her mouth was too dry. Agatha licked her lips and tried again. “When did you get that?”</p><p> </p><p>It came out breathless. Pathetic. She didn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. She was still adjusting the last buckle- low, right where the toy sat snug against Agatha’s body. Her fingers moved deliberately, checking the fit, brushing close enough to make Agatha’s thighs twitch.</p><p> </p><p>“This morning,” Rio said, quiet. Then she looked up, only for a second. “That’s why I was late.” </p><p> </p><p>And then she looked down again, finishing her work. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p> </p><p>Cool. That was fine. Totally fine. While she was across town making a goddamn mess, Rio was out buying this. For her. For them. Fantastic.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath through her nose and exhaled slow. She refused to think about it now. Not when Rio was still on her knees, still close, still touching her like she wasn’t going anywhere.</p><p> </p><p>Like she never had.</p><p> </p><p>Once she was satisfied with the fit, Rio sat back on her heels and looked up at her. Her hands rested lightly on Agatha’s hips, her eyes steady.</p><p> </p><p>“If you want to be in control, Agatha,” Rio said, “you can be.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a sound that was more breath than voice, her fingers already threading into Rio’s hair, her other hand sliding up Rio’s jaw, thumb brushing her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck yes,” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes never left hers. Her mouth fell open, ready for it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s grip in her hair tightened, not to pull, but to hold her still. To ground herself. To stop her own hips from jerking forward, from giving in to the instinct to fuck Rio’s mouth like she wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>God, she wanted to. She wanted to push in deep and claim every inch of control Rio had just handed her without question. Wanted to make her take it.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio stayed exactly where she was. Kneeling. Waiting. Mouth open. Willing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a shaky, breathless laugh- almost disbelieving at how willing Rio was, how easy she made this.</p><p> </p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha murmured, voice thick and low in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Then she pressed her hand firmly into the back of Rio’s head and guided her forward, slow but sure, until the tip of the cock met her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpered, soft and eager, just before her mouth closed around it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched as Rio’s lips closed around the tip, slow and deliberate, her mouth stretching to take it. Her lashes fluttered, breath catching just a little- and fuck, Agatha felt that in her spine.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hollowed her cheeks slightly, taking more, inch by inch, and Agatha’s knees nearly buckled.</p><p> </p><p>Her jaw clenched. Her free hand found Rio’s shoulder for balance, fingers digging in to keep from thrusting forward.</p><p> </p><p>“You look so fucking good like this,” Agatha muttered, barely audible. She wasn’t sure if Rio heard it. Didn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched, rapt, as Rio worked her mouth over the length of her. The slow, steady drag of her lips. The way her cheeks hollowed when she pulled back- just to sink forward again, taking more each time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. And then she gagged, soft and strained around the base, before pulling back slightly to breathe through her nose.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly lost it.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers tightened in Rio’s hair, not to stop her, not to push, just to <em> feel </em> her there. Her knees wobbled.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked up at her, eyes glassy with effort, tears clinging stubbornly at the corners. But she didn’t stop. She swallowed around her again, slow and sure, letting Agatha feel every second of it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was trembling.</p><p> </p><p>She was so fucking pretty like this- eyes wet, mouth stretched, wrecked and still offering more.</p><p> </p><p>Still kneeling. Still hers.</p><p> </p><p>“Come here,” Agatha said, her voice low, ragged.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled Rio off the strap abruptly, and Rio rose without hesitation- barely upright before Agatha grabbed her and crashed their mouths together, spinning them until they stumbled backward toward the window, Rio’s ass knocking against something hard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands flew back, steadying them, fingers brushing wood.</p><p> </p><p>A desk.</p><p> </p><p>Oh, this was going to be fun.</p><p> </p><p>She grinned against Rio’s mouth, then deepened the kiss- tongue deep pushing deeper, insistent, claiming. Rio’s mouth fell open around it with a desperate sound, her hand at Agatha’s jaw pulling her in tighter, the other arm looping around her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>Her palms flattened against Rio’s ribs, fingers sliding higher, mapping her skin. Rio’s body arched into her, needful, aching. When she pinched one nipple, Rio gasped, hips jerking against her.</p><p> </p><p>“Lube?” Agatha muttered, not pulling back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, breath hot against her lips. “Don’t need it. Not with you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, the sound guttural and low in her throat, and kissed her again- harder this time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha broke the kiss only long enough to press her mouth to Rio’s cheek, then lower, trailing heat along her jawline and down to her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand slid from Agatha’s jaw to the desk behind her, bracing herself, shoulders tense, head tilted back. Her hips jerked forward instinctively, chasing friction, chasing <em> more </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked against her skin and bit down, sucking hard enough to leave proof of it. A bruise. A mark. Hers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, fingers flexing against the edge of the desk, and Agatha’s hand moved between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio choked out a sound, high and needy, and her legs fell open without hesitation, welcoming the touch, begging for it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dragged two fingers through her, slow and slick, and both of them moaned at the contact.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so fucking wet,” Agatha murmured, eyes on Rio’s face, watching her unravel.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, dazed, her eyes half lidded and glassy. Her mouth searched blindly for Agatha’s, words slurring as she caught her breath.</p><p> </p><p>“All for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swore under her breath. She’d never get tired of hearing that. Of watching Rio fall apart like this, open and eager, needing nothing but her.</p><p> </p><p>She pressed in closer, hand steady between her thighs, and kissed her again, hungry and possessive, she meant to keep every word on Rio’s tongue for herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha teased her, slow and cruel, letting just the tip of her finger slip inside before curling it slightly- enough to make Rio gasp, but not enough to satisfy.</p><p> </p><p>Rio whined, head tipping forward, voice trembling. “Baby, please. I need you. Please, fuck me. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>And really, how could Agatha say no when she was being asked so sweetly?</p><p> </p><p>She withdrew her fingers completely, watching the way Rio shivered at the loss. Then she stepped back, catching her by the wrist and guiding her off the desk. Rio followed on shaky legs, one hand still braced behind her like she needed the extra balance.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her once before pulling away again. Rio whimpered at the loss, but it barely had time to register before Agatha spun her around and pressed a firm hand between her shoulder blades, guiding her down.</p><p> </p><p>“Bend over.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio obeyed instantly, folding forward, elbows hitting the desk with a soft thud.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Rio gasped, already breathless. “Fuck- yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t waste time. She gripped Rio’s hips, guided herself forward, and lined the strap up with practiced confidence. The tip slid in with no resistance, slick and perfect, and Rio let out a low, broken moan, hips instinctively jerking backward to take more.</p><p> </p><p>That sound nearly undid Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Easy,” Agatha muttered, tightening her grip to hold Rio still. “Let me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpered in response, her knuckles white against the desk as she held herself steady.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha eased in slowly, a little more, then pulled back just enough to make Rio gasp- and then pushed deeper again. She moved like she had all the time in the world, listening for every sound Rio gave her.</p><p> </p><p>Each inch made Rio whine, higher now, breath catching on every inhale. Her thighs trembled.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Rio breathed, voice wrecked. “Please, Agatha, fuck- don’t stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept going, inch by inch, until her hips finally met Rio’s, the base of the strap flush against her ass. She exhaled sharply, hands splayed over Rio’s waist, holding her there- filled and still and completely hers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio made a desperate noise and Agatha let her hands slide down the backs of her thighs, feeling her shake.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck, baby,” she whispered. “You take me so well.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio made a choked sound, head falling forward, and Agatha saw her nodding.</p><p> </p><p>“Yours,” Rio said, voice ragged. “I’m yours.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned, the sound raw and involuntary. Her pace quickened, hips grinding harder, and she slid her hand around Rio’s waist, fingers seeking out the soft heat between her legs. She found Rio’s clit easily, and didn’t stop moving.</p><p> </p><p>“Say that again,” Agatha demanded, her voice a low, fractured thing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio cried out, trembling under the pressure. “I’m yours.”</p><p> </p><p>The sound in the room was obscene- each thrust met with a slick, messy noise that echoed off the walls, soaked and unignorable.</p><p> </p><p>“Mine,” Agatha breathed, low and wrecked in her throat, nodding without realizing. “Again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, falling apart beneath her. “I’m yours.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her rhythm steady, fingers working Rio’s clit in tandem with each deep thrust. She was close, Agatha could feel it in the way her thighs trembled.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio gasped, voice barely holding together. “I’m gonna- don’t stop. Don’t you fucking stop.”</p><p> </p><p>The desk slammed against the wall with each movement. Rio’s head dropped forward again, moaning into the wood, her voice a strangled cry as she broke apart.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!”</p><p> </p><p>Her hips snapped back against Agatha, burying her completely inside, and then Rio was shaking -legs buckling, body locking up- and wetness spilled out of her, sudden and overwhelming.</p><p> </p><p>Another moan tore from her throat. “Fuck,” Rio said again, quieter this time, like she was stunned by it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t look away. “Yes,” she breathed, nearly undone. “God, yes.”</p><p> </p><p>She jerked her hips once more, deep and final, and Rio gasped again, louder this time, as a second wave of release hit her, liquid gushing between her legs, soaking them both.</p><p> </p><p>It was obscene.</p><p> </p><p>Beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held still, buried deep, barely breathing. Her heart was slamming in her chest, but everything else was quiet. So quiet it felt like the world had narrowed to just the two of them, tangled and shaking and soaked in the evidence of it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still slumped over the desk, breathing hard, her body bathed in the moonlight, trembling. A soft sound slipped from her throat, something between a laugh and a whimper, and her hand reached back, catching blindly at Agatha’s wrist like she needed something to hold on to.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled out slowly, carefully, her hands sliding over Rio’s hips to steady her as she straightened. Rio winced at the sensitivity but didn’t let go.</p><p> </p><p>Neither did Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in, kissed the top of Rio’s spine, just below the curve of her neck. “You okay?” she asked softly, voice frayed and rough.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, barely. “Yeah,” she breathed. “I just… give me a second.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She stayed pressed close, arms wrapped around Rio’s waist, her cheek resting against Rio’s shoulder as they both tried to catch up to what had just happened.</p><p> </p><p>“You were perfect,” Agatha whispered, lips brushing her skin. “So fucking good.”</p><p> </p><p>A breath escaped Rio. It was rough, winded, still caught in the edge of a moan. “God. That’s so embarrassing.” Rio groaned, muffled into her forearms.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said, pressing another kiss to her spine. “That was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen.”</p><p> </p><p>After a moment, Agatha straightened and helped guide her up. Rio leaned back into her without a word. Her legs were still shaky, and Agatha caught her without thinking, arms strong around her, keeping her upright.</p><p> </p><p>She nudged Rio gently to turn around. Rio followed the motion, slow and quiet, but kept her arms crossed tightly over her chest. Her eyes fixed on the far corner of the room, deliberately avoiding Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her fingers trail lightly over the inside of Rio’s wrist, then up to her shoulder, just enough contact to remind her she was still there. Still with her. Still choosing her.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to look at me,” Agatha said quietly. “But I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed. Her jaw twitched. Her fingers flexed where they clutched her own arms, then slowly loosened. She glanced at Agatha, just a flicker of eye contact, but it landed like a blow.</p><p> </p><p>There it was. The raw edge of her.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t usually…” Rio began, then trailed off. Her voice was hoarse. “That doesn’t happen to me.” Then she breathed out, so soft it barely registered. “It was a lot.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yeah,” she said. “It was.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t mean the sex. Or not just the sex. She meant the whole damn thing. The morning. The fight. The kiss with Wanda. The fear that she’d ruined it. The relief that she hadn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally looked at her. Eyes glassy. Mouth parted like she had more to say and didn’t know where to start.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha leaned in and kissed her forehead.</p><p> </p><p>“Come to bed,” she murmured. “Let me take care of you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t speak. She just nodded again, slow and small, and let Agatha lead her away.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>“You’re staring,” Agatha mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes stayed closed. She didn’t need to see the look on Rio’s face to know it was there- soft, stupid, probably smug. She could feel it in the way Rio’s body pressed into hers, warm and bare and close. Her arm was flung over Agatha’s waist like she was trying to keep her there. One hand traced the same slow circle on Agatha’s ribs over and over again.</p><p> </p><p>Memories from the night before came back in flashes. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Sometime in the middle of the night, Agatha had woken up to Rio pressed tight and her breath warm against the back of Agatha’s neck. She might’ve pretended to still be asleep if Rio hadn’t been grazing soft fingertips up the slope of her stomach. She also knew Rio’s breathing patterns the way other people knew their favorite songs- by heart, by repetition. She’d memorized them a lifetime ago. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio was awake. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha hadn’t said anything. She just pushed her ass back into Rio’s front, slow and obvious, and waited. Rio’s breath caught, she curled in tighter, pressed her mouth to Agatha’s shoulder. When she finally rolled her hips forward into Agatha, it was too careful to be casual. </em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em> They moved against each other for a while, quiet, enough to feel the ache building. Agatha didn’t try to hide the way she rutted into her. Rio didn’t try to hide the way her hips chased it. And they kept rolling into each other, over and over, until their breathing turned shallow and panting. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> At some point, Rio’s hand slipped down Agatha’s body without hesitation and cupped her fully. Agatha’s breath caught and she clenched around nothing. She pushed harder into Rio’s hand, chasing it. Her own thighs trembled with the effort. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It wasn’t enough. It wasn’t close enough. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio shifted behind her, letting out the smallest frustrated sound like she couldn’t go another second without seeing her. She tugged Agatha gently onto her back and Agatha let her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She kissed Agatha once. Soft, open mouthed, and so goddamn slowly. Then she slid down the bed. Rio kissed her stomach. Her thighs. The inside of her knee. Took her time. Agatha was already soaked. Already shaking. And when Rio finally lowered her mouth to her cunt, Agatha nearly sobbed. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> They didn’t stop. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It kept happening. Over and over. Each time slower than the last. And it wasn’t casual. It wasn’t manageable. It was horrifyingly intimate.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It felt like Agatha had been stumbling through the dark for years and then, suddenly, heard a heartbeat she recognized. And instead of trying to find her way out, she turned toward the sound. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Seventeen years of loving someone in silence, and then there she had been- breathing hard against Agatha’s neck, whispering Agatha’s name, holding her like she'd never known anything else.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled herself out of the memory, blinking back to the present. Rio still hadn’t answered. Her eyes stayed closed, but she could feel Rio watching her- could feel the slow path of her fingers tracing idle circles against her ribs. But she could hear Rio thinking even when she had said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Without opening her eyes, Agatha spoke quietly into the room, “What are you thinking about?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s response came easily. “You.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened one eye. Just as she’d expected, Rio was propped up on one elbow, watching her. There was nothing smug in her expression. Only a sleepy kind of softness. Her smile was lazy, her hair a mess, her chest bare in the early morning light. Agatha let her other eye open, gaze lingering on Rio’s chest before dragging back up to her face.</p><p> </p><p>“I like waking up with you like this,” Rio said, quieter now.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha still wasn’t used to that. This new version of Rio, who said things plainly, who didn’t hide behind jokes or wear her deflection like armor. It was strange how easily Rio said things like that now. </p><p> </p><p>She used to think she knew Rio better than anyone. Still did, Agatha thought. But each time Rio reached out like this, said what really meant. Agatha realized just how much she’d missed. How long they’d been apart. How much of that time had bent them, stretched them, into new versions of themselves. It hurt to notice that, even more to admit it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wished they’d gotten here sooner. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah?” she asked, a little breathless, despite herself. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed playfully. She pulled her lips between her teeth, then let them go with a hum, amused. Her hand moved, brushed lightly along Agatha’s jaw. Her thumb traced the edge of it. Her gaze lingered on Agatha’s mouth before she answered.</p><p> </p><p>“You do this thing,” Rio murmured, eyes still on her. “When you’re asleep, and the sun hits your face- you pout.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio said it casually, like it was just an observation. But it wasn’t. Not really.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t need to ask how many mornings Rio had seen it. The answer was in her voice, in the certainty of it- like she’d known for a long time and only now was allowed to share.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed and tried to act like it didn’t get to her. That Rio had always looked. Always paid attention. Even when she wasn’t supposed to. Even when Agatha hadn’t noticed.</p><p> </p><p>“You twitch in your sleep,” Agatha whispered. “Just your fingers, like you’re reaching for something.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t explain further. She didn’t need to. It was her way of saying: <em> I’ve seen you, too. Even when you thought I wasn’t looking. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio went still for a moment, her thumb pausing. Then she exhaled, quiet through her nose. Her mouth curved, barely. “Yeah?” she said softly.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha echoed. “You used to do it more. Back then.”</p><p> </p><p>“That tracks.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a soft breath, eyes flicking away for half a second before finding Rio’s again. “Did you ever find what you were reaching for?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was quiet for a beat. She ran her thumb along Agatha’s cheek, slow, thoughtful. Her gaze dropped to Agatha’s lips again for a moment, then she gave the smallest few nods.</p><p> </p><p>Then -so soft it nearly didn’t reach Agatha- “I think I’m getting there.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She looked at Rio and for a second it almost made her angry- how open she was, how easy she made it all seem.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha was tired. Tired of thinking. Tired of remembering all the versions of Rio who never said anything, who let her leave, who stayed quiet when it counted.</p><p> </p><p>So she reached up, fingers slipping behind Rio’s neck, and pulled her into a kiss.</p><p> </p><p>It was slow and it didn’t ask for anything. It wasn’t meant to fix anything or fill in the silence. Agatha kissed her because she could. Because she wanted to. Because for the first time since Rio had walked back into her life, she didn’t want to be the one holding back.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood on the porch facing the lake, elbows resting on the railing. Her coffee was perched beside her, steam curling lazily into the morning air, and a cigarette balanced between her fingers as she alternated between sipping and smoking. The light off the water was too bright, the quiet too suspicious. The house sat raised on a slope, built into the hill above the shoreline.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had disappeared down the stairs nearly twenty minutes ago, to dig around in the storage area, claiming she needed “a thing.” That was all the explanation Agatha got. She hadn’t pressed. Mostly because she was too busy enjoying the peace- and the persistent, mildly irritating smile that had been tugging at her mouth for the last hour and a half.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio appeared from beneath the porch. Whatever she'd been doing, she looked entirely too pleased with herself. Agatha’s attention though, drifted to her ass, immediately and without shame, to the way those jean shorts fit- frayed, high-waisted, and deeply distracting. The black tank top wasn’t helping either.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even bother pretending not to look. It was too early to be decent.</p><p> </p><p>She narrowed her eyes and took a long drag from her cigarette when Rio glanced back at her, then shifted direction toward the dock.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her elbows from the railing and stood up straighter, suddenly alert. Her gaze dropped to what Rio was carrying- and her stomach turned.</p><p> </p><p>A tackle box. Two fishing poles. And, based on Rio’s sudden increase in speed, a mission.</p><p> </p><p>“OH FUCK NO!”</p><p> </p><p>The sound startled a cluster of birds from the trees -again- as Rio picked up the pace.</p><p> </p><p>“I told you I wasn’t participating in outdoor activities,” Agatha yelled after her. “And I <em> specifically </em> said no fishing!”</p><p> </p><p>“It builds character!” Rio yelled, not bothering to turn around.</p><p> </p><p>“And I told you if you said that, I’d drown myself in the lake!”</p><p> </p><p>Without waiting for a response, Agatha smashed out her cigarette against the ash trash, already rounding the porch in a fast walk that threatened to become a run. She wasn’t about to let Rio get away with this.</p><p> </p><p>She barreled down the stairs, muttering to herself, trying to catch up before Rio even touched the dock. This was not how her morning was supposed to go. Coffee. Quiet. Rio. Possibly a second cigarette. Those were the plans.</p><p> </p><p>Fishing was not on the fucking list.</p><p> </p><p>By the time Agatha reached the dock, Rio had only just finished setting everything down- fishing poles leaned against one of the chairs facing the water, the tackle box set in the seat. She turned toward Agatha with a big, stupid smile stretched across her face, gap between her teeth showing and all, wearing a baby blue baseball cap that made Agatha want to rip it off her head and chuck it into the lake.</p><p> </p><p>No. Agatha wasn’t falling for it. That gap might’ve once been endearing -still was, unfortunately- but Rio’s charming dental real estate wasn’t getting her out of this one. Agatha was standing on fucking business. The decree had been clear, and it bore repeating: No fishing. </p><p> </p><p>And no fishing meant <em> no fucking fishing! </em></p><p> </p><p>“Hey!” Agatha barked. The shout rippled across the water with such force that a startled bass broke the surface, flopped once, and vanished.</p><p> </p><p>Rio winced theatrically. “You’ll scare off the fish,” she scolded, reaching for Agatha’s waist, still smiling like this was charming instead of monumentally infuriating.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t give a single, solitary shit about the fish,” Agatha shot back, swatting at Rio’s hands. “We are not fishing. Outdoor activities were vetoed. No fishing. No sitting and bonding over fucking worms and nature. None of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re being a little dramatic.” Rio said, undeterred, and tried again to reach for Agatha’s waist again. She kept batting Rio’s hands away, but with slightly less conviction each time.</p><p> </p><p>“What part of no fishing was confusing for you?”</p><p> </p><p>Then came the death blow.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated how fast it worked. Her arms dropped before she could stop herself, and Rio slid an arm around her waist. She  crossed her arms hard over her chest and stood stiff in Rio’s hold, scowling at her as <em> she </em>was directly responsible for this betrayal.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t fishing. She would rather scream into the lake until the fish fled the county. And if Rio so much as tried anything cute, that pastel baseball cap was absolutely getting launched.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She stood in front of Agatha with one arm still looped casually around her waist, entirely too pleased with herself. Then her eyes dropped to Agatha’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>It was obvious, followed by a subtle shift- her bottom lip pulled between her teeth, her gaze slowly rising to meet Agatha’s again like she hadn’t been caught doing something deeply manipulative.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t playing this game. Not now. Not while fishing equipment was still visible within a seven-foot radius.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said, firm and level, her tone carrying enough weight to leave no room for argument. Her stare didn’t waver. It wasn’t a threat, or a warning.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smirk didn’t falter, not even a little. If anything, it deepened. “You don’t have to fish,” she offered, her voice light.</p><p> </p><p>“Good. Because I’m not.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s totally fine,” Rio said, nodding.</p><p> </p><p>“Wonderful,” Agatha replied, her voice clipped.</p><p> </p><p>“Great,” Rio returned.</p><p> </p><p>“Fucking spectacular,” Agatha muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rocked on her heels, clearly enjoying herself. “What if I put the worm on for you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, okay.” Rio held up her free hand in mock surrender, still grinning like this was foreplay. “New offer. You don’t have to touch anything. You don’t have to hold anything. You don’t even have to look in the direction of the water.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She just stared at Rio, eyes narrowed, teeth clenched. She could already hear the smug satisfaction in Rio’s voice and hated that it was working, even a little.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in slightly, voice low and sweet in a way that made her extra suspicious. “Just sit in the chair. That’s it. Sit your hot ass down, drink your coffee, and look pretty while I fish like an old man trying to impress you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the scowl she’d been holding onto waver, though she didn’t let it fall completely. She glanced toward the water, then looked back at Rio, her lips pressed into a tight, unimpressed line.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” Agatha muttered, reaching up to pluck the baseball cap off Rio’s head as she stepped past her.</p><p> </p><p>She barely made it a step before Rio caught her hand and pulled her gently back. Agatha turned just as Rio pulled her in and kissed her. It wasn’t dramatic or showy- just certain and annoyingly sure of itself. Agatha gave in faster than she meant to. Her hand came up to Rio’s cheek without thinking, fingers curling there, pulling her in closer for longer than necessary. Then she slid her hand down, pressed her palm to Rio’s chest, and gave her a light shove.</p><p> </p><p>“Go make me another coffee, Skipper,” Agatha said, already walking away.</p><p> </p><p>As she moved down the dock, she pulled the cap over her head, adjusting it with one hand. Without turning around, she added, “Also cigarettes and something that won’t bore me to death.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s reply came fast. “Aye aye, Captain.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look back, but she could hear the grin in Rio’s voice, and it made her want to roll her eyes. She dropped into the empty chair at the end of the dock and let herself sink into it with an exaggerated huff. Crossing her arms tightly, she pulled the cap lower over her eyes like a curtain.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t smiling.</p><p> </p><p>And if she was, Rio didn’t get to see it. Neither did the fish.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio had returned earlier, barefoot and smug, with a fresh cup of coffee in one hand. Between her fingers that held the cup, she had Agatha’s old purple lighter and a pack of American Spirits. Under her arm was a crossword puzzle book with only a few pages filled in, and she had a dull pencil tucked between her teeth. She didn’t say anything, just handed Agatha the coffee first, then the cigarettes and lighter, then set the crossword and pencil in her lap.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t thank her. She took a sip from the coffee, set it carefully on the little table in between the two chairs, and reached for the carton. Her fingers fumbled slightly as she tried to worked one cigarette free without crushing it, not looking up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned down.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t register it until it was already happening- until she felt the press of lips against her cheek, warm and solid and irritatingly casual. It was quick. Barely a pause in her movement.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held still for a beat too long. She didn’t think she’d ever get used to that. Her body didn’t know where to file the feeling. Years ago, this would’ve been unthinkable. And now? Now Rio kissed her on the cheek in broad daylight and went back to rigging a purple rubber worm like they were an old married couple who did this every summer.</p><p> </p><p>All she could do was sit there for a moment longer than necessary, staring at the carton of cigarettes in her hand as she tried not to let herself sit in that thought too long. She blinked, pulled the cigarette free, lit it with her old lighter, took a long drag, and stared out at the lake instead.</p><p> </p><p>The bait situation, at least, was less offensive than expected. Agatha had been braced for worms. Actual, wriggling, nightmare fuel worms. But Rio, apparently, had the decency -or the self-preservation- to use soft plastics instead. Some kind of fake worm, rubbery and purple with flecks of glitter in it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her thread it onto the hook with practiced fingers, rigged so it wouldn’t catch on the brush at the bottom, and tried very hard not to look impressed.</p><p> </p><p>Now, Agatha was sunk into the chair with one foot tucked beneath her. A cigarette in one hand and the pencil in the other, the crossword book open across her legs. The ashtray and her coffee sat on the small table between the chairs, along with her lighter and the pack of Spirits. She wasn’t paying attention to the puzzle.</p><p> </p><p>She took a drag and let the smoke sit in her chest before exhaling, eyes narrowing in on the curve of Rio’s ass as she shifted her weight and cast the line clean into the water. It wasn’t Agatha’s fault. Rio had worn those shorts -intentionally, Agatha was sure- and Agatha, being only human, took it as an open invitation. So she looked. Thoroughly.</p><p> </p><p>“I can feel you staring at my ass,” Rio said, without looking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunted. She took another drag, her elbow propped on the armrest, cigarette between two fingers. She turned her head to exhale the smoke into the air. “I hope you don’t catch a single fucking fish,” she said, flicking the ash into the tray.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed like that didn’t bother her at all. She reeled in a little, her eyes still on the water. She looked relaxed. Self satisfied. Stupidly pretty in the sun.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Twelve across,” she said aloud, voice flat but just loud enough to carry. “‘Too bright. Four letters.’”</p><p> </p><p>She knew the answer. She’d known it before she even finished reading it. She just wanted to hear Rio try. Wanted her to talk. Wanted to keep her voice in the air.</p><p> </p><p>There was a pause. Agatha didn’t have to look to know what Rio was doing. She could picture the way Rio tilted her head, tongue pressed into the inside of her cheek, overthinking it.</p><p> </p><p>“Flash?” Rio offered, casual.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a noncommittal noise. “Four letters, babe. Try again.”</p><p> </p><p>She glanced up as she said it and caught the exact moment Rio’s head turned -just slightly, not all the way- like she needed to make sure she’d heard that right. Agatha could see her ear, the edge of her jaw, nothing more. Rio didn’t say anything at first. She just turned back to the water and cast again, smoother this time.</p><p> </p><p>“Noon,” Rio said, no hesitation. She could hear the small smile in Rio’s voice.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked to herself, took another drag, and filled it in without responding.</p><p> </p><p>The rod tip twitched. Rio shifted her grip, reeled in a little quicker, muttering something under her breath that Agatha couldn’t make out.</p><p> </p><p>“If you pull out a fish, I’m going inside,” Agatha said, blowing smoke from her lips as she kept her eyes on the page.</p><p> </p><p>“If I pull out a fish,” Rio said, adjusting her stance, “you’re going to be extremely impressed and possibly a little turned on.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t answer. She heard the snap of the rod, the sharp pullback as Rio set the hook, and then the line surged tight.</p><p> </p><p>That was enough to pull her attention. She glanced up just in time to see the water break - brown flash, hard splash- and the fish lifting out of it, thrashing mid air. Rio didn’t panic. She kept tension on the line, reeled in fast and steady, moved her feet to shift with it, and dragged the thing closer to the dock with her mouth set and eyes narrowed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat upright without meaning to.</p><p> </p><p>The fish hit the deck of the dock with a heavy thud, tail slapping the boards once, twice, before Rio kneeled down and pinned it with one hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up, grinning, out of breath and completely pleased with herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the fish. Then at Rio. Then back at the fish.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped the pencil into the open crossword book and reached into her pocket for her phone. Rio crouched over the flapping mess of a fish, muttering to herself as she worked the hook free. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her fingers grip and adjust,  Rio pulled back slightly, avoiding a fresh spray of lake water to the face as the fish flopped aggressively.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it?” Agatha asked, mildly horrified, though she didn’t look away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t glance up. “Dinner eligible.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, stubbed out her cigarette in the tray, and opened the camera on her phone.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a bass,” Rio clarified, one hand now gripping the base of the fish’s tail, the other pinching its jaw open between thumb and forefinger. The damn thing was huge- thick through the middle, brown-green with a dull shimmer, and long enough that it nearly spanned the width of Rio’s torso.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a face. “Cool. Now throw it back in before I go inside.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed -half amusement, half disbelief- and turned the fish to face Agatha. “You want to give it a kiss?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck no,” Agatha snapped. She lifted her phone and took a picture. Then another. The second had Rio posing with her teeth bared. Fish angled to show off the body. Agatha caught herself smirking as she snapped a third, this time with Rio pretending to kiss the thing’s open mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood, fish still in hand, and looked back at her. “Admit it. You’re impressed.”</p><p> </p><p>She tossed it back into the lake before Agatha could answer, the splash echoing across the water. When she turned again, she was smiling- broad and bright, cheeks high with satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried not to smile back. She failed. “Definitely wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm.” Rio stepped toward her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sank back into her chair and kicked her leg out, bare foot stopping Rio mid step. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” A warning. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands raised in mock surrender, but she didn’t stop. She only moved forward until her stomach pressed fully into Agatha’s foot. “I’ll let you decide,” Rio said, and the smirk blooming on her face was all edge, all intent, something so deeply familiar it could have broken Agatha apart. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wanted to play.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her foot drag downward, slow and unhurried, tracing over Rio’s stomach. Her heel caught at the waistband of Rio’s jean shorts, folding the fabric just enough to expose a sliver of skin. She kept going, dragging her foot lower until the ball of it pressed against Rio’s front, Agatha added just enough pressure to make a point.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin stretched wider. “So,” she said, drawing it out, “either you get bass slime all over you-”</p><p> </p><p>“Or?” Agatha prompted.</p><p> </p><p>“Or,” Rio repeated and leaned into Agatha’s foot slightly, voice dropping to something quieter. Something not meant for anyone but Agatha. “Go on a date with me tonight.” She paused, eyes still teasing, but there was something softer tucked under it now.</p><p> </p><p>For a second, everything went still.</p><p> </p><p>“I feel like I should say you do have the choice to say no and not get slimed. But I don’t want you to,” Rio added. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s foot fell away from Rio’s body. It hit the dock with a soft thud, but it sounded louder than it should have.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows lifted slightly, her hands still hovering somewhere between flirtation and defense. She didn’t say anything else.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha- God, Agatha hated her.</p><p> </p><p>She hated Rio so much in that moment she could barely hold herself still. Hated that Rio had the nerve to look at her like that, with fish slime probably still drying on her shirt, with that crooked little smile still warm from the sun and absolutely full of herself. She hated that Rio made her laugh. Made her smile without meaning to. Had made Agatha consider, even for one fucking second, that she would be happy for the rest of her miserable fucking life as long as Rio was standing in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>And- well. She’ll deny it later. She’ll scrub it from her memory and pretend it never crossed her mind. She’ll push it back behind her ribs where it’s lived quietly for years, where it waits for her to acknowledge it and hopes she never will.</p><p> </p><p>But this is the part Agatha never ever had the balls to admit- except to <em> you.  </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> Yes, you. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> You’ve been here this whole time, haven’t you? Sitting behind a screen, breath held, waiting to see how this would go.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> So let’s not lie to each other now. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness, in this exact moment, was entirely, devastatingly, painfully in love with the woman standing in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Obviously.</p><p> </p><p>It had been there for nearly two decades. Unnamed, unspoken, coiled beneath every conversation and every silence between them. She’d buried it until it built like sediment over the years, layer after layer, until you forget where it started and only know weight it leaves behind. Agatha had been carrying it forever, pretending she wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>And now, here it was. The thing Agatha had always refused to name, standing barefoot on a dock with lake water and fish slime dripping from her hands and asking, so plainly, for something Agatha could no longer pretend she didn’t want.</p><p> </p><p><em> This part </em> -no matter how much Agatha might try to rewrite it later- <em> will always remain true. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked once. Hard. She could lie, if she wanted to. She was good at that. Could laugh it off. Could scoff and make some snide remark and go inside and pretend none of this ever happened.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio Vidal was still here. Still standing. Still asking. Still trying. There was a slight indent where she bit against the inside of her cheek- barely noticeable, but Agatha knew it was there. Her brown eyes were wide, nervous, trying not to be.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha -despite herself, because of herself, maybe always for herself- was done pretending.</p><p> </p><p>“I hate you,” Agatha breathed.</p><p> </p><p>It came out so soft it barely qualified as a sentence. It had no venom behind it. No sarcasm. Just breath and longing disguised in old habits. It was full of everything she didn’t want to say and everything she couldn’t stop feeling.</p><p> </p><p>It was so full of shit. And Agatha had never been any good at saying what she meant.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face softened instantly, like she could feel every cracked open part of Agatha behind those words. There was something steady in her expression now, something tender. Something that had been waiting a long time. She lowered her hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Go on a date with me, Agatha,” Rio said again, quieter this time. There was no teasing in it. No smirk. It wasn’t for her own sake anymore. She wasn’t asking to win. It wasn’t a performance.</p><p> </p><p>It was just her. Just Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, tried to speak, found nothing. Then she exhaled, “Why the hell not.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled then- so wide she looked like she might combust, and then she tried to hide it, like she didn’t want to scare Agatha off. She nodded once, bit the corner of her lip like she needed somewhere to put her joy. Then she pointed at Agatha, squinted one eye like she was lining up a shot.</p><p> </p><p>“Fishing impressed you,” Rio said. “You like fishing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost choked. “Shut the fuck up.”</p><p> </p><p>“No. I don’t think I will.”</p><p> </p><p>“I will throw you in the lake.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, you won’t,” Rio said, stepping in again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t stop her this time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio knelt slowly in front of her, lowering herself with a sure confidence. She sat back on her heels and placed her hands gently on the armrests of Agatha’s chair. She didn’t lean forward. She didn’t reach. She just waited.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifted forward until she was close enough to see every flicker of expression on Rio’s face. She reached out, brushing a piece of hair behind Rio’s ear, and felt her lean into her touch without hesitation. So Agatha slid her fingers back through her hair, threading it slowly until her hand rested at the base of Rio’s skull.</p><p> </p><p>She tugged gently enough to pull a sound from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed. Entirely breathless, delighted, wicked. </p><p> </p><p>“I won’t?” Agatha asked, her voice low.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed, and she tilted her chin up just enough for their mouths to touch, for the softest press of their lips.</p><p> </p><p> “You won’t,” Rio muttered, against her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her world tilt sideways.</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t,” Agatha whispered back, and kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio responded with her whole body. Her lips parted instantly, a whimper fell from her mouth, her hands still gripping the arms of the chair like she might collapse without them. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed Rio like she meant it, like she had never meant anything more. She brought her other hand up to Rio’s cheek. Tilted Rio’s head, controlled the depth, let her thumb press firmly into the hollow of her cheek, her other hand still tangled in Rio’s hair. </p><p> </p><p>She kissed Rio to claim her. To mark every inch of Rio’s mouth with her name.</p><p> </p><p><em> Mine, </em>Agatha thought.</p><p> </p><p>They broke for air, their foreheads pressed together, chests rising with the same breath. Rio turned her head just enough to kiss the corner of Agatha’s mouth, then nodded like she was answering a question.</p><p> </p><p>“Yours,” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio’s mouth was everywhere- her cheek, her jaw, her throat, all the places Agatha had never known she so desperately needed to be kissed by Rio. Agatha closed her eyes and let her. Let Rio’s mouth find every inch. Let the truth live in that silence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her way back up to her mouth, slow and firm, like she was steering Agatha into something that had always belonged to both of them. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her eyes just long enough to let Rio see it. The answer was there. She nodded. It was all she could give. It was everything.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe Rio could read her mind, or maybe Agatha had whispered it into her mouth. Maybe it was written across her skin by now. Maybe it had always been there.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t matter.</p><p> </p><p>There was only one word left in her.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had already showered. Now she was curled in the middle of the bed in an old, oversized t-shirt, legs tangled in the blankets, scrolling idly through the New York Times app on her phone, pretending she wasn’t waiting for the bathroom door to open.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t entirely sure what they were doing tonight.</p><p> </p><p>A date. It was a date. And Agatha, in her infinite wisdom and emotional grace, was handling that news with the calm, measured stability of someone not at all in denial.</p><p> </p><p>Which meant she was refusing to think too hard about it. That was easier, honestly. Especially when she could convince herself that not much between them had really changed.</p><p> </p><p>Sure, they were now having sex. With feelings, probably. Sort of.</p><p> </p><p>But everything else was the same. Still Rio. Still Agatha. Still a connection between them that made sense in a way nothing else had in her entire life.</p><p> </p><p>They could talk or not talk. Sit in silence. Fall asleep near each other. Bicker. Laugh. Touch. That had always been easy.</p><p> </p><p>Now they were just fucking. That was the only new variable. And it had slotted itself in almost too easily.</p><p> </p><p>So she wasn’t spiraling. Agatha was fine.</p><p> </p><p>To keep herself from doing anything stupid -like thinking too hard about the outfit she’d already hung in the closet, the one she very deliberately packed a day ago under the guise of practicality- she focused instead on the NYT app, which had become her newest form of quiet masochism. She hadn’t brought that outfit because she thought she’d be going on a date. Obviously not. It was just... a possibility. Something she threw in last minute. Just in case.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had already played Wordle and had gotten it in three guesses. The Mini crossword had taken her longer than it should have, and she wasn’t proud of it. Now she was playing Spelling Bee, the game where they gave you seven letters in a little honeycomb and asked you to build as many words as you could out of them, always including the center letter. She’d made it to “Amazing,” but hadn’t reached “Genius,” and it was pissing her off more than she’d admit.</p><p> </p><p>Still, it gave Agatha something to do while she waited for Rio to stop being attractive in a shower out of her line of sight.</p><p> </p><p>The bathroom connected to this room and another, one of those weird Jack-and-Jill setups. Agatha had learned pretty quickly that neither room was meant for guests. Only Rio and Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Which was all to say: Agatha very clearly heard the water shut off about ten minutes ago through the door and now Rio was brushing her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>So when her phone buzzed and a notification banner popped up with <b>Rio Vidal sent a photo</b>, she barely reacted.</p><p> </p><p>Probably a meme. Maybe even her Wordle score, though Agatha was pretty sure Rio hadn’t played yet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tapped the notification open.</p><p> </p><p>And she was immediately proven wrong.</p><p> </p><p>So incredibly, devastatingly, violently wrong.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw slackened and the English language narrowed itself down to a very small pool of vocabulary, none of which she was proud of.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Boobs. Nipples. Boobs. Rio’s boobs. Nipples. Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>A picture of Rio’s chest. Just her chest. Just boobs. Perfectly, carelessly centered in the frame. The photo was angled slightly, Rio had one arm raised -brushing her teeth still, presumably- while the other held the phone out, snapping the picture. Her face wasn’t in it. Just skin. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Shoulders. Collarbones. Boobs. Nipples. Naked. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could still hear Rio humming faintly, probably doing one of her annoying routines where she counted how long she brushed each quadrant of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>And here was Agatha, blinking down at a full screen, high quality image of Rio’s bare tits. Sent with zero context.</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth watered and her pulse hammered like it had somewhere to be. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had no idea how long she’d been ogling the photo. It could’ve been thirty seconds or five entire minutes; time had collapsed into one long, boiling loop of <em> boobs, nipples, Rio.  </em></p><p> </p><p>She was still staring -phone inches from her face- when the bathroom door creaked open. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha startled so hard she nearly threw the phone across the room. Instead, she slammed it facedown against her stomach like she’d been caught doing something illegal.</p><p> </p><p>Which was ridiculous. Because <em> Rio </em> had sent the photo. <em> Rio </em> had started this.</p><p> </p><p>But that didn’t matter now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked out of the bathroom with a confidence that made Agatha want to scream. She was wrapped in a towel, skin still dewy from the shower, hair wet and tucked behind her ears. She looked radiant. Effortless. Unbothered. And when she looked over at Agatha and she greeted her with a single breathless, “Hey.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. Couldn’t, really.</p><p> </p><p>She was too busy tracking Rio’s every step to form a coherent thought. Rio crossed the room, made her way to her duffle bag near the dresser, and bent slightly as she unzipped it, digging through it. Agatha watched her pull out a worn t-shirt and underwear, then straighten back up- and without the slightest pause, without even looking in her direction, Rio unwrapped the towel from around her body and let it fall to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s soul left her body.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t just the view. It was the ease of it. The casualness. The <em> audacity </em>. Rio wasn’t flaunting anything. She simply existed, comfortable in her skin, wholly aware of what that skin did to Agatha and absolutely not acknowledging it.</p><p> </p><p>Every inch of Rio’s body was accounted for. The hickey’s Agatha had left stood out in shades of red and plum, scattered across her chest, the line of her jaw, the slope of her throat. Her ears -ears Agatha had pierced- were on full display, wet hair tucked neatly behind them. Her thighs flexed as she stepped into a pair of underwear. She looked calm. Soft in the golden light of the room.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was sure that if she weren’t so stunned, she’d be barking. Foaming at the mouth. Chewing the bedframe. Instead, she just stared in total silence. She could barely remember how to blink.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned away from the dresser and hung the towel neatly on the closet door handle, still gloriously, obscenely topless. Then she pulled the t-shirt over her head as she started walking toward the bed.</p><p> </p><p>She was saying something, Agatha had seen her mouth moving, but none of it registered. Words floated in one ear and out the other. All she could hear was static. All she could see was Rio’s hips, the hem of the t-shirt sliding down her torso.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t moved. Her phone was still pressed on her stomach, screen face down now, though the picture was permanently burned into her retinas.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was approaching, still talking, still pretending like she hadn’t just turned Agatha into a fucking disaster with one photo and a towel drop.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, to her credit, was doing everything in her power not to explode.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” she asked, blinking out of her trance just as Rio climbed onto the bed and settled into a cross legged position, facing her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, eyes dropping down to where Agatha’s phone was still clutched protectively to her stomach. Agatha could see the realization hit her. Watched it travel across her face in real time- She pulled her lips into her mouth, worked her jaw as if physically chewing back the smirk already trying to form, and then looked back up at Agatha with an expression so falsely innocent it practically screamed <em> caught you </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio cleared her throat, still biting down a smile. “Okay,” she said. “I have two options you can choose from for tonight. Or, if you’re still impressed by the end of the night, maybe we can make it a two-part thing. Carry it into tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The date.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked slowly, her pulse stuttering as the words sank in all over again. <em> They were going on a date. </em> She’d already made peace with the word internally. Sort of. Just that hearing Rio say it out loud, casually pitching date plans like they did this all the time, knocked the breath from her lungs in the stupidest possible way.</p><p> </p><p>She forced herself to swallow, tried to ignore the way her eyes kept locking onto Rio’s mouth, and finally asked, “What’d you have in mind?” Her voice came out low, slightly hoarse, and she narrowed her eyes at Rio’s lips like maybe if she squinted hard enough, she’d be able to look literally fucking anywhere else. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t comment on it. She just shrugged and said, “Well, there’s a place in town we could go for dinner. Or, if you’re feeling brave, I know a good trail. We could go on a hike.”</p><p> </p><p>Neither option sounded terrible. In fact, the idea of hiking -which would’ve been an automatic <em> no </em> any other time- surprised her with how not-awful it sounded. She hadn’t been to the gym in weeks, which she was pretending was due to her schedule and not the fact that she was now apparently obsessed with skipping every adult responsibility in favor of playing house with an infuriating brunette who had a gap between her teeth and knew exactly how to use it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to tell Rio to just choose whichever she preferred but Rio, naturally, beat her to it.</p><p> </p><p>“Just so you know,” Rio said, still maddeningly casual, “if you pick the hike, it’s actually the law that I, Rio Vidal, am legally required to check your butthole after.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Why the fuck would you need to check my butthole?”</p><p> </p><p>“For ticks.”</p><p> </p><p>“I can check my own goddamn butthole.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised a hand, feigning apology. “I don’t think that’s how it works, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m pretty sure that’s exactly how it works. You just want to see my butthole.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s an added bonus,” Rio agreed, nodding like she was being generous, “to saving you from potential Lyme disease. Which, by the way, is very serious.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not checking my asshole for ticks.”</p><p> </p><p>“Dinner it is, then.” Rio’s grin stretched wide, goofy and entirely pleased with herself, like she’d known from the start which option would win but still wanted to play it out.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha looked at her with a stunned little smile she didn’t bother hiding.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t just the conversation, or the nude, or the fact that Rio was somehow making a date feel like a game instead of a trap. It was the way she asked. The way she didn’t force it. The way she sat there, patient and smug and open, like she’d keep sitting there no matter what Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>And somewhere in the middle of it all -this conversation, this day, this date, this cursed offer of anal pest inspection- Agatha had the dreadful realization:</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t going to be able to walk away from this.</p><p> </p><p>Not now. Not tomorrow. Probably not ever.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They were sitting on the patio of a restaurant tucked just off the main stretch in town, nothing flashy, just wood framed windows and a gravel lot out back, but the view was perfect- overlooking the lake, the sun was dipping just low enough that the water was caught in that in between color like the light couldn’t decide whether to stay or go. There were trees lining the far edge of the water, their tops still lit while the base had already gone to shadow, and somewhere across the way, live music was playing somewhere faintly, though it was impossible to tell from where. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat with one leg crossed neatly over the other, dressed in brown corduroy from shoulder to ankle. The vest was snug across her ribs, the matching pants fit too well for her to pretend she hadn’t planned it. She had one hand resting on the rim of her glass of whiskey even though she hadn’t taken a sip in a while.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was leaned back in her chair, cigarette burning between two fingers. Her white shirt was unbuttoned low, collar loose, the edge of a black bralette visible beneath. Her gray slacks were loose through the leg, cinched just right at the hips with a black belt. She didn’t look like someone who had scrambled off the couch earlier that evening and just stared, open mouthed, when Agatha walked into the room. But Agatha remembered. She was still thinking about it.</p><p> </p><p>The food was long gone, the plates cleared. The last of Rio’s beer sat untouched in front of her. Rio took a drag from her cigarette, then nodded to herself like she’d been thinking something over for a while.</p><p> </p><p>“Give me a stack of hand x-rays and I know that I could pick yours out of a lineup.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked slowly, then shifted in her chair, “You absolutely could not.”</p><p> </p><p>“I absolutely could,” Rio said, dead serious. “Easily. Fastest round of Guess Who you would ever see.”</p><p> </p><p>“How often are you staring at my hands to make you that confident?” Agatha asked, slightly amused.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned around her cigarette. “Very often.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a sip of her whiskey and narrowed her eyes across the table. “You’re out of your mind.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. Just exhaled a breath of smoke into the air, like she’d been waiting for that accusation.</p><p> </p><p>“No. I’m observant.”</p><p> </p><p>The way she said it was maddening- completely casual, like she wasn’t about to start listing things no sane person should’ve noticed.</p><p> </p><p>“I know how you move them,” Rio went on, gesturing faintly toward Agatha’s hand without actually pointing. “How you talk with them. How you flex your wrists after pulling gloves off.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her. “You spend way too much time watching me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Your pointer finger curls in when you’re trying not to interrupt someone,” Rio continued, tapping ash into the tray without looking away. “And the way you hold a beer bottle? Completely psychotic. Like you’re trying to break its neck-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cut in, fast and annoyed on purpose. “Okay, creep.”</p><p> </p><p>She’d heard enough. Because whatever Rio was doing… it was working.</p><p> </p><p>“I take images of people’s bones for a living and pretend I don’t have opinions about them, Agatha. Hundreds of hands, <em> at least </em>. You think I don’t know what makes yours different?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, “I think you’re not a radiologist.”</p><p> </p><p>“I never claimed I could read them or diagnose you,” Rio replied, grinning. “I just said I would know which ones were yours.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a flicker of something in Agatha’s chest- irritation or heat or whatever the hell counted as foreplay when it came to Rio. Agatha rolled her eyes, mostly at herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Am I not supposed to find that deeply unsettling?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, already calling her bluff. “You don’t.” She stubbed out her cigarette, then leaned forward onto her elbows, arms crossed as she eyed Agatha with a smirk. It curved slow, settled easy on her mouth, like she’d been waiting all night to use it.</p><p> </p><p>And unfortunately, Rio was right. Agatha didn’t find it unsettling. She found it stupidly hot... and a little impressive. Which was worse.</p><p> </p><p>“You think it’s impressive,” Rio said, voice quiet and sure.</p><p> </p><p>“I really don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Lie. A dumb, fat fucking lie.</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed a laugh. She sat back in her chair like she had time, eyes tracking the hand Agatha had wrapped around her glass. They lingered too long. Her gaze paused at her ring finger. Then her knuckles. Then back to Agatha’s face, where something in her eyes darkened just slightly.</p><p> </p><p>She nodded. “Okay, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held Rio’s gaze. She pressed one finger to the rim of her glass and dragged it around in a slow, full circle.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t talk much on the walk over, but Rio stayed close- closer than she needed to be. Her arm brushed against Agatha’s once, then again, until she finally gave in and let her fingers skim along the back of her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha noticed. She kept her gaze forward, but her hand shifted just slightly, falling into a more open position between them. It wasn’t dramatic. Barely anything. But it was enough- an invitation disguised as nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio caught it. She didn’t make a show of it, just let her fingers ease into the space Agatha had left for her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t pull away. She adjusted her grip, subtle and quick, and kept walking like nothing had changed.</p><p> </p><p>When they reached the bar, Rio let go to open the door. Agatha stepped inside without looking back, and didn’t bother hiding the small, satisfied curve of her mouth as she passed.</p><p> </p><p>The pool table in the back was open. She headed straight for it.</p><p> </p><p>One thing about Agatha Harkness- she was one competitive motherfucker.</p><p> </p><p>Not in a charming, good sport way. She played to win, played to ruin people a little. Rio used to call it fun until Agatha started running the table and pretending it wasn’t personal. It always was. That was the point.</p><p> </p><p>They used to play at shitty dive bars, mostly back in Westview, mostly after too many drinks. The tables were always uneven. The cues were warped. Someone would put on bad music and sing along. Rio would flirt with strangers and pretend not to watch Agatha play. Agatha would pretend not to notice any of it. They were best friends. It was fine.</p><p> </p><p>Pool had helped. It gave her something to focus on. Something to control. Angles, geometry, force- it was reliable in a way people weren’t. If she played hard enough, she didn’t have to think about the way Rio would hover just behind her during a shot, close enough to breathe on her neck. Or how she'd laugh every time Agatha called a ball and made an entirely different one, then claimed it counted anyway.</p><p> </p><p>It had been easier back then. Not simple. Never that. But easier.</p><p> </p><p>Now it was different, and they both knew it. Because they weren’t twenty-three anymore, and Agatha wasn’t pretending she didn’t notice things. They’d slept together. They were on a date. The air between them wasn’t suggestive- it was dense. Familiar. Worn-in in a way that made her want to pace herself and speed up at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>Which is exactly why Agatha had suggested pool after dinner. Because she needed rules. She needed a space she could bend and twist back into something familiar. She needed something to win at.</p><p> </p><p>Because this wasn’t neutral anymore. Rio wasn’t flirting with strangers. Agatha wasn’t pretending not to look. They were here, together, and whatever this was -whatever it was turning into- had already passed the point of denial.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha picked up the cue, checked the balance, and chalked it with more force than necessary. She didn’t ask if Rio wanted to break. She never used to, and she wasn’t about to start now.</p><p> </p><p>If she could control the game, maybe she wouldn’t have to think about how badly she wanted to lose the rest of it.</p><p> </p><p>She broke hard, sent two solids in and pretended she hadn’t lined it up that way on purpose. Rio didn’t comment, just sipped her beer and wandered around the table like she wasn’t watching her every move. That had always been the worst part- Rio never made it obvious when she was paying attention. She just <em> was </em>. Present in a way that made it hard to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha called her next shot with a confidence that she knew would piss Rio off. Corner pocket, seven ball. She sank it clean and kept walking, didn’t give Rio the satisfaction of a look.</p><p> </p><p>The truth was, she could feel her. Just to her left. Not close enough to touch, but enough to track. Like heat.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio wasn’t saying anything. No joke. No smug comment. Not even a smirk. Just quiet, and the sound of Agatha’s cue cutting the table, and whatever the hell this night was becoming pressing in between shots.</p><p> </p><p> Rio stepped up and took her shot without lining it up properly. The ball clacked off the rail and missed by a mile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at her, suspicious. Rio just shrugged like she hadn’t just tanked on purpose.</p><p> </p><p>“Your turn.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and leaned over the table to line up her next shot. She’d barely settled her stance when Rio, far too casually, spoke from just behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you like the nude I sent you earlier?”</p><p> </p><p>Her cue slipped. The shot went wide, clumsy and nowhere near what she’d called.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha straightened slowly. She didn’t turn around, but she didn’t have to. She could feel Rio grinning behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re the worst,” Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t deny it. She just stepped past her to line up her next shot, mouth twitching with barely contained satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t answer the question.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was busy.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sank a shot without looking. “That’s not a no.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She stood just beside Rio and leaned back against the pool table. Rio had gone soft around the mouth, the way she always did when she was proud of herself and trying not to show it. It was irritating.</p><p> </p><p>And hot.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached out, sliding her hand across Rio’s chest to the back of her neck. She gave the gentlest tug.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved without question. She let go of the cue, then she turned. Stepped into Agatha like gravity demanded it- hands slipping around her waist, bodies fitting together as if they’d always known how.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand slid down from Rio’s neck to rest against her chest, barely pressing, fidgeting with a button on Rio’s shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Seventeen years, and she was finally allowed to reach for her.</p><p> </p><p>“You remember that Halloween,” Agatha murmured, “when you made me promise to go as <em> Little Shop of Horrors </em> characters?”</p><p> </p><p>“You mean the year you said you found the perfect Audrey II costume for me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a breath of laughter. “You were so pissed.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was pissed! You made me wear a giant foam flower on my head,” Rio said defensively. “Bright pink. And a leaf necklace. I looked like a depressed toddler in a school play.”</p><p> </p><p>“You refused to sit down the whole night,” Agatha laughed harder.</p><p> </p><p>“Because I had no peripheral vision in that thing! People kept bumping into me. I swear one guy tried to use me as a photo prop.”</p><p> </p><p>“You hissed at him.”</p><p> </p><p>“He touched my petals!”</p><p> </p><p>“You still wore it,” Agatha said, quiet now. Her hand moved again, smoothing over the front of Rio’s shirt without purpose, without thinking.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grip around her waist tightened slightly.</p><p> </p><p>She shrugged. “You asked me to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, eyes flicking between Rio’s mouth and the place where their bodies touched. “You’d wear it again, wouldn’t you,” she said softly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. She leaned in, slow, pressing her cheek to Agatha’s until her mouth was near Agatha’s ear. Her hands shifted slightly at Agatha’s waist, thumbs brushing once against her sides.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved without thinking- her arm slipping around Rio’s shoulders, holding her there. </p><p> </p><p>“If you asked me to,” Rio said quietly. Like there was no version of the world where Rio wouldn’t say yes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha breathed out through her nose, barely a sound.</p><p> </p><p>She felt Rio smile against her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back, just enough to see Agatha.  Their noses nearly brushed. Her hands stayed right where they were, thumbs hooked soft against Agatha’s sides, like stepping away any further wasn’t an option she wanted to consider.</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look away. She stood still and let herself be seen. Whatever had lived between them all these years, it was no longer hidden behind timing or pride. She held it in place. Let Rio look at it.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio moved.</p><p> </p><p>There was no lead in, no sharp breath, no shift in posture that warned Agatha. Just the decision, and then the follow through. Her mouth found Agatha’s like it had always known where to go.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her eyes close without meaning to. She inhaled through her nose, startled by how much she felt all at once. Her arm tightened slightly around Rio’s shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>The kiss was soft. Warm. Her own lips parted beneath Rio’s mouth, breath catching. She kissed her back, gently at first, then with a little more certainty, tilting her head just enough to let it deepen.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio pulled back, it was only by an inch. Agatha stayed where she was. Heart unsteady. Mouth tingling. Rio’s forehead brushed Agatha’s, their noses nearly touching, both of them still breathing the same air.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice came quiet, almost fond. “It’s still your turn.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled- small, crooked, a little stunned. “Right,” she said, like she’d genuinely forgotten. She lingered for just a moment longer, hands moving once more along Agatha’s side before she stepped back. She picked up her cue again, leaned down to line up her next shot.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>She watched her instead- the way Rio’s brow creased slightly in concentration, the subtle tilt of her wrist, the way her back curved just enough to remind her how many times she’d imagined this exact view under different circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice came quieter than she meant. “You don’t think this is moving too fast?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look up. “I would’ve married you yesterday if I knew you’d let me,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Then: the soft thud of the cue striking the cue ball, a crisp crack as it hit the others, and the echoing clatter as two balls dropped into pockets.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped her head toward Rio, eyes wide.</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t just say shit like that,” Agatha snapped, before she could help herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood up slowly, turned toward her, and angled her body into Agatha’s space. She shrugged, that same insufferable smirk tugging at her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Rio offered, clearly not.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not,” Agatha said, sharper. “You’re just fucking with me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “You want to go to the courthouse and test that theory?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went completely still. Because the courthouse was obviously closed. Because Rio wasn’t serious.</p><p> </p><p>Except maybe she was.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that was the worst part. Not the kiss. Not the smirk. Not even how easily Rio still got under her skin after all this time. It was the way she said it- like she meant it. Like she’d follow through without thinking twice.</p><p> </p><p>It was the fact that Agatha almost let her.</p><p> </p><p>Just to see what Rio would do. Just to see if she'd really go through with it or if she'd squirm, or laugh, or take it back the second Agatha said yes.</p><p> </p><p>Because if Rio didn’t… if she actually meant it…</p><p> </p><p>Well. Then Agatha was in much deeper shit than she thought.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Just as Agatha was about to open her mouth, maybe to say something deeply, irrevocably stupid, or maybe nothing at all and just meet Rio’s lips with her own, fully open-</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>A phone rang.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The sound pulled her back too fast to reality. Agatha’s mouth snapped shut. She turned her head, cleared her throat, and said, “That’s yours.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>A second ago, Rio had been looking at Agatha with a smile forming- barely restrained, wild with hope. Agatha had seen it begin in the corner of her mouth, that shift from playful to something devastatingly real. A smile that would bare teeth, and with it, adoration. Maybe even something Agatha wouldn’t name.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Then the ringtone came, and Rio’s mouth faltered. Annoyance flickered in her features but she didn’t turn away from Agatha. She didn’t even reach for her phone.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“What were you going to say?” Rio asked. She stepped in closer. One hand reached out, resting gently over Agatha’s on the edge of the pool table. The other still loosely held her cue, forgotten at her side.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She looked down at their hands instead. Her thumb shifted, resting over the back of Rio’s hand where it covered hers. She brushed against it once.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Your phone’s ringing, Rio,” Agatha murmured, her voice barely audible.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“I don’t care,” Rio said. “What were you going to say?”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Her brown eyes flicked to Agatha’s mouth -brief, no more than a heartbeat- and then back again. There was no teasing in it. No feigned casualness. Only a certainty that always threatened to take Agatha’s breath away.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>And Rio had to stop doing that. Looking at Agatha like that. So directly. So intently. As if nothing in the world mattered more than whatever might fall from Agatha’s lips.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Because if Rio didn’t stop, Agatha might actually speak.</p><p> </p><p>And if she spoke, if Agatha gave any part of it a voice, it wouldn’t stop there. Every single secret she’d denied long enough to almost believe was true would spill from her mouth, and fall straight into Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>The phone finally stopped ringing.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, soft, but with more spine this time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t. Not like this. She couldn’t let herself speak something into the open that she hadn’t even admitted in the privacy of her own mind. Even if, in truth, she couldn’t remember a single version of herself that hadn’t, on some fundamental level, already belonged to the woman standing next to her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio opened her mouth, maybe to press again, maybe to fill the silence with something gentler-</p><p> </p><p>When her phone started ringing again. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, to her shame and relief, exhaled.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled too, but it wasn’t relief- not like Agatha’s had been. She set her cue gently on the table, then reached into her pocket for her phone. Rather than pulling away, she shifted closer, aligning herself alongside Agatha, leaning in like regret only came when you left too much room for it.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, who no longer had the stomach to be needlessly cruel, let her.</p><p> </p><p>More than that, she moved and let her hand settle at the small of Rio’s back, fingers curling into the waistband of her slacks. A silent reassurance. Agatha didn’t want Rio to think she was running away from her. She wasn’t. She was only trying to outrun her own thoughts. But Rio? She couldn’t leave her behind. Not again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at the screen of Rio’s phone.</p><p> </p><p>It was a FaceTime call from Sage. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught the moment Rio’s face softened- barely, but enough to register. And she felt her heart twitch at the sight of it. There was something about seeing Rio worn slightly thin but still soft where it mattered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Sage hadn’t grown up together. That much Agatha knew. But somewhere along the way, they’d decided it didn’t matter. They’d chosen each other, and the shape of that choice was obvious in ways Rio probably didn’t realize she was giving away.</p><p> </p><p>And even with that flicker of fondness, the edge of irritation still lingered on Rio’s face. She obviously hadn’t wanted to be interrupted. </p><p> </p><p>Rio slid her thumb across the screen to answer, and Agatha instinctively tilted her head just out of its frame, even as her eyes stayed on the screen.</p><p> </p><p>The first thing that appeared was Sage’s forehead, unbothered and oblivious, until she heard the sound of the call connecting. Then her eyes darted toward the camera. The phone jolted as she yanked it closer, her face suddenly filling the screen.</p><p> </p><p>She looked furious.</p><p> </p><p>“You dirty little whore,” Sage hissed. “How dare-”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want?” Rio snapped. Then she winced, as if hearing herself in real time. She glanced over at Agatha and flushed, suddenly embarrassed at how fast she’d gone full older sister mode. Rio pulled the phone closer to her face, teeth clenched, and hissed, “I’m busy.” Then glanced at Agatha again and back at the camera.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s jaw dropped. She let out a few breathless, incredulous huffs.“Yeah? Well <em> I’m </em> busy too,” Sage snapped back. “You’re at <em> Bee’s </em>lake house -without me, which is already bullshit- while we’re getting completely fucking slammed! It’s hell. Actual, biblical hell, Rio. It’s past midnight, I haven’t sat down in five hours, and my feet feel like they’ve been fucking steamrolled.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at the nickname. <em> Bee? </em> She hadn’t heard anyone call Sybil that before. She obviously didn’t comment on it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was trying to stay composed. “Did you call the on-call tech in?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I did,” Sage snapped again. “News. Flash. It’s still not enough. Because three people can’t cover the entire fucking  hospital.” Her voice pitched up, just slightly. “I’m getting fucked in the ass by this shift, Rio. I mean thoroughly. Raw.” </p><p> </p><p>Sage leaned closer to the mic, just slightly off camera now, her voice dropping to a furious whisper. </p><p> </p><p>“Meanwhile,” she hissed, directly into the mic, “you’re off bottoming for Agatha Harkness. Getting fucked in the ass in a very different and probably very literal fucking way.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit down on a laugh. Hard. She brought her free hand to her mouth, tried to press it against her lips, but it didn’t help. A loud, choked noise escaped before she could stop it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head whipped toward Agatha, scandalized, cheeks already pink. Her mouth opened like she was about to launch into a full defense, but nothing came out. She looked back at the camera.</p><p> </p><p>“I… That’s not… watch your mouth! That is so… You can’t just-”</p><p> </p><p>Sage cut in immediately. “‘I…That’s…Watch…You can’t just… ” she parroted, mean and delighted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had to bite the inside of her cheek just to stay quiet. Not because Sage was right, though she was hilarious, but because watching Rio this flustered felt weirdly good.</p><p> </p><p>From the moment Rio reappeared in her life, she'd been infuriatingly composed. But this? This was a version of Rio that Agatha remembered. Scrappy. Off balance. Barely keeping up.</p><p> </p><p>Then Sage said through gritted teeth, “I need your help, Roo.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand tensed slightly where it rested at the small of her back. And when Rio glanced at her, Agatha mouthed, “<em> Roo?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, soft and almost sheepish. Like she'd forgotten anyone else was listening. She turned back to the screen.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away. It filled her chest with something warm and awful. The same feeling she got every time she saw them interact. Every time she caught sight of the photos in Rio’s apartment. A reminder of what she’d missed. Of a life lived without her.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha hated how much it made her miss Lilia. Hated how much she wanted to see them all in a room together. Not for herself, not to be a part of it… just to know what it looked like.</p><p> </p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “What do you need help with, Sage?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t answer right away. Instead, she flipped the camera.</p><p> </p><p>The screen filled with the hallway outside of the ICU and the portable x-ray machine, parked awkwardly against the wall.</p><p> </p><p>Sage started kicking the wheel of the machine. Repeatedly.</p><p> </p><p>“This. Stupid. Fucking. Machine. Broke. Down. In. The. Worst. Possible. Place. And I cannot get it to move. Or turn on. Or do fucking anything<em> . </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio flinched with every kick. “Hey!” she snapped. “That’s like two hundred grand worth of equipment, what are you- don’t kick it, Jesus.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t stop. “Then come fix it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard the shift in Sage’s voice right away. It wasn’t anger anymore. It sounded tired, like she was about to cry.</p><p> </p><p>Rio heard it too. Her tone changed in an instant.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey. Okay. Stop. Just… stop for a second.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage gave the machine one final, frustrated kick. Then she stilled. The screen angled low, showing nothing but the wheel of the portable and her shoes.</p><p> </p><p>“Is it giving you any error codes?” Rio asked, softer now.</p><p> </p><p>“No. Screen’s black. I already tried rebooting it. I don’t know what happened.” Sage tilted the camera to show the monitor- blank, flashing black.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio said. “Alright. It’s fine. We’ll figure it out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing. Her hand stayed where it was at the base of Rio’s back, fingers curled loosely at her waistband. She could feel the muscles there, not as tense as before- how quickly Rio had moved from annoyance to care. There was no performance in it. No show for an audience. Just... Rio being Rio, when it counted.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know what to do with that. Maybe because it was so seamless. Maybe because it reminded her of how often she’d relied on that same instinct and hadn’t realized how much of it had once been offered to her too.</p><p> </p><p>She stayed still, eyes on a random wall, not listening to whatever Rio was saying. Her voice had gone clinical, technical, full of words Agatha didn’t understand and didn’t try to. None of it meant anything to her. </p><p> </p><p>But the feeling did. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha realized how much had changed and how much of it she hadn’t been there to witness. Not just tonight. Not just this shift into calm, capable authority. It had been happening for a long time. Rio had grown into someone steadier. More certain. The kind of person people turned to when everything else fell apart.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t angry. This wasn’t bitterness. She wanted this for Rio. She always had. But it knocked the air out of her every time she got to see it up close and know she hadn’t been part of it. </p><p> </p><p>That the person who used to white knuckle her way through every moment ever had softened without Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha used to tell herself she was done holding out for a version of Rio who never arrived. She had been angry then. Not at Rio for being lost, but for how much of her life was spent resisting- caught in the constant effort of keeping things from breaking instead of letting anything begin. Agatha had made choices without her because she was tired of waiting. Tired of pretending she didn’t already know how it would end. She needed Rio to <em> choose. </em> To move. To do something. Anything. But she never could. </p><p> </p><p>Now here she was, years later, watching Rio be everything she couldn’t be back then. And Agatha hadn’t been there to witness the change. Only arrived in its aftermath.</p><p> </p><p>It hurt. <em> Deeply </em> . Because Agatha had no idea if there was still room to be part of the life that had formed in her absence. Or if she’d been gone so long that it had outgrown her. That <em> she </em> had become the one who no longer fit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha would trade anything to go back and make different choices. To stop running. To stop punishing them both for not being ready at the same time. She thought the distance would make it easier. That starting over somewhere else with someone else would protect whatever tenderness she couldn’t name. But all it did was move her to the edge of a life that kept going without her.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to be part of it. Not just the memory. Not just the maybe.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted in. Past, present, future.</p><p> </p><p>And now, standing at the edge of it, watching it move without her, Agatha didn’t know how to ask if there was still room. If the home she’d walked away from was still there. If anyone inside had remembered to leave the light on. Or if there was even still a chair at the table, waiting for her to come home.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t answered Rio’s earlier question. She hadn’t let herself think about the answer, even in the privacy of her own mind.</p><p> </p><p>But now she did. Silently. Just for herself. Where no else could hear it.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> ‘You want to go to the courthouse and test that theory?’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Yes. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They were back at the house now. It was late, but neither of them felt tired. Neither said as much- they just moved quietly, instinctively, like they both knew they weren’t ready for the night to end. </p><p> </p><p>They had changed when they got in. Agatha pulled on a baby blue tank top and a pair of pinstriped boxers. Rio had reappeared to the living room in white socks, navy and yellow plaid boxers, and Agatha’s old gray Westview U shirt. The same one Agatha had only just realized Rio must’ve stolen from her a few days ago.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t say anything about it. Just looked at Rio for a second too long, then looked away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat on the couch and twiddled her fucking thumbs while Rio rifled through Sybil’s vinyl collection, flipping through the sleeves like she knew exactly what she was looking for. Eventually, she landed on <em> Rumors </em> and dropped the needle without even a glance back. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the obviousness of it. But still- <em> classic </em>. She loved that record. She knew Rio knew it. And she chose not to say anything, letting the opening chords of “Second Hand News” fill the room. </p><p> </p><p>Then she watched Rio light a stick of incense- something sharp and smoky that filled the room. It smelled like a Catholic mass on First Fridays, when the priest would swing that metal thing back and forth and the smoke would hang in the air long after the doors opened.</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, Agatha didn’t hate it.</p><p> </p><p>Now the two of them sat across from each other on the floor, the mancala board on the coffee table between them. The marble stones clacked gently against the board. The music spun low in the background. The silence was comfortable, if not a little fragile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was losing, and for someone who might qualify as the sorest loser in recorded history, she didn’t care. Not with Rio sitting across from her, dropping stones a precision that should’ve been irritating. Her fingernails were still painted black. Her brown eyes stayed focused, head tilted slightly, tongue pressing into her cheek whenever she managed to drop more stones into her store. And every so often, Rio would glance up at her like she was checking to see if Agatha was watching. </p><p> </p><p>Of course Agatha was. She hadn’t stopped. </p><p> </p><p>It was her turn now, but she didn’t move. Her elbow rested on the table, chin tucked into her hand as she studied Rio with quiet focus.</p><p> </p><p>“How’d you get that nickname?” she asked, quietly. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up. “Roo?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a small nod.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted, her knee knocking lightly against the leg of the table. One hand drifted toward the corner of the mancala board, thumb brushing over the corner of it.  “Anytime Lilia had to work and Sage was out of school, she’d call and ask if I could come over. Said it was to keep Sage company, but we both knew it was just her way of pushing the whole sibling thing.”</p><p> </p><p>“How old was she?” Agatha asked as she shifted her hand forward without thinking, the tips of her fingers brushing lightly against Rio’s on the table.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced down at the touch, lips twitching. She tapped her pointer finger twice against Agatha’s knuckles, then let it settle there. When she looked up again, her voice was casual. “Twelve.”</p><p> </p><p>“Brutal,” she muttered, adjusting so their fingertips tangled together, loose and thoughtless.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re telling me. She was weird as hell around me at first. Like, wouldn’t talk, barely looked at me. Just sat there like I was some kind of freak. I think she thought if she ignored me long enough, I’d go away.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, just raised her eyebrows, she could see that happening.</p><p> </p><p>“Then one day, out of nowhere, she looks me dead in the face and says I look like a Disney adult who probably has an unhealthy attachment to Winnie the Pooh.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her mouth into her hand, trying not to laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Rio noticed, of course she did, but didn’t comment on it. She just kept talking, the corner of her mouth quirking up, “A week later she started calling me Roo.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her hand from her mouth. “As in the character from Winnie the Pooh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Unfortunately,” Rio said, deadpan.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at her, voice caught in disbelief. “And you let it stick?”</p><p> </p><p>“It felt like a win at the time. And… I think she meant it kindly.” Rio glanced away, then back at Agatha and gave a shrug. “Eventually.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh. “Alright. I’ll say it. It’s fucking weird that you have a sister now.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio just smiled, lazy and unbothered, her fingers toying with Agatha’s. “You’ll get used to it,” she said softly, like a promise. </p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Rio pulled her hand away.</p><p> </p><p>The absence was immediate. But before she could linger on it, before she could miss it, Rio was moving. She rose to her feet without ceremony, circled the coffee table, and lowered herself beside Agatha on the floor.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Then Rio was looking at her. Not in a soft, admiring way, but with focus. Like she was checking for something. Like maybe she already knew and was just waiting for Agatha to confirm it. </p><p> </p><p>And maybe Agatha should have been annoyed by the scrutiny, should have deflected or looked away or made a comment that would pull them both back into safer territory- but she didn’t. She let Rio look. Wanted her to. Wanted to be looked at and recognized and known, maybe more than she wanted to keep pretending she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio reached up and tucked a piece of hair behind her ear like it was nothing, and Agatha tried not to lean into it, really she did, but her body made the decision for her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked, not in the way she used to when she was trying to start something, but smaller, like she was almost proud of herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you like our date?” Rio asked, barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose. “Oh, is that what that was?” she asked, the words light. “I thought it was just two friends hanging out.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows lifted, her mouth parting slightly. “Ohhh, okay,” she said, dragging it out, dry and theatrical. “Just so you know that little crush I had on you?” She jerked her thumb over her shoulder. “Gone. Out the window.”</p><p> </p><p>Crush. Right. They both knew it hadn’t been little, and it hadn’t gone anywhere.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha said, smirking now. “You still like me.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re funny,” Rio muttered, not even denying it, voice warm with annoyance that wasn’t really annoyance.</p><p> </p><p>“The funniest,” Agatha mumbled back, but she couldn’t commit to the bit. Her eyes were already locked on Rio’s mouth, and her fingers were twitching with the urge to do something- reach, pull, touch, anything.</p><p> </p><p>Her heart had already picked a direction, and her body was trying to follow.</p><p> </p><p>“Be honest,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her lip, still watching her mouth, and gave the smallest nod, not trusting her voice, but managing a quiet, “Mhm.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand moved again and tilted her chin up until Agatha had no choice but to meet her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you want to go on another one with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Yes. </p><p> </p><p>Always yes. </p><p> </p><p>The awful truth.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio asked, it would always be yes. That was the fucking gag.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t answer right away. Instead, she looked down, eyes catching on the Westview U shirt Rio had absolutely stolen, and chose the distraction. “You stole my shirt.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t even pretend to deny it. “Yup. And you’ve stolen a lot more from me. It’s only fair,” She shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up slowly, brow raised. “That sounds loaded.”</p><p> </p><p>“It is,” Rio said simply. “Answer the question.”</p><p> </p><p>“What question?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her a look. “Would you go on another date with me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit down on a smile she couldn’t fully hide and nodded again, slower this time. “Mhm.”</p><p> </p><p>In the background, Fleetwood Mac was playing low, the song almost too on the nose- Don’t Stop bleeding through the quiet like it knew something she didn’t. Like the universe was trying to be funny. Or kind.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure which was worse.</p><p> </p><p>“Good. That’s really good,” Rio whispered, almost to herself. Then, clearing her throat like she needed the reminder, she found her voice again. “Okay. Another question.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed, glanced away just long enough to find her own breath then looked back. “You’re full of questions tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio didn’t argue.</p><p> </p><p>“Get on with it then,” Agatha said, her voice small, already betraying her.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand lifted without permission, palm settling flat against Rio’s chest. She didn’t know what she was doing. Only that she could touch her now. That she didn’t have to stop. And her body kept proving that it wanted to- over and over, in tiny betrayals she couldn’t stop. It was humiliating, really.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her hand slide higher, fingers catching the edge of the collar, fidgeting, holding. </p><p> </p><p>And then Rio asked for the second time that night, “Did you like the nude I sent you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand went still. Her eyes shot up, caught Rio’s, didn’t look away. “Yeah.”</p><p> </p><p><em> Fucking traitor. </em>Her mouth was useless. Couldn’t even stall. Couldn’t joke. The truth had shown up and spoken for her before she had a chance to redirect.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brows lifted in surprise. </p><p> </p><p>“What did you like about it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mind short circuited. What the hell was this- some kind of warped trust exercise? </p><p> </p><p>“Boobs,” the only thing Agatha’s brain could give her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at her, eyes wide like she couldn’t believe that was the answer. But she didn’t laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand was still caught on the collar of her shirt. Her ears were burning. Her heart was becoming louder than the music.</p><p> </p><p>She tried to recover, but the words felt clumsy leaving her mouth. “I liked your boobs. It was a good picture. Hot. You looked-“ Agatha stopped, jaw tightening. “It was good.”</p><p> </p><p>The more she tried to fix it, the worse it got. Agatha felt her nose scrunch, and she hated that she could hear herself fumbling. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go.</p><p> </p><p>What happened to her control? One mention of a nude -one image of Rio, purposeful and naked- and she was tripping over herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had sent that picture to her without shame like she knew exactly how much space she could occupy inside Agatha’s mind.</p><p> </p><p>And she did.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted her. Desperately. It was deeper, older, heavier. It lived in her breath and her spine and her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Seventeen years of desperately wanting Rio had rewired her. Every nerve in Agatha’s body lit up the moment Rio got close. Her skin remembered everything now. Her pulse wouldn’t ever shut up.</p><p> </p><p>The anticipation wasn’t gentle. It didn’t hum. It buzzed, clawed, pulled.</p><p> </p><p>Then, quietly- testing- Rio said, “I took it for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach flipped. Her eyes darted to the corner of the room like looking anywhere else might help, only to land on a full length mirror set against the corner of the living room. That didn’t help at all. Her blush hit hard and low, crawling up her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head, followed Agatha’s line of sight, and caught her eyes in the reflection. Her lips pulled inward. She looked between their bodies, then back up to Agatha’s face, and turned to face her again. </p><p> </p><p>She took Agatha’s hand and stood.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked up at her, dumb. </p><p> </p><p>Rio tugged once, and she stood without a word. Rio didn’t speak as she undressed Agatha, and Agatha sure as fuck didn’t stop her. Wouldn’t. Couldn’t. She wanted this- fully, shamelessly. She would’ve begged, if she had less pride. </p><p> </p><p>Luckily, Agatha had just enough to hold still and pretend she wasn’t trembling.</p><p> </p><p>Rio started slow. Fingers hooked at the waistband of Agatha’s boxers, dragging them down with her underwear in one smooth pull, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s face. Then came the tank top.</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, Agatha was standing in the middle of the living room- naked, flushed, Fleetwood Mac whispering in the background, incense still burning.</p><p> </p><p>She should’ve felt mortified. But all she felt was her own throbbing pulse between her legs. </p><p> </p><p>Rio stripped next -no show, no extra effort- just skin and intention. She stepped forward, pressed their naked bodies together, and Agatha felt it everywhere.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t speak. Didn’t make a singular fucking sound. She just pressed her palm to the side of Rio’s face like it might anchor her, like she might lose herself if she didn’t. Her hips were already moving without permission, searching for friction.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t touch her. Kept her hands at her sides like she hadn’t felt a thing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her thumb into the hollow of her cheek, a silent command:<em> more, now.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio held still. Then she spoke. Quiet, so softly, “Sit.” She nodded toward the couch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fucking sat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio followed, adjusted Agatha until she was sat between her legs, her back pressed to Rio’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha looked up, the mirror held the full picture.</p><p> </p><p>Her own reflection- bare, flushed, breathing harder than she meant to. And Rio behind her, head just over her shoulder, eyes piercing and dark.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted her hips, just slightly, just enough for her center to drag across Agatha’s lower back.</p><p> </p><p>The moan that left Agatha was soft and startled. She could feel the wetness, even from that angle, and knew -knew- there was more. She wanted all of it. Wanted to grind back, to take.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t give her time. She moved her hands to Agatha’s thighs, slow and sure, and spread them wide open.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched it all happen in the mirror. Watched Rio’s hands, watched her own legs fall open, watched everything. And thought:</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Here lies Agatha Harkness. Cause of death: Rio Vidal turning control into religion and making Agatha watch the sermon. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She watched as Rio’s hands moved -up her thighs, across her stomach, back down again- dragging heat in their wake without ever rushing. When Rio finally spoke into her ear, it wasn’t soft. It was quiet in the way thunder could be quiet, though it still shook Agatha’s foundation.</p><p> </p><p>“I took it for you.”</p><p> </p><p>As if Agatha hadn’t heard it the first time. As if Rio wanted to make sure she absorbed it this time- word by word, breath by breath.</p><p> </p><p>It was infuriating. It was devastating.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio stopped now, Agatha might actually scream.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought about you the whole time,” Rio went on, her voice still maddeningly calm. Still close. “What you’d look at first. How long you’d stare.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the full weight of Rio’s gaze through the mirror like it was branding her in place.</p><p> </p><p>She nearly moaned. Bit her tongue instead. She wasn’t going to give Rio the satisfaction of seeing her fall apart from words alone.</p><p> </p><p>But god, she was close.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, Agatha jutted her chin out, trying to get her hair out of the way, baring her neck almost eagerly. Like a goddamn invitation. Like saying,<em> ‘look how good I can be for you. Now put your mouth on me.’ </em></p><p> </p><p>And Rio -bless her- still hadn’t figured out how to tell Agatha no. She offered her mouth immediately like it was her idea.</p><p> </p><p>Once. Open and wet. Right where Agatha had wanted it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shivered, let out a breath that turned into something like a laugh. A wicked, breathless little thing. Smug, honestly. She’d gotten exactly what she wanted without saying a single word.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands moved up her body. Agatha’s eyes trailed them in the mirror, lit up with delight and ruin.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you look at it and think about touching me?” Rio’s voice was steady, cruel in its calm, and then her fingers found Agatha’s nipples- rolled them between her thumb and forefinger. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth dropped open on a sound that didn’t qualify as a word.</p><p> </p><p>No chance in hell Agatha was confessing what she’d thought when she saw that picture. That her brain short circuited into the dumbest string of words possible.</p><p> </p><p>“I did,” Rio added softly, not bothering to wait for an answer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands snapped to Rio’s thighs, gripping like her life depended on it. She wanted to tell her to shut up. To get on with it. To fuck her stupid. Instead, she stared daggers into the mirror- icy blue daggers laced with pathetic, aching need.</p><p> </p><p>And of course, Agatha watched herself. Her own face. The way her body reacted to Rio’s voice, her hands. Undeniable. Inescapable. Evidence she’d never be able to refute.</p><p> </p><p>“I used to imagine this.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s nose was in her hair now. One hand over her breast. The other now cupped between Agatha’s legs like Rio owned Agatha’s cunt. And honestly, she kind of did. Every time she touched Agatha, it was with this ridiculous certainty, that made Agatha want to start fucking panting.</p><p> </p><p>“I knew what I wanted before I ever saw you like this. I knew where I’d touch you first. Where I’d stay longest-”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha gasped, her voice ragged.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes locked on Rio’s wrist, the way it bent slightly. The way her fingers flexed like they might move but didn’t. The way veins ran up her hand. It was obscene. It was beautiful. It was going to kill Agatha Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>“Get on with it,” Agatha grunted, thrusting forward chasing pressure. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move. She just held Agatha’s hips in place with one arm, casual and cruel. When Agatha looked up, Rio’s eyes were half lidded, lazy. She sounded disgustingly casual. </p><p> </p><p>“Or,” Rio murmured, “I could just sit back and watch.” Her hand didn’t budge. Not an inch. She didn’t pull away. Didn’t even pretend to.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha gasped, the sound wrecked and desperate, her hips shifting to catch a hand that wasn’t even pulling away. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t begging. She was not fucking begging.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Agatha heard herself beg anyway.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> How unfortunate. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand reached back, found the back of Rio’s head, fingers threading through her hair, pressing Rio’s face into the side of her own- cheek to temple. Every inch of Agatha burned. She wanted to disappear here. Live here. Die here. Reincarnate just to do it again.</p><p> </p><p>“I waited too,” Rio said, low against Agatha’s cheek. “I fucking waited. You have no idea what you did to me,” She dragged the heel of her palm harder against Agatha, grinding in like she needed the friction too. “I wanted you so badly,” Rio said through her teeth. “I couldn’t even touch myself without seeing your face.”</p><p> </p><p>And a whimper clawed its way out of Agatha’s throat so desperate that it made herself blush.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled -slower, quiet, tired- “Only ever your face.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know when she’d shut her eyes, but she had. It was the only way to hear Rio without looking. Without seeing the way Rio held her. Touched her. The way she was letting it happen. The side of her head pressed harder into Rio’s, jaw tight. She bit down on her lip, but it didn’t help- her hips were grinding into Rio’s palm and Rio just let her. Pressed her palm in harder even.</p><p> </p><p>“Even thinking about you touching me…” Rio huffed, short and breathless, like she hated saying it. “It ruined everything else.”</p><p> </p><p>Then, halting- more breath than voice:</p><p> </p><p>“I… I couldn’t let…” A swallow. “I stopped letting other women fuck me.” Rio managed through clenched teeth and she rolled her hips once, hard and precise, against Agatha’s lower back again. “I only wanted you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flew open. She gasped- loud and extremely involuntary. “Bullshit,” she snapped. Her hand shot down, covering Rio’s over her cunt, she ground her hips hard. “You’re so full of fucking shit.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha meant it. Because Rio flirted with everyone. Always had flings. Had a fucking reputation. She had watched Rio work a room before, seen women fall for her- and Rio always fucking let them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice cracked, “No.”  She shook her head, desperate, hiding her face in Agatha’s hair. “No, baby. I swear. I couldn’t let them. It made me sick.”</p><p> </p><p>A pause.</p><p> </p><p>“I wanted you so badly it made me sick.”</p><p> </p><p>There was something horrible about the satisfaction blooming in Agatha chest, like being handed confirmation that she hadn’t been the only one sick with something awful made the whole thing worth it. She felt powerful with it. Vindicated. Mean.</p><p> </p><p>The knowledge twisted in her like a live wire. It didn’t soothe. It didn’t settle.</p><p> </p><p>It lit her the fuck up.</p><p> </p><p>“You?” Agatha said, the words breaking apart halfway out of her mouth. Her laugh followed right behind it- ugly and wicked and gleeful. “You didn’t let anyone fuck you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wouldn’t pretend she wasn’t fucking thrilled. </p><p> </p><p>But the second the words left her mouth, Rio growled low in her throat. Without a word, she dragged her tongue up the side of Agatha’s throat and then bit hard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a loud, excitedly obscene moan. She didn’t care. She couldn’t. Her whole body was throbbing now, hips grinding faster, chasing friction, chasing Rio’s hand, chasing that- whatever the fuck that was. The burn. The history. The thrill of knowing she wasn’t the only one ruined by the absence.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t need anyone else,” Rio murmured, voice hot and low in her ear. “I needed this. I needed you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s cunt clenched so hard it made her breath catch and her eyes slam shut. She felt herself pulse, felt the slick mess she was making, felt how soaked she was. It was too much. She was going to come. And she couldn’t stop it.</p><p> </p><p>From this.</p><p> </p><p>Just this.</p><p> </p><p>“Say it again,” Agatha begged. She pressed down hard, ground her hips into Rio’s hand, her nails digging into the webs of Rio’s fingers. “Tell me again, please-”</p><p> </p><p>But Rio’s voice stayed even. Solid. In control now.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio said simply. “You heard me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barked out a frustrated sound that cracked into a whine. She was so close. It was humiliating. Her thighs were trembling, her breath hitched on every exhale, and she was so fucking wet she could hear it every time she moved.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio’s mouth was back at her ear. “Look at yourself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flew open. “Fuck,” she choked out, the word rough.</p><p> </p><p>She was trying to stay quiet. Trying to hang on to a shred of fucking dignity.</p><p> </p><p>But that was gone.</p><p> </p><p>Because the second Agatha’s gaze met their reflection in the mirror again- she saw herself. Truly.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand still tangled at the back of Rio’s head, gripping hard. The slick, desperate grind of her own hips. The way her mouth had fallen open. Her other hand, braced and trembling on top of Rio’s. The tension in her jaw. The color high in her cheeks. How completely, shamelessly wrecked she looked under Rio’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>And the sight of it -seeing the truth of what Rio had done to her- hit harder than anything else.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes slammed shut again just as it hit. Her orgasm surged through her so fast it stole her breath and gave her back another sound she didn’t recognize. Long. Shattered. Mortifying in its honesty.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated her.</p><p> </p><p>She hated Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated how little it took to do this to her. A hand between her legs. A voice in her ear. Her own reflection staring back at her like evidence.</p><p> </p><p>Just a mirror and the confirmation that Agatha had never really stood a chance.</p><p> </p><p>And the worst part? She had let it happen. Agatha had chased it. She had begged for it. She wanted more of it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kindly let her ride it out- every twitch, every tremor, every broken breath. She held Agatha there with both hands. </p><p> </p><p>And when it was over -when Agatha was still quivering, still soaked, still stunned from the force of it- Rio didn’t stop.</p><p> </p><p>She just adjusted her hand slightly, dragged slow, circling fingers over Agatha’s clit. She kept Agatha open, kept her exposed, and did nothing to relieve the ache still pulsing under her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand was still at the back of Rio’s head, tangled and trembling, nails biting lightly into her scalp like she couldn’t let go even if she wanted to. Her other hand gripped at Rio’s wrist, not to stop her, but to stay connected to what was being done to her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched -helpless- as Rio moved her fingers in slow, dragging swirls, just light enough to keep Agatha on edge, just cruel enough to make her hips twitch for more. Her eyes were barely slitted, lashes heavy, mouth slack, breath uneven.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio…” she whispered, voice already gone. “Please. You’re being cruel.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to stop?” Rio asked, softly, her lips brushing the shell of Agatha’s ear as she spoke.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whined- high and broken and immediate. “Don’t you fucking dare.”</p><p> </p><p>That earned a low hum from Rio, thoughtful and amused, like she’d expected that answer and needed to hear it anyway. Her fingers never faltered, never rushed. She stayed just shy of mercy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hips were starting to roll again, involuntary, her whole body shifting in search of something deeper. And Rio -fucking Rio- just leaned in lower and kissed her neck. Then the edge of her jaw. Then her cheekbone, soft and devastating.</p><p> </p><p>And when Agatha started to tremble again, right on the brink without a single word of encouragement, Rio finally asked- quiet, careful:</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was fighting to come back into her body, fighting to hold on, and Rio wasn’t giving her space to think.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” The sound broke out of Agatha, dazed and useless.</p><p> </p><p>And that’s when Rio did it- eased the tips of two fingers inside her, barely there, shallow and infuriatingly gentle.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a groan that sounded more like a sob. Her whole body tightened around the tiniest intrusion, but it wasn’t enough. Not nearly.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me, please,” Rio said again, quieter now, and even more patient. “What do you want?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. She could barely form the words.</p><p> </p><p>“For you to fuck me stupid.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stilled, started to pull her fingers away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t take it.</p><p> </p><p>She gripped Rio’s wrist to keep her in place, pushed her hips down harder. Trying to grind into Rio’s fingers like it would open her up, chasing Rio’s touch with everything she had left.</p><p> </p><p>“You,” Agatha gasped, desperately. “You, Rio. I want you.”</p><p> </p><p>It sounded real this time. Whole. Humbling.</p><p> </p><p>She felt when Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>“Please,” Agatha continued, more than willing to beg and never stop. “Please fuck me. I want to feel you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t speak.</p><p> </p><p>She just watched Agatha in the mirror-cheek pressed to Agatha’s temple, breath shallow, fingers still not doing a fucking thing.</p><p> </p><p>And then she shifted.</p><p> </p><p>Not away. Not to tease.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed in.</p><p> </p><p>Two fingers. Slow, deliberate, all the way to her knuckles.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped, her whole body seizing around it. Her hand at the back of Rio’s head fisted hard in her hair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio held her there, fingers buried, hips steady beneath her, and kissed the curve of Agatha’s jaw once. Then again. Slower.</p><p> </p><p>“Move,” Agatha begged, barely coherent. “Please. Fuck- please, I need your-”</p><p> </p><p>“Say you want me,” Rio demanded, breath ragged, fingers still.</p><p> </p><p>“I do,” Agatha sobbed. “I do. I want you- I want you- I want you so bad I feel fucking insane.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned into her neck, biting hard into the skin just below her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“Then take me.”</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Rio’s fingers turned brutal. Deep, perfect thrusts that pushed everything else out of Agatha’s body- words, breath, shame. All of it burned up and gone.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand moved faster, harder, curling just right, grinding her palm over Agatha’s clit until she was crying out into the side of Rio’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to- fuck- I’m-”</p><p> </p><p>“Do it,” Rio whispered. “Come for me.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha did.</p><p> </p><p>Harder than before. Worse. Her whole body went taut, then shattered, eyes rolling into the back of her head, mouth wide around a moan she couldn’t stop. She came around Rio’s fingers. Hard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. Her body felt boneless, wrecked, too full and too empty all at once. One hand was still tangled in Rio’s hair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t said anything. She was still inside her, fingers resting deep, the heel of her hand slick and warm against Agatha’s cunt. Her breath hitched every few seconds, not steady either, but trying to be. She was trying to hold still.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes and listened to the heartbeat under Rio’s skin. Fast. Messy. The same as her own.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Later, they moved from the couch. Rio had tried to guide them to the bathroom, murmuring something about getting her cleaned up.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had meant to let Rio lead. Let her be sweet about it. Agatha’s hands had other plans.</p><p> </p><p>The second the water started running, she cornered Rio. Mouth on mouth. Thumb pressed hard into the soft hollow of Rio’s cheek to keep her still. She kissed Rio like she was still starving, like there was something she needed to prove.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio didn’t fight it. She gasped into Agatha’s mouth. They stumbled back until the bathroom counter caught the back of Rio’s hips, Rio let Agatha lift her up onto it like it was inevitable.</p><p> </p><p>While Agatha fucked her on the bathroom counter, Rio wouldn’t stop looking at her. Wouldn’t let her look away. One leg wrapped tight around Agatha’s waist. One hand fisted in Agatha’s hair. The other cupped Agatha’s jaw, keeping her jaw tilted up. Rio was panting -glassy eyed, wide open, wrecked- and made Agatha watch every second of it.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m yours,” Rio said, over and over. A gasp, a moan, a promise. “I’m yours.” Like she knew it’s what Agatha needed to hear.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio came like that. Open, clenching around her fingers, still holding Agatha’s face with one hand like she belonged to her too.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look away. Not once. She didn't want to. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The shower after was unbearable in a different way. There was no fucking. No teasing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood behind Agatha for a long time, pressing slow kisses into the curve of her shoulder, her mouth moving in silence like she didn’t know what to say.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned into it without meaning to.</p><p> </p><p>Rio washed her with a gentleness Agatha didn’t know how to receive. She kept her eyes low, half lidded, pretending not to notice how reverent the whole thing felt. But when Rio kissed her -slow, mouth slick and warm from the water- Agatha kissed her back.</p><p> </p><p>They took their time.</p><p> </p><p>No rush.</p><p> </p><p>Just hands sliding across skin, mouths brushing shoulders, deep kisses without teasing, without demands.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed once, so quietly it barely counted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything, but she smiled- small and crooked, trying not to let it show.</p><p> </p><p>It was disgusting, truly.</p><p> </p><p>How much Agatha didn’t want it to end.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The next day, they didn’t go on that hike.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha woke first, which felt impossible given how exhausted she’d been the night before. Rio was curled into her chest, legs tangled in the sheets, her entire naked body draped across Agatha’s. Agatha stared at the ceiling, trying to remember how to think. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio woke, without meaning to, Agatha asked her if she  still wanted to go on that hike Rio mentioned the day before. She immediately followed it up with a warning that if Rio so much as looked at her ass under the pretense of tick prevention, Rio would be left in the woods to die. Rio, sleepy and already smiling, buried her face in Agatha’s neck and mumbled that they should stay in bed all day. That could be their date instead of hiking.</p><p> </p><p>Rio made breakfast in an oversized t-shirt and nothing else, yawning through the entire process. Agatha sat at the kitchen counter in one of Rio’s oversized t-shirts, legs crossed, pretending to work through a crossword puzzle and not just stare at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>After breakfast, they went back to bed. The world narrowed to sheets and slower rhythms. They slipped in and out of sleep, and in between there were long, quiet rounds of sex. Agatha on her back, Rio’s hand between her legs like she wanted to take Agatha apart slowly. Rio sleepy and pliant, mumbling something sweet against Agatha’s mouth before Agatha kissed her way down and buried herself between Rio’s thighs- gently and with a tenderness that bordered on worship.</p><p> </p><p>They smoked cigarettes on and off throughout the day too, stepping out onto the deck that overlooked the lake. The boards were warm beneath Agatha’s bare feet, the air damp and green. Agatha leaned against the railing while Rio perched on the edge of it, flicking ash into the tray. Agatha teased her for hoarding the lighter. Rio accused her of getting off on making her suffer. Neither of them denied it.</p><p> </p><p>By evening, Rio had pulled together dinner from whatever was in the fridge. They ate on the couch, legs touching, a movie playing on Rio’s phone that neither of them watched. After, Rio built a fire outside while Agatha pulled on socks and a hoodie. The day’s warmth had given up. </p><p> </p><p>They sat on the ground on top of a blanket, facing each other. Rio pulled out a joint from her hoodie pocket, held it between their faces like it was a gift, and grinned so wide Agatha could see the gap in her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“Like old times?” Rio asked, glancing away quickly, then back to Agatha and added like it was obvious, “But better.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, snatched it from Rio’s fingers, but didn’t argue.</p><p> </p><p>They passed it back and forth, laughing at nothing. They told stories they’d both heard before. They talked about the time Rio snorted milk through her nose because she ate a hot wing and how said snorted milk flowed out of Rio’s mouth and into the sink. Rio tried to defend herself through it, insisted nose milk was a legitimate relief. Agatha laughed so hard she nearly pissed herself.</p><p> </p><p>Later that night, naked in bed again, Agatha kissed Rio without thinking.</p><p> </p><p>It was too soft, too careful, too open and exposed. When Agatha pulled back, Rio’s eyes stayed closed longer than they should have. And when they finally fluttered opened, they were so brown, so glassy, and so full of something it nearly sent Agatha running.</p><p> </p><p>She hovered above Rio for a long moment, frozen.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached up and held her face in both hands. Her thumb moved across Agatha’s cheek like she was checking whether she’d imagined her. Rio opened her mouth to speak. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t let her.</p><p> </p><p>She kissed Rio again, deeper this time, as if that could hold the words back.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever this was, it was growing carefully, gently, and it was something that had to be tended with both hands. It couldn’t be rushed. It asked for softness. And Agatha, already unspooled by the last few days, felt it settling into her like new roots- quiet, tender, and terrifying in how easily it could take hold.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally pulled back, she let her body fall into Rio’s, she buried face in Rio’s neck. Her breath caught in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>And in the quiet that followed, she heard Rio whisper, soft and certain:</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll try again tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard every word. And somewhere beneath her breastbone, her heart stirred like it had been touched by light- fragile, blooming, unsure, but no longer afraid to reach for the sun.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, again, was up before Rio but hadn’t moved far. She stayed leaned against the headboard, legs tangled in the sheets, thumbing through the crossword book, letting herself pretend she didn’t keep glancing at the lump of warmth still asleep beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually Rio stirred, face pressed into the pillow, voice rough with sleep when she mumbled something about coffee and stumbled out of bed without a shirt. She looked soft in the light. Puffy eyed, rumpled, slow. Agatha watched her cross the room, watched the sleepy stretch of her arms over her head, the yawn she didn’t bother to hide. She didn’t say anything while she pulled on a sweatshirt and shorts.</p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha watched Rio leave the room fucking dumbfounded.</p><p> </p><p>Had hell gone and frozeth over? Had pigs flown? Had the natural order of all things collapsed? Had Rio Vidal finally decided that their pretend domestic bliss didn’t include morning affection?</p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha Harkness was still sitting up against the headboard in bed and Rio fucking Vidal had not kissed her good morning.</p><p> </p><p>Which made absolutely no goddamn sense.</p><p> </p><p>Not once since they’d arrived at this too-perfect lake house had Rio failed to kiss her good morning. Not a single fucking morning. Forehead, temple, lips, shoulder, wherever Rio could reach. Always murmured something barely awake and annoyingly tender.</p><p> </p><p>Until this morning.</p><p> </p><p>And no- She didn’t want a good morning kiss. Obviously. She just wanted…consistency. Some fucking decorum. The goddamn natural order of things.</p><p> </p><p>No, now Agatha was just pissed off.</p><p> </p><p>The crossword book on Agatha’s lap went flying. Then the covers. Then she dragged one of Rio’s t-shirts over her head, grumbling profanities the entire way through the collar, and stomped into the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was tinkering with the coffee machine like she hadn’t just walked out and left Agatha sitting there- wide awake, high and fucking dry, wondering when basic human decency went out the window.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood in the threshold of the kitchen with her arms crossed, glaring daggers into the back of Rio’s head. </p><p> </p><p>She watched Rio’s posture shift- barely, but enough. The way her grip tightened on the counter. The way her shoulders pulled in just slightly. Rio knew. She always knew.</p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal was literally the human equivalent of a heat seeking missile when it came to locating Agatha Harkness in a room.</p><p> </p><p>So the fact that Rio wasn’t turning around?</p><p> </p><p>Fucking unacceptable.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat- loudly. Aggressively. It was a warning.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head, brown eyes soft and stupidly sweet, and offered a casual, “Morning, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>Then turned back and started making a second cup.</p><p> </p><p><em> ‘Morning, sweetheart’ my ass </em>, Agatha thought.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t respond because she was too busy picking up her jaw from the fucking floor. Too busy summoning the full force of her adult self not to stomp her foot and scream,<em> ‘Give me my fucking kiss, right now!’ </em> like a brat in a grocery store checkout line.</p><p> </p><p>No. Agatha wouldn’t do that. She wouldn’t raise her voice. She wouldn’t throw a fit.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t a child.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was just going to stand here. Silently vibrating with rage. And wait for Rio to fix it.</p><p> </p><p>And if Rio didn’t get her shit together in the next ten seconds?</p><p> </p><p>There would be consequences.</p><p> </p><p>Real, adult, completely rational consequences.</p><p> </p><p>There was a beat where Agatha tried -tried- to talk herself down. To tell herself it wasn’t that deep. That she didn’t care. Maybe she’d just made it a thing in her head and it wasn’t actually a pattern forming.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio still wasn’t paying attention to her.</p><p> </p><p>And that thought alone nearly sent Agatha lunging across the kitchen like a wild animal.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she took a single, deep breath. A reasonable breath. A breath full of poise and maturity.  She took one more step into the kitchen. A casual step. A cool, unaffected, not at all very threatening step.</p><p> </p><p>Then said -calmly, evenly, like a grown woman very much in control of herself- “So. Just out of curiosity. Are you… not doing that anymore?”</p><p> </p><p>“Doing what?” Rio asked, still not turning around.</p><p> </p><p>“Doing what?” Agatha mocked theatrically, pitching her voice higher, like Rio was suddenly too stupid to grasp context. “Gee, I don’t know. That thing where you kiss me in the morning like you actually like me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced over her shoulder. “I do like you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, well, good,” Agatha snapped. “Then maybe you could let your mouth inform your actions.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned around fully this time, leaning against the counter with her coffee in hand, and brows raised in amusement. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re mad I didn’t kiss you?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not mad,” Agatha lied, immediately and poorly. “I just think it’s interesting.”</p><p> </p><p>“Interesting…” Rio glanced to the side, eyes widening briefly before flicking back to Agatha. She dragged the word out like she was waiting- giving Agatha the space to say more.</p><p> </p><p>“Interesting,” Agatha snapped. “That you woke up, looked me dead in the eye, and then left the room like you forgot how to be a decent fucking human being.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio held her gaze, both hands wrapped around her coffee, shoulders stiff in that way Agatha recognized immediately- controlled, thoughtful, trying not to fuck it up further.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t think you wanted me to,” Rio said, shrugging.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “Are you joking?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio said quietly. “You seemed tense.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was waiting for you to kiss me, you idiot!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s whole face instantly softened. She set her coffee on the counter and slowly crossed the kitchen. She stopped in front of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I kiss you now?” Rio asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a half step back just enough to prove a point. “No. You missed your window.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I’m sorry.” Rio hesitated, then added, softer this time, “I panicked.”</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t supposed to happen.</p><p> </p><p>These days, between the two of them, Rio wasn’t the one who panicked. That wasn’t how they worked anymore.</p><p> </p><p>It was the last thing Agatha expected. And maybe she shouldn’t have needed Rio to be the one who was always certain. Maybe that wasn’t fair.</p><p> </p><p>But she did. So to hear Rio hesitate now -to hear even a flicker of doubt- wasn’t just surprising. It was terrifying.</p><p> </p><p>Because if Rio was panicking, then maybe she was thinking twice about them. And Agatha felt her heart drop.</p><p> </p><p>Her arms fell to her sides. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward like she was going to explain, reaching for her hand, but Agatha didn’t let her. She took another step back instead, too stunned to cover it with anything snide.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not you,” Rio said, words tumbling before Agatha could retreat further. “It’s not how I feel about you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then what the fuck is it about?” Agatha snapped, trying not to focus on how her eyes were starting to sting, or how her throat suddenly felt tight and raw, like barbed wire pulling tighter around her neck every time she swallowed.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t want to scare you,” Rio said, louder, rushed, and breathless. She let out a shaky breath, tried to collect herself, then added, quieter, “After last night…”</p><p> </p><p>Dread -full bodied, dramatic, Victorian level dread- washed over Agatha. Dread that belonged to a corseted woman flinging herself across a chaise lounge with one hand pressed to her forehead.</p><p> </p><p>She knew what Rio was referring to- the night before, when Agatha had kissed her, and Rio almost said something irreversible. And how Agatha had stopped her with another kiss. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her mouth shut, jaw set, eyes fixed on Rio’s face like she could will her into backing off from the topic. She wasn’t going to ask what Rio was talking about. She wasn’t going to help.</p><p> </p><p>Rio picked up on it immediately.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t want you to pull away,” Rio said, gently now. “I thought if I gave you space, it might make you feel safe. I didn’t mean for you to feel like I didn’t care.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you did,” was all Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>Just because she couldn’t stomach the words didn’t mean she wanted Rio to pull away. God, no. She’d already been given too much of Rio- too much warmth, too much attention, too much of Rio moving through the world like she was Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>Anything less now would be unbearable. Cruel, even. A punishment to herself she couldn’t justify, not when she’d already let this much happen.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha knew herself well enough to know she wouldn’t handle anything less with grace.</p><p> </p><p>Which was, unfortunately, pretty damning information that she chose not to look too closely at it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward and reached out again. This time, Agatha let her.</p><p> </p><p>“I was wrong,” Rio said softly, pulling her in with the smallest tug. Her other hand came up to Agatha’s cheek. “Please,” she added, voice thin with urgency. “Let me fix it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged, eyes fixed anywhere but Rio’s. She played at indifference, clung to it, pretending she didn’t care- didn’t melt under the way Rio spoke to her, or touched her like this. </p><p> </p><p>A quiet, almost cautious, “Baby.” Then a thumb brushed her cheek, light and careful, pulling blue to brown.</p><p> </p><p>Of course that was all it took. Agatha Harkness -world class avoidant, notorious hard-ass- reduced to mush because Rio Vidal had learned how to weaponize a pet name. Disgusting. She should’ve bitten Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her, Rio said, “I want to make it up to you.” Her eyes flicked to Agatha’s mouth, and Agatha’s stomach swooped hard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a tiny nod.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded back, then leaned in and kissed her- so softly it was insulting. If it had been literally anyone else, Agatha would’ve shoved them off and dry heaved.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t. She let it happen. </p><p> </p><p>Worse-she leaned into it.</p><p> </p><p>Even worser -which wasn’t a word, obviously, but felt correct enough to be insulting- Agatha felt her entire body exhale like she hadn’t once been holding a grudge for seventeen years.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled back without a word, brushed past Rio, grabbed both coffees off the counter, then turned around, walked right back, and shoved one into Rio’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t do it again,” Agatha muttered, already heading outside like that had been her plan all along.</p><p> </p><p>No pants. No underwear. Just Rio’s t-shirt and whatever pride she had left stitched into the hem. She didn’t look back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio would follow. Obviously. Probably with those stupid cigarettes and Agatha’s old lighter that Rio refused to stop carrying around for reasons Agatha had no interest in unpacking.</p><p> </p><p>And if Rio’s idea of apologizing for skipping Agatha’s good morning kiss involved getting on her knees, Agatha’s lower back pressed against the decks railing, a lit cigarette in Agatha’s mouth, one hand fisted in Rio’s hair while she moaned Rio’s name like a prayer- then fine. Sure. That worked.</p><p> </p><p>They were in the woods. It was early. No one was around. Probably.</p><p> </p><p>And afterwards, once Rio had thoroughly fucked her and Agatha had finally stopped shaking, Agatha briefly considered the possibility of ticks. </p><p> </p><p>She blinked at the treetops, and thought, <em> This is how I get a tick on my asshole and die of Lyme disease. </em></p><p> </p><p>So casually, on the way back inside, Agatha tossed over her shoulder, “You still want that excuse to inspect my asshole, or should I lie down in some grass first?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio yelled, “FUCK YES!” loud enough to startle birds out of trees, then sprinted after Agatha like she’d won the lottery.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed. Loudly. Couldn’t help it.</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, Agatha was genuinely concerned about having a tick on her asshole.</p><p> </p><p>Thankfully, there wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>No. The real parasite was the woman kneeling on the bathroom tile, whispering, “This is the best day of my life,” while Agatha stood bent over the counter, elbows planted, brushing her teeth and trying very hard not to smile. Mostly because she was too busy questioning every life choice that had led her to accidentally dating her pervert best friend.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The last two days defied explanation. They hadn’t been extraordinary. That was the unsettling part. Time didn’t feel linear. It expanded, doubled back, folded in on itself. Every hour bled into the next, and somehow, none of it felt wasted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They’d moved with a softness Agatha wasn’t prepared for. Slower. Looser. Intimate in the places she used to guard. Long mornings, bottomless coffee, too many cigarettes, and something that felt suspiciously like peace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her good morning every time Agatha blinked awake, and never just once. It was always slow, always drawn out, always a little smug about how easily Agatha gave in. Not that Agatha complained. There wasn’t a single bad thing she had to say about Rio’s mouth… Agatha had checked. Thoroughly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They touched constantly. Hands slipping beneath shirts, along hips, around shoulders. Mouths brushing foreheads, collarbones, the stretch of skin just beneath a jaw. Kisses that didn’t rush. Kisses that asked for nothing but were always answered. They woke up tangled. Slept in. Made coffee. Ate only what was within reach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha kept catching herself watching Rio. The way Rio hummed through toothpaste, tapped her fingers against the counter like she had too much energy and nowhere to put it. The way she sat cross legged on the counter, eating cereal straight from the box, reading the back like it was the newspaper. She was everywhere- quietly, stupidly everywhere. And in the afternoon, sun drunk and entirely too pleased with herself, Rio pressed a cold bottle of beer to the inside of Agatha’s thigh just to hear the way she gasped. Agatha rolled her eyes. And let Rio do it again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They had sex, yes. Several times. Each time different. Sometimes lazy, like it was just a way to pass the time. Sometimes urgent with want, mouths and hands overlapping until it all collapsed in on itself. Sometimes slow, careful, like they were building something from the bones outward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On their final afternoon, Agatha -against every protest- ended up with a fishing pole in her hands. She’d said no. Several times. But Rio had tilted her head and said, </span>
<em>
<span>“Just once. For me.”</span>
</em>
<span> So she’d cast the line. Immediately regretted it. Within minutes, something pulled hard enough to nearly yank the rod straight from her grip. She screamed. Rio cackled. Then ran to help her haul in the world’s most pissed off bass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio wanted a picture. Agatha told her to fuck off. Rio threatened to pout. Agatha held the fucking fish. It thrashed wildly, and she screamed again, dropped it, watched it flop itself back into the lake. She refused to speak to Rio for twenty minutes. Then Rio kissed her and- well… So much for the silent treatment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their last morning was quieter. Not sad. Just unmistakably not the same. The light looked different through the windows. The air was too still. The world had started up again somewhere outside the walls of the lake house, and neither of them knew how to rejoin it without shattering whatever they’d built in its absence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned against Rio’s car, smoking a cigarette, while Rio locked up the house- her eyes fixed on the lake. She expected it to look different. But it didn’t. It looked exactly as it had for the last six days, unmoved by the fact that everything else had changed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t blame it. The lake hadn’t asked to hold their pause, hadn’t agreed to bear witness to what almost felt like a life together. It had just been there- quiet, constant, letting them believe the world outside could wait a little longer. But it hadn’t. And now, standing at the edge of departure, even the water refused to say goodbye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On the drive back, Rio reached for her constantly. Fingers brushing Agatha’s thigh, her wrist, the back of her neck at a red light. She didn’t say a word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha leaned into every touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled into the employee parking lot of St. Rita’s at exactly 6:25 p.m., which left her ten whole minutes to sit in the car and pretend she wasn’t unraveling. Technically, she was early for Huddle- an infuriatingly cheerful name for the pre-shift meeting where the charge nurse handed out assignments and reminded everyone, through teeth gritted politeness, to restock the isolette drawers. Agatha’s only plan was to sit in her car, finish </span>
<em>
<span>Connections,</span>
</em>
<span> and summon enough willpower to give a passable impression of someone who gave a shit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She and Rio had said goodbye yesterday afternoon in her foyer, and the memory made her nauseous. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It had been awkward in a way that didn’t make any sense. It felt too casual. Grossly casual… like they hadn’t just spent six uninterrupted days in each other’s skin. They stood a little too far apart, said too little. Rio had gone in for a hug, then stopped halfway through- grimaced at herself like she’d forgotten how to be a person. Agatha might’ve found it endearing if it hadn’t made her want to commit a crime. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t that Agatha needed fanfare. She just couldn’t wrap her head around how two people could spend six days sharing a bed- waking up tangled, falling asleep with a face tucked into a neck- and then suddenly forget how to touch each other. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio had checked her asshole for ticks, for fucks sake. That wasn’t metaphorical. That actually happened. And now they couldn’t even make eye contact? </span>
<em>
<span>Please.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled Rio in out of spite. Hugged her with more force than necessary. Rio’s arms came around her immediately, and they both went still the second they made contact. They held each other longer than they should have, only breathing, not moving. Then Rio leaned back and let out a shaky breath that brushed against Agatha’s mouth. And then, as if rehearsed, they both let go. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio made it to the sidewalk before turning around, walking straight back through the door, and kissing Agatha like she couldn’t help it. Agatha kissed her back, open mouthed and already annoyed at how much she’d missed it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was messy and ridiculous and briefly obscene before settling into something slower. Softer. Familiar in the worst way. Agatha pulled away first. Rio lingered just long enough to whisper, “See you at work tomorrow,” and pressed one more kiss to the corner of Agatha’s mouth before walking out again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was the last time they spoke. No texts. No calls. Agatha hadn’t opened their text thread since, and she didn’t plan to. Not because she was heartbroken- she wasn’t. She was just adjusting. A little out of step.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Six days of closeness had shifted Agatha’s center of gravity, and now everything was tilted half a degree to the left. She didn’t fall apart. She still liked her space. She still liked her own company. But waking up alone after that many mornings full of Rio’s limbs and Rio’s warmth and Rio’s dumb laugh wasn’t easy. It wasn’t ruinous. Just absolutely fucking irritating. Like the absence of that stupid gap toothed smile had drained the color from her world a little bit. And Agatha had to pretend she hadn’t noticed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now, Agatha was halfway through grouping four words she was almost positive described patterns when an unexpected knock against her window startled her so violently she let out an undignified yelp, dropped her phone, and screamed “FUCK” loud enough to rattle her own eardrums. Her heart slammed against her ribs as she whipped her head- already halfway into a scowl she assumed would be aimed at Rio, who had a chronic habit of scaring the shit out of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Except it wasn’t Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was Jen. Which, frankly, was absolutely worse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned and cracked the window an inch and glared out at her very pissed off best friend. “Jennifer,” she said flatly. “To what do I owe the jump scare?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Out of the car.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>So much for hello.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked up at her. “Absolutely not. I have six more minutes to sit here and rot in peace, and I plan to savor every last one. You’re encroaching on sacred time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen didn’t respond. Just stepped back half an inch, clearly waiting, clearly not going anywhere.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, opened the door with unnecessary force, and made sure it bumped Jen’s hip on the way open. She climbed out with theatrical annoyance, slung her bag over her shoulder, and locked her car with a single, accusatory beep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is there a reason for all of this,” Agatha said, motioning vaguely at Jen’s entire existence, “or did you just feel like showing up and making me miserable today?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen squinted at her. “Hilarious,” she said dryly.  Then, without missing a beat, “No actually, this is about you being an asshole and ignoring my calls and texts all week.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head. “What?” Her tone was light, drawn out, and clearly performative. She didn’t wait for a response before turning toward the hospital  building. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen followed without hesitation. “Don’t play dumb, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, still playing dumb. “Well- sorry abou-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nope. Not letting you squirm out of this one.” Jen grabbed her elbow and tugged her to a stop. “What the hell happened? And don’t say ‘nothing,’ because you and Rio both called out last week, and I may be tired but I’m not stupid.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled her arm free, roughly. “You’re reaching.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you being serious right now?” Jen said. “Your ex-wife showed up to the bowling alley and caused a whole scene, you left with Rio -</span>
<em>
<span>thank god</span>
</em>
<span>, by the way. We all literally cheered the second you were both out of sight and Wanda started screaming at security.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, and Jen threw her hands up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You left with Rio! You both called out! And now you’re seriously not going to tell me what happened? I want the entire rundown. Every single detail. Starting now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I’m sorry,” Agatha said, stopping dead in the middle of the sidewalk, forcing two people to step around them. “Did I forget to give you a play by play of my entire personal life imploding in the middle of a fucking bowling alley?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen raised an eyebrow. Agatha didn’t give her the chance to speak, “I saw Wanda. I saw Rio. I used my one functioning brain cell and left with the hotter option.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you downplaying this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Agatha said, already walking again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bullshit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Correct,” Agatha said, not even bothering to fake it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen scoffed. “So what, you vanish for a week and I’m not supposed to ask? Are you two dat-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are who two what now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio appeared mysteriously at Agatha’s side, and it took no effort at all for Agatha to remain unfazed. She didn’t flinch, didn’t pause, only instinctively took the coffee Rio held out in front of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha may have made her own coffee at home, stared at it, and then left it sitting on the counter. Not an oversight- a choice. A minor sacrifice, really, in the off chance that a certain insufferable person might take the admittedly unreasonable hint… and bring her one instead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen glared at Agatha for the fact that she had enough respect not to keep asking real questions in front of company, and clearly hated herself for it. She didn’t say anything, but her eyes dropped to the cup in Agatha’s hand and narrowed. There was no mistaking the pointed expression that followed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t offer an explanation. She just took a long, obnoxious sip and kept walking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at Jen, completely unfazed. “Tell your wife her gym bag’s still in my car. It’s been a month.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha clocked it instantly- Rio redirecting the conversation without blinking. Whether it was to spare Agatha or herself, she wasn’t sure. Either way, it worked. And the coffee didn’t hurt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tell her yourself. You’ll see her more tonight than I will, considering you work ten feet away!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha kept her focus forward, jaw set, pace steady. She didn’t look at either of them, didn’t engage, but she did let her fingers drift ever so slightly against Rio’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio, still talking to Jen, extended her middle finger and pressed it lightly against the back of Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach flipped. She didn’t react beyond the faint curl of her index finger as it caught on Rio’s. It was a small, deliberate contact- unremarkable to anyone else, but enough. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They walked the rest of the stretch like that, Rio keeping up her end of the conversation with Jen. Her finger staying loosely caught around Agatha's and neither of them pulling away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When the entrance doors came into view, Rio stepped ahead, fingers slipping away from Agatha’s, and pulled the door open for them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha went in first.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen kept close behind, leaned in just enough to make it annoying, and muttered under her breath, “Don’t think you’re off the hook just because your guard dog showed up. I still want every detail, and I’m not above dragging it out of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Details? About what?” Agatha shot back in a sharp whisper. “The coffee? It’s a little sweet, but I’m coping.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From a few steps behind, Rio called out, casually and infuriatingly tuned in, “Too sweet?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer. Not because she didn’t want to- she did. The words were right there. ‘</span>
<em>
<span>No, it’s perfect.’</span>
</em>
<span> She could’ve said it easily, could’ve thrown it over her shoulder. She even opened her mouth to do it. But Jen cut back in with purpose.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Jen said. “You still wanna play dumb? Cool. Let’s play.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was closing the gap now, falling into step behind them. Jen didn’t wait. She glanced sidelong at Agatha, then raised her voice just enough to carry. “Hey, Rio,” she called, tone light and loaded, “is Agatha a good kisser?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped walking. “Oh, you’ve lost your goddamn mind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen turned on her heel to face Agatha and crossed her arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was already stepping past them, moving smoothly toward the ER doors. She turned to walk backward, coffee in one hand, head tilted. “Sorry, Jen,” she said, shrugging. “A lady doesn’t kiss and tell.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly laughed. For one blissfully naïve second, she thought Rio might leave it there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then she saw it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The press of Rio’s tongue against the inside of her cheek. Her eyes dragged slowly down Agatha’s body, then back up again without apology. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The shift in energy was immediate, unmistakable. Jen glanced at Agatha and then back at Rio, waiting for the hit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gun to my head, though?” Rio continued, barely containing the grin that stretched across her face. “She’s incredible. Excellent technique. Very generous with-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop talking!” Agatha snapped, pointing after her. “You are willfully selling my soul to the fucking devil.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, all teeth and triumph, and raised her hands in mock surrender without missing a step. She reached for her badge, scanned it against the reader, and the doors swung open on cue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And instead of just walking away like a normal human being, Rio gave an exaggerated, theatrical bow, turned on her heel, and skipped a few steps through the doors. Without looking back, she tossed a casual wave over her shoulder. “Can’t wait to see you tonight,” she called out before vanishing down the corridor, whistling some absurdly cheerful tune with zero goddamn shame.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared after her, positively fucking dumbfounded. She tossed a useless hand in the air, exasperated. “Can someone remind me why I haven’t filed an HR complaint against her already?” She didn’t wait for a response. “Oh, right. She gives phenomenal head.” Then she turned and walked toward the elevators like she hadn’t just intentionally blown Jen’s brain out of her ears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“WHAT?” Jen shouted as she stood frozen in the hallway. Then immediately scrambled and rushed after Agatha, nearly tripping over her own feet as the elevator doors slid open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped inside unbothered, hit the button, and took another sip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You can’t just say that and walk away with zero explanation!” Jen shouted again, diving in after her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” Agatha said, casually. “Oh. Sorry. I thought you wanted details.” She glanced at the strangers around them and asked, far too loud and far too sarcastic, “Sisterhood of the Traveling Kegels? No? No?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Someone near the back of the elevator snorted. Another jabbed a button for the next floor with increasing desperation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re awful,” Jen hissed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The worst,” Agatha agreed sweetly. The elevator dinged. She stepped out smoothly, tossing over her shoulder, “Feel free to direct all further complaints to literally anyone else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had lucked out- only a two baby assignment tonight, both feeder/growers, both practically packing their bags waiting to be discharged. No micro-preemies, no frantic admits. She was stashed in one of the postpartum overnight rooms- normally reserved for parents, now repurposed as NICU overflow since the unit had exceeded its capacity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was starting to think Westview -and every town within a twenty-mile radius- had put a little too much faith in the pull-out method. And judging by the state of the NICU, it wasn’t going well.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Whatever her personal opinions on the town’s ongoing battle with birth control, Agatha couldn’t complain about the assignment. The room was quiet and blissfully removed from the main unit. No pod chatter, no alarms screeching, no babies trying to flirt with the Woman upstairs. Just two bassinets, both occupied by sleepy, stable babies who had no interest in anything but their next bottle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had just finished her first hands-on time: four scheduled windows in a shift to get everything done: assessments, diapers, feeds, vitals. and all the ritual baby maintenance wrapped in a thirty minute window. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>One down, three to go.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now she was swaddling the smaller baby of the two -Lennie- who had taken her bottle like a fucking champ, belched without shame, and was now staring at her with the blank, mildly betrayed expression of someone who had not consented to being burrito-wrapped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You do know this is temporary, right?” Agatha said, folding the blanket over with one hand and tucking it. “The room service ends the minute you graduate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lennie let out a small, indignant huff that Agatha chose to interpret as backtalk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, first of all, rude. Second of all, if you spit up in the next three seconds, we’re fighting.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lennie let out a soft grunt, eyes already drifting closed like she knew she could get away with anything, and Agatha would let her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly and watched her settle into sleep before crossing the room to the computer- what they all called a WOW, short or “workstation on wheels.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She logged in and started charting. The only drawback to this cushy setup was that neither of her babies had x-rays ordered tonight. No excuse for an x-ray tech to wander in. Good news for her patient. Bad news for her odds of seeing Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not that she was thinking about that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha kept her eyes on the monitor and told herself the silence was nice. Peaceful. Efficient.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was just finishing up when the door creaked open wider and her two hours of peace came to a swift, inevitable end.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hello, Agatha,” came Jen’s voice -flat, pointed- as she dragged a parent lounger across the room and plopped into it like she owned the place. She crossed her arms and sighed dramatically. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you wake either of these babies, I’ll kill you,” Agatha said calmly, fingers still tapping at the keyboard. “And I won’t be quick about it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Relax,” Jen whispered, settling in. “I’m being respectful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re being annoying.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen shrugged. “Tell me what happened between you and Rio.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to tell me everything. I’m just saying… if you wanted to talk, I’d listen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed and pressed her fingers to the bridge of her nose, specifically, to keep her from throttling her best friend. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We went to Sybil’s-“</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Her hot aunt,” Jen cut in, too fast.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The look Agatha gave her was nothing short of venomous- teeth clenched, chin tilted forward, every muscle in her jaw visibly restraining itself. “Are you going to let me finish?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen held up her hands. “Sorry. Please. Continue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We went to Sybil’s lake house for a few days. We didn’t kill each other. That’s it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But you slept together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even blink. “We’ve been sleeping together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen sat forward like she’d just heard a gunshot. “SIN-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha cut her off with a harsh shushing noise and a quick glance toward the babies.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen froze, then slowly leaned back into the chair, visibly trying to regulate her face into something less feral. Her voice, when it returned, was quieter- but still far from neutral. “Okay. Since when?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The night before the bowling alley.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen leaned in again, practically vibrating with energy. “So let me get this straight-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You want straight answers, ask a straight lady.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen blinked, unimpressed, then continued.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You called out last week so you could spend days uninterrupted being thoroughly, repeatedly, fucked by Rio Vidal? That’s amazing. I’m so proud of you I could cry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and sank deeper into her chair, arms crossed, legs stretched out. She didn’t dignify that with a response- which, unfortunately, only encouraged Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now- tell me. Is it everything you thought it’d be? Are you actually together now? Because I’ll be honest, I never thought I’d live to see the day you two finally got your shit together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>‘Is it everything you thought it’d be?’</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What a stupid fucking question. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because no. Not even close.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It felt like Rio Vidal -with her stupid green thumb- had planted something in Agatha’s chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A garden. Wild and alive and completely outside Agatha’s control.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She could feel it constantly, this thing Rio had made in her. Roots coiled around her ribs. Vines threading through her lungs. Flowers blooming behind her teeth every time she tried to speak. She couldn’t open her mouth without fucking petals falling out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was beautiful. And it belonged to her. Grown for her. She loved it completely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “It’s sex,” she said flatly. “We’re good at it.” Her eyes stayed on the monitor of her WOW, unmoving. Hoping if she focused hard enough on it, she could will the screen to erase the question. Or maybe just her reaction to it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen waited, brows raised. “Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>God. That voice. That tone. The one Jen used when she made it painfully clear she wasn’t the fool Agatha sometimes pretended she was, and they might as well cut the bullshit and get on with it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen said nothing else. She didn’t push. Didn’t dig. Just let the silence stretch- long enough for Agatha to get annoyed, which was half the strategy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Begrudgingly, Agatha pressed her lips together and finally looked at her- still silent, but no longer pretending this was a conversation she wasn’t going to have. It was a choice. A reluctant, defensive, unspoken </span>
<em>
<span>fine, but only because it’s Jen </span>
</em>
<span>kind of choice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen’s earlier amusement cooled, just slightly, into something more careful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you seriously about to reduce seventeen years of pining and psychological warfare down to </span>
<em>
<span>just sex</span>
</em>
<span>?” she asked, voice dropping to a hiss. “Because that’s what it sounds like. And that would be -frankly- fucking deranged.” She threw a mindful glance at the sleeping babies and then back at Agatha, voice still furious and hushed, “Seriously, do you hear yourself? You and Rio blue balled each other through the most spectacularly doomed friendship in recorded history, and now that you finally did something about it, </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> is what you’re going with?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And there it was. Jen, dead-on as always. Holding up a mirror and telling Agatha to look. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha resisted the urge to roll her eyes because Jen was </span>
<em>
<span>infuriatingly right</span>
</em>
<span>, and she wasn’t even being smug about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She could’ve lied. Could’ve thrown another joke at it. But what was the point? Jen had already seen the worst of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen was the only person Agatha had ever admitted anything about it to. Years ago, after she tried to kiss Rio, and Rio hesitated, then Agatha bolted like her skin was on fire. She’d gotten in her car, heart in her throat, shame like static in her mouth, and driven straight to Jen and Alice’s place. She didn’t knock on the door. She pounded. Over and over until Jen answered, bleary and backlit, took one look at Agatha, and didn’t ask a single question. Just stepped aside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha made it to the couch and completely lost it. Couldn’t breathe, couldn’t stop crying, couldn’t pretend it hadn’t meant anything. And somewhere in the middle of it -curled into Jen’s side, soaked in her own embarrassment- she said it. Quiet, hoarse, pathetic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“I can’t keep doing this to myself,” she had choked out, “If she loved me back… I’d know. I would’ve known.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen didn’t react. Just held her through it. One arm around her shoulders, hand in her hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Jen, to her credit, never brought it up again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed now. “Can you not say it like that? You make it sound like we’ve been edging each other since the Obama administration.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You literally have!” Jen hissed. Then, more gently: “Look, I’m not trying to poke at it, okay? But are we seriously gonna sit here while you lie to my face and then go cry in your car later because ‘it’s all moving too fast and your nervous system wasn’t built for this level of functional communication’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a withering look. “You’re not funny.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m hilarious. And you’re in lo-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha hissed, sitting up fast. “Can we not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No. Because I’m your voice of reason and gay panic management.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not doing this with you right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because it’s mine.” Agatha snapped. “It’s </span>
<em>
<span>mine</span>
</em>
<span>,” she repeated, quieter this time. “And I don’t- It’s too much. I feel like I’m running at capacity and I’m trying not to fuck it up just because I feel everything too hard. So yeah- if telling you it’s </span>
<em>
<span>just sex</span>
</em>
<span> keeps me from collapsing into a fucking puddle of unresolved feelings and poor life choices, then that’s what I’m calling it. It’s mine. Let me deal with it how I need to.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you told her that?” Jen asked, voice gentler now, but still cutting straight through her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, sharp and disbelieving. “Told her what exactly? That it’s easier to lie when she’s not standing in front of me? That I don’t know how to be inside something without controlling it or pretending it doesn’t matter just to avoid the risk of ruining it?” She stood, crossed the room, and leaned back against the counter. Arms crossed tight over her chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We went on one date,” she muttered. “And played house for a week. After over a </span>
<em>
<span>decade</span>
</em>
<span> of- ” she broke off, shaking her head. “Of nothing. It </span>
<em>
<span>felt</span>
</em>
<span> real, and it was good, and I wanted it. But wanting something that bad doesn’t make it sustainable. And I’m not betting everything on a fluke or a break in the goddamn weather.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen didn’t respond right away. She just watched her- quiet, steady, hands folded in her lap like she knew better than to move too fast.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know breaks in the weather still count as weather, right?” Jen said finally. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t do that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Make it poetic and feel safe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen stood, but kept her distance. “I’m not trying to make it safe. I’m telling you that just because it wasn’t in the forecast doesn’t mean it wasn’t real.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed. “I’ve driven myself up the fucking wall picking all this shit apart. And I’ve decided that it’s not actually that serious. So we don’t have to do all this, okay?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen gave her a long, flat and unimpressed look. “You’re so full of shit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span> that.” Agatha said, biting it out like it was obvious. “And more importantly? </span>
<em>
<span>She</span>
</em>
<span> knows that.” She shifted, jaw tight. “But talking about it like this, it doesn’t help. It makes it worse. So forgive me for wanting to keep her to myself for five fucking minutes without dissecting it like it’s a goddamn case study on emotional repression.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s a hell of a coping strategy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s better than buying a gun.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That startled a laugh out of Jen. Lennie stirred.  Both of them fell still, watching as the baby settled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Once the quiet returned, Agatha looked at Jen and said, “I’m not leaving again. If that’s what you’re worried about.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Something in Jen’s shoulders relaxed, the tension easing just slightly. “Good,” she said simply. Then added, “I’m going to hug you now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Too late.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t resist. She let herself lean into it- let her chin fall to Jen’s shoulder, her arms loose at her sides.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After exactly one minute, Agatha sniffed and pulled back with a grimace. “God. That was awful.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m nauseated.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t make this a thing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen raised both hands. “This? Never happened.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Perfect.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They stood in silence for a beat too long.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“... But if my car is mysteriously keyed again, I promise I will tell everyone in this hospital-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, “I said I was sorry! And we were twenty-three. Let it go, Jen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You keyed the wrong car, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was drunk and pissed Rio beat me in pool. It could’ve happened to anyone.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen scoffed. “It didn’t. And afterward, Rio let you key </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> car because you were still mad at her for winning.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “She only did that so I wouldn’t feel like an idiot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>“No. She did that</span> <span>because she was more worried about you still being upset with her than watching you key her car.”</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright. That’s enough. We’re done here.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Still the most romantic thing anyone’s ever done for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop talking, Jen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen didn’t have an assignment tonight -just tasking- so Agatha asked if she could sit with her babies while she took her lunch. Asked was generous. She told Jen, actually. Told her the exact time, too. Not around 4. Not after a feed. Four o’clock, sharp.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There might’ve been a reason for that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio, even now, was still a creature of habit. She still counted the seconds brushing each quadrant of her teeth. Still kept her keys in the same front pocket of that same beat up backpack. Still ordered her beers undressed. Still used the back of her knuckles to flip light switches. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And unless the earth had tilted off its axis, Rio was probably still taking her lunch  breaks at 4 a.m. sharp.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen showed up eleven minutes early. She made a whole performance of telling Agatha not to go over her thirty, but Agatha just smiled, because no one showed up eleven minutes early unless they expected you to run long. Jen knew exactly what this was. She didn’t ask why Agatha was being so precise, didn’t point out the way her eyes kept flicking to the clock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed a kiss to her cheek -loud, obnoxious, sloppy on purpose- and Jen shoved her off with a grimace. “You’re disgusting,” Jen muttered, already settling in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t look back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha made her way down to the radiology department on the ground floor, tucked at the furthest end of ER. She took a left into the alcove where five x-ray portable machines were lined up. The space wasn’t labeled, but Agatha knew it was where the portables lived when they weren’t being dragged upstairs or wedged into patients' rooms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t text Rio. Didn’t wait at her usual smoking spot, or theirs, or whatever it was now. Just showed up. Quietly. Casually. She figured it was a nice thing to do- thoughtful, maybe. Proof she was trying without making it a big deal. She wasn’t going to humiliate herself… not that the bar was especially high.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Past the portables and a right turn led into a hallway where the x-ray control booths were. It was the only section of imaging without a proper door, just a wide cutout in the drywall and a scattering of rolling chairs in the hallway outside of it, always in the way. Rio had once called x-ray the ugly redheaded stepchild of the hospital and rattled off a list of reasons so long that Agatha had no choice but to actually listen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was halfway down the hallway when screaming started- loud, chaotic, and completely unexpected. Then came a voice yelling “SHOT!” and the piercing beep of the x-ray machine firing off an exposure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha slowed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That wasn’t nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha paused just before the opening to the control booth, tucked herself to the side where she couldn’t be seen, and listened. Voices drifted from inside- one of them unfamiliar, a woman’s voice, tired and apologetic. “We have to get one more. I’m so-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman didn’t finish. A second later, someone -presumably a patient- let out a furious, guttural yell that echoed down the hall. Agatha flinched. It was nearly 4 a.m., and while she was used to infants wailing and monitors shrieking, grown adults screaming in close quarters threw her. The sound didn’t just break the quiet- it tore straight through it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman again, less gentle now. “Rio, I need you to hold again.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then Rio’s voice- steady, almost bored. “Sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>More conversation followed, low and clinical. Instructions exchanged, a strained explanation offered, the patient clearly irritated that another image needed to be taken.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha inched forward and glanced into the booth, just enough to see.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>To the left, a nurse sat at one of the computers, charting without looking up. On the right, Sage was sat posted at the main console, one hand resting on the exposure switch, the other adjusting the monitor in front of her. The live camera feed showed the patient's pelvis. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>From where Agatha stood, she could barely see into the exam room through the control booth’s lead-lined window. She stepped in a little further and reached out, poked the back of Sage’s shoulder. The girl flinched, quick and reactive, twisting in her seat like she was ready to tear into whoever had the nerve- until she saw who it was. Her whole expression changed, irritation dissolving into something entirely far too amused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well,” Sage said, leaning back in her chair, “You’re awfully far from home. Babies are on the fourth floor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged. “Was in the neighborhood,” she mumbled, already distracted, trying to peer through the glass for a better view of the exam room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Inside, Rio was geared up in lead, gloves on, standing at the head of the stretcher. There was an orthopedic resident at the foot of the bed- making adjustments, focused, fiddling with something Agatha couldn’t see from this angle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped back slightly out of view, careful not to draw attention. Rio had a habit of always finding her without even trying. But right now, she didn’t want to be found. She just wanted to watch Rio- quiet, selfish, unseen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sage gave her a once-over, then pressed her lips together and kept watching, like she was deciding how much she felt like starting something.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> “Sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No questions. No follow-up. Like Agatha showing up down here didn’t need an explanation. Like it wasn’t strange at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt herself exhale.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Thank fuck. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What the hell are they doing in there? Torture?” Agatha muttered, arms crossed as she leaned against the wall, eyes locking on the window- even though she couldn’t see Rio from here. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Close,” Sage said, tilting her head just enough to be annoying. “Traction.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced down at her. “You gonna explain, or am I just supposed to guess based on the screaming?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Patient’s got a proximal femur fracture,” Sage said, turning to the monitor and pulling up a previous image. She pointed to the break. “The bone fragments are overlapping, so Ortho applies traction -pulling in line with the leg- to temporarily realign them. It reduces the overlap enough to get a clearer image of the break. Looks awful, sounds worse, but it gives them a better idea of what they’re dealing with before they take the patient into surgery.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked at the screen, then glanced back toward the exam room. “You all just… do that? While the patient is awake?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sage didn’t answer. She just smirked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sage, get ready on the rotor,” Rio called out through the glass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My time to shine,” Sage whispered, already turning back to the console.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted closer to the window, careful to keep herself out of Rio’s eyeline. She leaned over slightly, one hand on the counter, craning for a better look. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The resident leaned in, adjusting her grip on the patient’s ankle, while Rio stepped forward and locked her arms under the patient’s shoulders. Agatha watched the way her feet shifted slightly, grounding her weight, her gloved hands already hooked in place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“One!” The resident called out. “Two!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sage immediately started rotoring, the mechanical hum of the x-ray machine kicking in as the resident began pulling on the patient’s leg. There was nothing subtle about it. She used her whole body, leaning backward with controlled force, and Agatha watched, equal parts horrified and intrigued, as Rio countered the movement without flinching like she was used to taking the brunt of the resistance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The patient screamed. Loud. Awful. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shot!” the resident shouted. The machine beeped. The pulling stopped. Rio let go of the patient and straightened, still calm, already speaking- soft, even, trying to talk the patient down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The patient, for their part, did not give a fuck. They were swearing impressively, hurling every profanity Agatha had ever heard and a few she hadn’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t blame them. If someone had pulled on her leg like that while another person held her down like a sandbag, she would’ve kicked, sworn, cried, probably bitten someone- then made it everyone’s problem, loudly enough to get security involved.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The resident came around behind the control booth a moment later and began flipping through the images on the monitor, squinting at the alignment. After a beat, she nodded. “We got it!” she called out through the glass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank fuck,” the patient shot back, their voice strained and shaky, still sharp with pain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The resident offered an apology and Agatha felt the nurse beside her rise from her chair, already heading into the exam room to take the patient back to their room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha eased back out of sight, pressing her spine lightly to the wall inside the booth. She told herself it was about being polite. Giving them space. Not hiding. Definitely not hiding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was inconvenient, how attractive Rio managed to be in the middle of something objectively horrifying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was all muscle memory and quiet force, wrapped in lead like it had been custom-fitted, holding her ground while someone screamed directly into her ear. It was ridiculous. Unnecessary. Kind of devastating.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was still trying to shame herself into sanity when the resident spoke again. Her tone had shifted- subtle, but there. Not that Agatha noticed. Not that she was listening. Not on purpose, anyway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You held perfectly,” the resident said. “Most techs don’t hold traction like that without complaining.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sage didn’t look up from the monitor, but her eyebrows rose by at least a centimeter. “Bitch,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio said nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You must work out,” the resident added, tone just professional enough to stay out of HR’s jurisdiction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand flew out and clamped down on Sage’s shoulder before she could think twice about it. Definitely harder than necessary. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sage flinched, looked at her, and immediately turned back around like she’d decided surviving the day mattered more than getting involved. She started working faster, dragging labels and slapping Rio’s initials on the screen -standard post-processing, every x-ray needed it- but Sage was acting with an urgency like her life depended on it. Which, to be fair, was a valid read of the room. Agatha knew exactly what she looked like- and maybe Sage wasn’t dumb enough to make eye contact twice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Out in the hallway, Agatha heard the squeak of wheels and the nurse’s voice trailing back through the open door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good luck. Seen a lot of folks try to rein the bad boy of x-ray in. Never ends well.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw locked. Her hand tightened on Sage’s shoulder, uselessly, like that was going to do anything. Her whole body was buzzing, trapped somewhere between walking out and seriously considering the fallout of throwing hands in a hospital. A nurse. An ortho resident. Both. She hadn’t decided yet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She heard the door shut. The patient was gone. The resident, unfortunately, wasn’t. Still inside, still talking- apparently immune to rejection, silence, or common fucking sense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No pressure or anything,” the resident said, lightly like it was a fucking joke, “but if you have a night you’re free... we should grab dinner.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha heard the rip of Velcro as Rio peeled off the lead apron. “No thanks. I’m seeing someone,” came Rio’s voice- calm, even. “Not really looking to complicate that.” A beat. “She also bites. Last person to try this needed stitches.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Silence followed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then came a low, guttural sound -half snarl, half bark- and the unmistakable snap of teeth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, her face was surely caught between horror and disbelief. The stitches comment was bad enough. But the sound effect? The fucking visual effect? That was theater. Completely unnecessary, painfully on brand… and unfortunately, kind of hot. Which only made everything worse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was going to commit murder. Maybe two. Depending on whether Rio kept talking or the resident kept breathing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hadn’t even landed on a name yet when Sage twisted around so fast it looked medically inadvisable. Her entire face was lit up- eyes wide, mouth open, jaw twitching like she was about to say something that would absolutely get her slapped. And given who she was related to, it was guaranteed to be bold. Bold and wildly ill-advised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t give her the chance. She pinched her shoulder, hard, and Sage let out a strangled noise between a gasp and a curse. Then she lunged at Agatha, looking absolutely feral, but Agatha shoved her back into the chair with one hand and zero patience. Sage stayed put, seething, practically vibrating, but wisely didn’t try again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then the resident’s voice- thin, a little breathless, like she wasn’t sure if she should apologize or run.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right. I- I didn’t mean- never mind.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The door opened. Agatha couldn’t see her leave, but she heard the rushed footsteps, fast and uneven, like someone trying not to look panicked while absolutely panicking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t smile. But she was close.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then she heard it- Rio’s footsteps. Getting closer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to leave, fast, trying to get ahead of the moment before it turned into something, but her foot caught one of the rolling chairs scattered around the booth.  She didn’t fall, but it was a mess- one arm shot out for balance, her other shoulder clipped the wall, and her heel caught on the chair causing it to rattle loud enough to announce her presence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha straightened and pivoted slowly, already composing a lie she wouldn’t believe if the roles were reversed. Something about needing to check on an order. Or tripping on air. Or Sage- yes, blame Sage. That seemed like a solid fallback.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Rio was already there, standing just inside the booth. Her eyes flicked to Agatha’s heel, then the chair, then back to her face- nothing but cool amusement and the faintest twitch of her mouth, like she was trying very hard not to smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha cleared her throat, nodded once, and said, “Sup.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Sup?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>SUP?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The word landed between them with the elegance of a brick smashing through a window.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her ears burn. She kept her face still, but it was a fight. Whatever expression wanted out didn’t belong in public. She didn’t look at Sage. She didn’t have to. That kind of glee didn’t need an audience. It announced itself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio said, not smug but maddeningly soft. “What are you doing down here?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Any excuse Agatha might have had evaporated on the spot. She felt her shoulders give slightly, and she felt the corner of her mouth betray her with the start of a smile- but then her eyes landed on Sage, seated directly in front of Rio, teeth sunk into the back of her hand like she was physically holding herself back from saying something stupid. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked back at Rio with a small shrug, “It’s four a.m.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sage immediately dropped her arms and slapped her palms against the desk. “Awww!” she whined, grinning now, turning toward Rio. “She knows what time you take your-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio cut her off with a sharp smack to the back of the head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“OW,” Sage barked, rubbing the spot and glaring at her, “I do </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>get paid enough to be physically assaulted by the both of you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio ignored her completely and stepped past, stopping in front of Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let’s go,” Rio said, nodding toward the hallway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha followed Rio out, and from behind them, Sage called out, loud and clearly offended, “Yeah, no, totally fine- I’ll just hold down the entire department alone. Love that for me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Neither of them looked back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just outside the department, they passed Teen hauling a portable back toward the bay. Agatha groaned. His eyes lit up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Were you looking for me-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not now, Teen,” Agatha snapped, not breaking stride. Neither did Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The walk felt longer than usual. Not tense, exactly, but not easy either. Eventually, Rio spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t see you when I came up to do morning x-rays.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They’ve got me in a postpartum overnight room,” Agatha said. “We’re running out of space to store the babies.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, and held the door open for her when they reached it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bad boy of x-ray, huh?” Agatha said, dry as anything, as they crossed the parking lot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio barely turned her head. “Didn’t realize I had an audience.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, not bothering to hide her lack of enthusiasm. “Didn’t realize you still had a reputation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That earned Agatha a smile. Predictable. Effortless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you miss the part where I said I’m seeing someone?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No, Agatha definitely didn’t. She heard it. Logged it. Pretended it didn’t make her chest feel stupid.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So instead, she said, “You said I bite,” breaking off to lean against the wall of the old administration building. She crossed her arms, waiting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stopped in front of her, the street lamp buzzing faintly around them. “You do,” she said simply, then softer, gaze steady. “Are you upset with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wasn’t upset. She was nowhere near that simple.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because Rio looked hot doing her job. Ridiculously so. She looked hot in those black scrubs she’d chosen to wear tonight. She sounded hot when she snapped her teeth at the resident: unhinged, dismissive, unbothered- as if the idea of anyone else asking her out was beneath consideration. And maybe Agatha should’ve been irritated by the reputation, by the way it still lingered in every room like smoke, even now. Maybe she should’ve rolled her eyes at how easily Rio let the world assume she was reckless, available, untouchable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she remembered what Rio had told her in confidence. That no one else touched her. That she didn’t let them. That she hadn’t wanted them to. That she only wanted Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha, for all her pride and reason and pathological need to stay in control, was decidedly not fucking angry. Not even close. She just wanted to kiss Rio- terribly, inconveniently, with an urgency that made her feel foolish for pretending she ever had the upper hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pressed her tongue to the inside of her cheek and shook her head, slow and helpless. She couldn’t speak. Not like this. Not with petals threatening to spill out of her mouth, soft and stupid and meant only for Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha uncrossed her arms and reached out. Rio took her hand without hesitation, let herself be pulled in like it was the only thing she’d been waiting for all night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their mouths crashed together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio melted into her, shameless. She whimpered into Agatha’s mouth the second Agatha let go of her hand, brought both up into her hair, nails dragging against her scalp. She opened her mouth like she was begging for Agatha’s tongue. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha gave it to her. She licked into Rio’s mouth like it belonged to her, dragged her tongue across the roof, the back of her teeth, the soft inside of her cheeks- every part she could reach, just to prove she could. Because Rio had asked for it with everything she had and Agatha wasn’t about to say no to that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They didn’t stop kissing so much as break it in pieces- barely pulling apart before finding each other again. It was all tongue, all friction, all of Rio’s soft, desperate sounds caught in Agatha’s mouth like confessions she had been all too willing to give. They kissed until they couldn’t. Until breathing became a problem and their mouths were too swollen to ignore it. Even then, Agatha barely pulled back- just enough to catch her breath, just enough to hear Rio laugh, soft and wrecked, head tilted forward against hers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I missed you,” Rio said, voice shredded, smile twitching at the corners of her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t flinch. She didn’t soften. She stared at her, panting and flushed, and whispered, “I hate you,” just before dragging her back in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Rio kissed her again like she knew exactly what Agatha meant. Like she didn’t believe a word of it. It wasn’t gentler the second time. They went right back to it, mouths colliding, hands grabbing, like they hadn’t wasted a second apart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha only hated one thing- that no matter how many times she said it, no part of her had ever, even for a second, been capable of truly hating Rio Vidal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had made it through one entire shift without caving. Without inviting Rio over. Without suggesting they crash at the same place, even though they were both working all weekend and could’ve easily justified it as practical. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After their Friday night shift, Rio got pulled into a trauma and texted her sometime around sunrise to say not to wait, that she was going to be stuck there forever. It was short. Casual. Practical. Agatha didn’t respond. She just went home alone and pretended that it didn’t bother her that Rio hadn’t walked her out to her car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She told herself it was fine. Reasonable, even. They were adults. Not everything had to be dramatic. Besides, Agatha figured it was healthy not to spend every second together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After seventeen years of emotionally compartmentalized bullshit, they hadn’t exactly eased back into each other. One kiss outside a bar and suddenly Agatha was waking up in a lake house, a crash course in domesticity, every moment ripe and blooming and too much. And when they returned to the real world, it showed. Agatha tried to be normal about it, but the silence of her own home after Rio was its own kind of violence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And when Agatha woke up Saturday afternoon, hours before her shift, she was inexplicably, irrationally furious. She dragged herself out of bed angry at the world. Angry at her sheets. Angry at the silence in her house. Angry at how cold her room felt without Rio pressed against her like some living furnace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha told herself it had nothing to do with the fact that Rio hadn’t been there to kiss her awake, the way she had every morning at the lake. Nothing to do with the fact that she had gotten used to it far too quickly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That would be ridiculous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Outrageous, really. Especially considering how precarious this whole situation was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wasn’t going to linger on how fast things were moving. She had been trying hard not to think about it at all, because not thinking made it easier to pretend it wasn’t happening. It kept her from hesitating. From pulling back. From second guessing every inch of progress they had made.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha worked her Saturday night shift like normal. Same assignment as the night before. During her moments of downtime, she took turns holding each baby against her chest, more for herself than for them, though she could justify it either way. The warmth helped. The rhythm of their breathing helped. It reminded her that softness wasn’t something she had to earn. That she could be tender and tired and still be good.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time her shift ended, she was barely holding it together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Rio was there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Leaning against the wall just outside the NICU doors, casual as anything, holding out a Diet Coke for her. Like Agatha hadn’t spent the last thirty-six hours actively trying not to think about her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took the soda. She said thank you. She smiled, barely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She tried, genuinely, to hold it together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she was exhausted and wired and stretched thin in every direction, and Rio’s calm made her feel like she was losing her grip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So she snapped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t even about Rio. But it came out harsh anyway- some offhanded jab, brittle and unnecessary, aimed more at the tension in her own chest than at the woman standing next to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t say anything. She didn’t move, didn’t flinch, didn’t even look upset. She just blinked, slowly, as if trying to make sense of a sentence in a language she hadn’t heard in years.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha would’ve preferred yelling.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sank her teeth into her tongue hard enough to sting. She didn’t apologize. She turned away fast, spine pulled straight, and walked across the parking lot without another word. She didn’t look back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha heard footsteps behind her- too fast, uneven, coming in hot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No. No way!” Rio’s voice called from behind her. She didn’t sound mad, just baffled. “No fucking way! Agatha- wait!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She kept walking. Reached the driver’s side door of her car and hit the unlock button, but it didn’t respond. She pressed it again, harder this time, like force would fix it. Nothing. It took a third try before the lights finally blinked and she yanked the door open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can you just stop for a second?” Rio was breathless as she reached her, slipping between Agatha and the open door before she could get in. “Help me out here, please. What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t look at her. She kept her eyes fixed on something past Rio’s shoulder- nothing in particular, just forward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move. “Really? Because that didn’t seem like nothing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha flicked her gaze toward her, then away again. “Maybe you’re reading too much into it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She saw it in the corner of her eye- Rio’s shoulders falling, the fight draining out of her posture in one breath. Agatha pressed her lips together, jaw tight, her mind racing but refusing to yield anything useful. Her body stayed frozen, her mouth stayed shut.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then Rio touched her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Fingertips brushed her cheek, gentle and familiar. Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut before she could stop them. She hated that. Hated that her body recognized Rio before her brain gave permission. She tried to turn away, barely- a twitch, not a protest. Weak. Ineffective. And Rio, of course, noticed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did I do something wrong?” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her eyes. She looked at her. Rio’s eyes were impossibly brown, catching the morning light until they looked touched with gold.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course you did. You let me need you. And I’m still paying for it. I’ve spent years trying to unlearn the shape of you in my life, and now here you are- my safest place and the reason I spent entire seasons trying to silence the answer. You are the comfort and the withdrawal and the ache in my chest. And I hate that I want to protect this. I hate that I’m trying to be careful with you. Because logic doesn’t help me anymore. Distance doesn’t fix it. Every time I try to do the right thing, it feels like I’m punishing myself for wanting you. And I do. I want you. I don’t want moderation. I want to wake up and find you there, and not have to explain why that’s enough.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes were steady on her, searching her face knowing the truth would be buried somewhere in the fine print. “Tell me what you need from me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha almost laughed. Or cried. She couldn’t tell the difference. Her whole body tensed, because hearing kindness hurt worse than anything else. She felt the answer catch in her throat, fragile and ridiculous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She opened her mouth, and a single petal fell out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I want you to come home with me,” Agatha whispered, the words catching on her breath. She didn’t dare look at Rio. The garden in her chest was already blooming wild, and speaking it aloud only made it worse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The words felt exposed, embarrassing in their simplicity, and already too late to take back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then I’ll come home with you,” Rio said, like it was the simplest thing in the world. No pause, no fuss. Her brow furrowed, not with confusion but because the answer was simple.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a short, breathless huff, shaking her head. She took a step back without meaning to, and Rio’s hand slipped from her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s only been two days, Rio,” she said, “I know how to be alone. I like being alone. But I- ”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She liked being around Rio. Still did. Still felt better for it. Rio was strange, meticulous, sometimes fucking infuriating- but never dull. There was no conversation, in all the years they’d known each other, that Agatha had walked away from feeling diminished. Rio never wasted her time. She only ever added to it. It used to feel unbearable. Now it just felt rare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So do I,” Rio said. Her voice didn’t rise. She didn’t try to make it more than it was. “And I hate to break it to you, but I’m kind of fucking obsessed with you. You’re, like, the coolest person I’ve ever met, and I want to be around you all the time. That’s never changed.” She paused, then shrugged almost gently. “So I’m not going to stand here and talk myself </span>
<em>
<span>-or you- </span>
</em>
<span>out of that just because we’re finally acting on what’s always been there. That’s not a problem I want to solve.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at Rio, stunned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She had spent years turning herself inside out in search of such clarity. And when that didn’t work -when the questions started to feel endless and one-sided- she carried her feelings for Rio silently, sometimes even convincingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And somehow, Rio had beaten her to it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not the feelings -those had never belonged to one of them alone- but the certainty.  To the terrifying ease of saying shit out loud. Like it wasn’t a risk. Like Agatha wasn’t one breath away from dragging Rio to the nearest courthouse, and getting it over with- just to prove that she had been ready long before she was ever willing to admit it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wanted to kiss her. Desperately. Stupidly. Entirely. Enough to forget every reason she had ever had not to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead, Agatha heard herself say, “I just feel like we shouldn’t be having sleepovers every day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled. That same infuriating, familiar smile she always used when she knew she had won. “We had fourteen years without a single one. I think we’re allowed to make up for lost time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha breathed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded once. “Good. Now get your fine ass in my car.” She shut Agatha’s door for her with one hand, already turning toward her own. “You can take yours back when we get off in the morning. I’m driving.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha called after her, all faux innocence. “You don’t want me to drive?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t miss a beat. “Listen. I know I’ve changed a lot. I’m hotter now, wiser, arguably ethereal, but your driving is still a public safety issue. And I still value my life. So no. Absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and got in Rio’s car- grinning the entire time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When they pulled up outside Agatha’s house, Rio circled to the backseat and pulled out her work backpack along with a small duffle bag.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at her, skeptical. “Were you planning on staying over?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No. It's the spare scrubs I keep in my car in case someone decides to bleed directly on me, or if I have to deal with fluids that should’ve stayed inside people. You know, fun working in healthcare stuff.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a low, unimpressed hum as they made their way inside. Shoes were left at the door. Upstairs, Rio talked through most of the walk- something about a patient who got flagged for an exam and refused to explain why he had a fork shoved up his ass. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha barked a laugh- loud, sudden, and completely involuntary.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio kept talking like she hadn’t just said the funniest thing Agatha had heard all week.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t say much in return. Didn’t need to. Rio filled the space between them like she always had, and for once, Agatha didn’t feel the urge to take it back.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They ended up in the bathroom without saying much. The walk in shower was already running, steam curling out into the open space. Rio stood with the door half open, one arm outstretched under the water, testing the temperature with her fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stayed at the mirror, brushing through her hair, watching Rio’s reflection more than her own.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let her eyes track the line of Rio’s spine, the shape of her ass-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio spoke- her voice lifted just enough to be heard over the water, but she didn’t turn around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When did you start hanging eucalyptus up again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at the bundle hung around the showerhead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She knew this wasn’t the first time Rio had noticed it. She also knew Rio had chosen not to say anything before now, which meant this moment had weight to it, even if Rio tried to pass it off casually. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There had been a time when Agatha picked up the habit from Rio without thinking. Even after everything, she never stopped. She didn’t feel the need to lie.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I never stopped,” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head slightly in the direction of her voice, not fully turning, but clearly listening. “No?” she asked, the word held carefully, as if hope had to be handled with both hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nope.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was enough to make Rio face her completely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their eyes met in the mirror. Agatha’s gaze dropped, dragging its way down Rio’s naked body like she had every right to look. And she did.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio crossed her arms, tongue pressing into the inside of her cheek as she caught Agatha’s eyes in the mirror. She didn’t say anything right away- then let a slow, amused smirk pull at the corner of her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fake ‘I don’t give a fucker,’” Rio said under her breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned slightly at the reflection. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t bother answering. She turned without hurry and stepped fully into the shower, letting the steam swallow the rest of her expression.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing, sweetheart,” she said over her shoulder, voice light. “Come shower with me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha did, without argument.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They spent too long in the shower. It started with Rio reaching around her to adjust the water and never really stopped. At some point, Agatha stopped pretending it was about getting clean. They kept kissing  -slow, greedy, mouths slipping over skin and steam like they'd both forgotten how to let go- and every time one of them pulled away, the other found a reason to start again. By the time they got out, Agatha had no idea how much time had passed. Only that she didn’t care.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After, Agatha stood in front of the mirror with the blow dryer, brushing out her hair in sections while Rio wandered off to dig through her drawers and eventually tugged on one of Agatha’s oversized t-shirts and nothing else before climbing into bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was already flicking through movie options by the time Agatha finished up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For the love of god,” Agatha muttered, catching sight of the screen. “Are you seriously about to put on </span>
<em>
<span>The Land Before Time</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked over at her, slightly offended, from under the blanket. “It has dinosaurs, Agatha. It’s a fucking classic.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t fight it. She threw on boxers and one of the thin strapped tank tops she slept in, then crawled into bed and sat back against the headboard, adjusting the pillows behind her. She didn’t even get a full second to adjust before Rio rolled over her, unapologetically claiming the space between her legs and leaning back against her chest like she belonged there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t roll her eyes. She didn’t make a joke or shift uncomfortably like it was too much. When Rio finally stilled, Agatha wrapped her arms around her waist and pressed a kiss to her shoulder. Then she rested her chin there, quiet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And sure, maybe Agatha tasted a little bile at the back of her throat from how disgustingly soft she was letting herself be- but honestly, what else was new.</span>
</p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Needless to say, Agatha regretted every decision that had led her to this moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time Littlefoot’s mother died, Rio was already sniffling audibly. Agatha stared at the TV in horror, her gaze flicking again and again to the remote still clutched in Rio’s hand, trying to devise a strategy for stealing it before this got any worse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How the fuck is this a children’s movie?” Agatha whispered, incredulous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer. Probably couldn’t- her sniffling had fully taken over. Agatha just sat there, slack jawed, arms still around Rio, willingly being held hostage in her own bed by a grown woman crying over </span>
<em>
<span>The Land Before Time.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then it happened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The shadow scene.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The part where Littlefoot mistakes his own shadow for his mother’s -runs to it, hopeful, before realizing the truth- was, somehow, even worse than her actual death. And Rio, this absolute fucking menace, lifted her arm, waved the remote weakly in the air, then let it drop uselessly against Agatha’s leg as she muttered, “Oh no fucking shot,” and burst into tears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Turn it off! Turn it off, you fucking sadist!” Agatha yelled, crying now too and beyond the point of reason, while she tried to wrestle the remote from Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Rio wouldn’t let go. She clutched it tighter and wailed, head thrown back dramatically against Agatha’s shoulder. “No! It’s </span>
<em>
<span>so good!</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eventually, when the storm of tears finally started to subside, Agatha -still hiccupping and snotty- asked, somewhere between a laugh and a gasp, why Rio even liked this goddamn movie in the first place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio turned her head slightly and, with the utmost seriousness, whispered, “I fucking love dinosaurs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a broken laugh and wiped her eyes on Rio’s shoulder, still sniffing, still barely composed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed her phone and snapped a picture: both of them flushed and puffy, tear-streaked and mid laugh. Agatha’s eyes were squeezed shut, her face red and blotchy from crying. Rio looked feral- mouth open, nose running, hair stuck to her forehead. Her shirt was crumpled from where she’d wiped her face with it, and the shoulder was soaked from Agatha doing the same. It was a disaster. A perfect one.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>It had been three months since Agatha suffered through </span>
<em>
<span>The Land Before Time</span>
</em>
<span>, woke up with Rio in her bed, got dressed beside her, and rode to work together without making it a conversation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In the grand scheme of things, it hadn’t been that long. But apparently it was long enough for Agatha to forget where the line had been- if she had ever actually bothered to draw one at all. Or maybe she just stopped looking for it. Maybe it blurred so slowly she convinced herself it never existed. Softened under the persistence of someone who used to, and still somehow did, know Agatha better than anyone else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They were in each other’s space more often than not. No plan. No routine. Just a trail of evidence neither of them bothered to hide:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s shoes by the door. A phone charger plugged in on the side of Agatha’s bed that Rio slept on. Agatha’s lotion in Rio’s bathroom- showing up out of nowhere after she’d complained about forgetting it. Agatha’s laundry folded and sorted in a way Agatha never folded it. An extra toothbrush in each of their bathrooms. Rio’s shampoo nearly empty in Agatha’s shower, replaced by Agatha -not that she was admitting it- without comment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They worked. Came home. Not always to the same place, but often enough. They didn’t have sleepovers every night. Agatha was glad for that- though she wouldn’t have known how to explain it if asked. It gave her the illusion of control. She still went to the gym alone. Still met Jen for drinks. Still came home some mornings and crawled into bed by herself, which was, if anything, mildly fucking irritating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But when she stayed at Rio’s -or Rio stayed at hers- sleep came easier. Quieter. Like her body had finally stopped bracing to wake up in Chicago and find it had all been a dream. Like it hadn’t forgotten, this time, where she was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Being this close to Rio wasn’t theoretical anymore. It used to come with boundaries- close enough to memorize every detail, never close enough to touch any of it. There were parts of her Agatha had never been permitted to know. Not when they were only best friends.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But now, cautiously, like she didn’t quite trust the generosity of it, Agatha was learning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It didn’t happen all at once. Rio handed herself over in pieces, in habits she didn’t know she was revealing. Agatha learned that Rio always reached for her fingers when she fidgeted- tracing the joints, tugging gently, twisting Agatha’s rings without seeming to notice. Like Agatha was the thing her body trusted first. Her hand would settle over Agatha’s chest when they kissed too long, too deep, like she was trying to memorize the rhythm of what lived beneath it. That she bites the inside of her cheek when she’s trying not to say something sweet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t know when she started memorizing it all. Only that now, if any of it disappeared- if Rio stopped reaching for her hand, if she stopped tripping over Rio’s shoes every time she walked through the door of her own house. Agatha would notice. Would ache for it, probably.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It would’ve been easier if she didn’t notice. If she could keep pretending this was physical, manageable, on her terms. But Agatha had always been observant, especially when it came to Rio. And now there were too many details, too many small things stitched into her days now to stop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was no milestone. No conversation. Just three months of quietly getting away with it- whatever </span>
<em>
<span>it</span>
</em>
<span> was. Rio kept showing up. Agatha kept letting her. Nobody labeled it. Nobody pushed. And Agatha, who hated explaining herself more than she hated most things, didn’t have to. They didn’t talk about what they were. They just… were. And that was enough.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Most of their mornings off together blurred into each other over those three months. Agatha would sit at the kitchen island during staff meetings with laptop open, her camera off, pretending to listen while flipping through the </span>
<em>
<span>Westview Weekly</span>
</em>
<span>, which now came out monthly for reasons no one had ever adequately explained. She had only put herself back on the mailing list for the crossword- a fact she refused to unpack, even privately.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In the beginning, Rio would wander in wearing socks, an oversized t-shirt, and no underwear, muttering that the Keurig brewed coffee so flavorless it always tricked her into thinking she was coming down with a sinus infection. Over time, the complaints softened into a grimace. Then a squint. Sometimes, if Agatha was lucky, Rio would take a sip, wrinkle her nose, and spit it back into the mug- only to set it just within Agatha’s reach. Then Rio would stare at her- completely silent, clearly waiting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha drank it every time. Of course she did. And Rio would watch, unblinking, like it didn’t count unless she saw it happen. Like watching Agatha drink it was the whole point. Which was, objectively, disgusting. And weird. And, somehow, very Rio- the exact kind of thing Agatha should have put a stop to.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Agatha never did. She drank it, made direct eye contact, and quietly got away with it- paid the small, revolting price of drinking coffee Rio had spit back into a mug, without admitting she only did it to see the gap between her teeth when she smiled at Agatha afterward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t obvious at first. Just a few familiar moves, spread out over three months- a game Agatha had started seventeen years ago circling back like it had never ended.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snooped the way Agatha stole her things- compulsively, competitively, and -only recently- with enough creativity and deranged flair to turn petty theft into foreplay, complete with framed evidence and a fucked up sense of hospitality.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had always stolen Rio’s things. Not anything important- just stupid, obvious shit Rio would definitely notice was missing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was the fun of it. There was comfort in possession, sure, but also in chaos. A younger, less dignified version of herself used to hide things in increasingly deranged places just to see what Rio would do about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Back then, Rio never said a word. She’d just find whatever she was supposed to find and move it somewhere painfully obvious- on purpose, obviously. Agatha took it as a challenge. So she escalated. Started stashing things in her underwear drawer, her box of sex toys, the bottom of her dirty laundry basket. Places no one should be. Places she </span>
<em>
<span>wanted</span>
</em>
<span> Rio to be.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And of course Rio snooped. Agatha had made sure of it. At twenty-four, she used to check afterward- not because she was nervous, but because she wanted proof. She wanted Rio to take the bait. To slip, to steal, to be a freak. But she never took anything. Not once. Not even when Agatha made the message loud and perverse and impossibly fucking clear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Or so Agatha thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Five weeks into it -whatever they were doing- Agatha noticed the first photo after coming home from hanging out with Jen. It was resting on the credenza beneath her television- framed, angled just enough to be intentional. One of the pictures she’d stolen from Rio’s apartment. The one of all four of them -Rio, Jen, Alice, and herself- curled on Rio’s old couch, crammed into a single frame like nothing could ever touch them. She’d hidden it at the back of a kitchen cabinet, behind a stack of things she never used. And now it was back. Out in the open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She ignored it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A week later, another one surfaced.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On her nightstand this time. Just the two of them- young, pressed together on Rio’s old fire escape, laughing at nothing. She’d buried that one in the back corner of her underwear drawer, under a few pairs she never wore, like that somehow made it easier to forget.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha responded by doing the only thing Rio wouldn’t expect. She left the frames out where Rio put them. Didn’t move them. Didn’t speak. Just let them sit there like they belonged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she saw how Rio looked at them when she came over. Quick glances. Cheek dented just slightly from where she was biting it- trying not to smile, trying not to say something so insufferably fucking sweet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Seven weeks in, Rio upped the ante. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha came home and found a pair of a underwear folded neatly on her pillow. Familiar, but wrong. It took a second to click. She hadn’t seen them in fifteen years. They weren’t misplaced. They were gone. Stolen. Forgotten. And now returned, with no explanation, no shame.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>All that time, she’d been trying to provoke something that had already happened. Rio had stolen her underwear- just like Agatha always hoped she would. She just hadn’t noticed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat on the edge of the bed, stared at it like she was waiting for the fabric to blink. She didn’t touch them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was disgusting. Obviously. But it was also romantic- in the most specific, personal, deeply fucked up way imaginable. And undeniably, the most deranged gesture of affection Agatha had ever received.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This was just the latest round. She stole. Rio found. And now, apparently, Rio curated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And because Agatha was still Agatha, she did the next logical thing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stole all of Rio’s butter knives. Hid them in increasingly inconvenient places around her house- under her mattress, inside her current box of sex toys, buried just beneath the soil in the flower bed out front. Pointless sabotage. A silent little tantrum.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And the final knife, Agatha wrapped in a pair of her own dirty underwear. Still reeking of the night before on the couch, when Rio had done nothing but dry hump her- one hand cupped over cotton, fingers pressed firm, unmoving. No dirty talk. Nothing theatrical. Only Rio’s breath- hot and shallow against her ear, the side of Rio’s face pressed close, lashes brushing Agatha’s temple. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Every grind of Rio’s hips had felt smug. Like she knew exactly what she was doing and how little it took. Agatha had come like that. Full body. Furious. She’d kept still through it, too- jaw locked, hands gripping Rio’s ass. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She buried the wrapped knife in a basket of her dirty laundry and moved the fuck on.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t forgiveness. Or closure. It wasn’t even about winning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was maintenance. Something to trim back the vines curling around her ribs. To swallow the petals behind her teeth instead of saying what she meant- just for a little while longer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha offered cutlery and cotton and the faint suggestion of a threat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And if Rio didn’t see it for what it was, Agatha would try again tomorrow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio kept up with Agatha’s front yard. Not just once- every time it needed it. Mowed. Watered. Dragged the hose back into place without being asked. She never said anything. Never announced it like a favor. It was just upkeep- quiet, consistent, annoying in the way that made it impossible to tell her to stop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then, on a random Wednesday, she spent the entire day on Agatha’s backyard. Showed up before noon, kissed Agatha hello, and got to work- raked, trimmed, cleared out the corners no one else saw. At one point, she looked up and asked if they should stain the deck before it got cold. Agatha shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That night, Agatha ordered new outdoor furniture. Overbuilt, overpriced, meant for people who hosted things. A long table. Heavy chairs. Lights she didn’t need. It arrived two days later.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sometimes they sat out there, just the two of them. Smoked. Shared a blanket even when it wasn’t that cold. Rio would pass her the lighter without looking, always somehow knowing when she reached for it. Their knees would bump. Their hands would stay close. Every now and then, Rio would tilt her head and say something stupid just to make her laugh. And it worked. It always worked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And sometimes, Rio would lean over and kiss her- soft, thoughtless. A brush of her mouth against Agatha’s cheek, or the corner of her mouth, or wherever she could reach without moving too much. No lead up. No comment. Just a kiss people gave when they already knew it would be returned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha never stopped her. Never made a joke out of it. She just leaned in, kissed her back, and let it happen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t a big deal.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They both went to game nights. They kept their distance in the ways that counted. No lingering touches. No hovering. Agatha kept her hands to herself, and Rio mirrored the restraint. There were no questions. No stares. They weren’t obvious. Not really.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Still, they found each other. Always. In the middle of a loud table, over a losing hand, across a crowded room- Agatha would glance up and Rio would already be looking. Sometimes with a smirk. Sometimes with nothing more than a stare that lingered too long. They moved around each other the way they always had: easy, unthinking, intimate. Close enough to feel it. Careful enough to make sure no one else did.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sometimes they snuck off. A hallway, the bathroom, anywhere that felt far enough away to breathe. There was one night Agatha had spent the entire time trying not to look at Rio. Or, more accurately, trying not to notice that Rio wasn’t looking back. She could feel it. The ache of attention not being paid. And when Rio’s eyes finally met hers -brown turned a shade darker- Agatha got up without a word and walked straight to Rio’s car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio followed. They fucked in the back seat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They came back separately. A few minutes apart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha returned to the table first, unnoticed. The others were caught in the middle of a loud debate over whether Teen had cheated during the last round, and no one looked up when she slipped back into her seat. Her drink was still sweating onto the table, the condensation pooling at the base, untouched. She reached for it and kept her eyes on the game, letting the noise wash over her until her pulse slowed to something manageable.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A few minutes later, Rio sauntered back in- shirt wrinkled, expression lazy, like she'd only stepped out for fresh air and not sex that had left Agatha biting the inside of her cheek to keep quiet. She dropped into the seat beside Sage, still chewing the last bite of a brownie.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>Sage barely looked away from the game when she asked, casually,</span> <span>“Where’d you go?”</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t bother with words. She held up two fingers and flicked her tongue between them obnoxious and smug and deeply proud of herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The color drained from Sage’s face so fast it was almost impressive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even blink. She reached for the nearest Jenga block and whipped it across the table. Rio ducked easily, the block sailing past her head and bouncing against the wall behind her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She grinned, teeth bared, eyes cutting toward Agatha with the same look she’d worn ten minutes ago in her backseat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Later that night, in the kitchen, Jen leaned against the fridge like she’d been waiting all night to get Agatha alone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>“So. Car sex?” Jen asked, already smirking.</span> <span>“Rate it. One to ten.”</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and reached for the whiskey.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eleven.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The group hangouts kept happening. Birthdays, game nights, the occasional special breakfast cobbled together after work. Sometimes they arrived separately. Sometimes they didn’t. Maintained the illusion of moderation in between. They were careful. Enough space to pretend. Enough heat to make it interesting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At some point, Agatha started treating it like a game.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She started paying attention. Started keeping score. How long it took for Rio to crack. Whether she’d get a look across the table or be ignored entirely. Whether touching Rio’s wrist in front of everyone would earn her a shiver or a shrug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sometimes Rio cracked early, gave her a look across the table that made her forget what she was saying mid sentence. Other times it took longer. More work. A hand on Rio’s wrist, a whisper too close to her ear, a smile that said </span>
<em>
<span>don’t you dare pretend you’re not thinking about it.</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha kept going until something gave. Until she saw it: the slip, the shiver, the way Rio would bite her bottom lip and try not to grin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha liked it too much. The pacing, the patience, the slow pull of it. Rio pretending to hold the line. Agatha pretending she didn’t know exactly how to make her give it up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen’s birthday dinner should’ve been no different.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It started at her house. Alone. Jen’s birthday was always absurd- some too-fancy restaurant, dress code implied but never stated, and the annual tradition of everyone being forced to say one nice thing about her while she beamed like she hadn’t orchestrated the whole thing herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chose a rust colored suit with a pinstriped button up, gold hoop earrings, and black heels. She did her makeup without overthinking it, straightened her hair until it looked uncharacteristically tame, and by the time she stepped back to check the mirror, the result was undeniable- she looked fucking phenomenal, and she knew it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>While she got ready, she texted Rio- under the guise of coordinating outfits, like it was about not clashing instead of wanting to know. Asked what she was wearing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio answered: </span>
<em>
<span>idk. maybe slacks. a button up.</span>
</em>
<span> No photo. No tease.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Fine. Agatha put her phone down and pretended it didn’t bother her. Touched up her makeup just to have something to do with her hands. Then she picked up her phone again and sent the only logical follow up: </span>
<em>
<span>boobs?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If Rio wasn’t going to send a picture of her outfit, maybe she could be convinced to send something better. Something useful. Something Agatha could think about through dinner.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No reply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Which, frankly, told Agatha everything she needed to know. And also made her want to hurl her phone across the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha got to the restaurant early- already a red flag. She was never early. Rio was always the first one to show up to things. Painfully punctual and borderline irritating about it. Always waiting somewhere just out of sight, pretending she hadn’t been standing there for ten minutes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But this time, Rio wasn’t there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Everyone else was scattered on the sidewalk outside the restaurant, minus Jen, Alice, and the one person Agatha couldn’t stop thinking about. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She spotted Sage right away, hovering too close to Yelena, who was pretending not to notice in a way that was practically an invitation. Teen waved her over and launched into a story before Agatha even reached the curb.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored him and cut straight to Sage, “Where the fuck is your sister?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sage scowled, “I don’t know. I’m not her handler.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and stepped back into the periphery, arms crossed tight against the ridiculousness of how hard she’d tried. Her phone sat heavy in her pocket. Her blazer was too warm. Teen kept talking beside her, but she couldn’t hear a word of it. All she could focus on was the fact that Rio still wasn’t there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Not late. Just making Agatha wait.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha, fully aware of what was happening, stayed exactly where she was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The shift in energy landed before the sound of heels on pavement. Billy trailed off midsentence. Someone let out a low whistle. And when Agatha finally looked up, Rio was already halfway across the parking lot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was wearing a ribbed brown dress- fitted, low cut, held up by two wide straps fastened with silver bulb things that caught the light as she walked. Her heels clicked with purpose, not rush. Her hair was down. Her makeup was done. No jewelry except for a slim band on her right hand and a watch on her left wrist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stood a few feet away, trying to look composed, while every cell in her body seriously considered abandoning pride and resorting to audible panting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let her eyes drag, slow and shameless, from the cut of the dress to the shift of Rio’s hips to the glint of that damn watch. She didn’t bother softening it. Didn’t try for subtlety. If Rio wanted to play in public, fine. Let her feel it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And all Agatha got in return was a slow lift of Rio’s eyebrows and a breathless, almost amused, </span>
<em>
<span>“Hey,”</span>
</em>
<span> like they were strangers bumping into each other in a grocery store aisle. Then she settled beside Sage, and asked where Jen was- as if Agatha wasn’t seconds from chewing through concrete just to get her mouth on Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen and Alice arrived not long after Rio, which meant the group was now complete, if a little chaotic. There were cheers and hugs and someone -definetely Teen- shouting “Birthday bitch!” loud enough for it to echo. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The second Jen’s eyes landed on Rio -still posted up beside Sage- she didn’t even try to play it cool. She gave her a look that was well beyond friendly. Top to bottom. Bottom to top. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly started barking. Jen was lucky she was married to Alice, because Agatha had never ruled out murder as a valid coping strategy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The group shifted toward the restaurant entrance, pulled by the promise of air conditioning and overpriced cocktails. Agatha hung back. So did Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>Only once she reached Agatha did Jen lean in and mutter,</span> <span>“You doing all right?” through a breathless laugh, like she knew </span><em><span>exactly</span></em><span> what kind of hell Agatha was walking through.</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snapped her head toward her. “What the fuck do you think? I’m one polite conversation away from bursting into flames and licking her face.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen rolled her eyes.</span>
<em>
<span> “</span>
</em>
<span>You’re fine. And tonight is about me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How could I forget, birthday girl,” Agatha muttered, placing two fingers against her lips before dramatically smooshing them onto Jen’s mouth with a fake kiss.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen shoved her off with a scoff and slapped her ass as she walked past, hard and unapologetic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha yelped -offended and delighted- and loud enough to turn a few heads. </span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t be dramatic,”</span> <span>Jen said.</span> <span>“You’ll live.”</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>No promises, Agatha thought, but she followed everyone inside anyway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Dinner was fine. Loud, pleasant, full of clinking glasses and people who genuinely liked each other. Everyone took their turn saying something heartfelt or embarrassing about Jen, which Agatha chimed in when it was her turn. She said something disgustingly sincere. Something Jen would absolutely never let her live down. There were groans. Laughter. Someone called her soft. Whatever.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was about the only part of the night that felt manageable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because Rio was seated just far enough down the table to be strategically inconvenient. Close enough for Agatha to hear the sound of her laugh, to watch how her fingers wrapped around a water glass, to notice the way she hadn’t looked at Agatha once since sitting down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha wasn’t stupid. She knew how much control it took for Rio to keep her face that blank, how much effort it took to maintain that absolute refusal to glance in her direction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It might have been flattering if Agatha didn’t feel like she was overheating. Her skin was too warm, her legs wouldn’t stop shifting beneath the table, and she could feel her heartbeat in places that had no business pulsing during dinner. It was starting to border on obscene- how worked up she was from absolutely nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Still, Agatha gave it time. Longer than she wanted to. Let Rio sit with it, let her pretend she wasn’t feeling it too. But the longer it went on, the more it started to itch. Because whatever Rio was doing, it was working- and Agatha was three chairs down, seriously refraining from throwing her knife across the table just to get Rio to look at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If Rio wasn’t going to give her anything, then fine.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha picked up her phone, held it low in her lap, and started texting her. No buildup. She described exactly what she’d do to Rio the second they were alone, graphic enough that her thighs pressed tighter under the table before she even hit send.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Rio’s phone buzzed, Agatha watched as she glanced down, read the message, and set her phone face down beside her plate without so much as a blink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s pulse kicked hard in her throat. If filth wasn’t going to break Rio, then maybe the threat of sincerity would.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>She typed again, this time slower. Told Rio she looked beautiful.</span> <span>Told her she missed her. That she couldn’t stop thinking about her. It wasn’t poetry, but she meant it.</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Rio looked at her phone again, Agatha saw her bite the inside of her cheek while reading them. And Agatha felt like she was starting to win a battle no one knew was happening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Still, not enough.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned her attention to Sage, seated beside Rio and too caught up in whatever nonsense she was saying to notice the look Agatha was drilling into the side of her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha cleared her throat. “Sage,”</span> <span>she hissed.</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sage turned, still grinning. That faded the second she saw Agatha’s face- smile too wide, eyes too direct.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha mouthed, </span>
<em>
<span>Check your phone.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sage blinked, reached for it like it might bite, and read the message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Switch seats with me. Now.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A pause. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Sage</span>
</em>
<span>: </span>
<em>
<span>Why?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t bother texting her response. She hissed through clenched teeth, “Because I said so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sage rolled her eyes and pushed her chair back with a loud sigh that made no secret of her martyrdom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stood before she finished moving. She rounded the table and took the seat next to Rio without hesitation, without ceremony, without bothering to hide the fact that she’d wanted this all night. She let her arm brush against Rio’s as she adjusted her blazer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Rio didn’t look at her. She was too busy talking to Alice about the fucking WNBA and a green dildo that had apparently been thrown onto the court during a game. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha waited for a lull in the conversation before leaning in, close enough that her breath brushed Rio’s ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio turned toward her like she was expecting it -like she </span>
<em>
<span>wanted</span>
</em>
<span> it- and Agatha nearly lost it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Whatever perfume Rio was wearing had no business smelling that good. She wanted to lick up the entire side of Rio’s face. She felt deranged. Like some mutt who caught the scent of a female in heat and was ready to claw through a fence just to hump the air nearby.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You look really pretty,” Agatha whispered, barely holding it together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>Rio inhaled like she could smell the desperation radiating off Agatha. “Thanks,”</span> <span>she murmured back. “You look really good.”</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was enough to make Agatha feel even worse. Or better. It was hard to tell. Her blood felt like it had started to hum. Her body wasn’t really behaving anymore. Her leg pressed against Rio’s under the table, not accidentally, and she didn’t move it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move her leg either. But with an unholy amount of composure, she turned back to Alice and kept talking.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the side of her face, stunned. It took her a full second to remember she had bones, that her body was meant to function in public. She blinked, tried to breathe, and waited for the next lull in conversation. Then she tapped Rio’s thigh, leaned in close again, voice just above a whisper.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bathroom?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t even glance over. “I don’t have to go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had to laugh- breathless, borderline hysterical. Fine. She could be patient. She could wait. She’d play the long game. She </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> the long game.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slid her hand onto Rio’s thigh beneath the table without looking at her. She smiled at other people, answered questions, told Billy to stop trying to guess her middle name.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After a while, Rio’s hand moved. It didn’t reach for Agatha’s. Didn’t push her away either. It settled in front of Agatha’s, resting lightly on her own thigh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha moved hers without hesitation. Slipped it beneath Rio’s palm. She held it beneath the table, steady and certain, until Rio’s fingers threaded through hers. Her thumb moved against the side of Agatha’s, soft and almost thoughtless. She saw Rio’s teeth catching the inside of her cheek again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked away fast, like she hadn’t seen it. Like it hadn’t hit her square in the chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But it felt like maybe Rio had been waiting all night for her hand to be held.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t push. Just let Rio keep holding her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the end of dinner, Agatha felt like she was crawling out of her skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Out front, everyone lingered. People hugged Jen. Laughed. Took one last round of blurry, overexposed photos. Agatha waited her turn, half listening to Sage complain about Billy forgetting his card inside.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Night, guys,” Rio called over her shoulder- same tone as everyone else. No glance back. No private signal. No </span>
<em>
<span>see you later.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. Her heart thudded once, annoyed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She speed ran through her goodbyes, pulled Jen into a hug that bordered on violent.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t drive like a crazy person stalking her,”</span> <span>Jen said into her ear.</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grunted. Bolted anyway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t drive like a maniac. Not exactly. She stayed three cars behind Rio. Took every legal turn. Obeyed every traffic law like she wasn’t actively stalking someone who’d already given her a key to her apartment weeks ago. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Once she was parked, she dug through her duffle bag until her fingers hit the harness. Familiar leather. The dildo was already buckled in, curved and heavy and impossible to mistake for anything else. Agatha looked around once, unbuttoned her pants, and shoved them down with more urgency than grace. Her underwear was ruined. She peeled them off and threw them to the back of her car without thinking twice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Getting it on wasn’t the problem. Getting her pants over it was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her slacks were tailored, unforgiving, and not designed to accommodate seven inches of silicone. She angled herself awkwardly in the seat, one foot braced on the dash, trying to hold the base steady while shimmying the waistband over the harness. It caught at her hips. She cursed under her breath. Adjusted. Shoved.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eventually, Agatha managed to button them. Barely.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The zipper didn’t stand a chance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The bulge was there- undeniable, obscene, and far too prominent to be ignored. She grabbed her duffle bag, held it directly in front of her like a shield, and stepped out of the car with the rigid determination of a woman who had already committed the crime and was simply walking toward the sentence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The elevator was already on the ground floor when she walked in, the duffle bag still clutched tight against her hips. She hit the button and stepped inside, ready to ascend in shameful silence, alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She almost made it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hold the elevator?” someone called from across the lobby.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s panic response was immediate and deeply unflattering. She stabbed the </span>
<em>
<span>door close</span>
</em>
<span> button with urgency, jabbing it multiple times in rapid succession like that might actually work.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It didn’t.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The stranger caught the door with one hand, smiling politely as he stepped inside. Mid thirties, earbuds in, holding a bottle of wine and what looked like a frozen pizza. He didn’t say anything else. Just nodded in that vague, harmless way strangers do in elevators.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded back. Brief. Controlled. Her arms stayed locked around the duffle as it was the only thing standing between her and a public indecency charge.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The ride was painfully slow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She could feel the dildo shifting with every tiny movement, pressing awkwardly against the fabric of her slacks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The man didn’t look at her. Didn’t say a word.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He got off on the third floor, still oblivious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled through her nose and adjusted the bag, now damp against her palms. She was flushed. Sweating. Half buttoned and deeply committed to the bit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time the elevator doors opened again, her heart was hammering, her pants were pinching at the hips, and she had never felt more insane.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s door was unlocked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Of course it was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t knock. She stepped inside, closed it behind her, set her duffle bag down, and made her way down the hall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood at the kitchen counter, haloed by the soft gold light above the sink. She hadn’t changed. Her dress still clung to her in all the ways that made Agatha’s pulse spike. Her heels were still on- an intentional oversight for someone who never wore shoes inside. But now? Now she was standing at the counter like sin incarnate, in a dress that should’ve been illegal and stilettos she’d clearly kept on just to be cruel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nearly wailed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her posture was unbothered, nearly bored. One hand steadying a glass, the other reaching for the bottle of whiskey she only kept for Agatha. She poured two drinks like she’d expected this. Like she’d known Agatha would show up- ridiculous, vibrating under her skin, strapped into a harness under too tight slacks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t turn around.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed the room slowly, dragging her hand along the wall, then the edge of the counter- touchpoints to keep her from combusting. When she reached Rio, she didn’t stop. Just stepped into her space and slid both hands around her waist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Still, Rio didn’t flinch. She continued to pour like nothing was happening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in and let her palms slide lower. Over Rio’s hips, her stomach. Her fingers twitched against the fabric of her dress, then kept going- settling between her legs, cupping her fully. Firm. Certain. Possessive, even through the fabric.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The bottle wobbled in Rio’s grip. She set it down- carefully, deliberately. Fingers still curled around the neck, like it wasn’t because Agatha’s hand was between her legs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then Agatha stepped in fully. Her front met Rio’s back with no resistance. The bulge beneath her pants pressed against Rio’s ass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gasped. The bottle jerked in her grip, knocking into the cluster of glasses with a loud clatter that echoed off the walls. Her free hand shot forward to catch the edge of the counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t move. Didn’t gloat. Just held steady as Rio tried, and failed, to pretend she wasn’t folding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It took a second.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But Rio’s hand slipped from the bottle, the other still braced on the counter. It drifted down, slow and uncertain, until it found Agatha’s- still pressed between her legs, firm, unforgiving. Her fingers hovered for a second, then settled on top. She rolled her hips- hard, slow, grinding back into Agatha just enough to test the shape of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re insane,” Rio said, breathless, almost laughing. She leaned back into her fully now, spine pressing Agatha’s front, her neck arched to the side in offering. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled into the side of her neck. “You ignored me all night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It worked, didn’t it,” Rio asked, and Agatha could hear the lazy smile curling in her voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>“It pissed me off,” Agatha muttered. She pressed the heel of her hand in harder, slow and mean, right over Rio’s clit- making Rio’s breath catch. “You know,”</span> <span>she murmured, lips brushing the skin beneath Rio’s ear. “You could’ve just asked me to hold your hand. Would’ve saved us both the trouble.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I got what I wanted,</span><em><span>” </span></em><span>Rio breathed, not even bothering to lie. “And I got to watch you squirm through an entire dinner over how badly you wanted my attention.”</span> <span>Then -quieter, crueler, victorious- “How wet are you, Agatha?”</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>At this point, Agatha didn’t give a shit about dignity. She whined into the open mouthed kiss she was pressing into Rio’s neck, breath hot and ragged. “So wet, baby.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The moan that broke from Rio’s mouth was high and obscene in its thrill. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha felt it in her teeth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio turned in her arms. Her breath caught as she moved, like the act of facing Agatha might undo her completely. She didn’t look up right away. Her hand dragged down Agatha’s torso, knuckles grazing the buttons, the waistband of her slacks, before finally resting low- right over the bulge. Palm open. Possessive.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>Her eyes were dark, fixed on her own hand palming the bulge through Agatha’s slacks.</span> <span>“God,” she murmured, the corner of her mouth curling into a lazy, crooked grin, “I would’ve paid to watch you wrestle your pants over this.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha laughed under her breath, eyes flicking to Rio’s mouth.</span> <span>“It sucked. I got stuck in the elevator with some guy holding a bottle of merlot and a frozen DiGiorno.”</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes snapped up, soft with amusement, but her body still hummed with want. “Poor baby,” she whispered, her voice thick with sympathy she didn’t mean, already thumbing at the button.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed. “It was an ordeal.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, already easing the waistband down. The slacks caught immediately- tight around the strap on, stubborn at her hips. She crouched slightly to work them lower, then gave one last tug, and the slacks finally cleared the strap on, sliding down to Agatha’s thighs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She straightened without a word and reached for Agatha’s shirt, her fingers steady as she worked open the first button. Then the next. Her face gave nothing away- no smirk, no teasing, just a quiet focus that made Agatha’s skin prickle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha, for once, said nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She couldn’t. Her breathing was shallow, her arms slack at her sides, and she could feel the strap on pressing between them, more unbearable now that Rio was undressing her like it was the only thing she’d ever been meant to do.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time Rio reached the last button, Agatha’s restraint snapped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She surged forward and kissed Rio- hard, fast, no space left between them. The force of it drove Rio back against the counter, and still, she didn’t resist. Her hands came up immediately, one curling in Agatha’s hair, the other curling into the fabric of her shirt. Her mouth opened against Agatha’s like it had been waiting all night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They both moaned into it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha broke the kiss first, panting, dragging her mouth against Rio’s jaw, her neck, dragging her teeth in short, uneven bursts. Her hands were already on Rio’s dress, pulling the straps down over her shoulders, rough with urgency.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let her. She was breathing hard now, hand in Agatha’s hair, eyes fluttering shut as Agatha kissed down to her chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you wear this for me?” Agatha asked, voice low and wrecked, mouthing along the top of her chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t hesitate. “Everything I do is for you.” Her hand moved without warning- slid between Agatha’s thighs, around the dildo, fingers dipping through her folds.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha moaned. And when Rio’s fingers met the wetness there -hot and obvious and entirely for her- she whimpered. Her forehead dropped to Agatha’s shoulder like she hadn’t braced for that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For me?” Rio whispered, almost stunned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s breath came fast.</span> <span>“All for you,” She grabbed Rio’s face and kissed her again.</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was heat and pressure, hunger cracked open. Their mouths collided, sloppy and full of too much want. Rio moaned into it -high and wrecked- and her hands clutched at Agatha’s shirt like she’d fall without it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for her dress, yanked it up. Rio gasped against her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Up,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Rio obeyed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She lifted just enough for Agatha to get her onto the counter, dress rucked around her hips, legs falling open as Agatha stepped between them. She kissed along the soft skin of Rio’s chest, licking over the swell of her breast before closing her mouth around one nipple and sucking hard. Rio’s fingers tightened in her hair instantly, her breath catching high in her throat. Agatha bit gently, then soothed it with her tongue, moving to the other side without warning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gasped as Agatha dragged her teeth lower, mouthing at the space just beneath her ribs, then nipping at her stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up, needing to see her- needing proof. Rio’s lips were parted, her brows drawn tight, chest rising and falling in shallow bursts. One hand was braced behind her on the counter, the other clenched at her side like she didn’t trust herself to reach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please, baby,” Rio whispered, voice wrecked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha answered with an open mouthed kiss to her clit- slow and obscene.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio cried out at the contact, her thighs trembling as her hand shot to the back of Agatha’s head. Her fingers tangled in her hair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes,” she gasped, the sound ripped out of her.</span> <span>“Please, Agatha- ”</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha moaned against her, the vibration making Rio jolt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her tongue moved deliberately, slow at first, then deeper, more focused. She traced the shape of her with unhurried precision, licking through slick heat like it was the only thing that mattered. Her hands curled under Rio’s thighs, holding her wide, grounding her as she came undone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hips rolled helplessly against her mouth, no rhythm, no control. Just need. Just instinct. She was already shaking. Already gasping her name again- softer this time, reverent. A whisper caught on the edge of a cry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t stop.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She licked her like she’d been waiting for this. Like it was owed. Like it would never be enough.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wanted Rio to feel it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wanted her ruined.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Rio, wrecked and open on the counter, gave her everything.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They didn’t talk about it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But something settled between them after that. A shift- not seismic, but steady. The kind that builds under your feet before you realize you’re already standing somewhere else.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped treating it like a test. She stopped needing Rio to flinch first.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She touched her more. Reached for her in rooms with other people in them. Not always boldly, but without apology. A thigh pressed under a table. A hand brushing the back of Rio’s neck. A thumb tracing the ridge of her knuckles while everyone else argued over takeout.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Rio let her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Worse- she was patient about it. Always met her in the middle, never asked for more. Just waited. Like she knew Agatha would get there eventually.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t brought up Tuesday night  dinners. Probably because every time Lilia called, Agatha left the room. Or opened a cabinet. Or suddenly had to rearrange the spice rack. She didn’t linger when Rio talked to her adoptive mother, didn’t ask what they’d discussed, didn’t offer to say hi. And Rio, mercifully, didn’t push.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because what was she supposed to say? That the thought of showing up to Lilia’s house with Rio -</span>
<em>
<span>with</span>
</em>
<span> her- made her want to peel her skin off? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha missed it. Of course, she missed it. Missed Lilia’s food, the music that always played too low to be noticed, the way it had once felt easy. Like she belonged. But then everything happened. And she stopped showing up. And no one chased her. And now she couldn’t stomach the thought of going back- of seeing Lilia’s face, of hearing her say </span>
<em>
<span>it’s been a while</span>
</em>
<span> with too much softness. Or worse- ask something. Or say nothing. Or look at her like she already knew the answer. Like she had opinions about Agatha’s life choices. Or the time it took.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So no, Agatha didn’t go to Tuesday night dinners. Rio didn’t ask her to. And they both pretended that wasn’t its own kind of conversation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because it wasn’t about dinner.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was about showing up to a place she used to call home, standing in that kitchen again, and knowing full well what she left behind. What might still be waiting for her if she could just get over herself and go.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But not everything had to happen all at once.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stayed home. Let Rio go alone. Told herself she’d be ready eventually.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Told Rio she would try again tomorrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wakes to the sound of her alarm, but it’s gone before she can hate it. Her brain registers it just enough to know she should care, then promptly decides not to. Something warm and slow moves through her hair- fingertips, scratching lightly at her scalp. Thoughtless, tender. Her face is pressed into something soft and warm, which she eventually realizes is the bare skin of a hip. Her arm is thrown across a waist.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Then she hears the steady hush of rain come next, soft against the glass, like it’s been falling for hours.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She breathed in without thinking and caught the smell of coffee and petrichor. And Rio, she thinks, drowsy and certain. She sinks further into the mattress, into the warmth pressed beside her, into the hand that keeps tracing lazy circles through her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha breathes, not quite a question.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” Rio doesn’t move, doesn’t stop moving her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha lets her eyes drift halfway open, but the light is dull and the bed is warm and her brain doesn’t feel like workking yet. It’s a miracle she’s awake at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can’t wake up like this,” she mumbles, voice thick with sleep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Like what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Too comf-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’s asleep again before she can finish. Her mouth goes slack, and a small, ridiculous snore startles her just enough to stir.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Coffee,” Agatha whispers, as if remembering the dream she’d been having. Or maybe just naming the thing she wants most, second to this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s on the nightstand,” Rio says, soft enough that it blends into the rain. Her fingers press a little firmer behind Agatha’s ear, just for a moment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hums and shifts, just enough to tighten her arm around Rio’s waist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Time?” she croaks, eyes still refusing to open.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Three thirty-nine.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tries to groan, but it comes out as more of a whine. Her whole body feels like it’s underwater- thick, heavy, unwilling. She knows she has to wake up. Has to start moving. But everything inside her disagrees.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Without opening her eyes, she shifts upright slowly, limbs sluggish and unwilling. Rio’s hand slips from her hair, and the loss is immediate. Agatha huffs in its absence, sleepy and pathetic, as she leans back against the pillows, head falling limp against the headboard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Waking up for her final shift of three always feels like she’s been hit by a sack of bricks.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She cracks one eye open, and instantly regrets it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The room is soft gray, rain pressing steady against the window. The blackout curtains have been pulled back, and the window’s open just enough to let the sound in. It’s too bright in the way cloudy afternoons can be- muted, gentle, but still too much when you’re made of sleep. She squints for a second, then shuts her eye again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then fingers wrap around her wrist. A warm mug is pressed into her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Still, Agatha doesn’t open her eyes. Just shifts her fingers around the handle, brings it to her lips, and drinks like she’s done it in a dream before. The heat moves through her chest slowly. The first swallow stings a little, but she doesn’t flinch. She can feel Rio’s body still close beside her, hear the rustle of blankets, the way her own breath slows as the coffee takes root somewhere in her ribs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Too bright,” Agatha mutters.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hums beside her, amused but quiet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It takes her nearly ten minutes to finish her coffee. The urge to pee grows more insistent with every sip, but she ignores it in favor of stillness, of warmth, of not shifting the balance of comfort just yet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Eventually, Rio takes the empty mug from her hand. There’s the soft sound of ceramic being set on the nightstand. Then a warm kiss, pressed to the inside of her wrist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Goosebumps rise along her arm. Agatha tells herself it’s the breeze from the window.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a sigh that borders on dramatic, Agatha peels herself out of bed. She shuffles to the bathroom, does what she needs to do, and makes no attempt to be graceful about it. When she returns, it’s with the singular goal of reclaiming what she lost by getting up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This time, she doesn’t ease back under the covers. She throws them off Rio entirely, climbs on top of her, knees on either side of her hips, and buries her face in the warm space between Rio’s neck and shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughs softly -just a puff of air in her hair- and wraps her arms around her without hesitation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good morning to you too, goose,” Rio said, voice soft. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was four in the afternoon, but Agatha didn’t bother correcting her. She just grunted softly and pressed closer, letting the warmth of Rio’s body and the softness of her voice distract her from the clock and everything waiting on the other side of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not going to work,” she murmured into the curve of Rio’s collarbone. The words came out half hearted, more complaint than plan, her mouth brushing skin like punctuation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, you are,” Rio said, tilting her head to give Agatha more of her neck. “But I’ll act surprised when you complain about it for the next two and a half hours.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond. She pressed her face in harder, mouth warm against Rio’s neck, hands sliding beneath the hem of Rio’s -no, her- shirt like that distinction still mattered. She let her fingers roam slowly, tracing the shape of ribs she already knew, like knowing them wasn’t the point.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand came up slowly and brushed her hair back from her face with a care that always made Agatha feel a little off balance. Not because it was tender, but because it wasn’t hesitant. Her fingers lingered under the curve of Agatha’s ear, just resting there, like she was grounding them both in the touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back a little. Not far- just enough to look at Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her eyes dropped to Rio’s mouth first, because that was always where they went. There was the start of a smile there, barely formed, like Rio was in on some joke Agatha hadn’t realized she’d told. But it wasn’t smug. It was quiet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their eyes met.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then Rio exhaled, and the sound that came out wasn’t a laugh and wasn’t a sigh. It caught somewhere in between, like something had almost slipped out and gotten caught at the last second.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Agatha watched the smile fade- not dramatically, not all at once. Just slowly, like Rio was stepping back into a space she had been circling for a long time. Her gaze moved across Agatha’s face as if searching for something.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was no fear in it. No nervousness. But it was serious in a way that made Agatha feel every part of herself go still.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s thumb brushed her jaw once, soft but steady, and Agatha recognized the look in her eyes before she had to name it. Rio looked the same way she had at the lakehouse- the last time she’d come close to saying something that would change everything. And Agatha had shut it down with a kiss because it had been too much. Too big. Too soon. Or maybe not too soon. She didn’t know anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But now, Agatha didn’t stop her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t move at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If Rio was going to say it, Agatha would let her. Whatever it was. Maybe she was too tired to interrupt the moment. Maybe she just didn’t have the energy to pretend she didn’t want it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth parted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha saw the tiny, familiar gap between her teeth that she had always thought about far too often. Rio closed her mouth again, opened it, and nothing came out. Not a sound. Not even a breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her brown eyes flicked to Agatha’s lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then her hand slid from her jaw to the base of her neck, fingers curling slightly, pressing just enough to guide Agatha in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And maybe Rio didn’t say it because she thought Agatha wasn’t ready. Maybe she didn’t say it because it was already here, in the room, in the space between their bodies and breath and the stupid mug still sitting on the nightstand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But it didn’t matter that Rio hadn’t said it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because the second their mouths met, Agatha felt it. All of it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In the way Rio kissed her- deep, slow, like her mouth had been waiting for this and didn’t mind the time it took to arrive. No performance. No rush. Just a certainty that folded around her like a secret she didn’t have to protect anymore.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She kissed Rio back with aching ease. Let herself be touched, explored- Rio’s hands sliding over her like a map already memorized but still needed to trace. Her shoulders. Her hips. The soft inside of her thigh. Her spine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t about want. It never had been. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was about a truth that had rooted itself quietly between them, growing in the dark like something that had learned patience. Not loud, not sudden- just steady, stretching through every silence they never touched, winding around every glance they refused to hold too long. It had weathered years without light, without language, without proximity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha, even now, wasn’t sure if the ache in her chest came from how long it had lived there, or from how impossible it suddenly felt to keep pretending she didn’t recognize its shape.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand moved again, slower now, until it settled over Agatha’s chest. Her thumb traced idle patterns above the bone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t stop kissing her, her pulse thrumming beneath Rio’s palm, painfully aware of every inch of her body that had softened beneath this touch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And maybe Agatha should’ve been annoyed by that. Or unnerved. Or anything but this.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But all she could think about was how, of course, </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> was the spot that Rio’s hand always reached for. How, this time, Rio had reached for Agatha’s heart -carefully, deliberately- and held it like she meant to keep it. Cradled it. Spoke to it like it was something alive. Whispered to it promises Agatha was beginning to believe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She could almost laugh at the audacity of it- of Rio always knowing where to press. As if it were natural to return there, to coax bloom from bone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Rio pulled back, Agatha followed- without thinking, without meaning to, chasing her mouth. Craving the taste of blossom on her tongue, the impossible sweetness of something finally in full bloom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their lips met again- gently this time. Less kiss, more confirmation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back, slow and careful, their faces still close. Rio’s eyes opened like she’d forgotten they might- fluttering once, then fixing on her. And when she saw Agatha already looking, her lips lifted into the smallest smile. Breathless. Honest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hi,” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha almost smiled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey,” she said, just as quietly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then Rio moved in, not to kiss her again, but to press her face into Agatha’s neck. Her arms slipped around her waist like she was giving herself something to hold onto before she said too much.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s arms came up without thinking. One around her shoulders, the other curling around the back of Rio’s head, holding her close.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move for a long time. Just breathed against her neck like it was the only place she still made sense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then without pulling away, Rio turned her head- resting her cheek against Agatha’s shoulder, eyes angled toward the window.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her voice came soft. Barely a breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The rain sounds nice, doesn’t it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer right away. Just kept holding her, eyes drifting toward the window, where the rain tapped soft patterns across the glass.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It did. But that wasn’t why Rio said it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha knew her too well for that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But still, she didn’t call Rio on it. Didn’t say </span>
<em>
<span>you don’t need to protect me anymore</span>
</em>
<span>. Didn’t say </span>
<em>
<span>stop treating me like I’ll disappear if you breathe too hard. </span>
</em>
<span>Didn’t say </span>
<em>
<span>please, I want you to say it.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Instead, she held Rio a little tighter. And eventually, quietly, Agatha said, “Yeah. It does.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Three months of letting it happen. Three months of getting away with it. Three months of Rio being hers in every way that didn’t require saying so. And three months of Agatha not saying it. Not when she should. Not when she wanted to. Not even now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The rain would speak for them both a little while longer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Tomorrow, maybe, Agatha would try again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha had spent the last two nights in the postpartum overnight room again. Tonight made three, her last shift of the week. The babies were different this time, twin girls with round cheeks and heavy eyelids, nothing to worry about. They would be going home in the morning.</p><p> </p><p>She was halfway through her charting, about to start her second hands-on time, when a soft knock tapped against the already open door. Her head turned without thinking. The moment Agatha saw who it was, a small smile tugged at the corner of her mouth before she could stop it. She pressed her lips together, turned back to the screen.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re up here early,” Agatha said, eyes narrowing slightly as she squinted at the screen.</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Rio’s voice floated in. “Heard you guys were having a party. Didn’t want to miss out on the fun.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wildest party in town. Open bar’s all formula.”</p><p> </p><p>“There’s nothing going on downstairs,” Rio said as she wandered in and dropped into one of the loungers beside Agatha’s workstation. “Figured I’d come up and harass you while I could.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped charting. Her fingers stilled on the keyboard, then slipped away. She swiveled slowly in her chair to face Rio, arms folding over her chest like she wasn’t already smiling a little. “How generous of you,” she said, and this time, there was no hiding the warmth in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>“How’s your night been so far?” Rio asked, leaning back like she planned to stay awhile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged, pushing back from the workstation. “Alright. I’m about to start feeds.” She stood and stretched slightly before glancing down at Rio. “You wanna help?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to feed a baby, Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>There was a beat of silence, then: </p><p> </p><p>“I mean… is that even allowed?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she pulled a bottle of milk from the warmer, “We let nursing students do it all the time. You’ll be fine.”</p><p> </p><p>“But what if something happens?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned slightly, giving Rio a dry look.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know. What if it chokes? Stops breathing? I drop it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Good thing you’ve got a certified NICU nurse standing right here. Also,” she gestured toward the row of glowing monitors above the bassinets, “They’re hooked up to monitors.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached into the bassinet and lifted the smaller of the twins- arguably the sweeter one, though she’d never say so. She adjusted the baby against her chest, then turned toward Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” she murmured, keeping her voice quiet. “Put on a gown. Let’s see if you’re brave enough to hold her first.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her a look like she’d just been asked to disarm a bomb. Still, she stood, grabbed the hospital gown draped over the back of the second lounger, and slipped it on. She sat back down and held her hands out, stiffly, palms up.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her for a long second, the corner of her mouth twitching despite herself. She was trying to be serious, but Rio in an oversized gown with that vaguely panicked look on her face was making it difficult. She stepped closer and eased the baby into Rio’s arms.</p><p> </p><p>“Support her neck,” Agatha said gently, hoping softness might somehow compensate for Rio’s very visible alarm.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced at the crib card, clipped to the edge of the bassinet. “Delilah,” she said, mostly to herself.</p><p> </p><p>Delilah responded by squirming in Rio’s hands, letting out a faint, suspicious whimper, and kicking one tiny foot free of the swaddle- like she could already tell this woman had no idea what she was doing.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio -brave, sure, but absolutely not a natural- held the baby at arm’s length, elbows awkward, every muscle in her body overthinking it.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha muttered, staring down at Rio, a little mortified. “Can you relax? You’re holding a baby, not a bomb.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up at her with wide eyes and a tense jaw. “That’s basically the same thing,” she hissed, furious and defensive, as the baby made another soft, unsettled sound.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, grabbed the bottle she’d set on the counter, then bent down and yanked the lever on the side of the lounger. The chair squeaked as it kicked back, the footrest sliding out beneath Rio’s legs.</p><p> </p><p>“Bend your knees,” Agatha said, already pulling up her chair next to it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked at her. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Just do it. It'll help.”</p><p> </p><p>She did, albeit stiffly, clearly skeptical of everything.</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” Agatha said, sitting down. “Now rest her against your thighs. One hand under her neck, let her settle into your legs. You don’t have to keep her in a death grip.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio followed her instructions, bending her knees and settling the baby onto her thighs. It took a second, but once she got her hands in the right place both she and the baby seemed to relax a little.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha handed Rio the bottle, uncapped and warm, and leaned in beside her to guide her hand. “Tilt it just a little more,” she murmured, gently angling Rio’s wrist. “There.”</p><p> </p><p>Delilah latched on the first try, sucking steadily like she’d been waiting all night for it.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio exhaled. Her hands were still a little tense, but her grip had softened.</p><p> </p><p>“See?” Agatha said, quiet, leaning back in her chair with just the faintest trace of smug. “Not so bad.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio side-eyed her without turning her head and grunted. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything else. She just kept watching- Rio’s hands, the way her thumb brushed unconsciously along the baby’s neck, like she didn’t even know she was doing it. The crease in her brow had eased, and her breathing had synced up with the baby’s in that hypnotic way newborns can make the whole world slow down.</p><p> </p><p>It was stupid -definitely stupid- but Agatha couldn’t look away. There was something about Rio in that ridiculous oversized gown, hunched over a baby she’d sworn she didn’t know how to hold, suddenly all soft hands and careful movements.</p><p> </p><p>It hit Agatha in some deep, inexplicable place she didn’t have the tools to process. It was hormonal, or existential, or both. Her chest went weird. Her stomach dipped. And the longer she watched, the worse it got.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio said after a minute, barely above a whisper. “You can stop staring now.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. She cleared her throat, scooted her chair back to the workstation a little too aggressively, and dragged the monitor closer to make a show of clicking through tabs.</p><p> </p><p>Right. She was here to chart feeds, not spiral into some full-body hallucination about domestic bliss. Her ovaries weren’t doing anything weird. She wasn’t feeling things. Certainly not things about <em> Rio </em> holding a baby. That would be clinically fucking insane, if Agatha had anything to say about it. Which she didn’t. Obviously. </p><p> </p><p>And just as she was mentally lecturing herself back into sanity, Rio spoke again.</p><p> </p><p>“This is harder than it looks,” Rio muttered, adjusting the bottle a little. “You guys make it look so easy.”</p><p> </p><p>“Comes with the job,” Agatha said flatly, even though her own mouth had gone dry, which felt unfair.  She glanced back -because of course she did- and immediately regretted it. Rio was still feeding the baby. Still not dropping her. Still looking way too much like someone who could do this again tomorrow and be fine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wrenched her attention back to the screen, pretending it might have the power to save her.</p><p> </p><p>And then -because Rio was a menace and had no interest in letting Agatha live- she added, far too casually:</p><p> </p><p>“You ever think about having one?”</p><p> </p><p>The answer formed instantly, in layers, contradicting itself on arrival. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> No. Yes. Absolutely not. With you, maybe. Yes. But definitely no. And still, somehow, yes again. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said none of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” she replied instead, flat and casual, eyes still fixed on the screen in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>“Why didn’t you and Satan ever…?” Rio didn’t finish the sentence. She didn’t have to. Agatha could hear the rest of it in her voice, the hesitation, the distaste, the way she practically gagged on the image of her and Wanda procreating.</p><p> </p><p>It would have been funny if it weren’t so bleak.</p><p> </p><p>The truth was, Agatha had done many regrettable things in her life, had made choices that bordered on self destruction more often than not. But even at her worst, she had never been foolish enough to bring a child into the world with Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda had brought it up. Of course she had. With her wide-eyed optimism and her relentless conviction that love could fill every crack and hold it all together. She talked about it like it was inevitable, like it was the next logical step.</p><p> </p><p>And every single time, Agatha had shut it down. Not kindly, not delicately, and certainly not in any way that left the door cracked open. She hadn’t offered compromise or comfort or even basic human softness. No, she had ended those conversations with finality. Vehemently. Swiftly. Expeditiously. Other SAT words that meant <em> absolutely the fuck not. </em></p><p> </p><p>She’d told herself it was because the timing was wrong, because the marriage needed to be more stable, because they hadn’t figured enough out yet. But the truth had always been quieter, deeper, and infinitely more uncomfortable.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had known that marriage wouldn’t last. Not just suspected. <em> Known </em>. And maybe, though she’d never admit it aloud, not even under threat, she’d known even then that she would end up right where she was now. Back in Westview. Back at the center of her orbit.</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda wanted one,” she said finally, her voice cool, measured. “Talked about it all the time. Picked names. Had entire Pinterest boards.” She paused, lips twitching into something a little evil. “I told her no. Every time. Loudly. Repeatedly. In several languages, I think.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a laugh. “Good. Those kids probably would’ve come out ginger and ugly as fuck.” She looked down immediately after, eyes landing on the baby in her lap, and her voice softened as she mumbled an apology. “Sorry. That wasn’t very nice.”</p><p> </p><p>Delilah didn’t seem to mind, still sucking lazily at the bottle, perfectly content.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at Rio without meaning to. And for a moment, forgot to pretend otherwise. Her mouth parted slightly, not enough to speak, just enough to betray her. On her face, it probably read like disgust, but it wasn’t that. Not even close. It was the opposite. Completely, dangerously the opposite.</p><p> </p><p>“What about you?” Agatha asked, without meaning to, and immediately hated herself for it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up. Her brows lifted slightly, not in confusion but in cautious interest, like she could already sense the terrain shifting. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel the heat in ears instantly, and before Rio could respond, she rushed to clarify, tripping over her words as they came. “I mean… kids. Babies. Having one. Eventually.” She cringed inwardly, heard herself fumbling and made it worse by trying to course correct, “Not that you and I-  I didn’t mean it like that. Obviously.”</p><p> </p><p>Another breath, another second of silence. Her cheeks were hot now, her thoughts spiraling, but she forced herself to finish it. “I’m asking if you ever picture yourself as the kind of person who wants that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. She blinked, like she was trying to decide whether Agatha was serious, or if this was one of those moments she was supposed to laugh off. Her eyes dropped to the baby in her lap, her fingers adjusting the bottle without needing to. Delilah was still drinking, her small hand curled against Rio’s wrist.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio said finally, her voice lower now, smaller than it had been all night. “I used to think no. I… I worry a lot. About everything. Obsess over stupid shit. I convince myself something’s wrong even when it’s not.” She paused, her eyes still on the baby. “I think it’d be hard on me. The mess of it. The noise. Not knowing what’s normal and what’s not. It’d be a lot for my brain.” Another pause, and this time she looked up. Her eyes found Agatha’s and didn’t look away. “But lately, I don’t know. I think about it sometimes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t expected her to answer like that.</p><p> </p><p>She’d expected a joke, maybe a brush off, something dumb and self protective that she could match with her own deflection and move on like the question had never happened. But instead, Rio said it softly. Thoughtfully. Like she’d been turning it over in her head for a while.  </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha felt something catch low in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know what to do with the image of Rio like that- vulnerable, self aware, and impossibly gentle with a baby pressed against her thighs. She looked at ease and completely out of her depth at the same time. Agatha didn’t realize she was staring until Rio’s eyes met hers again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away fast, back to the chart, suddenly wanted to fucking vomit all over the place.</p><p> </p><p>“You’d probably be better at it than you think,” Agatha managed to force out, eyes still locked on the screen in front of her. “You’re good with her.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a beat of silence after that -too long, too charged- and Agatha could <em> feel </em> Rio looking at her.</p><p> </p><p>Abruptly, Agatha stood.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, give her back,” Agatha snapped, reaching out with both hands. “She needs to be burped.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, startled. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Bottle’s almost empty, which means she needs to burp, and you’re holding her wrong for that anyway, so-” Agatha made an impatient grabby motion. “Give. Her. Back.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio held tight to the baby for half a second too long, eyes narrowing as something clicked behind them. Then her face changed completely.</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth fell open, and the smirk that followed was slow, predatory, and downright <em> radiant </em>. Her tongue did that fucking thing where it poked into her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio breathed. “Agatha Harkness. Do you want me to put a-”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop talking!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snatched the baby out of her arms, cradling her with dramatic efficiency, like the baby herself had been complicit in the crime. “Look,” she snapped, cutting Rio off before she could get another word out. “I don’t know what you’re about to say, and I don’t want to know.” She adjusted the baby with practiced hands- Delilah now upright in her lap, back to Agatha’s chest, one hand cradling her chin and chest in a perfect C-hold, while the other began patting between her shoulder blades with determination.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever you think just happened,” Agatha continued, her voice dropping into a harsh whisper, “<em> did not </em> happen. It didn’t. And if you plan on staying in this room, you’re going to keep your mouth shut. Am I clear?”</p><p> </p><p>Delilah let out a tiny burp. Rio looked like she was seconds away from bursting into song.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her.</p><p> </p><p>She just resumed patting the baby’s back, firmer this time, like that would somehow burp whatever the fuck just happened out of existence.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want?” Agatha answered flatly, tucking her phone between her shoulder and ear as she placed a bottle of laundry detergent into her cart.</p><p> </p><p>It was the exact brand Rio used- though that was, of course, entirely coincidental. A subconscious grab. An unconscious betrayal of self. She hadn’t meant to reach for it. It simply found its way into her hand, as if summoned by scent memory and unresolved issues. Smelling faintly of Rio didn’t make her <em> miss </em> Rio. Or <em> want </em> Rio. It was just a familiar smell in an unfamiliar store on an otherwise forgettable Tuesday. She’d tell herself that until it was true.</p><p> </p><p>“So I’ve been thinking,” Rio said, with an evil casualness that made Agatha want to hang up immediately and throw her phone across the store.</p><p> </p><p>She exhaled hard, pressing the heel of her palm to her forehead. “That’s never good.”</p><p> </p><p>“About our conversation the other day.”</p><p> </p><p>There it was. The premonition. The dread. The faint drumbeat of regret echoing in Agatha’s temples. She could feel the humiliation creeping up her neck already, as if her body remembered it more vividly than her mind allowed. She didn’t need to hear the rest to know exactly where this was headed.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Agatha said briskly, veering down another aisle. She stared down the shelf, eyes landing on the Diet Coke display, and immediately started loading them in, box after box, mechanical and wildly deranged.</p><p> </p><p>Something about aspartame and emotional suppression just made sense. Like if she stacked enough silver aluminum, perhaps it would barricade her from the rest of the conversation. Or her feelings. Whichever was louder. </p><p> </p><p>And if that failed, Agatha would settle for a self administered lobotomy. Nothing too drastic.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you know,” Rio drawled, and Agatha had to physically restrain herself from javelin-throwing her phone into a shelf of cokes. “That part where you said you want me to-”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t say I wanted you to do shit,” Agatha hissed.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, there is nothing wrong with you wanting to be dicked down, I promise.”  Rio replied, maddeningly composed. “I’m just saying, if that’s where you’re at, I’m happy to oblige.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze in the middle of the aisle and looked around- not out of embarrassment, but out of pure survival instinct. She was, blessedly, alone. That was the only reason she allowed herself to lean forward, press her forehead against the handle of the cart, and silently scream into the void. She stomped once, twice, then stood up and tried very hard not to want to commit a felony.</p><p> </p><p>She swept her hair out of her face, took a breath sharp enough to bruise her lungs, and said through her teeth, “Dicked. Down?”</p><p> </p><p>“You want me to put my dick in you,” Rio clarified, as if she fucking need to.</p><p> </p><p>“I know what it means, Rio. Thank you for the vocabulary lesson.” Her voice came out clipped, seething. “And also, absolutely not.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why not?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She could hear the pout in Rio’s voice, which was unfair. Weaponized. Possibly actionable in court.</p><p> </p><p>The problem wasn’t that she didn’t want to. It was that she wanted to <em> too much </em> . That was the entire issue. She’d already surrendered more of herself to Rio than she’d ever intended to give another human being. She would, without protest, do so again. Had done so, in various forms. Would keep doing it, probably forever. That was fine. That she could live with. But not this. Not <em> this </em> conversation. Not after the baby conversation, and the way Rio had looked holding her, and how Agatha had sat there watching, not even remotely disgusted by the possibility of that kind of permanence.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t admit it. Not now. Not aloud. Not while she was still pretending to be the one with the upper hand.</p><p> </p><p>Because the truth -the horrifying, embarrassing, soul destroying truth- was that if Rio so much as crooked a finger in her direction, Agatha would fold. Would bend over, cheeks spread, offering up every last shred of pride she had like it was a sacrifice to the gods of lesbian debauchery. No ifs, ands, or butts.</p><p> </p><p>Pun fully fucking intended.</p><p> </p><p>And there was nothing dignified about knowing that and still answering the phone.</p><p> </p><p>“Because I have standards,” is what Agatha decided to say.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you?” Rio asked, and Agatha could hear her smiling. </p><p> </p><p>She clenched her jaw. “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>More silence. Smug, unbearable silence.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, trying to sound level. “Anyway. I’m hanging up now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Rio said. “I’ll see you tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha : <em> I hate you. </em></p><p>
<em> I hate you so much it’s actually making me nauseous.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I hope you trip over your own dick. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Don’t come over.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Actually, I don’t care.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I’m not even home.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I am.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio : <em> this would be so much easier if you just admit you want it </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha : <em> I don’t want it.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio : <em> sure.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha : <em> I’m serious.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio : <em> no i know.  </em></p><p>
<em> you don’t want it.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> you just think about it constantly, text me about it unprovoked, and make yourself sick over the idea of how much you want it… </em>
</p><p>
<em> totally different.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha : <em> If you actually had a dick, you wouldn’t last three minutes in bed with me. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio : <em> oh, i’m not denying that </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha : <em> I was insulting you.  </em></p><p>
<em> Be insulted.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio : <em> you were imagining it </em></p><p>
<em> very vividly, apparently  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha : <em> Shut the fuck up.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio : <em> you think about it a lot, huh?  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha : <em>  I will block you. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio : <em> cool </em></p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Whatever irritation Agatha had been nursing dissolved the second she heard the jingle of keys in her front door- familiar enough now to bypass suspicion, but still carrying that little thrill of someone letting themselves into her life.</p><p> </p><p>Moments later, Rio appeared in her the living room entrance- take-out in a brown paper sack dangling from her hand, eyebrows doing that smug little dance, and a grin showing off that infuriating, perfect gap between her teeth. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha ate cross legged at the coffee table while Rio lounged in the corner of her L-shaped couch, still full from her usual Tuesday dinner at Lilia’s. Survivor reruns played in the background- episodes they’d both seen enough times to talk over and still know exactly who got voted out.</p><p> </p><p>After dinner, Agatha cleared the mess, took her time in the shower, and came back barefoot in an oversized t-shirt and underwear to find Rio exactly where she’d left her.</p><p> </p><p>As she rounded the couch, Rio reached out a hand, palm open, that easy beckoning she did now without thinking. Routine. And, if Agatha was honest, something she’d come to rely on.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio ever stopped reaching for her like that -in all the subtle, thoughtless ways she did now- Agatha figured she’d come apart faster than she’d admit. If Rio hadn’t made herself at home here, and Agatha in hers, the loss would feel like someone had stolen half her heart and left the rest beating just to be cruel. Not that it mattered. Not that she’d ever admit it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took her hand anyway, letting Rio pull her down onto the cushion beside the corner of the couch. Her legs stretched out along the long side of the L, her back resting into the solid warmth of Rio’s side. Rio’s arm slipped easily around her waist, settling there like it had always belonged. They stayed that way, watching alliances crumble and torches snuffed- Survivor filling the room, Agatha’s mind unusually quiet.</p><p> </p><p>The quiet lasted all of thirty minutes- about average, where Rio was concerned.</p><p> </p><p>It began with her arm, wedged between the couch cushion and Agatha’s side, fingers absently worrying the hem of Agatha’s t-shirt. Maybe it was mindless. Maybe it wasn’t. But every so often her knuckles caught the bare skin of Agatha’s thigh, and that was harder to ignore. Then her hand inched higher, playing with the band of Agatha’s underwear, thumb sliding the elastic up and down along the ridge of her hip bone like she was testing how far she could push it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her arms crossed, jaw tightening, eyes nailed to the TV as if the fate of the next torch snuff depended on it. She lasted fifteen minutes before mentally saying fuck it and setting her own hand on Rio’s thigh- sweatpants covered, which she chose to view as a temporary problem.</p><p> </p><p>The moment she touched her, Rio’s thumb stilled. Agatha’s mouth curled. A second later, Rio’s thumb started moving again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thumb skimmed lower this time, slipping just beneath the waistband before retreating, the faintest scrape of her nail dragging across Agatha’s skin on the way back up. Agatha exhaled slowly, her head tilting back until it brushed Rio’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed like that for a few minutes, until the need to be closer won out. </p><p> </p><p>She swung her legs off the couch, turning so she could sit beside Rio properly. She moved closer, close enough to lean in and press her lips to the warm curve of Rio’s throat, right where it met the line of her jaw.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tipped her head to the side without hesitation, baring more skin, making it easier for Agatha to follow. She didn’t let Agatha linger. Her hand came up, threading through Agatha’s hair, and with a gentle pull she drew her back just enough to break contact. Then she tipped her head forward, catching Agatha’s lips in a kiss.</p><p> </p><p>It stole the air from Agatha’s lungs in that immediate, irritating way Rio always managed- like she’d been tricked into needing it. She kissed Rio back anyway, one hand sliding instinctively to the back of Rio’s neck, keeping her close.</p><p> </p><p>She felt the warm drift of breath between them before Rio deepened it- tongue sliding against her bottom lip, coaxing Agatha’s mouth open before she’d even realized she’d given in. Shameful, how her body went soft for it, for Rio, without a fight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fisted the hand at the back of Rio’s neck, pulling her in until there was nowhere left to go, swallowing the desperate moan Rio gave her for it. Her other hand slid higher along Rio’s thigh, ready for the way Rio usually melted, breathless and pliant beneath her. But this time, Rio didn’t. She kissed Agatha back harder, hungrier, every tilt of her mouth pushing for control instead of yielding to it. The defiance sent a jolt through Agatha, her stomach flipping, heat pooling low, every nerve suddenly tuned in.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers dug into the muscle of Rio’s thigh, anchoring her in place while the hand at the back of her neck drew her closer- close enough for Rio to take whatever she wanted. Caught somewhere between holding control and handing it over, she let the kiss deepen, as she continued sliding her hand further up Rio’s thigh. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was aiming for the heat between Rio’s legs when she felt it- thick, unmistakable, pressing back against her palm through her sweatpants.</p><p> </p><p>The moan that tore out of her own mouth was filthy, unthinking. She broke the kiss, yanking Rio’s head back by the hair- rougher than intended, though the needy sound Rio let slip made it hard to care.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest was still heaving when she blinked, forcing her focus onto Rio’s face- flushed, lips swollen, breath coming quick with that fucking smirk twitching at the corners of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard, trying to lace her voice with pure venom. “What. The. Fuck. Is that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. She leaned in, slow and deliberate, like she was testing how far she could push before Agatha broke. “My dick,” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s grip in her hair tightened, holding her there. Then Rio’s hand covered hers- still resting over the thick shape against her sweatpants- and pressed. Guided her palm along the length of it until Agatha could feel every inch. </p><p> </p><p>Heat coiled sharp and fast in Agatha’s gut, forcing a huff out of her before she could stop it.</p><p> </p><p>“Bought it yesterday,” Rio added, smug curling her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped to hers, fury locking her jaw, words refusing to come. She just stared, drilling heat and daggers into the delight sparking in Rio’s gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to take it off?” Rio asked softly.</p><p> </p><p>“No!” Too fast. Too loud. Agatha immediately yanked her hand back from Rio’s crotch and shoved herself upright, putting just enough distance between them to keep her head clear. </p><p> </p><p>“I mean,” Agatha corrected, gesturing lazily toward Rio’s pants. “You wore it all the way over here- might as well see how ridiculous you look in it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed herself up from the couch in one quick motion, using Agatha’s shoulder for balance so she wouldn’t trip. It took everything in Agatha not to catch her hand in her teeth just for the hell of it.</p><p> </p><p>She stood right in front of Agatha, and pulled her shirt over her head first. <em> Good call </em>, Agatha thought. Rio’s boobs always had a way of improving her mood immediately.</p><p> </p><p>Then came the sweats- pushed down slow, revealing black compression shorts clinging tight to her hips. The outline beneath them was impossible to miss: thick, curved just enough to press against the fabric, the head clearly defined, pointing toward her waistband.</p><p> </p><p>That sight alone made Agatha’s pulse skip and her mouth go dry.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hooked her thumbs under the waistband, holding Agatha’s gaze as she shoved the compression shorts down over her thighs. Beneath them, the harness was already strapped tight to her hips, black leather hugging her curves. The purple shaft jutted forward from it, thick and perfectly shaped, every ridge and vein catching the light.</p><p> </p><p>It was obscene, the way a piece of silicone could look like it was staring straight into Agatha’s fucking soul. She forced her eyes upward to find Rio already watching her, every muscle of her body vibrating with anticipation.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look ridiculous. Worse. She looked lethal. And Agatha was clamping her teeth on her tongue to keep every desperate, humiliating plea she knew from spilling straight into Rio’s twitching hands.</p><p> </p><p>Her lips parted, dry, and she meant to say something mean. Instead, what came out was a quiet, breathless, “Oh.”</p><p> </p><p>The word had barely left her mouth before Rio stepped in, both hands coming up to cradle Agatha’s face. Agatha instinctively slid forward on the couch, catching Rio’s wrists in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just looked down at her, holding her there, her thumbs brushing lightly against Agatha’s cheeks. She tucked a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear with trembling fingers. “Baby,” Rio breathed, the word shaky, her lips twitching upward but never making it to a smile. “Please don’t make me beg for your mouth.”</p><p> </p><p>The words barely cleared a whisper, but every syllable trembled with plea.</p><p> </p><p>And fuck Rio Vidal for asking so sweetly.</p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha’s mouth gave her away immediately, parting without thought as she was already staring up at Rio like she’d hung the moon just for her.</p><p> </p><p>One of Rio’s hands slid from Agatha’s cheek into her hair, the gentle drag of her fingers sending a shiver straight down Agatha’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned forward before she even realized she was moving, her knees parting around Rio’s legs as if her body had decided for her.</p><p> </p><p>“Good girl,” Rio murmured, and Agatha despised how the praise dragged a soft, humiliating whine from her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand tightened in her hair, guiding her forward. Agatha let herself be moved, inch by inch, until head of the strap brushed her lips. </p><p> </p><p>She wrapped her lips around the head and sank down in one smooth motion, her tongue gliding along the underside. Rio’s hips pushed forward in a short, helpless thrust, a soft “fuck” spilling out of her like she hadn’t meant to say it.</p><p> </p><p>The sudden push caught Agatha off guard, the head hitting deeper than she’d braced for. Her throat tightened around it, a sharp gag tearing free before she could stop it. Rio’s hand flexed in her hair and she whimpered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to drag in air, eyes watering, then pushed down again -on purpose this time- letting her gag around it once more. Rio’s response was a loud, helpless moan, her hips jerking forward again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let one hand drift between her thighs, fingers sliding into bare, slick heat. The wetness met her instantly, warm and obscene, and she hummed around the length in her mouth just to feel the way Rio shuddered above her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha then pulled her mouth off with a wet pop, wiping her lips with the back of her hand as she looked up at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright,” Agatha said, voice rough, “enough of that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped back, breathing hard, not saying a word, not moving.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was just about to tell her to get on with it when Rio spoke first.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s lube in my sweatpants,” Rio said, nodding toward the pile on the floor. “Put it on me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted as she stared up at her. “Rio, honey,” she drawled, the corners of her mouth curving, “this is… undignified, no?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s okay,” Rio said, voice dripping with false sweetness. “I can take it off if you don’t want to do this.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha barked, louder than she meant, heat flashing in her face. “Sit down.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch -of course she didn’t- just dropped onto the couch cushion beside her, close enough that Agatha could feel the radiating heat of her skin.</p><p> </p><p>She kept her eyes on the floor as she snagged the sweatpants, shoving a hand into one pocket, then the other, muttering under her breath as she searched. “This is so fucking pathetic,” yanking the bottle of lube from Rio’s pocket.</p><p> </p><p>She was twisting the cap when Rio’s hand drifted up toward her face. Agatha swatted it away then pointed at her in warning, “Don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio only grinned, settling back into the couch beside her, thigh pressed to hers.</p><p> </p><p>God, Agatha wanted her. Wanted her so badly it was fucking ridiculous. Which was exactly why she glued her gaze to the bottle of lube instead of the beautiful, completely naked problem sitting next to her.</p><p> </p><p>She squeezed the lube into her palm, threw it on the coffee table as she turned toward Rio- and froze. In that blink, the teasing light in Rio’s eyes had given way to something molten, expectant. Agatha’s gaze swept down her body bare skin, the taut set of her hips. Her posture was rigid, like she was one breath away from thrusting up into nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Heat pooled in Agatha’s stomach. She wrapped her fingers around the purple shaft, working the lube along its length. When she glanced up, Rio’s face was closer than before, chin lifted just enough to keep from leaning in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha met her eyes, kept her hand moving. “Rio,” she breathed, close enough that her words brushed Rio’s lips, “I want you. So… why don’t we skip the warm-up and get to the part where you’re inside me?” Her tone was soft, coaxing, but there was a tremor under it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed, a slow, thoughtful sound humming from her throat. She slid her hand over Agatha’s, slowing her stroke until they were moving together, up and down in unhurried, perfect sync. The contact knocked the breath out of her, and Agatha let out a pitiful little huff before she could catch it.</p><p> </p><p>“Say it sweeter,” Rio murmured, gaze fixed on her mouth, “and maybe I will.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, but nothing came out at first. Her fingers tightened under Rio’s, stroking once more before she finally spoke. “Baby…” The word was soft, almost shy, and she leaned in so close her mouth brushed the corner of Rio’s. “Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio caught her mouth in a searing kiss, and Agatha let out a helpless whimper against it. She hooked an arm around Rio’s shoulders, yanking her closer until their bodies fit flush, then sank back into the couch without letting go.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally pulled away, her breath ghosted over Agatha’s lips -just long enough to make her shiver- before her hand slid down, tracing the curve of her stomach. She caught the waistband of Agatha’s underwear and eased them down, slow enough to make her squirm, until they were gone. Fingers slipped between her folds, and the low, guttural sound Rio made at the feel of her nearly had Agatha wailing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely had time to register it; she was already gasping, hips rolling up into Rio’s touch, chasing it. The solid press of the strap nudged against her thigh, a silent promise she wanted far too much.</p><p> </p><p>Rio watched her from above, that slow, knowing smile curling at her lips as she circled two fingers at Agatha’s entrance, keeping her right on the edge. “Still pathetic?” she asked in a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. Her teeth sank into her bottom lip, brows drawn tight. She could only nod and give a shaky, “Mhm.”</p><p>Rio’s smile deepened, satisfaction flickering in her eyes like she’d just won something. She dragged her fingers up and circled her clit until Agatha’s head tipped back against the couch, a soft gasp breaking free. Then the touch was gone.</p><p> </p><p>She whined before she could stop herself, hips lifting in a greedy chase- but Rio was already gripping the strap, bringing it down between them. The tip skimmed her entrance, dragging through her slick folds, nothing more than a taunt. She felt herself beginning to clench around nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t do that!” Agatha gasped, her hand snapping down to still the movement.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brows knit, panic flickering across her face. “You didn’t like it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head once, sharp, the words sticking in her throat. She wasn’t about to give away that the teasing was working too well- that if Rio kept it up, she’d be gone before they’d even started.</p><p> </p><p>Understanding flickered in Rio’s eyes and that evil fucking smirk returned. Without another word, she pressed forward, sinking it into Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>The sound that tore out of her was shameless, her head dropping back against the couch again. “Fuck-” Her hands flew to Rio’s hips, nails digging in, holding her there because she literally might die if Rio pulled out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in, chest brushing hers. “Better?” Her grip shifted, sliding under Agatha’s thighs to hook her legs up around her waist.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t stop. Don’t you dare fucking stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer- she just pulled back an inch and slammed back into her, the force jolting through Agatha’s spine. The air punched out of her in a moan, her fingers clawing for more grip at Rio’s back.</p><p> </p><p>Her pace turned relentless, each thrust hitting deep enough to make Agatha’s vision spark. Her breath came in sharp, broken bursts, fingers clutching at Rio like she could pull her further inside. She was right at Agatha’s ear when she spoke, her voice all heat and satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me what you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, “I- just… don’t stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed in harder, holding there until Agatha clenched around her, the pressure unbearable. “Try again.”</p><p> </p><p>A broken sound tore from her throat, and she tipped her head back against the couch, eyes squeezing shut. “You already know,” she rasped.</p><p> </p><p>“Say it anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha gasped, though it came out more like a plea than a threat. Her nails scraped down Rio’s back, dragging her closer, hips chasing every snap of hers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand caught the back of the couch for leverage, driving into her with precision, each thrust pulling another broken sound from Agatha’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“God- don’t stop- please-,” Agatha cried out, the words spilling out too fast to catch. “I want it, Rio, I want you-” Her nails bit into Rio’s ass, yanking her closer. “Want you so deep- fuck- please, just come inside me-“ She barely knew what she was saying anymore, only that she couldn’t stop, couldn’t keep it in. “Need it so bad, Rio- need you so bad-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a breathless moan, her voice pitching up with something almost giddy.  “Knew it,” she panted, pressing in deeper until Agatha’s gasp broke apart. “Knew you wanted me to put a baby in you.” And Rio’s mouth was on her jaw, teeth scraping before she dragged her tongue up to the shell of her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“God-“ the sound broke on a moan, “I hate you.” Agatha knew it was a lie the moment it left her mouth, knew she didn’t mean it, not with her head tipping back to bare her throat, not with her hands gripping Rio’s ass to keep her there.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s laugh was hot against her ear, smug enough to make her stomach twist. “Oh yeah?” she breathed, dragging her hips back just enough to make Agatha ache before driving in again.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck- yes!” Agatha cried out, one hand flying to the back of Rio’s head. She threaded her fingers through her hair and yanked her back from where she’d been sucking hard at her neck. Rio’s mouth left her skin with a soft, wet pop that sounded far too innocent for what it had been doing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to glare, but Rio’s grin was impossible to hold against -wide, smug, that stupid fucking gap in her teeth showing- while her eyes stayed lidded and dark. And with every thrust of Rio’s hips, all Agatha could manage were pitiful little whimpers and broken squeaks.</p><p> </p><p>“You-” Agatha tried, her voice catching. “Please-” she whimpered, her voice desperate.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s pace slowed, her expression shifting. She looked down at Agatha like she’d just found something she’d been searching for, like she couldn’t believe it was real.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the corners of her mouth curl in a faint, defiant smirk.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes fell to her lips, catching her smirk. “You’re an asshole,” she breathed, the words stripped of any real malice, her gaze soft and unrelenting- as if Agatha was the only thing worth looking at in the entire world.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m yours,” Agatha corrected, without a single ounce of defiance in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Mine?” Rio asked, barely audible as her hips rolled forward in a slow, deep thrust that made Agatha’s breath stutter.</p><p> </p><p>One of Agatha’s hands was still locked on the curve of Rio’s ass while the other was still tangled deep in her hair. She held Rio there, twisting gently at the roots, pulling her close until their foreheads touched.</p><p> </p><p>“Yours,” Agatha said again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked between Agatha’s lips and eyes like she couldn’t decide which she needed more. Then she moved- her mouth crashing into Agatha’s with an intensity that was more gratitude than hunger.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio pulled back, her hips were already driving into Agatha’s cunt harder.  “You’re mine,” Rio breathed, almost startled by the sound of it. The second time was different- solid, fact. “Fuck- Agatha- you’re mine. Always mine. No one else’s. Never anyone else’s.”</p><p> </p><p>Every word seemed to brand itself into Agatha’s skin, scorching, permanent, impossible to shake.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was crying out, nodding, gasping, her grip in Rio’s hair tightening with every thrust, clinging like she could keep her there forever. She wanted Rio closer, deeper- wanted to feel her in her bones, in the beat of her chest, in every breath she took. Every thrust dragged another sound from her, every pull made her want more.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby-” Rio’s voice cracked, hips driving deep, “I think I’m gonna-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s orgasm tore through her, incessant and all consuming. Her vision went white, every muscle locking as her cunt clamped hard around the strap, milking it in desperate pulses. She could feel the weight of Rio’s hips pinning her open, the deep, shuddering press of her inside, each tremor from Rio dragging another helpless cry from her throat. </p><p> </p><p>The sound of Rio’s breath breaking against her ear sent her spiraling higher, until there was nothing left but the heat and the dizzy, crushing need to never let her go.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>A swing sat in the far corner of Agatha’s backyard, its iron frame nearly swallowed by late summer blooms and greenery left to do as it pleased. The morning was still cool- thin light, damp air, the smell of cut grass drifting in from down the block.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had been angling for mornings like this ever since she noticed the sun slipping away earlier each evening. She’d always been that way, for as long as Agatha could remember- always chasing the tail end of summer. She craved the slow days, the air softened by heat, the way the sun took its time leaving. Now, with the season waning, Rio treated every minute outside like a borrowed thing, something she’d have to give back before she was ready.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, quietly, was relieved to find that hadn’t changed. </p><p> </p><p>They were still in what they’d woken up in- sweatshirts and boxers. Rio still had her socks on. Agatha’s feet were bare, toes pressing into the grass, cool and damp enough to make her feel awake. </p><p> </p><p>Beside her, Rio leaned back against the bench, head tipped toward the sky, her orange baseball cap shading her face. Her eyes were closed, a cigarette sat idled between two fingers, the other hand loose in her lap, curled around Agatha’s old purple lighter.</p><p> </p><p>There was a softness in Rio’s face now, an ease Agatha doesn’t remember from when they were younger. She didn’t know when that had happened, only that it hadn’t always been there. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes flicked down to the lighter in Rio’s hand. The initials carved into the side <em> -A.H.- </em>were worn to a dull impression, like something pressed into memory rather than metal. Faded, but still there.</p><p> </p><p>And somehow, after everything, Rio still had it. Still used it. Agatha couldn’t quite make sense of that. There was loyalty in it- subtle, disciplined, and strangely enduring. Years had passed, whole lives had been lived, and still Rio had kept pieces of her from another time. As if the girl Agatha had been back then was still worth keeping in her pocket.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>She had done the opposite. Agatha erased Rio from her life, stripping away anything that might pull her back into memories that never once gave her what she wanted. No photographs. No keepsakes. Nothing to make her stop and remember. Only one exception: a sweatshirt, buried in the back of a dark closet where she could pretend it was safe. Then, one day, even that was gone, torn from her before she could close her fingers around it.</p><p> </p><p>“Twenty questions?” Agatha asked, keeping her voice low enough to sound like an afterthought.</p><p> </p><p>The swing’s chain gave a lazy creak when Rio shifted her weight. “Shoot,” she said, eyes still closed.</p><p> </p><p>“Why do you still have my lighter?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because it’s mine.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “It’s not.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve had it longer than you ever did. Pretty sure that makes it mine by default.” Rio cracked one eye open, the corner of her mouth curling into a smile she didn’t bother to hide. “Why are you asking?”</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could answer, Rio took her hand and set it on her thigh. She began working over it in that unconscious way she always did now- thumb drifting along the bones, fingertips rolling over each joint as if her hands knew the shape of Agatha’s by heart.</p><p> </p><p>“Because I want to know why you kept all of it… My lighter, the pictures, my…” She turned her palm in Rio’s hand, offering it. It was her favorite place to be touched when Rio did this, and Rio’s thumb found it right away, pressing into the center and moving in slow, firm circles. “…the underwear you stole.”</p><p> </p><p>“Underwear you wanted me to steal,” Rio murmured, her smile twitching- too soft to be smug, but trying. She lifted the cigarette to her mouth, exhaling a slow curl of smoke. “It was all I had left of you.” Rio’s words were soft, almost careless, but her eyes flicked to Agatha when she said it -certain- before sliding away again. “Of course I kept it all.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha believed her, and she hated it. All that time, all those years, and her old things had been enough. Enough to keep. Enough to live with. Enough to stand in for her… For Agatha, the actual fucking person.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers shifted in Rio’s grip, not quite pulling away, but enough to make Rio tighten hers. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s junk,” Agatha made herself say it like she believed it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, a flicker of disbelief and offense crossing her face, before her eyes found Agatha’s again. “Well, some of that <em> ‘junk’ </em>is sitting in your house right now. So, what’s your point?”</p><p> </p><p>Like Agatha could fucking forget. Every time she woke up in her own bed, a younger version of herself and Rio sat framed on the nightstand, staring her down. She didn’t need the reminder. She didn’t need Rio looking at her like she could read the handwriting on her bones.</p><p> </p><p>“Does it matter?” Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, yeah?” Rio’s face twisted, the answer so obvious it almost hurt to force it out. “It matters to me. You matter to me. And just because you…” She broke off, eyes flicking away before finding Agatha’s again. Her jaw worked like she was biting down on something she couldn’t spit out, and Agatha wanted to pry it loose just to watch it hurt.</p><p> </p><p>“Just because I what?” Agatha tipped her chin, eyebrows arched, daring Rio to finish it.</p><p> </p><p>“Married someone else.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look away. Her stare hooked into Agatha’s, like she was waiting to see if she’d bite.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha did, with all the grace of someone who’d been sharpening her teeth for over a decade.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that’s the part you’re stuck on? Not the part where you had years to say something and didn’t? We didn’t speak for ten years, Rio. And before that? A few words here and there, and a goodbye that felt like a slap in the fucking face.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think any of that was easy for me?” Rio said- too loud, too sure, like Agatha was being the unreasonable one. “I sat outside your apartment more times than I could fucking count- sitting in my car like a dumbass because I didn’t know where else to go. I hated who I was without you. I didn’t know who I was without you. I missed you. I needed to talk to you. And I wanted you so fucking bad it hurt.”</p><p> </p><p>Well, join the fucking club, Agatha thought, but she wasn’t in the business of handing out credit for almosts anymore.</p><p> </p><p>What Agatha never could have anticipated was how much further it had gone- how someone who had once been the most important person in her life could vanish so completely that even the bare minimum, perfunctory connection people keep out of habit had never even been a fucking option.</p><p> </p><p>Like Agatha wouldn’t have ruined an entire marriage for fun over a single<em> I miss you </em> text from Rio Vidal. A <em> you up? </em> text? God forbid, her hand would’ve been in her pants before she even finished reading it.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha didn’t care if that made her a terrible person. Rio Vidal was a hell of a drug. The warning labels weren’t deterrents; they were bait. You reached anyway, knowing nothing else would ever come close. Even scraps could keep you high long enough to start dreaming about the next hit.</p><p> </p><p>Even thinking about it made her jaw ache.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well, you should’ve tried harder,” Agatha shot back. “You should’ve had the balls to get out of your fucking car and knock-”</p><p> </p><p>“I did!” Rio cut in. “And guess who opened the door?”</p><p> </p><p>“And you still walked away,” Agatha snapped, resentment bleeding into every word. “You let her speak for me, and you believed her. What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face twisted again and Agatha could see the way her jaw trembled before she spoke. “You were married, Agatha. You literally married someone else. How was I supposed to compete with a fucking marriage license?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t hearing her. Not really. And maybe Agatha hadn’t heard herself either, not until now. This wasn’t just about a move Rio never made, or some confession that never happened.</p><p> </p><p>It was about the years they did have, the way Rio had been her default person, her family, and then- nothing. Silence hadn’t just stolen the possibility of them; it had taken away the only place Agatha had ever truly belonged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had never minded being on her own. In truth, she’d built her life to protect it-  the quiet, the control, the assurance that no one could leave if she never let them close. But Rio had undone all of that. She’d pulled Agatha into the warmth of her life: Lilia sliding a chair out for her without asking, Sunday dinners that felt older than they were, a place to go on holidays without knocking, a home that breathed and made space for her as if it had been waiting for Agatha all along.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps that was the part Rio had never understood- the sheer intensity of what Agatha simply <em> felt </em>for her. It wasn’t neat or reasonable, it didn’t live in the safe lines of friendship or family. It could be sharp as anger, as steady as devotion, as consuming as love. It was all felt for Rio, and only for her. She was the single constant Agatha had ever trusted, the one person she’d been certain she could never lose.</p><p> </p><p>But she had. And still, Agatha carried her- in Chicago, even married to someone else, even through the long famine of silence- lodged in the back of her mind, as constant and relentless as the beat in her own chest. </p><p> </p><p>Losing that life -the seat at the table, the Sunday dinners, the open door on holidays- was the worst thing Rio had ever done to her, and the tragedy was that she’d never seemed to see it. That Rio could be close enough to touch, and still feel oceans away.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, you’re missing the point-”</p><p> </p><p>“Would you have even stayed if I asked?” Rio cut in before she could finish.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t have to think about it. She had carried the answer for so long it had settled into her bones. Even now, knowing Rio had come back that night, that she’d made it to the door before Wanda intercepted her, it didn’t touch the truth she carried.</p><p> </p><p>“You never would’ve asked,” Agatha said without hesitation, her voice soft but laced with a disappointment she made no effort to hide.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath faltered, and when she looked away, the sound she made was somewhere between a laugh and a breath that hurt. She didn’t argue. Didn’t bother trying to defend herself. </p><p> </p><p>That, alone, told Agatha she was right.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stubbed her cigarette out in the ashtray beside her, slipped her hand from Agatha’s, and slouched deeper into the bench. Her eyes had gone glassy, and Agatha could tell she probably pushed it too far.</p><p> </p><p>Without a word, Rio brought both hands to the hat on her head and pulled it down until her face was hidden.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha knew that habit by heart. Rio didn’t cry often, but when she did, she shut it down fast, tucking herself out of sight like her tears were something to be ashamed of.</p><p> </p><p>Even after all these years, Agatha still hated seeing Rio cry; it hurt in a place nothing else could touch. And the worst part? Rio still hid it from her, like Agatha hadn’t spent half her life wanting to catch those tears, to keep them safe before they could water the earth.</p><p> </p><p>“I hate when you do that,” Agatha said, softer than she meant to.</p><p> </p><p>“Do what?” Rio asked, voice muffled under the brim of her cap, the attempt at indifference was brittle and pointless.</p><p> </p><p>“Hide from me when you’re hurting.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move. Her fingers just tightened on her cap like she could pull it farther down, like it offered more protection than it did. Agatha didn’t say anything else. Her hand stayed where it was, resting in Rio’s lap, unmoving.</p><p> </p><p>She watched as Rio let out a breath through her nose, quiet and shaky, and slowly pulled the cap from her head.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at it for a moment before letting it fall slack in her hands. One hand raked through her flattened hair, brushing it back in a motion that might’ve looked careless if it weren’t for the way her fingers trembled.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally looked up, it was like being let in on something no one else was meant to see. Her lashes were wet and clumped, her cheeks flushed, the skin beneath her eyes raw.</p><p> </p><p>It hurt to see and every instinct in Agatha told her to look away, her heart couldn’t bear it, but she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard and her voice still caught on its way out, “Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, okay?” Rio said, desperate now. “It was the worst decision of my fucking life, and I’ve lived with it every day since.” She paused, jaw tight, breath catching. When she spoke again, her voice dropped- quieter, but still shaking. “I’m so fucking sorry. I’m sorry I knew exactly what you meant to me- I still let everything happen the way it did.”</p><p> </p><p>The pressure in Agatha’s chest built until it was almost unbearable, a hot, tight ache that made it hard to breathe. It wasn’t just anger- it was grief, and years of swallowed words, and the nastiest reminder of everything they’d been before it all went to absolute fucking shit.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m still so angry with you,” Agatha whispered through clenched teeth, her eyes burning. “You were my best friend, Rio. You weaseled your way into my fucking life, you brought me into your home and gave me a home, and then you shut me out of it.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“I never meant to take that from you.” The words rasped out of Rio as if she’d been holding them in her mouth too long, rough-edged from disuse and bitter from being swallowed back too many times. She hesitated, jaw working again, and Agatha saw the shallow rise and fall of her chest before she forced herself to go on. “I just… I couldn’t be around you. Not when you chose someone who hated me as much as she did.”</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze dropped to her hands, twisting in her lap, thumbs pressing into each other hard enough to blanch the skin. “It got to my head,” Rio said, softer now, “made everything feel ugly.” She let out a shaky breath that seemed to deflate her. “I kept thinking I’d find a way to be near you without it eating me alive. I thought I had time to figure it out. I never thought you’d leave before I could.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to scream, to rip something out of herself just to stop the ache. Loving Rio had never been gentle. It grew wild in her, sprawling into every corner until there was no room left for anything else. She could feel it even now-  roots knotted deep, climbing through her ribs, refusing to be cut back no matter how hard she tried.</p><p> </p><p>But some things don’t stop growing, not even when you’re gasping for air. The same roots that anchored Agatha had begun to wind tighter, the same vines that had drawn her close were now pulling until she felt stretched thin. And she couldn’t separate the beauty from the hurt. Every petal was edged with a thorn.</p><p> </p><p>It shouldn’t have been this hard. Not then. Not now. And yet, they’d both chosen the easier pain: distance, silence, the false mercy of leaving things untouched. Maybe they hadn’t meant to hurt each other. Agatha could almost believe that. But what did intention matter when the damage was already done?</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t innocent in it. She’d hurt Rio, too. She’d stayed with Wanda knowing exactly how she felt about Rio. She’d married someone who made it impossible for Rio to be part of her life, and then acted surprised when she disappeared. She had let the distance settle like dust and pretended she didn’t know how to sweep it away.</p><p> </p><p>And now Agatha was tired. Tired of carrying something that refused to get lighter. Tired of tending to a wound that would not heal, of loving something that only grew heavier the longer she held it. The truth she didn’t want to face was that she didn’t want to lose Rio -not at all- but she also couldn’t keep going like this, circling the same pain until it hollowed them both out.</p><p> </p><p>Her voice came flat, almost against her own will. “You know what? If it’s going to be like this -if it’s going to keep feeling like this- maybe we should just break up.”</p><p> </p><p>“Break up?” Rio repeated, face twisting like the words didn’t belong to either of them. “Wait we’re…” Her gaze dropped, tracing the sweep of the grass under them like she was searching it for proof of something she’d missed, some detail that might make the words make sense. When she looked back at Agatha, her voice was smaller. “We’re dating?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, Jesus fucking Christ. Of course. They hadn’t slapped a label on it, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a fucking duck.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you think we’ve been doing this whole time?” Agatha’s voice rose, her hand cutting through the air as if she could point to the last four months and make Rio see it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat back slowly, like she'd just been told something she thought she wasn’t  allowed to want. Her eyes scanned Agatha’s face, searching, stunned. “You’re my girlfriend?” she whispered, almost disbelieving. “And I didn’t know?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach turned. Rio was looking at her with those wide, miserable brown eyes, like she couldn’t understand how she’d missed it, didn’t know exactly where it had gone wrong, only that it hurt. Agatha hated how familiar it felt, her own heart in Rio’s hands, still beating, while Rio turned it over like she was trying to figure out when it had gotten there.</p><p> </p><p>And okay. Maybe Agatha would take the blame for this one. Rio had been patient, moving at Agatha’s pace, never asking for more than she was ready to give. And now here Agatha was, blurting out words Rio hadn’t even known she’d named, blindsiding her with a definition she’d never been told they were living by.</p><p> </p><p>But that was the thing about silence- it could keep the peace for a while, even in good faith, but it always came back to bite them in the ass. It was a habit Agatha hadn’t managed to break, and cowardice had always been her easiest refuge. </p><p> </p><p>So Agatha didn’t explain. She pushed herself off the swing, the chains clattering in protest, and crossed the yard without looking back.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey!” Rio’s voice cut through behind her, followed by the sound of footsteps closing in.</p><p> </p><p>In seconds, Rio was in front of Agatha, moving into her path, both hands coming up to catch her by the shoulders to stop her. “You don’t get to drop that and not tell me what I did wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head, refusing to meet her eyes. “Move, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t,” Rio said, lifting her hands and placing them gently on either side of Agatha’s face. She tilted Agatha’s head toward her, thumbs brushing just beneath her cheekbones. “Tell me what to fix, and I’ll fix it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes slammed shut. She couldn’t look. Couldn’t let that be what broke her. Her throat locked, everything in her chest felt like it was tightening all at once. Rio’s hands were too familiar, too warm, too easy to lean into- and Agatha could already feel herself losing ground.</p><p> </p><p>She shook her head and grabbed Rio’s wrists, pulled her hands away. She tried to step around her, ready to put space between them while she still could. But Rio moved with her, sidestepping easily, her body closing off the path again. </p><p> </p><p>“Tell me,” Rio said, breathless. “What do I need to do? Be softer? Be louder? Pretend it doesn’t matter to me? Just- tell me what version of me you want, and I’ll be her.”</p><p> </p><p>The absurdity of it almost made Agatha laugh. It had never been about Rio being too loud or too afraid or too far gone to reach. Agatha had loved her through every version- through fear, through silence, through the years that turned them into strangers. Even now, with Rio standing in front of her, desperate to change something, Agatha still couldn’t find a single part of her that was wrong.</p><p> </p><p>And that fucking sucked.</p><p> </p><p>Because if there had been something broken- something ugly or evil she could point to and say <em> this, this is why </em>- then maybe she could have let go. Maybe she wouldn’t have carried it for so long, a grief without a cause, growing wild and utterly rooted inside of her.</p><p> </p><p>But there had never been anything wrong with Rio. Not then. Not now. Not ever. </p><p> </p><p>Rio took a step closer, her voice shaking but certain. “I’ve kept quiet because that’s what you wanted. And that’s fine. That’s- fine. But I won’t do it anymore, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice shook, but Agatha saw it anyway- the shift in her eyes, the weight gathering there like she was about to step somewhere they had never stood before. She knew what was coming. She could feel it as clearly as she did when Rio’s hand pressed against her chest when they kissed.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha snapped, then stopped herself, breath unsteady. “Don’t,” Agatha said again, quieter this time, pleading, because she couldn’t let her say it. Not here. Not now.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched, holding the words behind her teeth. But then her gaze shifted, like she was choosing a version of the truth Agatha wouldn’t be able to run from.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re not breaking up,” Rio said, and it sounded less like a decision and more like a fact carved in bone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head snapped back, her brows drawing in. “Excuse me?”</p><p> </p><p>“If you’re going to break up with me, then I’m going to know I was your girlfriend for longer than five fucking minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, and just like that, Rio was walking away from her.</p><p> </p><p>Her chest seized, her breath catching before she could mask it. “Where are you going?” Agatha asked, already moving, her steps quick and uneven behind Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>“My apartment.”</p><p> </p><p>The word landed like a door slamming shut, and Agatha stopped cold. She stared at Rio’s back, at the space growing between them, and felt the panic rise so quickly it bordered on instinct. It hit her too fast to make sense of, too sudden to contain. So she did what she always did- reached for the first weapon she could throw- something that might make her stop, even if it was the wrong thing entirely.</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t walk away from her again. She wouldn’t survive that twice.</p><p> </p><p>The words tore out of her before she could catch them, jagged and unguarded, before she could think better of them. </p><p> </p><p>“If you walk away from me again, I will hate you forever!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped like she'd hit a wall. For a breath, she didn’t move, didn’t turn, didn’t speak- just stood there, her back to Agatha, the weight of her stillness louder than anything she could have said.</p><p> </p><p>Then she turned, and the distance between them vanished. Her mouth crashed into Agatha’s with a hunger that didn’t build, it detonated. One hand locked around Agatha’s jaw, angling her just right, the other fisting hard in her sweatshirt and dragging her closer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her in without hesitation. Tongue, teeth, heat- every kiss a collision, every breath stolen and given back. Her fingers curled into Rio’s hair, pulled, and Rio moaned low into her mouth like it was the only answer she had left.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally tore away, Agatha chased her mouth, dazed, breathless, desperate to find her again- but Rio held her still, her grip firm, her forehead resting against Agatha’s like she couldn’t quite bear to lose the contact.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t ever fucking say that to me again,” Rio breathed out, the words pressed against Agatha’s mouth like a vow, or a warning, or both.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth -ready to throw it back at her, to say <em> then don’t walk away from me again </em>- but Rio had already stepped back, swiping at her face, breath still coming uneven. And Agatha whimpered at the loss before she could stop herself.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to my apartment,” Rio said, her voice steadier than it had any right to be. “And then I’m coming back. Because that’s what we do now. You can say whatever you want, swear you’ll hate me forever- I’ll still come back. I’ll always come back. And sooner or later, you’re going to believe me when I say I’m not losing you again.” She cleared her throat, wiped at her nose, tried to make it sound casual. “So yeah. I’ll be home later.”</p><p> </p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She just stood there, heart pounding, trying not to fall apart over syllables.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> I’ll be home later. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The smell of Rio’s cigarette still clung to her sweatshirt.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Home. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Oh.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know what she was expecting, only that she couldn’t sit still long enough for Rio to come back.</p><p> </p><p>Her knuckles grazed the door once, then again, harder. She stepped back, heart thudding in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>The door swung open.</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia,” Agatha breathed.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p><em>The door swung open.</em></p><p><em> </em></p><p><em>“Lilia,” Agatha breathed.</em></p><p> </p><p>For a moment Agatha forgot herself, forgot that she had been bracing for this for years.  Lilia’s eyes moved over her, sweeping across her face as if to take inventory of time itself- every new line, every mark of age, every trace of damage that absence might have left behind. Lilia didn’t look surprised. She didn’t even look angry, exactly. Just… like someone who’d been expecting her eventually, though maybe not today.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her gaze to the porch planks, suddenly absorbed by the way the stain had faded into softer shades, worn smooth where countless shoes had passed- a much safer study than the way Lilia was peeling her apart with her eyes. Agatha never liked being read like that, like every thought she had shoved down was written clear across her face. Her chest tightened; she sniffed, cleared her throat, and tugged up a crooked smile that didn’t fool either of them.</p><p> </p><p>“So… Lilia. Been a long time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fourteen years,” Lilia reminded her. “And now you’re on my porch like it’s been fourteen minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, letting her smile slip toward something more sardonic. “Figured we could skip the part where you slam the door in my face.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia gave a small, humorless scoff. “Uh-uh. Beat it, Harkness!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha might’ve believed her if Lilia had actually shut the door, but instead Lilia had turned on her heel and strode back inside.</p><p> </p><p>The door stayed open behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Typical Lilia- no welcome, no smile, just the wordless assurance that Agatha still had a place here, whether she deserved it or not. And Agatha would follow her in because for all her pride, she wasn’t stupid enough to walk away twice from a door Lilia had left open for her.</p><p> </p><p>Crossing the threshold, the smell hit Agatha first- incense, thick enough to sting the back of her throat and threaten to burn every last nose hair she had left. She kept her eyes forward, refusing to be pulled toward the framed pictures on the walls and mantle, the sagging sofa that still wore the same crocheted throw, the corners where a younger version of herself had once laughed or sulked or stayed too long. Every inch of it pressed against her like a hand around her throat, and she had to keep moving before she lost her breath entirely.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, come on, Lilia,” Agatha called after Lilia’s retreating footsteps. </p><p> </p><p>Lilia answered with nothing more than a low, unimpressed grunt.</p><p> </p><p>She trailed the muffled clatter of cupboards into the kitchen, shouldering through the bead curtain that clicked and snapped against her. And there it was. That table. That chair- hers, still sitting in its spot like it had been holding its place for her. She didn’t go near it. No. She slid into a safer seat, putting space between herself and the past Lilia’s house kept trying to hand her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat there, restless, eyes fixed anywhere but on Lilia as she moved through the kitchen without a word, not even a glance in her direction. The silence wasn’t accidental. It never was. It settled over them the same way it used to when Lilia had wanted Agatha to think before she spoke.</p><p> </p><p>Still, her eyes betrayed her, landing on Lilia when she hadn’t meant them to. Her hair was grayer now, pinned up so the light flashed off its strands. The mustard jacket, the wide blue pants, the glint of jewlery when she moved. She was older now, but in a way that made her more herself- honed, solid, like the years had deepened her instead of wearing her away.</p><p> </p><p>It hit harder than Agatha told herself it would. Fourteen years gone, and she’d just stood off to the side while they vanished. She thought about every chance she’d had to cross this threshold and didn’t, all the versions of herself that had kept their distance. </p><p> </p><p>And the feeling it left her with shoved itself up under her ribs until Agatha had to look away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, quick and too loud. Her fingers tapped against the table, restless, buying her a second before she had to open her mouth. “You look good,” she said finally. “How old are you now, four hundred and ten? Four hundred and fifteen?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia spun, hand on her hip, eyebrows arched high. “How dare you,” she snapped, then crossed the kitchen and swept through the curtain, the bead strands clacking in her wake.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had only enough time to smirk before the beads clattered again and Lilia returned, a bundle of sage already smoking in her hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, for fuck’s sake-”</p><p> </p><p>“You need it,” Lilia said, moving the sage in slow circles around her, sending curls of smoke into the air. “You’ve brought nearly two decades of bad energy into this house, and I’m not living with it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha coughed, waving the smoke away. “You could just say you missed me.”</p><p> </p><p>“If I missed you,” Lilia said evenly, “you’d know.” There was the faintest twitch at the corner of her mouth before she turned away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, still swatting half heartedly at the smoke. “So that’s it? Fourteen years and you’re just gonna fumigate me?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia set the sage in a chipped ceramic dish, then turned with that same assessing stare. “Tea or coffee?”</p><p> </p><p>“That depends. Is this you being nice or you trying to poison me?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia ignored her, pulled the coffee pot from the counter and walked it over to the machine. “When did you last eat?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m fine, Lilia.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure you are.” Lilia shoved the pot into the warming plate and turned from the counter, already fishing something from the fridge. “I’ll heat up some leftovers.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine, really. I’m not hungry.” And Agatha was telling the truth, at least in that moment. The thought of chewing, swallowing, forcing food down- it was almost enough to make her gag.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia stilled, the fridge door hanging open for a moment before she shut it with a quiet thud. She didn’t bother reaching again. Instead, she crossed her arms and leaned into the counter, eyes locked on Agatha. “So,” she said slowly, “what did she do this time?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm-hm.” Lilia’s hum was thick with disbelief. “So you just wandered over here on your own accord.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said, meeting her gaze now with a flicker of annoyance. “Not everything has to do with her, Lilia. I missed you. Fourteen years was a stupid amount of time to stay away.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s brow lifted, but her gaze didn’t waver. “You think saying it now makes it any less stupid?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed out a laugh that had no humor in it. “No. But it’s the best I’ve got.” She shifted in her seat, fingers drumming against the table before stilling.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia held her gaze a moment longer, something unspoken flickering there before she finally turned back to the coffee machine. “Yeah,” she said, almost too low to catch. “Took you long enough.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know. I’m sorry,” Agatha said, and the words tasted strange in her mouth. “I shouldn’t have waited this long. I should’ve… I don’t know. Shown up sooner. Done something different.” She started worrying at an invisible stain on the table, nails tracing a pattern that wasn’t there, just to give her hands something to do.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia stayed at the counter, pouring two cups of coffee, a loud laugh slipping out before she lifted a hand to cover her mouth, like she’d been caught misbehaving. “I’m sorry, Agatha,” she managed, her voice still warm with amusement. “I don’t mean to laugh. It’s just-” she glanced over her shoulder, lips quirking, “you apologizing? Didn’t see that one coming.”</p><p> </p><p>She turned away from the counter, crossed the kitchen and set a cup in front of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gawked at her, brows raised. “I apologize!”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm.” Lilia slipped into the chair across from her. “Anyway. Doesn’t matter.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shot her a look over the rim of the cup before taking a sip. Lilia’s coffee was exactly as she remembered- rich, dark, and unreasonably fucking good. She let herself hold it there on her tongue, forcing herself to savor it instead of spitting it back out just to prove she could.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia settled in her chair, elbows on the table, eyes studying her. The longer it went on, the more Agatha squirmed, heat crawling up her neck under it. If anyone else tried studying her like that she would’ve torn into them without a second thought. But this was Lilia. So she swallowed it down, the retort sitting bitter on her tongue.</p><p> </p><p><em>Respect your elders</em>, Agatha reminded herself.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve got some of yourself back,” Lilia finally said. “I can see it.” Her eyes narrowed, and the corner of her mouth twitched again. “I figure it has something to do with you being done playing house with Wanda.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother faking shock. What would be the point? That marriage fooled absolutely no one. Wanda was never the grand romance, just the slowest, most exhausting pit stop she could’ve chosen on the way back to where she belonged. Hell, the whole town probably knew it. Everyone did. Everyone except Rio. </p><p> </p><p>The only person who ever needed to, didn’t.  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded her head a little bit, lips curling into a grin that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Yeah. Probably. Or maybe I just got better at faking it.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, love. You’ve never been good at faking anything.”</p><p> </p><p>The word sat warm in Agatha’s chest and tight in her throat, it felt too generous, too kind. She cleared her throat, her voice lighter than she meant. “No?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Lilia huffed a small laugh, like the answer had always been obvious. “Especially not when your heart’s in the room.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to roll her eyes, scoff, make a joke just to push them somewhere safer. But she knew exactly what Lilia meant. She always had. “<em>Your heart</em>” had been Lilia’s little code for Rio back then, slipped into conversations in private, soft enough to pass as teasing about a best friend. She hadn’t said it often- just enough for Agatha to feel seen in a way she couldn’t stand and couldn’t shake.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well… she’s not here, so my odds just got a whole lot better.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia hummed, like she’d just fit a piece into place. “Still think you can outsmart everyone, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at her, mouth falling open. Her face couldn’t decide what it was doing- somewhere between a grin and pure confusion. It was funny, actually. Because what the fuck?</p><p> </p><p>“Outsmart? Please. Who the fuck-”</p><p> </p><p>“Language.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry. Who the <em>hell</em> have I outsmarted? Honestly.” Agatha swept a hand toward the empty room, to the audience of everyone she’s supposedly fooled. “Because if memory serves, everyone’s been in on the joke. You literally just said I’ve never been good at faking it.”</p><p> </p><p>“If everyone knew, love, then what made you think you couldn’t come home sooner?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swore she heard tires screech across her skull with her thoughts slamming to a stop.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” She answered before she could think better of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Well.” Lilia’s palms landed on the table with a decisive smack before she pushed herself up. “You’re only lying to yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia didn’t answer right away; she let the bead curtain rattle under her hand, forcing Agatha to follow the sound. “If you’re not going to be honest, there’s no point in sitting here. I’ve covered for the both of you long enough, and I won’t help it drag on any further.” </p><p> </p><p>“Honest?” Agatha squeaked, twisting in her chair. Her eyes darted around the kitchen, then snapped back to Lilia. She gritted her teeth. “What- you want me to tattle on myself? … In broad daylight?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia sighed and let the beads slip back into place, then crossed the room to sit down again. The chair creaked as she lowered herself into it. With her elbows on the table again, Lilia dropped her face into her hands and shook her head slowly, fingers pressed at her temples. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit down on her tongue, lips pressed tight, refusing to fill the silence. She could handle being yelled at. But disappointment- that was harder. The heavier cross to bear, Agatha would say.</p><p> </p><p>When Lilia finally lifted her head, her palms landed against the table with a dull smack. She looked at Agatha with an exhaustion that was almost worse than an accusation. “You know when I knew?”</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me.” Agatha heard the bite in her own voice, caught it, coughed, rolled her shoulders in a shrug, tried again. “I mean- you’re going to, anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>God forbid she admit it: she wanted to know. Wanted to gather every scrap of the <em>them </em>from someone else’s mouth to catch the softness she’d missed, to remind her it hadn’t all been awful.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia gave her a look between pity and <em>are you serious right now?</em> Then she shook her head. “It was maybe your fourth time here. By then, you were comfortable enough to be, well… <em>yourself</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell is that supposed to mean?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia ignored her interruption. “And Rio- Rio was pacing my kitchen like she always did when she didn’t know what to do with herself. Nervous as anything, wearing a path into my hardwood. But the moment you pulled into the driveway, and she bolted. Grabbed the umbrella and flew out the door before you even killed the engine.” Her gaze drifted toward the bead curtain, her voice turned softer, </p><p> </p><p>“That girl hated rain, Agatha. Always did. Couldn’t stand her clothes sticking to her skin, couldn’t handle the mess. I’ve seen her throw fits over a splash of water on her sleeve. But that night? The second you pulled up, she forgot all about it. Walked straight out into a downpour without a second's hesitation. And I swear I thought- hell must’ve frozen over.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost snorted. Yeah, well, if it had, she’d like to file a complaint, because somehow she’d missed the part where heaven or hell ever bothered lifting a finger for her.</p><p> </p><p>But now all she could think about was Rio barreling out the front door tearing across the yard with an umbrella clutched in both hands- like if the wind caught her just right, she might actually take flight. By the time she reached Agatha’s car, she was drenched, umbrella flailing until she yanked the car door open. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had gotten out laughing, only to be pulled under that umbrella and forced to watch Rio beam at her. She looked like she’d been waiting her whole life for Agatha to pull into that driveway. Again. <em>Rio</em>. Who had chosen to run out into the middle of a storm and smiled through it anyway. For Agatha. All for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>How the fuck was Agatha supposed to not fall in love with her? Good question. The answer : there was never a version of Agatha’s life where that wouldn’t happen.</p><p> </p><p>Every time Rio had laughed, every time she barreled headfirst into something she swore she couldn’t survive, every time she looked at Agatha like she was the only thing in the room- it stacked up. A few months into their so-called friendship and Agatha was staring down the massive, steaming pile of shit called realizing you were in love with your best friend. Rio, of course, noticed. <em>What’s wrong with your face?</em> she’d asked, like Agatha wasn’t in the middle of having her entire brain chemistry rewritten. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha figured she must’ve looked horrified. Or constipated. Which wasn’t far off- she was emotionally constipated, and nothing clogged the system worse than a feeling she hadn’t asked for.</p><p> </p><p>The softness of Lilia’s voice cut straight through her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>“I watched from the window. The two of you standing out there, rain pouring down, crammed under that umbrella and laughing like the rest of the world didn’t exist. That was the first time I think I ever saw Rio exist outside of her own head- like all that noise she usually carried around looked quiet. And you-” Lilia’s eyes didn’t waver, “your feet were set. Planted, like you weren’t going anywhere as long as she was standing there.”</p><p> </p><p>“That was the plan,” Agatha muttered, dragging her thumbnail along the edge of the table. “Westview was always the plan.”</p><p> </p><p>She  didn’t look up, but she could feel Lilia’s eyes on her, heavy with pity. The taste of it sat like bile in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“When did that change,” Lilia asked softly. </p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t been Wanda, though she made a convenient scapegoat.</p><p> </p><p>Being best friends with Rio wasn’t enough. It had never been enough, and Agatha had tried to make that clear. She thought she’d left enough hints. Maybe she said too little, maybe she counted too much on implication, but everyone else seemed to catch on. </p><p> </p><p>Everyone except Rio.</p><p> </p><p>So really, it was every question left unanswered, every silence that stretched too long, every time Agatha realized she wasn’t being seen anymore. <em>Rio</em>, who used to look at her like she was quite literally impossible to ignore, started turning away. The same woman who once treated Agatha as a challenge, an invitation, began to flinch like she was a threat.</p><p> </p><p>That was when it changed.</p><p> </p><p>And now, nearly two decades later, Agatha still couldn’t give anyone a straight answer to the question she dreaded most: <em>Was Rio in love with you too?</em> If she was honest, she leaned toward no. Not because of the way things ended, but because it hadn’t felt like love. It felt like being stripped for parts, hollowed out and left begging for scraps of something she should never have had to beg for in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>“Everyone’s got a limit, Lilia. I hit mine. I couldn’t keep wasting my time on it anymore,” Agatha said, her nail digging harder into the table. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wouldn’t admit the only thing she’d ever seemed to be consistent about was wasting her own time.</p><p> </p><p>“You still sound angry when you talk about it,” Lilia pointed out. </p><p> </p><p>And wasn’t the sky fucking blue?</p><p> </p><p>“I am angry,” Agatha snapped as her fist slammed the table, mugs rattling on the table. Lilia didn’t so much as flinch. She pressed her curled fist to her mouth and bit down on her pointer finger like she could chew the feeling down to size. Her eyes stung. “Your daughter pisses me off,” she muttered into her fist.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, please. Forgive her. Her head was constantly running interference. She could keep pace with her feelings. She was always battling the ground under her feet, like she had to earn every inch of it just to exist, you know that. She did it with me. She did it with you. And by the time her heart moved, her body would stall. It left her a step behind, every single time.” Lilia’s tone was soft, but not gentle- more like she was tired of watching them hurt themselves.</p><p> </p><p>The thing about Rio was she always showed up- when Agatha needed her, when she didn’t. But sometime before Agatha even met Wanda, a switch flipped. Everything Rio did felt late. Like she was scrambling to catch up to something. And Rio was never late. If you looked up punctual in the dictionary, you’d find Rio Vidal’s face staring right back you.</p><p> </p><p>To this day, Agatha swears that period of time was the most off-balance she had ever seen Rio- and watching it happen had been fucking brutal. Agatha tried to help -stopped nudging things out of balance, left her carefully counted silverware alone- but it only seemed to make things worse. Even just Agatha’s presence managed to magnify it all.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that was the first time Agatha really understood heartbreak: watching the person you loved fight themselves bloody, and realizing your hands only added to the damage.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, here we go- poor Rio.” Agatha raised and dropped her arms in defeat. “What was I supposed to do, huh? Sit around until she screwed her head on straight? Newsflash: it wouldn’t have made a damn difference” She jabbed a finger at the table to punctuate it. “She has OCD, Lilia. We all knew it, and yet we still talk around it like she’s gonna kick down the door and chew us out for saying it out loud. Which is actually fucking insane!” Agatha laughed in disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>“And then I come back and -poof- new Rio. I don’t even recognize her. Suddenly she’s fine, suddenly she’s functioning, and what’s the big takeaway? That I was the problem holding her back?” She leaned back into her chair, arms folding tight across her chest. “Do you know what that feels like? To come back and see that? It’s a slap in the <em>fucking </em>face.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s brows jumped, almost cartoonish in their disbelief. “She went to therapy, Agatha. You moving away wasn’t some magic cure.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her arms, her mouth twisted. “Therapy?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Therapy.” Lilia leaned back, a smile tugging at her mouth. “You might want to try it sometime.”</p><p> </p><p>“Gross,” Agatha muttered, but there was no real disgust there. Her fingers drummed against the table before she narrowed her eyes at Lilia. “Though I suppose the silver lining is that I can blame you for not getting her the help she needed when she was a kid. Maybe that’s why we didn’t work out the first time around. Poor case management on your end.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia rolled her eyes. “I did try,” she said finally, matter of fact. “She bit every therapist I sent her to. Told me she’d keep biting them until I got the message and stopped pushing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barked out a laugh despite herself. It was too perfect. Too Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“But let’s be honest,” Lilia continued, and now her voice carried the weight of someone who had thought about this far longer than Agatha ever wanted her to. “Even if she hadn’t, even if she sat there politely and smiled through every session, it wouldn’t have mattered. She wasn’t ready. Therapy only works if you decide you want to get better, and she didn’t- not then. No one could’ve forced her into it. Not me, not you, not anyone.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia leaned back, “You weren’t her cure, Agatha. You were her wake-up call. When you left, it shook her. She realized she couldn’t stay frozen in the same place, not if there was any chance you’d come back. She wanted to change. She wanted to be enough. And she believed, like the rest of us, that sooner or later, you’d come back.”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t funny anymore. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, forcing the corners of her mouth into something that pretended at amusement. A villain knew when she was being cast as the lesson. She’d been playing that part her whole life.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia caught it instantly. “No. Don’t do that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even blink. “Do what?” The word came out flat, brittle.</p><p> </p><p>“That,” Lilia pointed at Agatha’s face. “Acting like you're the villain. You were <em>hurt</em>. Rio hurt you. Whatever else she had going on doesn’t excuse it. She’s not a saint, and you don’t get to erase your own feelings just because hers were complicated.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw twitched, but she didn’t speak.</p><p> </p><p>“You have got to quit turning it into some blame game. Neither of you were enough for the other because you couldn’t be. You were kids. Two kids who didn’t know what they were doing. That’s not a crime, it’s just what it was. And you can’t keep picking it apart like you were supposed to know any better.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her vision blur a little with unshed tears. “But I loved her,” she breathed out.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia reached across the table and caught her hand, holding it like a parent catching a child in the middle of a fall. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her, even as Lilia’s pity-laden eyes never flinched.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course you did. And she loved you. None of that changes the fact you still lost each other. You think love should’ve been enough to stop it. It never is. That’s just a lie we all tell ourselves- that if we love hard enough, we get to keep it. You don’t. Love guarantees grief, Agatha. That’s the bargain. You can’t separate them.”</p><p> </p><p>And wasn’t that the truth? </p><p> </p><p>That loss didn’t just go away. Agatha carried it into every room, every choice, every pause between words. Love wasn’t enough. People walked away. Time didn’t heal a damn thing. “Moving on” was a complete fucking joke. She had tried. She changed everything she could -the scenery, the people, even herself- it didn’t make a fucking difference. She couldn’t escape it.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s thumb swept across Agatha’s knuckles, “The only way through it is forward. You wake up tomorrow, and you try again. And if you can’t that day, then you try the next. And the next. Tomorrow is all any of us hope to ever get, Agatha. You don’t need to carry the end of the world in your chest. Not when what you want is right in front of you.”</p><p> </p><p><em>I’ll try again tomorrow. </em></p><p> </p><p>At least Rio’s favorite slogan wasn’t something she picked up in therapy. If it was, Agatha might’ve actually had to buy a gun, just to put herself out of her own misery. What a relief, knowing Agatha had been spared that indignity.</p><p> </p><p>She gave Lilia’s hand a quick squeeze before slipping free, swiping at the tear that slipped down her cheek.  It didn’t do much. The second she pressed both palms hard into her eyes, she still felt it leaking through, burning. “God, I hate it when you’re right,” she muttered, voice trying for humor.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m always right,” Lilia shot back, smug as ever, and Agatha didn’t need to see her face to know she was smiling.</p><p> </p><p>When she finally lowered her hands, there it was: Lilia looking at her like she hadn’t just dragged Agatha through seventeen years of emotional bullshit. That smile wasn’t pity- it was recognition. A warmth that said <em>you finally made it back home. </em></p><p> </p><p>“She loved me back?” The question came out hesitant, soft in a way that pissed her off. It betrayed just how many nights she’d spent tearing herself apart over it.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a dumbass for ever questioning it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p> </p><p>Then Lilia tilted her head like she was tired of watching Agatha dance around the obvious. “Do you still love her?”</p><p> </p><p><em>Double homicide,</em> Agatha thought. And if she’d had the energy, she might’ve laughed at her own gallows humor.</p><p> </p><p>Her throat tightened, but the answer was easy, “Of course I do.”</p><p> </p><p>“There you are,” Lilia whispered, her smile softening the words. “Welcome back. Now how about we take a break, get out the dominoes, and see if you’ve finally figured out how to play without humiliating yourself?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched Lilia push back from her chair and head out of the kitchen. She wanted to stay. They’d wasted many nights like that before, Lilia crowing at every slip as if clowning Agatha was a personal hobby. And maybe Agatha needed that right now- the comfort of something ordinary.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio was still seeping into every corner of her mind.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia reappeared with the battered tin box in her hands, its paint scratched and its corners dented from years of use. She popped the lid and poured the dominoes out on the table in a rush of clattering noise. </p><p> </p><p>“Lilia, I should probably get back to Ri-”</p><p> </p><p>“Nonsense.” Lilia cut her off without looking up, already dragging the dominoes into a heap with both hands. “She’ll be fine.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha eyed Lilia. She didn’t know about the argument they’d had earlier, didn’t know how badly Agatha wanted to fix it, and with haste. She didn’t want Rio thinking she’d bolted or done something stupid. Yet Lilia sat there with that unnerving composure, like she had a sense for things before anyone else did.</p><p> </p><p>“Should probably shoot her a text anyway,” Agatha mumbled, digging her phone out of her back pocket, still side eyeing Lilia with suspicion. </p><p> </p><p>Lilia only hummed, bent over the table, still flipping the dominoes face down.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha unlocked her phone. No flood of missed calls, no string of panicked texts from Rio. That was… a relief, actually. Either she wasn’t home yet or she was, and she hadn’t worked herself into a frenzy thinking Agatha had bolted. </p><p> </p><p>Still, she thumbed out a quick text: <em>left the house for a bit. I’ll be home later. </em>That was it. No mention of where she’d gone. She wasn’t about to casually lob, ‘<em>Oh hey, by the way, after months of avoiding it, I finally waltzed into your mother’s house without you’,</em> into Rio’s lap over text. No. That conversation demanded more than a casual text. It demanded Agatha’s face, her tone, and possibly her groveling.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes flicked up to Lilia- bent over the dominoes, sleeves shoved to her elbows, stirring the pile in wide, careless circles. The noise was loud as shit, but familiar, like the echo of a life Agatha thought she’d lost. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her phone up and snapped a picture. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a whim. It wasn’t vanity. It was need. She had nothing left of this- no pictures of this table, no scraps of this house, no trace of the woman across from her. Ten years of proof had been deleted, burned, shredded in a dozen midnight purges. At the time it felt righteous, necessary even. If she cut the past out root and stem, maybe it couldn’t grow back and strangle her.</p><p> </p><p>But sitting here now, watching Lilia shuffle dominoes like nothing had changed at all, the certainty of those choices curdled in her stomach and all Agatha could think about was how stupid she’d been. She hadn’t protected herself by erasing the past-  she had gutted her own history, carved out years until there was nothing left but memory, and her memory had always been a treacherous fucking liar.</p><p> </p><p>She looked at the picture: crooked, grainy, Lilia’s face half hidden. Nothing special. And still, it mattered. It was proof that she had come back, that she’d walked through the door she swore she’d never open again, and found it waiting for her. Finally, Agatha held more than a memory in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Pick seven,” Lilia said as she settled into her chair, pulling Agatha out of her head.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha locked her phone, set it face down on the table, and picked her dominoes without protest.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t say how long they’d been playing when she heard the front door creak open. Her whole body went rigid, eyes snapping to Lilia like she’d just been caught in a crime.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t look at me like that, Agatha,” Lilia said, unbothered. “My children come and go as they please. They don’t owe me a notice every time they want to step foot in their own home.” Her gaze flicked to the bead curtain, then back to Agatha with the faintest curve of a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Children? They’re both here?” Agatha hissed, leaned closer, hands gripping the edge of the table. “Also, it’s pretty fucked no one thought to mention the family expansion that happened while I was still living down the goddamn street!”</p><p> </p><p>Voices spilled down the hallway- quiet, heated. They tangled, broken up by footsteps that kept starting, stalling, starting again. A thud echoed, followed by a muttered curse, then a louder shush that only sparked more whispering.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head whipped toward the sound, then back to Lilia. But Lilia was the picture of calm, elbow braced on the table, chin in her palm, idly studying her dominoes. She glanced up at Agatha and said, “Judging by the racket? That’s definitely both of them.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, sliding down in her chair and covering her face with one hand. </p><p> </p><p>This was a fucking nightmare. She hadn’t exactly planned on staying long- just long enough to air out over nearly two decades of grievances, which, in Agatha’s case, were the same thing as her feelings. That was already more emotional labor than she’d signed up for in one lifetime. </p><p> </p><p>She’d come here prompted by the fact that sitting in her own house, waiting for Rio to come home after their blowup that morning, felt excruciating. And now, because the universe loved irony, Rio was here. With Sage in tow- the little sister no one had thought to mention until recently. Six months ago? Maybe less. Agatha couldn’t even keep track anymore, and frankly, she didn’t care to. All she knew was that the timing was fucked up, and she was trapped right in the middle of it.</p><p> </p><p>The whispering in the hall was getting louder, sharper- snaps and hisses tangled with the sound of shoes scuffing against the floorboards. And Agatha shot another glance at the bead curtain. She couldn’t see through it, but she could make out two pairs of feet pacing, bumping, squaring up like <em>fucking idiots </em>about to brawl.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could even blink, Sage came barreling through the curtain. The beads clattered wildly as she tripped, landing flat on the floor with a <em>thunk</em> that made Agatha jump in her chair.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia didn’t so much as flinch- still propped on one elbow, chin in her palm, the only reaction she gave Agatha was a long suffering glance like none of this was unusual.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked back to Sage, sprawled on her back. “That fucking hurt, you bitch!” she barked, kicking a leg blindly through the beads.</p><p> </p><p>A muffled <em>yelp</em> cut behind the curtain. Followed immediately by silence, which Agatha assumed was Rio slapping a hand over her own mouth before she gave herself away like they hadn’t already just made an entire fucking scene out of their arrival.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage, stop trying to cripple your sister. Rio, grow a spine and get in here,” Lilia said, sounding more bored than bothered.</p><p> </p><p>Sage sat up straighter on the floor, eyes wild, pointing an accusatory thumb over her shoulder. “I’m sorry- are we all just going to ignore the fact that I was<em> body slammed</em> into the kitchen?”</p><p> </p><p>From behind the curtain came Rio’s muffled voice.</p><p> </p><p>“You tripped over your own damn feet!”</p><p> </p><p>Sage immediately kicked back toward the beads.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia set down a domino with a sharp click. “Wonderful. At this rate one of you will be dead before dinner. Saves me the trouble of cooking for four.”</p><p> </p><p>“You know, Agatha, I think now’s a great time to mention -at that first game night-” Sage declared, starting to crawl across the floor toward the table. “After Rio and I left, she forced me to play <em>Lips of an Angel</em> by Hinder on repeat for-”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t get any further. Two hands shot out from beneath the curtain, seized Sage by the ankles, and yanked. Sage let out a strangled scream as she was ripped backward, disappearing under the curtain in one violent pull.</p><p> </p><p>All Agatha could do was stare at the empty patch of floor where Sage had been a second ago. Honestly, she wanted to hear the rest of that story, but she didn’t even have much time to catch the thought before the bead curtain snapped open again and Rio stormed through it, chest heaving.</p><p> </p><p>“That never happened,” Rio announced, pitching it to the room as though volume could make it true. But the second her eyes landed on Agatha, everything in Rio’s posture stalled- shoulders locked, breath snagged, the fight that had carried her into the kitchen cut short in an instant.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed, hard, forcing herself not to squirm. Rio had ditched the boxers and sweatshirt she’d left the house in that morning, now in jeans and a gray sweater vest with nothing under it. Agatha’s eyes fell fast, traitorous, to Rio’s boobs and- of course. No bra. Her nipples poked taut against the fabric of the knit, and Agatha’s mouth watered like she had been starved of Rio for years.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t fair. Rio wasn’t fair. Gorgeous, cocky, so blindingly herself it felt like mockery. Agatha had to tear her eyes away because her brain kept handing her the most deranged thought imaginable- herself, crawling across the table on all fours like some feral animal, mouth open.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked to Lilia, who was rubbing her temples, already exhausted by the circus of her daughters. </p><p> </p><p>When her eyes slid back to Rio, Agatha found her still watching her with unnerving focus. She tipped her chin up a fraction, her posture tightening, and her words came out flat with an observation only she would think to make:</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not where you usually sit.”</p><p> </p><p>No, it wasn’t. </p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha had the chance to even open her mouth, the bead curtain clattered violently again. Sage shoved through it with all the grace of a wrecking ball, one shoulder catching Rio’s with a deliberate roughness as she passed. “Try not to bite anyone’s head off about it, Roo. You’re retired from losing your shit over a piece of furniture, remember?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio flushed, her words stumbling out, “I… that’s not… I was just stating an observation.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Bullshit. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio had never once been casual about the chair Agatha was currently sitting in. </p><p> </p><p>It had always been Rio’s. She guarded it so viciously it stopped being a seat at the table and turned into a household rule. Everyone knew it- friends, family, anyone who thought about sitting there learned fast that Rio would raise hell until they moved. She’d go on about balance, about how things had to stay a certain way, and maybe that sounded convincing once, but mostly it was just Rio being… Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Which made Rio’s attempt at brushing it off nothing short of ridiculous. Sage gave a short, mocking laugh without looking up from where she was pawing at the pile of dominoes, and the look Lilia cut her eldest was just as damning. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha… well, she kept her mouth shut. Instead, she stared hard at the scatter of dominoes, elbow braced on the table, fingers tugging at an ear that burned hotter by the second. Because she wouldn’t keep pretending her choice had been random.</p><p> </p><p>The moment she walked back into this kitchen Agatha had bypassed her old chair without a thought and dropped into this one. Rio’s. Because Rio’s had felt safe. Familiar. Like Agatha could still believe there was a place for her here, if only because Rio had once made it so.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snapped back to reality the second Rio dropped into the chair beside her, shoulder brushing her own.</p><p> </p><p>“No!” Rio snapped, smacking Sage’s hand away from the boneyard. “Put ’em back- we’re starting over.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage, of course, slapped her hand right back, and the two of them were bickering again as Lilia sighed and began turning them over from the game she and Agatha had been playing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her own hand of dominoes face down and shoved it into the pile, then leaned back in her chair. She didn’t help with the reshuffle. Didn’t bother pretending to care. Instead, she bit at her thumbnail, her eyes glued to Rio next to her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness had learned how to read people the hard way. It wasn’t instinct, it was survival- catching the tells, the hesitations, the things no one meant her to see. And Rio Vidal? That had taken fucking work. So much work that, now, Agatha could chart every tell without thinking, could map the entire shape of Rio Vidal from the smallest detail. </p><p> </p><p>Except tonight. Tonight, Rio’s attention was anywhere else -on Lilia, on Sage- and for the first time in a long time Agatha felt like she was staring at a book she’d worn the spine out of, only to find the sentences turning gibberish.</p><p> </p><p>They hadn’t exactly ended on a high note this morning. Well- it wasn’t a total disaster, but it wasn’t fine either. It was both, somehow. A fight that ended like a truce, except the mess was still there- shoved into a corner where it still fucking reeked. Now this was the first time they’d faced each other since, and it was at Lilia’s kitchen table with Sage right there too. Too many eyes, no way for Agatha to grab Rio by the face and say: <em>tell me what you’re thinking before I lose my fucking shit.</em></p><p> </p><p>So instead she sat, restless, unsure if Rio was angry, or hurt, or exhausted with her. If she was disappointed. If she was sad. Any of it, all of it- each possibility worse than the last. Because those things didn’t belong on Rio's face, not when they came from Agatha’s mouth. </p><p> </p><p>By all accounts, Agatha should’ve felt lucky- surrounded by her people, even the strange add-on of Sage, the easy noise of a game on a table. But she couldn’t stomach it. Not when Rio sat inches away, untouchable, unreadable, her silence heavier than any argument.</p><p> </p><p>Leaning in, Agatha kept her voice low, just for Rio. “Do you want to switch seats?”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a jab, wasn’t a test. It was as close to an offering as Agatha knew how to make in front of an audience.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands slowed, the dominoes she’d been turning slipping flat against the table. She looked at Agatha then, and for a second the kitchen noise fell away.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio said gently, shaking her head. “Stay.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes dipped to where Agatha’s thumbnail was still near her teeth. For a second, Rio’s hand twitched on the table like she might reach over and stop her, but she didn’t. She gave Agatha a small smile -quick, real enough- before turning back to Lilia and Sage instead, dropped back into their conversation, even laughed like it was easy.</p><p> </p><p>Fine. Whatever. Maybe Rio didn’t get worked up over little things anymore. Agatha could live with that. What she couldn’t live with was being ignored. She wanted Rio’s attention -plain and fucking simple- and she didn’t care if it made her seem childish. Her leg bounced under the table, thumbnail still at her mouth, eyes darting anywhere else so she wouldn’t look like a lunatic burning a hole into Rio’s profile.</p><p> </p><p>It took all of two seconds before Agatha leaned into Rio’s space again, watching as she counted seven dominoes and pulled them in front of Agatha. Only then did Rio start pulling seven for herself.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Lips of an Angel,</em> huh?” Agatha said, voice casual.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head snapped toward her, jaw tight, like she couldn’t decide whether to sputter out a defense or crawl under the table. “It’s a popular song,” she muttered with a shrug, eyes darting back to the table. “Sage, grab a few beers from the garage, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together. “I just think it’s interesting, that’s all.” She gave a lazy shrug, mirroring Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>Sage groaned but shoved her chair back, heading for the garage where they kept the spare fridge. Lilia pushed up from the table a beat later, muttering about chicken in the freezer out there, and followed after her.</p><p> </p><p>The kitchen quieted as their footsteps faded, the clatter of the bead curtain in the doorway the only sound left behind.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally looked over, her brow furrowed a little, but Agatha caught the upward twitch of her mouth. “Intresting?” Rio repeated, her voice pitched higher now, dragging the word out as she stood her dominoes in neat rows in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, it’s just- don’t you think it’s weird? You hadn’t even kissed me yet, and you went with the song every middle-aged single father butchers at karaoke night?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at her, her face fighting bewilderment and amusement, before she pressed her tongue into her cheek.</p><p> </p><p><em>Now, why the fuck was she doing that? </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her jaw clench before Rio even spoke. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that something you’ve thought about a lot?” Rio asked, her head tilting slightly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, her voice flat. “I only just found out you did that today, so no.” She wanted to leave it there, but Rio was still watching her closely, eyes bright, a little too entertained.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted in her chair, turning toward her until her knee bumped against Agatha’s thigh. “That’s not what I meant,” she said. “I mean songs in general. You clearly have opinions about mine, so what would you have picked instead?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wouldn’t pretend otherwise- she had an entire playlist dedicated to her deranged friendship with Rio Vidal. She could give a serious answer, something cool and bulletproof like <em>Silver Springs</em> by Fleetwood Mac. She could dodge the question completely. Literally anything. Instead, her brain served up the one answer guaranteed to get her eaten alive until the end of time.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Far Away.</em> Nickelback.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s jaw dropped, her eyes wide with horror and amusement. “Nickleback?” she demanded, the word itself was an accusation. </p><p> </p><p><em>Valid, </em>Agatha thought<em>. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t waste a second before she broke into a laugh that wouldn’t stop. “You’re gonna give me shit about Hinder and you went with Nickleback. That’s- oh my god- that’s fucking hilarious.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Agatha snapped. “It wasn’t your music taste that offended me- it’s your inability to apply context correctly.” And yet, despite herself, the smile tugging at her mouth betrayed her.  </p><p> </p><p>“Right, right,” Rio said, nodding along. “Because <em>Lips of an Angel </em>was more your vibe, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p><em>Yes. </em></p><p> </p><p>For a second Agatha sat in the silence that followed, simmering with the very subtle urge to throttle Rio.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio only leaned in closer, her voice dropping into a taunt that pressed right against Agatha’s temper. “How’s my context application look now, sweetheart?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to kiss her desperately.</p><p> </p><p>She nodded slowly, eyes narrowing at Rio. “Funny,” Agatha murmured. “Projecting onto me doesn’t make your choice any less stupid.”</p><p> </p><p>“Funny,” Rio echoed, tilting her chin up like a dare, eyes fixed on Agatha’s mouth. Her tongue swept over her own lips, deliberate. “You don’t look too mad about it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to glare, and her voice slipped out soft, almost pleading. “I am.” Pitiful defense, thin as paper, and she hated how unconvincing it sounded even to her own ears.</p><p> </p><p>The slam of the garage door jolted them both, their heads snapping apart too quickly to look casual. Though Rio stayed angled toward Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught the flick of Rio’s eyes toward the bead curtain, She cleared her throat, pivoted fast, like she needed to get the words out before Lilia or Sage came back. “Look, I hope we didn’t ruin your afternoon. Sage said her car was acting up, and wanted a ride over here. And when we pulled in and saw your car, she wouldn’t let me leave. I wasn’t trying to intrude.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha shot back too fast, because she meant it. “Lilia was acting strange earlier too. I even tried to leave because I didn’t want you thinking-” She broke off, the rest of it catching in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded in understanding, biting the inside of her cheek like she always did when she was fighting the urge to say something sweet. </p><p> </p><p>The sight of it left Agatha wanting to tell Rio to say whatever it was she was chewing holes into her mouth to keep down.</p><p> </p><p>The bead curtain clattered, and Agatha’s head whipped around. Lilia slipped back into the kitchen without so much as a glance in their direction, moving straight to the sink. She dropped a frozen chicken into the basin, the thunk of it echoing, and carried on as if Agatha and Rio weren’t even there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head back, and Rio was already watching her. Their eyes caught, close enough to make Agatha lean in further, her voice dropping to a whisper. “Do you think we were set up?”</p><p> </p><p>“No doubt,” Rio murmured, the corner of her mouth twitching. “Lil’s got that creepy intuition thing. Probably staged all of it with a candle and a spell.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a soft huff, shaking her head. “Could be worse setups. At least I don’t mind the company.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a scandalized little gasp, leaning in closer to Agatha with her arms folded on to the table. “Agatha Harkness,” she murmured. “Are you seriously flirting with me at the dinner table?” Her eyes deliberately flicked toward Lilia at the sink, then back to Agatha again, “And in front of my mom? <em>You dog</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her bottom lip and rolled her eyes. “If that’s what you want to call it.”</p><p> </p><p>And because the universe had impeccable timing, Sage’s voice cut through the air, muffled slightly around the black Juul clamped between her teeth: “Oh, she wants that cookie bad.” She strolled up to the table with four beers tucked against her chest, her shit eating grin flashing wide even as the vape bobbed in mouth.</p><p> </p><p>They both jolted again like kids caught passing notes in class, whipping back into their seats as if they hadn’t just been leaning into each other.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shoved her chair back so abruptly the legs scraped against the floor. She leaned across the table, sending half her domino stack face-up as she yanked two beers out of Sage’s arms. And because Rio was Rio, she hissed at Sage like an angry cat while she did it. </p><p> </p><p>Sage only jerked back a little, eyes delighted with the thrill of getting a rise out of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio dropped back into her chair with a huff, clamping the bottle between her teeth and snapping the cap off like it was nothing. The sound made Agatha flinch; she hated when Rio did that, hated anything that put metal near enamel. But she still took the beer when Rio pressed it into her hand, eyes watching -transfixed and faintly horrifed- as Rio pulled the same trick again for her own.</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, Sage unclipped the carabiner from her belt loop, the cluster of keys and other shit jangling as she used the bottle opener clipped on it to crack open Lilia’s beer and then her own. </p><p> </p><p>“Gay carabiners a generational curse in this family?” Agatha muttered against the lip of her beer before taking a sip.</p><p> </p><p>It was a dig, sure- but a useless one, because her chest still did something stupid every time she saw her house key hanging off Rio’s carabiner. Worse was being there when Rio used it, watching her unlock Agatha’s front door like it had always been theirs to walk through.</p><p> </p><p>Once seated, Sage tugged the black vape from between her teeth and waved it lazily at the pair of them. “Don’t stop on my account. I love a good slow burn.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her beer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned forward, eyes narrowing on Sage across the mess. “Oh, I’m sorry- how long did it take you to pull your head out of your ass before you and Yelena started dating, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha winced. </p><p> </p><p>Rio never seemed to remember that if anyone held the record for the longest slow burn in the history of fucking ever, it was the two of them- seventeen years and counting. So it wasn’t surprising when Sage snapped back, fast and sure, like she’d been waiting for the chance:</p><p> </p><p>“A hell of a lot faster than you and your girlfriend.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t hate that. </p><p> </p><p>Rio froze, jaw slack like she couldn’t believe Sage had actually said it- as if she hadn’t set herself up for it.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, you little-” Rio started to surge across the table, but Agatha slammed her beer down and caught her by the back of her sweater vest, yanking her down into the chair before she could launch herself any further.</p><p> </p><p>“For fucks sake- not over the dominoes,” Lilia snapped, striding back to the table like it mattered more than the potential brawl seconds away from happening. She flicked her gaze between them. “Sage, stop being an asshole. And you-” her eyes cut to Rio, “try lunging across my table again and you’ll regret it.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage snorted, clearly pleased with herself. Rio jerked against Agatha’s hold like she might actually try again, so Agatha dug her fingers deeper into the fabric.</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t gonna do anything,” Rio ground out through her teeth. “Just wanted to give Sage a hug. You know, love her up a little bit.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia dropped into her chair and leveled a finger at Rio in warning. Rio threw up both hands like she was finished, smoothing both over her sweater vest as if that settled it.</p><p> </p><p>“Perfect,” Lilia muttered, eyeing the dominoes scattered across the table. “Now we have to reshuffle the whole damn thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio slumped back with a huff, her hands still smoothing over her sweater like she could iron out the urge to lunge again. Agatha’s hand moved without thought, rubbing slow across her back, in a thoughtless attempt to settle her. She wasn’t even sure Rio noticed, but the tension beneath her palm loosened all the same. She kept her hand there until Lilia dragged the scattered dominoes back into a pile, and only then let it slip away. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha drew seven.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The game started well enough and then absolutely went downhill from there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t fucking stand losing and every round only ratcheted her competitiveness higher. Her blood was hot, teeth grinding, fingers hooked into Rio’s thigh under the table before she even realized her hand landed there. </p><p> </p><p>So when a couple of dominoes appeared in her hand, exactly the ones she’d been silently cursing for, she didn’t so much as blink. Rio had slipped them to her smooth as anything, tucked under the palm resting on her thigh, her other arm sprawled across the back of Agatha’s chair like it had always belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>Sage, of course, caught on. She jabbed across the table, swearing Rio was sneaking her pieces. Agatha scoffed, swore she wasn’t, even as she slid one of the incriminating dominoes neatly into place with a little too much satisfaction. </p><p> </p><p>Rio called Sage insane, which only made Agatha’s shoulders shake as she fought not to laugh outright. </p><p> </p><p>Sage nearly launched across the table after her, and Agatha had to bite down on her cheek to stop from encouraging it. Lilia smacked the back of Sage’s head to force her into her seat, and Sage collapsed with a dramatic scoff.</p><p> </p><p>It ended the way it always did: with Lilia winning. Calm, ruthless, unstoppable. She swept her last domino into place while Agatha sat back, fist jammed against her mouth to stop herself from pounding the table in defeat.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to snap at Rio for no real reason other than being a sore loser, but the words caught in throat when she found Rio already looking at her, wearing that smug little smirk that said they’d pulled one over on the world. And a smile broke across Agatha’s face before she could stop it. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t ask right away. She stayed beside her through the lull that followed- while the dominoes were put back into their tin, while Lilia gloated, while Sage sulked and the conversation wandered off into nothing. </p><p> </p><p>It was long enough that Agatha almost forgot she was holding her breath for it. Then Rio leaned closer, still in the chair next to her, “You wanna go upstairs for a little bit?”</p><p> </p><p>The exhale left her before she could stop it. She forced a thin smile and managed, “Sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate- she nodded once, laced their fingers together and hauled her up, already announcing, “We’ll be upstairs.”</p><p> </p><p>When they passed the sink, where Lilia and Sage were talking, Lilia lifted one hand in a lazy wave of permission not even bothering them with a glance.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let herself be dragged out of the kitchen and toward the stairs. When Rio’s foot landed on the second step, the wood let out its familiar creak under her weight. The sound was small, ordinary, yet it struck through Agatha with the force of memory. After nearly two decades that second stair still sang the same tired note, as if no time had passed at all. </p><p> </p><p>Something in her chest tightened, and before Agatha could stop herself she caught herself on the banister and gave Rio’s hand a small tug. </p><p> </p><p>After all the years she’d spent refusing, after rushing past it the moment she stepped inside, she couldn’t move on without facing it. She wanted to look. She needed to.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned back, one foot balanced on the second step, and she seemed to understand. She made no move to drag Agatha forward. She only stood there, holding still, her patience always so complete it felt like her hand pressed to Agatha’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made herself stand still, to let her eyes linger where they wanted to run. The living room was exactly as she remembered, yet changed by the years she had been gone. </p><p> </p><p>Sunlight spilled through the windows, caught in new curtains she didn’t recognize, patterned and bright. A different crocheted throw sagged over the same worn chair. A deck of tarot cards was left half shuffled scattered across the same battered trunk that doubled as a coffee table. Even the stairs behind her sang the same weary sound she remembered.</p><p> </p><p>Picture frames crowded the mantel and along shelves- some new with Sage’s grin, others older, ones Agatha had forgotten until they stared back at her. She spotted herself in more than a few, and in some it was only her and Rio. Her fingers twitched with the usual urge to steal one. She dug her nails into the banister, smothered it, and told herself fine. </p><p> </p><p>Told herself she would definitely be raiding Rio’s apartment at a later date- penance for the nuisance of a conscience that refused to let her loot Lilia’s living room.</p><p> </p><p>And still, even with the thrill of robbing Rio blind, she made a mental note to circle back later. Her moral compass, as it turns out, has always been a little… flexible.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, would you look at that, I need to tie my shoe,” Rio declared, loud enough to jolt Agatha out of her scheming.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head snapped toward her just in time to notice Rio slip her hand free and plop down on the stair. She bent forward, fingers working the motions of someone tying their shoelaces- if not for the fact Rio wasn’t wearing shoes at all. Only socks. Still, she kept at it, tugging tight, cinching down, double knotting air. She was busying her hands, her gaze, her whole restless body- looking anywhere but at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>It was almost insulting in its transparency. And yet there was something in the way Rio bent herself to the task -so earnest in her nonsense- that made Agatha want to kiss her. But she swallowed it down, took the distraction Rio handed her, and ran with it shamelessly. </p><p> </p><p>She moved to the mantel and scanned the pictures until one made her stop. It was the three of them- Lilia in the center, Agatha and Rio flanking her. They couldn’t have been more than twenty-two. Lilia’s smile was easy, Agatha’s a little guarded, and Rio- Rio, for once, wasn’t being ridiculous. No crossed eyes, no middle fingers, no goofy faces. She wasn’t even looking at the camera. She was looking at Agatha, her mouth tilted in that genuine smile that had only ever belonged to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers moved before she gave herself time to argue. She lifted the frame, slid the back open and slipped the photo free. And for a second she just held it, staring too long. </p><p> </p><p>Anyone else might’ve slipped it into a pocket, but she knew herself. Agatha had standards, even when it came to stealing. And she couldn’t stomach the idea of that smile creased. </p><p> </p><p>So she mumbled something vague about needing something from her car, slipped outside, and tossed the photo onto the passenger seat like evidence she couldn’t be caught holding. She shut the door hard, exhaled once, and went back in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha returned to the staircase and found Rio still planted on the second step, sitting there- knees drawn up, chin resting in her hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said, a little short of breath though she tried not to sound it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled at her, that same gap toothed fucking smile that was now trapped in the photograph sitting safe in Agatha’s car. It was almost unbearable, seeing it alive and right in front of her after she had just stolen proof of it on paper.</p><p> </p><p>Again, Agatha felt it like Rio’s hand pressed to her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood, gave her a satisfied nod, and held her hand out like it was the most obvious thing in the world. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took it without thinking, let herself be hauled up step by step, until they reached the top and the familiar door at the end of the hall.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed it open and Agatha lingered in the doorway.</p><p> </p><p>The room smelled faintly of old incense and dust warmed by sunlight. The bed sat in its same spot beneath the window, a black comforter faded by time. The desk was clear but not empty: single neat stack of CDs sat on top of it, a chipped mug that held only pens. Above, the corkboard still carried its weight- ticket stubs lined up like a ledger, Polaroids fixed square and orderly instead of curling at the corners. Even the posters- <em>Rocky Horror</em>, <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>, <em>Sweeney Todd</em>- every gruesome musical Rio had obsessed over until she knew the lines and lyrics  by heart. They were still intact, their edges pressed flat, colors a little dulled but still unpeeled from the wall.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t feel lived in, but it didn’t feel abandoned either. Just… paused.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a faint hum, almost a laugh. <em>Figures</em>, she thought. Rio’s past always had better posture than most people’s present.</p><p> </p><p>“You gonna come in?” Rio’s voice cut through her thoughts again- for what felt like the hundredth time in the last half hour. “Or are you just gonna stand there looking pretty.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked, tilting her head. “You think I’m pretty?” She played it light, feigned innocence she knew Rio wouldn’t buy.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked back, unbothered. “You’re fishing.” She tipped her chin toward Agatha’s feet, still rooted in the doorway. “And stalling. Any time now.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed under her breath. “Don’t tell me what to do.” She slipped inside, shut the door behind her with a quiet click. </p><p> </p><p>When she turned around, Rio hadn’t moved. She was still standing in the center of the room, watching Agatha like there was nothing else she wanted to do. </p><p> </p><p>“Are we still in a fight? Because I’d like to know. The lines feel a little…” She let her gaze flick away, pretending to search for the word, then dragged it back to Rio, taking the chance to look her up and down- yup, nipples still on clear display through that fucking knit she was wearing. “Blurred,” she finished.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sure as fuck didn’t miss the way Rio’s gaze slid down her body before finding her eyes again. “Blurred,” Rio echoed, nodding slightly, as if repeating it counted as an answer.</p><p> </p><p>She let out a hum, casual as she could make it, though Agatha didn’t have the slightest fucking clue where they stood. They could be fine, not fine, still fighting, already over it- fuck if she could tell. And the look Rio had just given her wasn’t helping. It pressed against her until her skin prickled and her body wound itself tight, ready for something her mind kept second guessing, too caught on the possibility that she was misreading the entire situation.</p><p> </p><p>Rather than stand there trying to decipher it, Agatha let her attention shift, eyes catching on the desk pushed up against the wall. She crossed the room toward it. </p><p> </p><p>Her fingers trailed along the edge, catching on dust motes and grooves in the wood before sliding over to the neat column of stacked CDs. She tapped the one on top, some random Swedish rap album she didn’t recognize. It shouldn’t have made sense, but it screamed Rio anyway, and Agatha wasn’t about to fry her brain trying to figure out why. </p><p> </p><p>She could feel Rio’s gaze trailing after her, hot and relentless, like being watched through the scope of a rifle. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally turned and looked up, brown eyes were already waiting for her blues, steady and unblinking.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Agatha said, holding Rio’s gaze like a dare, “any reason you dragged me up to your angsty teenage bedroom?” </p><p> </p><p>She leaned her knuckle into the stack of CDs, nudging until the symmetry broke. The cases leaned, just slightly, but the shift was enough to light something in her chest- petty, reckless satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze flicked to the disruption for a split second before snapping back to Agatha. “No reason,” she shrugged, not bothering to fix the CDs. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brows shot up. “Try again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio started toward her, and Agatha leaned back against the desk. Her hands clamped onto the edge, holding herself there. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed closer until there was barely an inch left between them- Agatha lifted a hand to her shoulder to keep her steady, to keep <em>herself</em> steady.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s attention had dropped to the waistband of Agatha’s jeans, brushing the button with her thumb. A fidget, maybe. Or maybe not. Agatha couldn’t decide.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio’s gaze lifted. For a moment she looked caught off guard, lips parting slightly like she’d forgotten how to school her face.</p><p> </p><p>“We shouldn’t,” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Her finger hooked into the waistband of Agatha’s jeans, the tip resting just behind the button. It was barely contact, almost nothing- and still it tore a soft huff from Agatha’s chest, unbidden. Her hips pushed forward before she could stop herself, chasing more.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha found herself nodding before she’d even decided to. “We shouldn’t,” she echoed. “It sounds-” Whatever she meant to say cut short when Rio’s finger started moving, tracing the inside of her waistband from the button to the edge of her hip and back again. </p><p> </p><p>Rio dipped her chin in a small nod, wordlessly urging Agatha to finish. At the same time she leaned in, close enough that the tilt of her mouth felt like bait, like she was daring Agatha to break first.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, tried again. “It sounds an awful lot like you dragged me up here for a quickie.”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Rio’s head gave a small, deliberate shake, her tone lifting just enough to sound certain. Serious, almost tender- but somehow it landed warm and suggestive all the same, like she couldn’t help herself.</p><p> </p><p>“That didn’t sound convincing. Try again,” Agatha said, nearly breathless. </p><p> </p><p>Somebody had to be the adult, to remind them that sneaking off for a quick fuck in Rio’s childhood home was absolutely not the point of coming up here. </p><p> </p><p>That adult, however, was not Agatha- not with Rio’s fingertip hooked just behind the button of her jeans again in a way that had Agatha wetting her lips before she even realized it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze followed instantly, dropping to her mouth and staying there. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio tried again, it fell out breathy and whined, a contradiction that sounded far too much like she was rethinking it.</p><p> </p><p><em>That was worse. A hundred times fucking worse.</em></p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha muttered, shaking her head. “If that’s the best you’ve got, we’re fucked.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t bite. No grin, no comeback, not even a flicker of amusement. She just stayed there, finger still hooked in Agatha’s waistband, eyes glued to her mouth like she hadn’t heard a damn thing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted as Rio finally, <em>reluctantly</em>, dragged her gaze upward. The shift was slow like she was pulling herself through quicksand. When their eyes met again, Rio’s mouth parted, and the word fell out in a single needy breath.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby.”</p><p> </p><p>One word. Rio could reduce Agatha to putty with two fucking syllables, sounding like that, and it was beyond fucked up the way Agatha’s hips betrayed her again- jerking forward into the hand sitting at her waste band.</p><p> </p><p>“You-” Agatha’s tongue darted out to wet her lips, stalling for ground she didn’t have. Her eyes burning into Rio’s. “You are such an asshole.” </p><p> </p><p>“Am I?” Rio asked, her voice dipped in false sweetness.</p><p> </p><p><em>Well, fuck. </em></p><p> </p><p>Maybe Agatha was going to have to be the adult here -god help them fucking both- because there was no version of reality where they banged one out in Rio’s childhood home with her family downstairs. </p><p> </p><p>It simply could not happen… still didn’t mean Agatha couldn’t toy with Rio a little first.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha peeled her hand from the desk, her grip stiff from holding on so tight, and let it drift down between them. She dragged her palm up the inside of Rio’s thigh,  stroking once, twice, right over the place where Rio’s dick would’ve been if she were wearing it- where it had been the night before, when she’d shown up at Agatha’s house with it strapped on like it was nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha-” Rio gasped, her breath spilling hot against Agatha’s lips. “Agatha,” softer this time, like her mouth couldn’t help it, like her name itself begged to be spoken. Her eyes fluttered shut, her forehead tipping forward until it rested against Agatha’s. “Are you seriously… feeling for my dick right now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved, a low hum slipping out- confirmation, provocation, both. Rio’s hand slipped from where it had lingered at Agatha’s waist and slid beneath her shirt, curving around to the small of her back. </p><p> </p><p>She pulled away from Rio’s forehead, tilting to brush her mouth against Rio’s ear. And the faint scrape of Rio’s nails down her spine made Agatha shiver. </p><p> </p><p>“I want my mouth on it.” Agatha said it as her hand moved, cupping between Rio’s legs hard enough to jolt her upward.</p><p> </p><p>Rio broke with another gasp, a thin moan tangled in it, and her body collapsed forward so suddenly the desk rattled against the wall. She clutched at the desk with one hand, the other gripping into Agatha’s bare back like she couldn’t stand upright on her own.</p><p> </p><p>The collapse of Rio, the give of her- made Agatha’s head tip back, mouth falling open at how completely Rio poured herself against her. One hand still pressed firm between her thighs, the other buried in Rio’s hair, tugging at the nape until Rio’s face tilted just where she wanted it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips brushed the flushed skin of Rio’s cheek as she murmured, “What’s the matter, baby? Can’t fuck my throat without your toy?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio made a strangled sound and wrenched herself out of Agatha’s grip. She staggered back, then spun, throwing herself down on her old bed face first, fists knotted in the blanket.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned against the desk, chest heaving, lips parted on a laugh that never quite came. She tipped her head back, grinning anyway, tasting victory sweet on her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pounded the bed with both fists, yelling into the fabric before she shoved away from the mattress. She stumbled off the bed, tore the blanket back, and crawled beneath it. Then she snapped the blanket over her head, shutting Agatha out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushed off the desk, still breathless, and crossed the room. She sat herself on the edge of the bed, not bothering with the fact that Rio had buried herself beneath the blanket, and pulled open the drawer of the nightstand. </p><p> </p><p>Not her first time snooping here- probably not even her tenth. She knew what lived in there- probably hadn’t changed in years. But Agatha had missed over a decade of snooping through Rio’s old things, and she wasn’t about to waste the chance she had now.</p><p> </p><p>Inside, everything sat just where she expected: a pair of wired headphones wound into a knot, an old pipe scrubbed clean, silver wire rimmed glasses, and two photographs tucked beneath them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart squeezed. One photo showed Rio as a baby, cheeks soft, her parents’ arms holding  her in front of the house they’d barely had time to live in together. The other was only her parents, younger than Agatha liked to think about, smiling like the future wasn’t already written against them.</p><p> </p><p>She knew the story. At nine, Rio had been thrown into the system with almost nothing. Those pictures were the one constant she carried. And she carried them everywhere. Every new house, every new set of strangers. Different kitchens, different rules, different beds she wasn’t meant to get comfortable in.</p><p> </p><p>Seven placements in all, and somehow those pictures survived each one. Rio never risked putting them on display, never left them where they could be taken or torn. They lived pressed between clothes, hidden in drawers, stashed at the bottom of bags, always ready to move when she was told to.</p><p> </p><p>When she landed at Lilia’s, she finally stopped moving. And when she left as an adult, she left the photos here. Told Agatha once that it was safer than anywhere else. </p><p> </p><p>This drawer was the first place Rio allowed herself to believe something precious could actually stay put. The first place she trusted the world not to tear away from her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s first safe place.</p><p> </p><p>And that fucking drawer should’ve been Agatha’s first clue into how Rio loved: careful, controlled, never reckless. Rio didn’t gamble with what mattered. She didn’t take risks she couldn’t recover from. Not with the photos. Not with herself. Not with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Somehow, Agatha missed it. Too much noise in her head, too much fury in her chest, too much certainty in her own genius. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s love had been right there- patient, careful, stubborn. Safe as the photos in that drawer. And Agatha, always moving too fast for her own good, never slowed down enough to notice.</p><p> </p><p>Which was the real fucking irony- Agatha had spent a long time raging that Rio never actually saw her, never understood the quiet ways she tried to say <em>love me back</em>. All the while, she’d been blind to Rio’s. Demanding to be seen while refusing to look.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s thumb brushed over baby Rio’s face- soft, untouched, before the world had made her flinch at every corner. She lingered there for a moment, then reached past it, fingertips catching on the bent wire of the glasses.</p><p> </p><p>She climbed onto the bed without a word, knees sinking into the mattress until her hips bracketed Rio’s. The blanket still covered her head, a pathetic shield, and Agatha tugged it down slow, savoring the reveal. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t resist. She lay there stiff and waiting, arms crossed over her chest, glaring up at her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha only laughed under her breath. She reached down, thumb brushing the deep crease in Rio’s brow, smoothing it flat. “Always so dramatic,” she murmured. Then  she unfolded the wire frames in her hands and slipped the glasses onto Rio’s face. </p><p> </p><p>She grinned at how wrong they looked on Rio, how right it felt to be the one to put them there. </p><p> </p><p>“How long did you even wear those?” Agatha asked, her voice quiet.</p><p> </p><p>“A year. Maybe less. I was eleven.” Rio mumbled, her hands moving to rest over Agatha’s thighs, thumbs brushing across the denim.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “And then what? Your vision just magically fixed itself?”</p><p> </p><p>“I tanked my eye exam on purpose.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at her. “You mean you <em>pretended</em> to need glasses?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a small shrug, thumbs still moving against her. “Yeah. Thought they would make me look cool.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re unbelievable.”</p><p> </p><p>“What? Eleven-year-olds are allowed to have phases.”</p><p> </p><p>“Phases?” Agatha echoed. “You conned a doctor because you thought glasses would make you interesting.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned. “Worked, didn’t it? You can’t stop staring.”</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” Agatha muttered as she slid the glasses off Rio’s face. She folded them with care and placed them back in the drawer where she’d found them. Then she turned her attention back to the woman beneath her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands slipped under the edge of Rio’s sweater vest to tug it higher. She pushed the fabric out of the way until Rio’s chest was bare.</p><p> </p><p><em>Boobs.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha lowered herself carefully, pressing her cheek to Rio’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let her. More than that, after a moment, she wrapped her arms around Agatha, one hand dragging up into her hair, fingers threading through strands and holding her close. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her eyes fall closed and -stupidly, selfishly- thought: <em>there it is</em>. Rio’s heartbeat. The same one Agatha had dragged with her everywhere, even when she swore she was done with it. Still alive in the same place she had left it. </p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Proof she hadn’t lost everything. Proof something of Agatha’s had survived- guarded in the body of the only person stubborn enough to keep it safe.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>The loudest constant in Agatha’s life. </p><p><br/><br/></p><p>She had left, disappeared for years, trashed every chance she got- and somehow, against all odds, it was still there when she came back. Still beating. Still waiting. Still hers.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>And if that drawer had been Rio’s first sanctuary, then Rio herself had been Agatha’s. </p><p><br/><br/></p><p>The first place Agatha could set something precious and trust it would still be there tomorrow.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>“It beats for you, you know.” Rio’s voice carried the shape of a smile, soft enough to be a joke.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Agatha buried her face deeper, nose crushed to bone, eyes squeezed shut until they ached. Because of course Rio would lead with something like that- something so stupid it had no right to matter. </p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Except it did. It always fucking did. Like Rio had been listening in on every selfish thought rushing through Agatha’s head and gave it a voice.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt a hot tear slip from the corner of her eye, slide down the bridge of her nose, and fall against Rio’s chest. “I’m sorry,” Agatha whispered, and it wasn’t nearly enough.</p><p> </p><p><em>I misunderstood you. And I built years on that mistake. Fucked everything up just to prove myself right.</em></p><p> </p><p><em>I misunderstood.</em></p><p> </p><p>“You’re already forgiven.” Rio’s lips pressed into her hair. She didn’t even bother asking what the apology was for. And Agatha knew Rio still meant it. She always meant it. “Are you okay?”</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>A noise broke out of Agatha that wanted to be a laugh but fell short. She shoved her hand up, knuckles grinding against the eye not buried in Rio’s chest. “I just feel like shit,” she admitted. It took effort to keep going, to push the words through the tightness in her throat. “And I’m not trying to ignore what happened this morning. I don’t want you to think that.”</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>“I know,” Rio said, and her hand slid beneath Agatha’s shirt, rubbing slowly up and down her back. “We’ll get through it. Today’s been a lot, for the both of us. And right now, all I want is this- just us. A place to breathe together for a little while, yeah?”</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>And Agatha felt Rio’s words like a crack of light through the weight of the day. The fight that morning, the gauntlet of Lilia’s house, tearing herself open piece by piece until there was nothing left to hide. She was still on her feet, fragile as glass, almost waiting to break… And she hadn’t even made it to dinner yet.</p><p> </p><p>But here was Rio, holding her, asking for nothing more than this moment. No apologies demanded, no fixes chased, no pretense that the day hadn’t chewed them up and spit them out. She was offering a pause. A place to breathe together. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll try again tomorrow,” Agatha promised.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll be there when you do. Always.”</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After the day Agatha had, she figured she’d drag herself through dinner half dead, smile where she had to, and leave feeling like she had been hit by a fucking bus carrying nearly twenty years of emotional baggage. Old photos came out, stories told across the table, Sage and Rio tore into each other like always, and somehow, somewhere in the middle of all that, Agatha forgot she was supposed to be tired. And Rio, ever the opportunist, had at some point thrown her keys at Sage with a “figure it out tomorrow.”</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Rio slid into the driver’s seat of Agatha’s car and turned the key, the engine starting as the dash lights blinked on. Rio called it damage control- Agatha’s driving, according to her, being an <em>“ongoing threat to public safety.”</em> Agatha let it slide. If Rio wanted to chauffeur her around for the rest of her life, she wasn’t about to complain. </p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Being a passenger princess wasn’t exactly a hardship, not with the way Rio backed out of the driveway with one hand on the wheel and the other stretched behind Agatha’s seat. It shouldn’t have been that distracting, but apparently she’d hit the stage of life where a woman who could drive her home without incident was the sexiest thing alive.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Agatha had been staring at the side of Rio’s face for so long she was surprised she hadn’t burned a hole clean through her skull. It wasn’t subtle -she knew that much- but brain kept offering up unhelpful ideas, like leaning over and dragging her tongue up the side of Rio’s face.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Rio must’ve felt it, because she shot her a quick side-eye, a small smile tugging at her mouth before she looked back at the road. </p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Agatha didn’t even pretend to look away. She watched Rio tuck her hair behind her ear, that quiet laugh slipping out like she’d been caught off guard. “Mind if we stop for cigarettes? I’m out,” Rio asked, voice easy as she shifted in her seat, another glance at Agatha before she fixed her eyes on the road again.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p><em>Made sense</em>, Agatha thought. Rio had been tapping the wheel with her thumb since they left.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Rio kept talking. “Last one was early this afternoon. I’ve gone through half a pack of gum and even bummed a few hits off of Sage’s juul, which was humiliating. Coughed like a rookie every single time.”</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Agatha kept her eyes fixed on her, lips twitching. “You’ve smoked for twenty years and you can’t handle a vape?”</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>“Apparently not,” Rio said, as she reached across the console, slipped her hand into Agatha’s, and gave it a squeeze that sent Agatha’s heart into a somersault.</p><p> </p><p>“Pussy,” Agatha said, grinning. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shot her a look. “My lungs have standards. Next time I’ll hand it to you, and we’ll see how long that mouth of yours keeps running once you’re choking on a lung.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t bother hiding her smirk. Agatha didn’t bother hiding the way her thighs pressed together.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, turning her head toward the passenger window as her nails dug into the spaces between Rio’s fingers. “Please,” she muttered. “If I’m choking on anything, it sure as fuck won’t be from hitting a vape.”</p><p> </p><p>“What was that?” Rio’s head snapped toward her, quick, before cutting her eyes back to the road. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned back slowly, catching the way Rio’s grip on the wheel had gone white knuckled. She gave the tightest smile like she hadn’t just said it. “Nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>She waited, expected Rio leaning in, voice dropping soft, sweet-talking her into repeating it. Maybe a tease, maybe a demand- anything that proved Agatha had gotten under her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look over again. She kept her eyes pinned to the road, jaw set, and gave a few small nods.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. “That’s it?” she snapped, eyes wild.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer her. She slid her hand out of Agatha’s grip and put both on the wheel, turning the car into the gas station like she hadn’t heard a word. She pulled into a spot, shifted the gear into park, unbuckled. Agatha watched her the whole time, seething, nails digging into her own palms now, waiting for anything that looked like a crack.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally looked over, her lips were pulled into her mouth. She raised her brows, perfectly unaffected. “You ready?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a disbelieving huff, her mouth stayed open on the tail of it. “I am not going in with you,” she said, the corners of her mouth twitching upward. But she wasn’t fucking amused. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio said lightly. “Do you want anything?”</p><p> </p><p>For a second Agatha could only stare. “I’m good,” she responded flatly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, leaned over, and pressed a quick kiss to her cheek before slipping out of the car. The door shut, and Rio was already walking toward the entrance before her fury surged, burning away any pretense of composure. “Oh, fuck no,” Agatha muttered, scrambling to unbuckle her seat belt. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was out of the car before she could think better of it, telling herself she wanted cigarettes. And if it looked like Agatha was chasing Rio for attention she couldn’t last thirty seconds without- well, she wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>She yanked the door open, and the bell above it clattered against the frame. Fluorescents were humming overhead, too bright, too harsh. The place reeked of burnt coffee that had probably been sitting on the burner since sunrise.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t at the counter like she should’ve been. She was loitering in the candy aisle, eyes fixed on the shelf like she was weighing life or death choices between sour candy options. She didn’t bother looking up, but that small, satisfied smile made it clear she knew Agatha would come storming in after her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, cut straight for the register. “American Spirits Blue,” she demanded.</p><p> </p><p>The woman behind the counter startled at her volume. Then she smiled, undeterred, as though Agatha’s loudness was more amusing than threatening. She turned toward the back wall where the rows of cigarette cartons were, scanning each one before pointing- not at the Blues, but at the Yellows. She angled her body just enough for Agatha to see her finger tap against the wrong pack, a glint of in her eyes that made it obvious she was screwing with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Cute. But I don’t smoke cigarettes that come in piss colored cardboard,” Agatha said with zero amusement in her voice. </p><p> </p><p>The woman chuckled like she’d been waiting for that, plucked the Blue carton, and carried them back to the counter. Her eyes lingered this time, shameless in the way they tracked Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re lucky you’re hot,” the woman said, scanning the pack. “Normally I don’t take well to strangers barking orders at me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched, eyes flashing as her irritation spiked. But right on its heels came the rush- the spark that always lit whenever she caught the scent of trouble. It wasn’t just close; it was reaching for her. And Agatha, incapable of resisting, grinned like she’d already taken its hand.</p><p> </p><p>The cashier leaned lazily on the counter, sliding the pack toward her. “That gonna be all?” she asked, smiling at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She felt it first- Rio’s eyes drilling into the back of her neck from the candy aisle. Heat curled up her spine, and she caught herself biting her lip at the excitement bubbling low in her gut. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said sweetly. “Do me a favor and repeat what you just said. A little louder, so it carries.”</p><p> </p><p>The cashier blinked. “That gonna-”</p><p> </p><p>“Not that!” Agatha snapped. She reeled herself back in with a long inhale, pasting on a smile that was sugar sweet and nothing close to real. “The other thing,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Understanding dawned slow but sure. The woman leaned forward, lowering her voice as though they were sharing a secret. “You’re lucky you’re-”</p><p> </p><p>“Louder.”</p><p> </p><p>The cashier’s brows arched. She straightened, took her time, and when she spoke again her voice was clear and bright, “You’re hot. Like really, <em>really </em>hot.” Her eyes dropped to Agatha’s mouth as she lowered her voice. “I get off in an hour if you-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio slammed a pack of candy onto the counter hard enough to shake it. It jolted both the cashier and Agatha, but Agatha’s smile didn’t so much as falter. If anything, it grew wider as she let her shoulder sink lazily into Rio pressed up against her side. </p><p> </p><p>Rio slid her hand off the candy, nodded once. “Sup. I’m Rio.” She sounded bored  as she went to pluck a cheap pocketknife from the spinning display and dropped it on the counter. “I collect knives. <em>Big </em>hobby of mine.”</p><p> </p><p>The cashier blinked, clearly thrown, and drawled out a confused, “Okay.” Her eyes flicked toward Agatha, looking for an ally she wasn’t going to find.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s not interested,” Rio added, almost playful. She nudged the pocketknife closer with her fingertip. “So if you value your eyeballs, you’ll back the fuck off.”</p><p><br/>Agatha felt a heat rush through her chest, a dangerous, exhilarating crackle that had her toes curling inside her shoes.</p><p> </p><p>The checkout was over in seconds. Rio paid, snatched the cigarettes, and was already out the door before the tap to pay finished processing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed just to grab the rest. “She’s joking… mostly. And honestly? You’ve been a delight. Seriously- thank you so much-”</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever, lady. Just get out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shoved through the door. Rio’s car sat at the far end of the lot. She cut across the pavement fast, hurled the candy and pocketknife into the passenger seat, and slammed the door closed.</p><p> </p><p>As she rounded the hood, her eyes found Rio. She was a few paces off from the driver’s side, standing in the glow of the overhead lights with a cigarette burning between her fingers. She didn’t move toward the car, didn’t even glance at it- her eyes were on Agatha the whole time. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced herself the rest of the way to the driver’s side and leaned back against the door. She only watched Rio watch her, pulse knocking hard against her ribcage as Rio lifted her cigarette, drew from it, and exhaled slow enough that Agatha thought she felt it in her own chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally moved. She closed the space without hurry, the cigarette in one hand at her side, and lifted her free hand toward Agatha’s face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth fell open before she even thought about it. She snapped it closed, lifted her chin, tried to reclaim control, but the flick of her head only made Rio’s touch graze across her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned, unbothered, and came at her again, thumb dragging along her jaw. <em>“</em>You liked that, didn’t you?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach swooped. She tried for a shrug, tried for anything casual, but her eyes had already dipped to Rio’s mouth. “Maybe a little,” she admitted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hum was soft, pleased, as she brought the cigarette to her lips. Three drags. Her cheeks hollowed a little with each pull. </p><p> </p><p>A throb deep in Agatha’s core answered every hollow of Rio’s cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>Rio flicked the cigarette to the ground, the ember hissing against the pavement. She stepped in closer, and caught her jaw in her hand again. Her thumb swept across Agatha’s bottom lip, coaxing her to open again. </p><p> </p><p>Her mouth gave before her pride did, slackening just enough, and Rio caught it. She pressed her thumb against Agatha’s bottom lip and tugged until her teeth showed. And of course Agatha let her. She went with it, willing, because resistance always felt pointless with Rio this close.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio leaned in, Agatha swore it was happening. Her chest tightened, her breath tripped, and every nerve screamed for Rio to just <em>kiss me already.</em> Agatha wanted her to, desperately -pathetically- so badly it left her nearly panting. </p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t give her what she was begging for. She stopped just short, her mouth grazing against Agatha’s, a ghost of contact that wasn’t nearly fucking enough. Smoke filled Agatha’s mouth until all she could taste was American Spirits. </p><p> </p><p>Which was a shit trade-off, but Agatha took it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to glance down at her lips, thumb pressing firmer against the soft inside of her bottom lip. Her eyes were lidded, while she breathed out casually, “Funny.” Her gaze flicked back up, lips twitching with a smirk that made Agatha’s stomach drop. “Last night you weren’t nearly this difficult when it was my cock brushing against your lips.”</p><p> </p><p>Don’t mind Agatha, really. Because she was currently trying to reattach her jaw to her fucking face.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Rio,” Agatha drew out, all venom and velvet. Rio’s thumb slid from her lip to her jaw, her hand framing firm around chin, holding her in place. Agatha pushed into her grip. “You should’ve mentioned you were into spanking. Because you’re clearly” -hissing her next words through her teeth- “begging to get your ass fucking whooped.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jerked her head toward her with every word, but Rio only moved her own head back, grinning wide, holding Agatha close enough to taste her breath and just far enough to deny her mouth. She was taunting Agatha- dangling herself there like bait, like Agatha was the one straining for it when she swore to god she wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was panting now, her grin wicked. “Baby, it’s hard to take your threats seriously when you keep chasing my mouth.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wrenched her jaw free from Rio’s grip. “Car. Now,” Agatha all but barked. But instead of listening, Rio’s arms slipped around her waist, tugging her closer until they were flush. Agatha’s hand found its way to Rio’s cheek, thumb brushing against her skin before she could think better of it.</p><p> </p><p>Just as Agatha leaned in, ready to take what was hers, Rio eased back- only a fraction, but enough. Agatha didn’t need more than that to know whatever was coming next would piss her off.</p><p> </p><p>“Let your heart guide you, Agatha. It whispers, so listen closely.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eye twitched. Her heart wasn’t whispering- it was winding itself up for a scream, furious and mortified. The only thing keeping it caged was the sheer effort of not throttling Rio right where she stood. </p><p> </p><p>Her hand snapped off Rio’s cheek and pointed it at her face, finger like a dagger aimed straight at that insufferable grin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth opened, snapping at the finger with a guttural little growl.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you ever-” Agatha gritted through her teeth with outrage, “fucking quote <em>The Land Before Time</em> at me again.” She yanked her hand back fast enough that Rio’s teeth clicked on nothing but air.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s laugh cracked out, sharp and delighted, head tipping back like Agatha had just handed her the best gift she’d ever been given. “Fuck, you’re perfect,” she managed between breaths, still grinning. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunted, fisting the front of Rio’s grey sweater vest and yanking her in. Rio went easy, like she’d been waiting for it, mouth parting against hers without a fight. She even whimpered -pathetic and perfect- and Agatha devoured it, taking until she decided she was done.</p><p> </p><p>She broke the kiss, ripped the driver’s side door open, and barked, “In!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was flushed and breathless, lips wet and swollen, still fucking grinning. But she got into the car without argument.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slammed the door behind her and bent to snatch up the cigarette Rio had dropped. By the time she straightened, Rio was already shouting through the window she needed to put it in the butt bin. </p><p> </p><p>She muttered under her breath, jammed the butt into the slot with more force than necessary, and stalked around the hood. If Rio was so intent on quoting lessons about listening, then she better fucking listen when Agatha told her to get on her knees.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>So. Change of plans.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been so sure of herself when they shoved through the front door. She thought she’d have Rio melting in her hands within minutes- her Rio, whimpering and desperate, the lovely mess she always turned into under Agatha’s touch. That was the plan, and Agatha had been hungry to cash it the fuck in.</p><p> </p><p>Except her knees hit the rug first.</p><p> </p><p>Fifteen minutes later, she was still there- raw and throbbing, the carpet burning her knees. Her jaw ached, her throat was shot, and the worst part was knowing she’d done it willingly. No one had forced her. She’d taken Rio’s cock like it was communion, fifteen minutes of worship she hadn’t planned on giving, until she absolutely had. </p><p> </p><p>And now? Now she was folded over the end of her own bed, forearms braced against the mattress, panting because apparently, her body had decided that was compulsory wherever Rio's presence was concerned.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was standing behind her. Calm. One hand settled on her hip, the other trailing lazy down her spine like she had all the time in the world. And to make matters even worse, her fucking strap on was nudging insistently into Agatha’s thigh every time she moved, like even the silicone was in on the joke of how far Agatha Harkness had fallen.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha ground out between her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio answered with a hum, sweetly distracted, her hands sliding to the swell of Agatha’s ass. The press of silicone against her thigh vanished as Rio stepped back, spreading her cheeks open with her thumbs. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even need to fucking look to know what was happening- she <em>felt</em> it… And of course it wasn’t a surprise. Rio was obsessed with looking at her asshole like it was a goddamn work of art.</p><p> </p><p>It had become a running bit- like the pinnacle of Rio’s existence was simply <em>looking </em>at it. And there was a part of Agatha, even now, that almost smiled at the thought. Endearing, in its own insane way. Endearing, because it was so entirely Rio.</p><p> </p><p>But right now? Agatha was too far gone to find it cute. Her clit was throbbing, her thighs slick with the mess she couldn’t stop making, every nerve lit up with the ache of how badly she needed Rio inside her. It bordered on humiliation, how much she wanted it, but Agatha had no pride left to guard. Not here. Not with her.</p><p> </p><p>“Quit staring at my asshole,” Agatha snapped over her shoulder. “I want your dick inside me. Now.”</p><p> </p><p>“Anal?” Rio asked, dumb as a brick, like she’d misplaced her brain between Agatha’s ass cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went rigid. “Rio, honey.” she drawled, as though she were about to give a lecture to a very, <em>very</em> pretty brick. “Let me make this crystal <em>fucking </em>clear, if you so much as waggle that thing near my asshole tonight… I will be going to prison for homicide.”</p><p> </p><p>“No waggles. Promise. I’ll keep both hands on the steering wheel and my mouth where you want it,” Rio said, hands sliding to Agatha’s hips for a firm squeeze. “But don’t think I didn’t catch the way you said <em>tonight</em>.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Double homicide</em>, Agatha thought. </p><p> </p><p>Good to know Rio’s comprehension skills returned the second she was done drooling over a hole.</p><p> </p><p>“If you’re done admiring the view, I’d love it if you’d actually put your dick to use.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio slid one hand from Agatha’s waist, slipping lower until her fingers found the heat between her thighs. She dragged them slowly through her slick.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpered -ugly, needy- and shoved her hips back chasing a cock that still hadn’t come anywhere near her cunt. But Rio only circled her entrance, two fingers brushing lazily around it like a prayer she refused to rush. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha whined.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could even revel in the slow torment of Rio’s fingers, they slipped away- replaced by the teasing press of silicone against her cunt. The swap was so sudden Agatha sputtered, jaw tightening around words she couldn’t get out.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio-” Agatha started, but it dissolved into a strangled moan when the tip pushed inside, only to stop. That was it. A taste, a ghost, nothing more. Agatha’s hips snapped back for more, but Rio’s hands locked her in place.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head dropped to the mattress with a guttural sound, fists bunching tight in the sheets.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio pulled away entirely. The tip slid out, leaving her empty, wet, wanting. Agatha whined again before she could stop herself, her face smashing harder into the bedding trying to smother a tantrum swelling in her chest. </p><p> </p><p>The weight of the mattress shifted. A dip in front of her. Shuffling. Agatha’s head snapped up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat back against the headboard like she had been born to rule, all flushed skin and slow breath. Her brown eyes were dark and blown wide, locked on Agatha. She licked her lips, lazily.</p><p> </p><p>It hit Agatha then: Rio didn’t just look like a woman waiting. She looked like judgment itself. Like Death, still and certain, watching the next soul crawl closer. Or some dark sovereign, unshaken in her throne, already sure of her victory.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t look anywhere else. Her gaze tracked every inch of Rio’s body in greedy pieces: the bruises scattering her chest, fading yellows and fresh purples mixed together. And then -obviously- Rio’s tits. Because of course. Because Agatha was obsessed, and even now, with leather and silicone gleaming between Rio’s thighs, her brain short circuited on boobs. Perfect, unfair, hypnotic boobs.</p><p> </p><p>It took everything to drag her eyes lower. Black leather wrapped beautifully around her. The purple cock rose proud between her thighs, thicker than what she remembered from the night before, its tip catching the light with the shine of Agatha’s own want.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been the one to put it on Rio. She’d tightened the straps, buckled them across Rio’s hips, adjusted until it fit. And it fucked her up- how much she loved seeing Rio wear what should have been on her to begin with. It felt like she’d just crowned her own executioner.</p><p> </p><p>Rio must’ve taken pleasure in how shamelessly Agatha stared, because she eased back against the headboard and spread her thighs wider. The move was intentional, and left Agatha with a perfect, unobstructed view of her cunt- swollen, dripping. Agatha wanted to crawl across the bed and bury her face there until Rio forgot her own name.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio’s hand moved. Fingers slipped between her thighs like she wasn’t already driving Agatha insane. Agatha’s head jerked up, eyes colliding with Rio’s. They were heavy lidded, chin tilted just enough to drip with arrogance. That look wasn’t a question- it was a dare.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew better. Rio wasn’t going to stop. This was deliberate, every calculated fucking second of it, some slow-burn scheme to strip her down to nothing. And God, it was working, because Agatha’s nails were already gripping  the sheets, white knuckled to keep from lunging forward.</p><p> </p><p>It was rage, possessive and wild, because Rio had the audacity to put her fingers where they didn’t fucking belong. Her cunt belonged to Agatha -always had- and watching Rio’s fingers slide through it lit something fucking feral in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>She kept her eyes pinned to Rio’s face, refusing to look away even as Rio touched herself, a shaky breath slipping past her lips. A smirk curved at her mouth -fuck, that forsaken fucking mouth- and it made Agatha’s body burn hotter than the sight of her hand moving.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck are you doing?” Agatha whispered, each word laced with fury. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brows lifted, her shoulder giving the laziest shrug imaginable. Agatha followed the movement of her hand, saw the way her fingers dipped into her own slick and came back glistening. </p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could even process it, Rio was sliding that wetness down over the shaft strapped to her hips, purple gleaming in the lamplight. She dragged her hand along its length in one slow stroke, coating it from tip to base.</p><p> </p><p>A whimper caught in Agatha’s throat. </p><p> </p><p>Rio did it again -touched herself, painted the cock with it- and then again, and again, slower this time, like she could make Agatha choke just by proving she didn’t have to rush.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed frozen the entire time, staring, undone by the cruelty of Rio touching herself just to wet the cock Agatha was starving for.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth curved as her fingers circled lazily over her own clit. “I don’t get you like this often,” she murmured.</p><p> </p><p>“Like what?” Agatha asked- no better than a very pretty brick herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Quiet. Perfectly still.” Rio said it like she was ticking boxes, then as if she was addressing an elephant in the room: “You’re waiting for me to tell you what to do, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to argue -she always argued- but her tongue felt heavy, nailed down. Because Rio wasn’t wrong. She was waiting. She’d been waiting. And the most disgusting part? She felt like thanking Rio for noticing.</p><p> </p><p>Her lips parted, dry. “Fuck you,” Agatha managed, but her voice betrayed her- thin, unsteady, nothing like she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio had the audacity to look at her with something like pity. “Sweetheart,” she said softly, like the fight Agatha was clinging to was useless against her. “Come here, please.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even pretend to hesitate. Her heartbeat was pounding while her clit was beating in time with it, her cunt was literally dripping in a way she couldn’t ignore, her chest and neck were flushed hot, betraying her worse than words ever could. She moved- crawled across the bed until she was kneeling between Rio’s legs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached for her face. She didn’t need to ask. The swipe of her thumb across Agatha’s bottom lip was question enough. Agatha opened, greedy, and took the fingers still wet from Rio’s cunt into her mouth. She moaned at the taste, closed her hand around Rio’s wrist, and drove them deeper- down to the knuckle, back to the tips, then down again, gagging herself until it was the only sound she could hear. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s other hand slipped into her hair, brushing it back with care even as she kept Agatha’s mouth on her fingers. She watched Agatha the whole time, panting, eyes wide with utter devotion- as though every second of Agatha’s surrender was holy. Which seemed to be the theme tonight. Rio a holy priest; Agatha taking communion like the good Catholic girl she’d never been.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha almost laughed, because even gagging on Rio’s fingers, stripped down to complete obedience, the truth never changed: Rio Vidal was hopelessly, irreversibly hers, always.</p><p> </p><p>Rio slipped her fingers free and tugged Agatha in, catching her mouth. The kiss was maddeningly brief, gone before Agatha could taste it, and she huffed- her usual complaint when it came to Rio, <em>enough</em> never really existed.</p><p> </p><p>“Sit on it,” Rio murmured against her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s moan tore free so fast it startled her, rough and desperate, louder than anything else she’d given up that night.</p><p> </p><p>They moved together- Agatha shifting forward, Rio straightening to meet her. Rio’s hands found her waist, grounding her, while Agatha slid one hand to Rio’s shoulder, steadying herself. With the other, she guided the shaft into place, the head nudging at her entrance. She flicked her gaze up and caught Rio staring- locked on the sight of it, pupils blown wide.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up at her. “Go slow for me,” she breathed, thumb dragging across the bone of her hip. Her attention flicked back down to the cock between Agatha’s thighs. She sank back into the pillows. “I want to see you take every inch.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck yes,” Agatha rasped. “Whatever you want.” She eased down on the tip and gasped, nails biting into Rio’s shoulder. Her eyes never left Rio’s face- the slack jaw, the hitch of her breath, the way her chin dipped in a shaky nod urging Agatha on. It pulled a whimper out of Agatha as she pushed down further, thighs trembling.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grip tightened at her hips. “Look at you,” she breathed. “Taking it like you were made for me.” Still staring, like she couldn’t tear her eyes away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. She sank deeper, smooth and slow, biting against the rush in her blood that begged her to fall fast, to prove she was made for Rio outright. Her breath came in harsh, measured pulls through her nose, every inch a silent declaration she refused to voice. When she reached the base, seated fully, her nails had carved crescents into Rio’s skin. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifted to grind down, but Rio’s hands locked her in place, the strap buried deep and unmoving inside her. “Stay,” she whispered, breath ragged. “Please. Just… stay on me like this.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Fantastic</em>. Sit there, stuffed to the brim like a goddamn fleshlight while Rio made puppy dog eyes about intimacy. At this rate, Agatha was certain she’d end up squirting before either of them moved.</p><p> </p><p>“Is that okay?” Rio asked, probably reacting to the silence Agatha hadn’t even realized she was giving.</p><p> </p><p>And fuck- her mouth was dry. She felt so goddamn full her brain was nearly mush. She licked her lips, nodded desperately. “Want to stay here.” Her hand found Rio’s cheek, clumsy and pleading.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Rio asked, eyes wide.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck yes,” Agatha exhaled.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s good.” Rio nodded, brown eyes now scanning every inch of Agatha’s body. “You’re being so good for me, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>“Holy fucking shit.” Agatha forced herself to stay still, thighs quivering, eyes locked stubbornly on Rio’s face- <em>only</em> her face. Not her boobs. Not yet. She was trying to last longer than five fucking minutes, and Rio’s boobs would not help.</p><p> </p><p>Rio slid her hand from Agatha’s waist to her stomach, pressing her palm flat like she needed proof of how deep she was. She pushed in with the heel of her hand digging until it met the shape of her inside Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“How are you feeling?” Rio asked, voice dazed and sweet. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked, breathless. “Like if I open my mouth too wide, your dick’s gonna wave at you from the back of my throat.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth curved, shaky. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. You want to grab a flashlight and see for yourself?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brows arched. “Don’t tempt me.” Her palm pressed harder.</p><p> </p><p>The air left Agatha in one shuddering exhale, every ounce of her bravado dissolving under the press of Rio’s hand. </p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in, and for a fleeting second the change in angle let Agatha breathe- right until her mouth closed over Agatha’s nipple. Her head fell back, eyes rolling, moaning. Her hips bucked against the hand locking her in place. She forced herself still, fingers abandoning Rio’s cheek to curl tight at the back of her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio-” Agatha. “Rio,” again, just to taste it, just to remind herself she could. Her fingers fisted tight in Rio’s hair, tugging until Rio moaned around her nipple. The sound vibrated through her chest, “Rio,” Agatha whined, helpless.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed to get it out, needed to spit something honest before it drowned her. She tipped her head forward to see Rio’s mouth clamped tight on her nipple, sucking hard enough to make her thighs shake.</p><p> </p><p>“I-” Agatha stammered, breath catching. “When I was with her-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s teeth sank in hard, cutting her off, and the sound that ripped out of Agatha was a yelp. Of course Rio would bite her for that- for daring to address that there had been anyone else at all. And God, Agatha loved it, loved the sting, loved being bitten for it. She arched into Rio’s mouth, chest chasing the pain because it felt like ownership.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers curled tighter in Rio’s hair, tugging rough to drag Rio’s gaze up while keeping her mouth right where it was. When Rio finally looked at her, eyes gone nearly black, her bottom lip was pulled down against Agatha’s chest, nipple swollen and trapped between her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“I would always come harder when I thought about you,” Agatha breathed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze, then let Agatha’s nipple fall from her teeth. She didn’t pull away- she lingered, tongue dragging, lapping again and again until Agatha could feel each pass like a wire running straight down her spine. Every pass of Rio’s tongue was a reward she hadn’t even realized she was desperate for until her body was bowed into it. </p><p> </p><p>Her gaze never broke from Agatha’s face, and it made her jaw fall slack, her cunt clenching around Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“I just meant-” Agatha squeaked, the sound humiliating in its pitch, nothing like her. She swallowed hard, shaking her head, scrambling for any words at all. “I’ve always been yours. Even then.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze again like the words had knocked the air out of her. Her mouth slipped from Agatha’s breast, and she grabbed the back of Agatha’s head, forcing her down until their foreheads touched.</p><p> </p><p>“Always mine,” Rio whispered, cracked and disbelieving, like she had to say them out loud just to test if they were real. Her lips pressed soft to Agatha’s mouth before she whispered against it, “Again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Always yours,” Agatha whispered back. “Never anyone else’s.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes squeezed shut, her whole body trembling under Agatha, and she let out a sound caught between a whine and a sob. She collapsed back against the headboard, face twisted, chest heaving like the confession alone was enough to make her come. “You’re killing me,” she panted, reaching for Agatha’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t think- she was on the edge of coming, the burn in her stomach searing all the way to her toes. She stayed frozen, good, eyes heavy just from looking down at Rio, beautiful and wrecked beneath her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio guided Agatha’s hands higher, pressing them over the swell of her breasts, and the second her nipples brushed Agatha’s palms Rio shuddered like she was breaking apart. Her head fell back against the headboard, throat working as she dragged in a breath.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, fuck-” Rio panted again, eyes snapping to Agatha’s. “Would you let me? If I could- would you let me come inside you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio already knew damn well what the answer to that was- she’d wrung it out of Agatha the night before, left her gasping on it. But Rio had always been greedy with repetition, always needed to hear it again, to touch it again, like once was never enough, like it only counted if Agatha broke on it twice.</p><p> </p><p>And it worked. The second the question left Rio’s mouth, the words came tumbling out of Agatha, frantic and begging. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha gasped, the word snapping out of her on a sob. “Fuck- yes, I want it. I want you to come inside me. Will you- please, Rio, will you-”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve never wanted anything more in my fucking life.” Rio’s grip locked bruising tight at Agatha’s waist as her hips snapped up, finally driving into her with the force Agatha had been starving her for.</p><p> </p><p>It knocked the air out of Agatha’s lungs. Her whole body folded, collapsing against Rio, forehead pressed to her temple, mouth hanging open around a sound that never made it out.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha sensed it in an instant, like her own body knew before her brain did: Rio was coming. She was trembling underneath her, one arm around Agatha’s shoulders, the other clawing at her back like she needed Agatha just as much.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s orgasm ripped through her, harder than she could brace for. She broke with another sob, her cunt pulsing so hard it felt like it would wring Rio dry. Heat spilled through her stomach, her thighs quivered, every nerve lit up like fire running through her veins. Her body gave everything up at once -her pulse, her voice, her pride- surrendered it all in a rush. Stars burst across her vision, her whole body convulsing, soaking Rio’s stomach, thighs, the sheets, in her release.</p><p> </p><p>“You- oh, my God, you just-” Rio choked. “Agatha- fuck, you’re so hot. You’re so fucking hot.” Rio wouldn’t stop saying it, wouldn’t stop dragging her mouth across Agatha’s jaw like she had to taste every second of it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s body trembled with aftershocks, every twitch pulling another ragged praise from Rio’s lips. She let it happen, too wrung out to argue, forehead pressed against Rio’s temple, mouth parted on the ghost of a laugh. Every muscle felt drained, hollowed out, but in a way that was relief.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in, brushing her nose against Agatha’s until she tilted her chin up, and the kiss that followed was slow and consuming. It was sloppy, unhurried, and so soft that Agatha sighed helplessly into her mouth. When it finally broke, she pressed her face into Rio’s neck, breathing her in until she found words again.</p><p> </p><p>“The idea of fighting with a fitted sheet feels like fucking hell,” Agatha murmured. “And I’d actually rather die here than deal with it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand swept over her back. “I’ll take care of it. You think you can move yet?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, her mouth dragging against the warm skin of Rio’s neck. The strap still stretched her, seated deep enough that she gave a broken little hum. “No,” she admitted. “I want to stay like this a little longer.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s arms tightened, she buried her mouth in Agatha’s hair and said, “Good. I don’t want you going anywhere.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio had changed the sheets like she promised before pulling Agatha back under them. They fucked again, then twice more, until exhaustion made the decision for them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha woke first- rare, and never something she was stupid enough to waste. She always spent it the same way, eyes on Rio, letting herself stare long past the point of reason. She told herself it was harmless, staying still, stretching the seconds as far as they would go greedy for the moment her eyes opened. She never pretended it wasn’t for selfish reasons; Agatha wanted to be the first witness, the one who caught her before the rest of the world could.</p><p> </p><p>More times than she’d admit, Agatha would even slip out of bed to tug the curtains back and tilt the blinds until the light landed exactly where she wanted it. She knew what it would do- Rio’s eyes would open amber, pushing toward gold, like the sun itself had decided to rise in them first. And it was always -<em>always-</em> worth the effort.</p><p> </p><p>Everything about Rio waking up belonged to Agatha: the puffiness in her eyes, the softened cheeks, the unruly hair, the way she radiated heat like a furnace made for one. Even the smell of her skin- it was irrational how addictive she found it, and Agatha treated it like she was snorting cocaine. </p><p> </p><p>And when Rio finally stirred, rubbing a hand across her face with that little huff, she always managed to wake up sweet in a way Agatha never could. Sometimes it was enough to make Agatha want to look away, because by then her heart surged too high in her throat, too fast- like it meant to rat her out and confess itself all over the sheets.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been right again: every ounce of scheming, every shameless tilt of her blinds, paid itself back in full. Rio’s eyes opening, the softness of her kiss, coffee, showers, breakfast in bed- only sweetened the fact.</p><p> </p><p>It was a little past noon, the plate they shared from breakfast abandoned on Agatha’s nightstand, two empty coffee cups sitting on Rio’s. Neither of them had moved far since. Rio had stretched herself diagonally on the bed, careless, like she owned every inch of it, and Agatha had climbed on top as if to prove otherwise, knees pressing into the sheets while Rio’s hands rested on her thighs. At some point Rio’s shirt had come off because Agatha had decided it should- her only reason being, well, <em>boobs</em>.</p><p> </p><p>The TV was playing something Rio had picked- some Julia Louis-Dreyfus show Agatha couldn’t be bothered to follow. She was too busy watching Rio instead: the tilt of her head toward the screen, that dumb little grin, the scrunch of her nose whenever a joke actually landed, and the huffed laugh that came after, like she refused to let anyone think she found something funnier than herself.</p><p> </p><p>It was stupid, how easy it felt. Everything about yesterday should have been sitting on the bed with them, heavy and waiting, demanding to be picked apart until there was nothing left but pieces. But it wasn’t. It just existed between them, strangely bearable.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her thumb against Rio’s cheek until Rio finally turned from the TV.</p><p> </p><p>“This show isn’t that funny,” Agatha whispered. But looking at Rio right now made her dizzy, a little nauseous, like she’d been hung upside down too long and set upright too fast. </p><p> </p><p>The natural consequence, Agatha figures, of staring too directly at something she’d spent seventeen years pretending she could glance past.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s hilarious. You’d love it if you were actually watching instead of creeping on my extremely attractive face.” The gap between Rio’s teeth was too much, and Agatha had the sudden, violent urge to groan and cover Rio’s mouth just to make it stop.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s bent knee shifted lazily against the mattress behind her, like she had no idea what the fuck she was doing to Agatha. She pressed her thumb harder into Rio’s cheek, the closest thing to a warning she could manage. Predictably, Rio only took it as an invitation and leaned into  it- eyes half lidded, looking so pleased with herself that Agatha thought she might actually be sick.</p><p> </p><p>“I like staring at your face.” And for reasons she couldn’t begin to justify -beyond the fact she had to stop herself from drooling over the thought- Agatha very often caught herself wanting to drag her tongue up the side of it. </p><p> </p><p>The way Rio bit down on her smile, how it shook a little at the corners like Agatha’s words had taken a hit at her breath- made Agatha’s chest push like some stubborn green thing being coaxed from her bone. </p><p> </p><p>Rio flicked her gaze away, then back. “You know, before everything… I had this thing with your lips,” Rio confessed, huffing a laugh that wasn’t really funny.  “I couldn’t look at you without finding them, without thinking about them.…” She turned away, tongue pushing at her cheek, head shaking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated that -how Rio talked her younger self like someone to be ashamed of- when all Agatha remembered was being in love with her anyway, in spite of it, maybe because of it.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand slipped from Rio’s cheek and settled against the flat of her stomach. Rio caught it immediately, trading Agatha’s thigh for her fingers, tugging them lazily. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced down at their hands resting there, soft against skin, taking in the small proof that she’d done something good.</p><p> </p><p>“I felt like a bit of a freak about it,” Rio admitted, her voice falling to a whisper. “It got so bad I started making rules in my head. How long I was allowed to stare, how long I could let myself imagine it- what it would be like, what they would feel like, the taste. Otherwise I’d get lost in it, spend hours stuck on the same thought.”</p><p> </p><p>“Three seconds,” Agatha murmured. Heat rushed to her ears the moment the words left her mouth- giving herself away like that. That she noticed. That she counted. That every time Rio let herself look, Agatha was clocking it like her life depended on it. </p><p> </p><p>Three miserable fucking Mississippi's. </p><p> </p><p>Three seconds that felt like an eternity, all while Agatha begged the universe for a fourth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s leg stilled behind her. “You were counting?” she asked, but the words weren’t accusation so much as wonder.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat went dry. She wanted to laugh, to shrug. “Of course I was counting,” she whispered. “What the fuck else was I supposed to do?”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you know?”</p><p> </p><p>Did Agatha know? Know what? Know that Rio had rules? Know that Rio actually wanted to kiss her? No. Agatha hadn’t <em>known </em>anything. Only that- </p><p> </p><p>“I knew you preferred even numbers,” Agatha said, trying to aim for careless and landing miles away from it. “And I figured if you wanted to kiss me, you’d do it on an even count. Four instead of three. Something that made sense to you.”</p><p> </p><p>She had meant it to sound like a joke. Like she wasn’t the kind of girl who noticed her best friend measuring seconds instead of just being brave enough for the both of them. Like she hadn’t been sitting there, hoping the math would do what they couldn’t. But it came out exactly that way- desperate, obvious, humiliating.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t bother saying anything. She shifted beneath Agatha, propping herself up on her elbows, then pushed herself higher, forcing Agatha to readjust in her lap. She reached up, tucking hair away from Agatha’s face, and in the tilt of her eyes Agatha caught Rio looking at her mouth like she was measuring something only she could see. </p><p> </p><p>Feeling like she was suddenly twenty-three and fucking stupid, Agatha froze. </p><p> </p><p>Rio cupped her cheek, thumb steady, and leaned in. She brushed her lips against Agatha’s softly, once. Again, a little firmer like a test. And then fully- slow, opened mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Air fled Agatha’s lungs, leaving her nothing but the press of Rio’s mouth. She kissed her back helplessly. They’d done this a hundred times by now, but this was different. It felt less like something new and more like something unfinished finally answered. </p><p> </p><p>And still, Agatha damn near squeaked, like she might’ve if she were in her twenties again and just discovered how it felt to kiss Rio Vidal for the first time. Her head went light, her body and soul scrambling to keep up with how much she wanted it, how much she’d always wanted it.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio drew back, her eyes stayed locked on Agatha’s, breathless. “I should’ve gone to four.”</p><p> </p><p>And if Agatha could’ve strung two coherent thoughts together, maybe she would’ve said something clever, or romantic, or at least not idiotic. But Rio’s mouth always managed to knock the wind out of her, leaving her face probably twisted into something constipated.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p>And all Agatha’s smooth brain could focus on was how much she liked the sound of her name in Rio’s mouth, how nice it felt when Rio’s breath brushed against her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” she exhaled, dumb as a brick.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said. Two words that sounded threadbare, desperate, frayed from use.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha realized she didn’t give a fuck anymore about hanging on to every wrong turn, every moment they’d missed, every time they’d let silence win. None of it mattered. Rio was here. Lilia was here. Jen and Alice were here. She was home. And she could kiss Rio and steal her things and pick stupid fights about nothing just for the pleasure of being listened to by Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“I forgive you,” Agatha said finally. She needed to say it out loud, needed Rio to hear it so she could feel it completely herself. She lifted her hand to Rio’s cheek, thumb brushing along her lips. “I’m sorry too. For every way I made it harder than it had to be.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth trembled against Agatha’s thumb, like she wanted to say more but the words had gotten stuck. Her silence didn’t bother Agatha. Not anymore. She could feel it- apologies and forgiveness had already happened a hundred different ways, in every look, every action, every pause, every ache of missing each other.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry for yesterday too,” Agatha added anyway. “I don’t… it’s easier for me to get angry than to admit I’m hurting.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio just looked at her and said the thing she always said, “You’re forgiven. ”</p><p> </p><p>The ease of it left Agatha reeling, her chest too tight, her mouth moving before she could think better of it. “I divorced Wanda because she donated your sweatshirt.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face did that funny thing it always did when she didn’t know whether she should laugh or be confused- eyes wide, lips pursed. Then she pressed her mouth lightly against Agatha’s thumb. Agatha let her hand fall away, heat rushing through her neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh?” is all Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha knew exactly what it meant: <em>Would you like to elaborate?</em></p><p> </p><p>She was flustered, for fuck’s sake, and in love -actually letting herself feel it instead of trying to wrestle it into something manageable- and that already felt insane enough. Now she was just running her mouth, saying shit she hadn’t planned, and somehow expected to explain herself like a reasonable person. Except Agatha wasn’t reasonable. She’d never done a fucking reasonable thing in her life.</p><p> </p><p>“I meant what I said last night,” Agatha started, because, apparently, that was her best attempt at elaborating. <em>Try again, nincompoop. </em>“I’ve always been yours.” <em>Better. Keep going</em>, her brain demanded. “And it was never about Wanda. Or the sweatshirt. It was about you. It’s always been about you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked once. Twice. Like her brain was still digging itself out from under Agatha’s avalanche. Then her mouth split open, stretched wide enough that Agatha could see -possibly even move into and live there forever, if she tried hard enough- that gorgeous gap between Rio’s teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“If I’d known all it took was that carrot-top getting rid of one of my old sweatshirts, I would’ve flown to Chicago and set the fucking thing on fire myself.” Rio tilted her head, following the path of Agatha’s fleeing eyes and catching them before she had the chance to look away. “Would’ve had you back home with me a lot sooner.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed, the sound closer to a laugh than she’d like to admit, her cheeks warming under Rio’s stare. “You should’ve,” Agatha said, tossing it out like a dare. </p><p> </p><p>“Flown to Chicago?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard the care in it. It wasn’t just a question- it was her way of asking permission, of warning that more truth might follow. Polite, always. Softer, gentler -always gentler- than Agatha had the faintest clue how to be.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha answered.</p><p> </p><p>“I- uh.” Rio let out a short, embarrassed huff, her cheeks going pink.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her hand, brushing a thumb across the heat blooming there. The color pulled a small smile out of her- Rio’s cheeks only ever flushed like that when Agatha was involved, and the knowledge made her feel a little fuzzy, warm. She let her thumb linger there before she drew her hand back. </p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed, cleared her throat, “I looked into jobs at Anne and Robert’s a few times… more than a few, if I’m being honest.”</p><p> </p><p>Oh.</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p> </p><p>That was where Agatha worked in Chicago.</p><p> </p><p>“You- what?” Agatha breathed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio only shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“Why didn’t you?” Agatha blurted, then backpedaled instantly, hand slicing the air. “Not that you were supposed to- I mean, no. You- you shouldn’t have had to consider turning your whole life upside down for… that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, like the idea of turning her life upside down would’ve been any kind of deterrent if it was for Agatha. “I would’ve done it in a heartbeat. I kept trying, over and over, for years. And every time, I was told the same thing: that I’d only make it worse, that you needed space to figure it out on your own.”</p><p> </p><p>And because Agatha was a nosy bitch- itching to beat the living shit out of whoever had the audacity to talk Rio out of that, multiple times, apparently- she snapped, “Who?” Like a pissed off owl. “Alice?” She guessed before Rio could open her mouth to answer. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head. “Jen.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha actually gasped, “That bitch.” Definitely the best person Rio could’ve asked, sure- the one most likely to hand over the right answer. But still.<em> That fucking bitch.</em></p><p> </p><p>“I brought it up a lot, you know. But Jen… she was the only one you still talked to, so if I was gonna listen to anyone, it was her. And most of the time, I did. Sat on my hands and let it go, even when I thought she was full of shit. But the last time I brought it up, she didn’t just shut me down, she was super <em>adamant</em> about me not going- like way more than usual. I immediately thought it was fucking weird, and I pissed her off until she finally told me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t interrupt, but her eyes narrowed, hoping maybe if she stared hard enough Rio would just talk faster.</p><p> </p><p>“She told me you’d been talking about Westview more. Even said you were tossing around the idea of visiting, instead of her flying out to you like she usually did. Her whole argument was that the second you set foot back in Westview, you’d pull something batshit to make sure you stayed. Which… yeah, fair enough. That sounded like you.”</p><p> </p><p>All of that was true. Whatever the timeline had been, Agatha didn’t care to remember. She had started bringing up Westview to Jen the way masochists poke a bruise just to see if it still hurts. She’d been restless, lost in her own skin, every corner of Chicago feeling smaller by the day, so she mentioned the word -<em>home</em>- just to taste it again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kept talking, “But I didn’t care. I just wanted to be where you were. So after a lot of back and forth, we made a deal- six months. If you weren’t back by then, I was doing the fucking thing…” Rio exhaled hard. “You were home in two.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew she was supposed to feel something at Rio’s words. Anger would’ve been the logical choice. She could’ve worked herself up if she really tried. She could have gotten pissed at Jen for meddling, pissed at Rio for listening. She could’ve even admitted that Jen had been right, that Rio showing up in Chicago would’ve been a disaster, no matter how many times Agatha had prayed for it.</p><p> </p><p>But none of it came. The only thing she could hold onto was one, admittedly small, truth:</p><p> </p><p>“You would’ve hated Chicago.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed, not harsh, but with a flicker of pity for Agatha’s half assed ignorance. “You know it was never about Chicago.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. “Is that why you started working at Rita’s?”</p><p> </p><p>And for once, Agatha didn’t shy away from the look on Rio’s face- that look Rio always warned her with when the answer would hurt. Agatha wanted the answer. Needed it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio only nodded. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her voice gentle, “When?”</p><p> </p><p>“I signed the onboarding paperwork a few days before you told me you were moving.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Figures</em>. At this point, Agatha was convinced the universe was strutting around in an <em>I’m With Stupid</em> t-shirt, while hers just said <em>I Am Stupid.</em> Because that’s exactly what it felt like. A running gag at her fucking expense.</p><p> </p><p>All she could picture was Rio, tucked away in some stuffy hospital office, signing pages of paperwork with that quiet determination, believing she had time. Believing she could fix it. Fix them. It broke Agatha’s dumb, lovesick heart.</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth tugged into a tight smile, a nod she didn’t mean, like she wasn’t mere seconds away from losing her shit. “Could you just… give me a second?” she asked, already climbing off of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha crawled toward the head of the bed, collapsed face-first into the pillows, and let out one raw scream that shook through her whole body. When she decided herself done, she flipped hard onto her back, pushed herself up against the headboard, and shoved her hair out of her face. That’s when she caught Rio, leaning back on her hands, bare chest rising and falling, staring at her with wide eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Am I allowed to approach?” Rio asked, her mouth twitching like she was fighting a smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Agatha demanded.</p><p> </p><p>Rio crossed the space, settling easily into Agatha’s lap, flipping their positions from a minute ago.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rested her hands at Rio’s hips, fidgeting with the waistband of her boxers.</p><p> </p><p>And because Rio knew her too well- she hooked a hand behind Agatha’s head and pulled her in, tucking her against her chest. She turned her head enough to press her ear against Rio’s sternum, right above her heart. Agatha closed her eyes and let herself breathe with it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed a kiss into her hair. “Agatha.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, letting her know she was listening.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want you to think that I’m oblivious. I know what we’ve been doing the last four months. I just didn’t know if I was allowed to say it. Your math is confusing sometimes.”</p><p> </p><p>She was right. Agatha’s math had never been numbers on a page. It was hesitation where words should be, sarcasm standing in for clarity, silence that Rio was left with to guess at the answer.</p><p> </p><p>She eased away from Rio’s chest, needing the space to really see her. Propping herself against the pillows and headboard again, she said, “I don’t think you’re oblivious. I’m just terrible at showing my work.”</p><p> </p><p>“You are,” Rio confirmed, a simple nod like she was acknowledging the sky was blue. Agatha rolled her eyes and let her hands move, palms finding Rio’s thighs. She pushed beneath the boxers, fingers creeping higher in search of warmer skin while she listened. “Because randomly throwing around the word break-up with someone who already has a track record of shit timing and missing the important stuff? That’s cruel. And the only defense I’ve got,” her eyes widened, “are these big sad brown eyes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Your sad brown eyes are actually the worst,” Agatha muttered, a reluctant smile tugging at her mouth. “In fact, you should never be sad or upset with me again. We should make that a law.” Her fingers pressed harder into the skin of Rio’s thighs to punctuate her point.</p><p> </p><p>“Then don’t try to break up with me again.” Rio’s voice carried none of its usual bravado, stripped down in a way that tugged at Agatha’s chest. It was a plea, plain and simple. Then clumsy in Rio’s attempt to cover it, she mumbled, “Maybe I should cover my eyes so you’re not swayed.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ignored Rio’s attempt at humor, and spoke before she could think better of it. “I won’t.” She swallowed, forcing herself to clarify, softer this time. “I won’t try to break up with you again, I mean.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded as she let her hands slip from Agatha’s shoulders. Both came up to tuck Agatha’s hair out of the way, her touch lingering longer than it needed to. Her eyes were lidded, her breath a little shallow, like she was on the verge of letting herself drown. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re my girlfriend,” Rio murmured. It carried the lazy tilt of a question.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze, caught off guard. She wasn’t sure why- except she was, and it had everything to do with the way Rio was looking at her. “Yeah,” she said simply. “Don’t wear it out.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile hit Agatha square in the chest, proud and devastating. “Oh, I will,” she said, her tone annoyingly triumphant. “And you’ll live.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll do better than that,” Agatha corrected, because fuck letting Rio have the last word.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in and kissed her. Soft, unhurried, so impossibly sweet that Agatha couldn’t do anything but let her. She didn’t move, didn’t breathe, only stayed there as Rio pulled back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt like she might throw up- not seriously, just in the way where her body didn’t know what to do with everything she was letting it feel, like its only response was to revolt. She shoved past it before it got the better of her, blurting, “You want to go on a date tonight?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile didn’t falter. She only nodded, humming, like it was the most obvious answer in the world.</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” Agatha said, breathless but smug. “I was thinking the Lookout.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They’d dropped Sage off at her apartment about fifteen minutes ago -after she’d driven Rio’s car back to Agatha’s so she could hand it over- and now it was just the two of them again. And Agatha had already had to wrestle Rio off the aux when she decided this was the perfect time to announce she’d never actually listened to <em>Far Away</em> because, apparently, no one listens to Nickelback.</p><p> </p><p>Which meant, in Rio’s mind, this drive was the perfect occasion to fix that. Agatha shut it down immediately. There were a lot of things she could stomach in a confined space with Rio, but hearing that song -those lyrics- while trapped beside her wasn’t fucking one of them.</p><p> </p><p>“You been up there recently?” Agatha asked, suddenly fucking antsy.</p><p> </p><p>“Not in a while,” Rio said. “Years, probably. Last time ended with Alice puking off the side.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned in her seat, incredulous. “Why did she always do that? Anywhere else she could drink half a bar under the table and walk out standing straight.”</p><p> </p><p>“She always blames the altitude,” Rio said, shaking her head, smiling.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed and turned to the window. “That doesn’t even begin to make sense.”</p><p> </p><p>The Lookout was just a really big hill outside town, scrub grass and loose rock, a view that made Westview look like it had more to offer than it did.</p><p> </p><p>Back in their twenties, she, Rio, Alice, and Jen would waste entire nights there, stretched out on the hood of someone’s car, talking shit and pretending they had time to burn forever.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t been back since coming home. She liked to think she hadn’t even considered it until yesterday, but that wasn’t the whole truth. It only came up because she’d thought of it while she was talking to Lilia. And even then, it wasn’t really the place she was thinking about- it was a question Rio had asked her when they were there once.</p><p> </p><p>Twenty minutes later, Rio swung the car into a slow turn, easing it backward up the hill until the tires crunched to a stop. Seatbelts clicked, doors thudded shut, and then Agatha was outside, the night air cool against her skin. She caught the sound of Rio rummaging in the trunk, metal latches and the shuffle of stuff, but Agatha barely heard it- because the view stole everything else.</p><p> </p><p>From the overlook, Westview didn’t shrink or swell; it just sprawled like a lit map, blinking and unpretentious. Highway lights carved a crooked line through the dark, their rhythm broken by gas stations, chain restaurants, the strip mall parking lot buzzing under fluorescent lamps. Downtown showed itself in a line of brick buildings, bar signs that flickered, the faded marquee of the old theater refusing to go black. Neighborhood porch lights scattered like constellations.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t stunning in any objective sense, wasn’t the kind of view people wrote about, and Agatha knew it. Still, something in her chest swelled. She wanted to resent the years she’d spent away, wanted to remind herself she had every reason to keep her distance. But the truth rose faster than her denial- gratitude, raw and aching, filling her from the soles of her feet to the crown of her head.</p><p> </p><p>She was home. And the realization made her almost dizzy, sick with how much she loved it, furious that she couldn’t stop herself from loving it. And then, as if the universe wanted to rub it in, came the flick of a lighter- delivering the very idea of home, personified, standing next to her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could see it as if no time had passed: Rio’s hand, that purple Zippo snapping open- Agatha’s initials carved into the side. It had started as hers, ended as Rio’s, like many things between them. A flame, a drag of smoke, Rio saying something idiotic just to make her roll her eyes. And then that grin- cigarette dangling loose from her mouth, Rio’s gap between her teeth flashing when she made Agatha laugh.</p><p> </p><p>A moment she tucked away without looking too closely, but it seeped through her all the same, saturating everything else that came after.</p><p> </p><p>Now, Rio was standing next to her, close enough that Agatha caught the faint trace of her perfume beneath the smell of her American Spirits. She lifted the cigarette, took a slow drag, then held it out without turning her head, her gaze fixed on the view as she blew smoke in the opposite direction of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha accepted it, fingers brushing Rio’s as she brought it to her lips. She drew in three quick puffs, harsher than she meant to before passing it back- though not before letting her hand linger in the exchange longer than necessary.</p><p> </p><p>“Feels different up here,” Rio said finally, almost like she was speaking to herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said softly. “Better than I remember,” she muttered.</p><p> </p><p>“Me too,” Rio said, and Agatha could tell from her periphery that she was looking at her. “Probably helps that I don’t have to pretend I don’t want to kiss you anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, biting her lip against the grin that wanted out. She turned toward Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned toward her too, cigarette still burning between her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“Not the worst improvement,” Agatha muttered, her hand drifting up to toy with the collar of Rio’s t-shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, narrowing her eyes like she was in on some joke only she knew. She lifted the cigarette, pulled once more, then tipped her chin and blew smoke toward the sky. Her head jerked toward the car, subtle as a command.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze followed, and the sight embarrassingly made her stomach flip.</p><p> </p><p>The trunk was open, blankets thrown across the back, pillows stacked, and a mess of battery powered fairy lights clinging to the ceiling. It was absurd, overdone, unbearably sweet. Agatha should’ve rolled her eyes at- except she couldn’t stop staring.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers clenched into Rio’s shirt, the cotton straining under her grip.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned close, voice dropping into a mocking, courtly drawl. “Ma’lady.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re disgusting,” Agatha whispered, eyes still fixed on the car.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think you really believe that.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha could hear the smirk in Rio’s words.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re right.” Agatha flicked her eyes toward Rio, finally uncurled her fist from Rio’s shirt, and moved toward the car. She sat on the bumper of the trunk, legs dangling.</p><p> </p><p>Rio strolled after her, dragging out the last pull of her cigarette. She exhaled slow, ground the stub between her fingers, then reached past Agatha for the jar of sand she always carries around.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio Vidal was nothing if not committed to saving the earth- one cigarette at a time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shoved the jar into the side pocket of the 4Runner’s trunk, right up against the emergency kit she always kept- jumper cables, poncho, flares. She called it her “just in case kit.” Agatha had been extremely disappointed to learn it wasn’t code for anything remotely sex related.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped in front of Agatha, and even perched on the edge of the trunk, Agatha was nearly eye level with her. Both of Rio’s hands came up, warm against her face, tucking strands of hair behind her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands slipped beneath the hem of Rio’s shirt, nails scratching lightly down her back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thumb caught on her cheekbone, tilting her chin until she couldn’t look anywhere else.</p><p> </p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a small smile and a nod, “Yeah. Just worried I’m gonna rot a tooth with how sweet this all is.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed under her breath, rolling her eyes. “That’s awful.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha murmured, letting her eyes roam over Rio’s body. “Must be distracted by the view.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, tongue caught in her cheek. “So you drag me out here just to out-flirt me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at her, then looked back at the trunk setup like she needed to confirm it was actually there. “Out-flirt you? I’m trying to keep up. I ask you on a <em>date</em>, and <em>you </em>show up with fairy lights, pillows, and blankets? And you expect me not to think about letting you rail me in the back of your 4Runner? Who even does that?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait- so you didn’t ask me to drive you out here just to get railed in the back of my 4Runner?” Rio teased, her hands sliding down to rest against Agatha’s thighs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew she was joking. She always knew. But suddenly, Agatha wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t picked this spot for the view, or for the privacy, or even for Rio’s stupid car. It was just… here. The scene of the crime. The place that had been gnawing the back of her skull since yesterday’s conversation with Lilia. </p><p> </p><p><em>Unfinished business</em>, Agatha thinks.</p><p> </p><p>Rio caught the shift instantly. “What?” she asked, her voice was softer, no longer teasing.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing. I just… Talking with Lilia yesterday reminded me of one night we were up here is all…” Agatha’s voice faltered, trailing off. A beat passed before she let the rest out, her face flushing at the memory. “You asked me what was wrong with my face.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head pulled back a little bit, her brow furrowed deeper, “That was shitty... Nothing’s ever been wrong with your face. It’s perfect. Always has been.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha might have smiled if it didn’t feel like her stomach was about to fall out of her asshole. “It was a valid question. I was actually doing something stupid with my face,” She huffed.</p><p> </p><p><em>Constipated, </em>her brain, ever the asshole, corrected. She yanked Rio’s shirt up just enough to duck under it, grateful as always Rio never bothered with wearing a bra. She pressed her ear hard against Rio’s chest, chasing the thud there like it might settle the riot in her own.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand came up, settling on the back of her head and held her there. Her other hand slipped from her thigh, pulling at the collar of her shirt wider. She pressed a kiss into Agatha’s hair, her voice gentle against her head. “Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunted into her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“This whole skin to skin boob obsession you’ve got going on- it’s very sweet,” Rio teased, pressing another kiss into Agatha’s hair.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had the urge to hiss and yank the collar shut, like she could physically slam a door on Rio’s voice vibrating through her ribs. </p><p> </p><p>She also wanted to correct Rio, rudely and at length. Yes, fine, she had what some might technically classify as a borderline unhealthy obsession with Rio’s boobs- sue her. Every time she looked at them she lost the ability to form a coherent sentence. But that wasn’t the point.</p><p> </p><p>The point was the sound. It was a terrible thing to be addicted to. She buried herself in it like she could siphon it all for herself, greedy for every beat. She didn’t even know she’d been chasing it until she found it here, under her ear, like the finish line to a race she hadn’t realized she’d been running her whole life.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted a little, maybe impatient with Agatha’s silence. “Feels like you’re trying to crawl inside me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rubbed her cheek deeper against her chest. “Maybe I am,” she murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed a laugh. “You’d hate it in there.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha nearly whined, horrified that Rio could say something like that with her heart right there. She turned her head, pressed her lips to Rio’s chest. “I wouldn’t,” she whispered, needing to correct Rio’s words- like Rio’s heart might believe them if she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha went rigid, mortified by how pathetic she must seem. It sent heat racing up her chest to her throat and ears. She turned her head again, pressing her ear back to Rio’s chest- where she immediately clocked the slight uptick in its pace.</p><p> </p><p>She nearly scoffed. <em>Figures</em>- Rio’s heart would take pleasure in Agatha humiliating herself. </p><p> </p><p>Rio inhaled unsteadily, exhaled just as shaky, and Agatha’s head moved with the rise and fall of her chest. “Agatha,” Rio said, and Agatha was grateful for the pause between words- grateful she could catch the stutter in that heartbeat again when Rio spoke her name. “You have no idea what you’re doing to me.”</p><p> </p><p>If it was anything like what Rio did to her, Agatha thought she should apologize- because what heavier, sweeter burden could there be than wanting someone so completely that your heart refused to rest unless it beat against theirs?</p><p> </p><p>In hindsight, that sounds dramatic. Agatha knew that. But when it came to Rio, everything always felt bigger than it should’ve. Too much. Too dramatic. Always more than Agatha knew what to do with.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand pressed firmer against that back of her head. “Don’t be. I like it. I like you like this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally lifted her head, pulling herself out from the warmth of Rio’s shirt. Her hair was a mess across her face, but Rio’s fingers were already there, pushing it back with infuriating gentleness, like she couldn’t help herself.</p><p> </p><p>With her hair out of her face, Agatha leaned in, pressing a quick kiss to Rio’s mouth just because she felt like it. It still messed with Agatha’s head sometimes- that she could just do that now, when there’d been a time it wasn’t nearly that simple. She pulled Rio closer, chin resting on her shoulder while her legs swung lightly as she stared out at Westview.</p><p> </p><p>“Crazy, huh?” Agatha said, offhand. “Last time we were up here, we were too chickenshit to even hold hands.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to kiss her cheek, then let the side of her head rest against Agatha’s. “That’s not entirely true. Sometimes you let me hang on to your pinky.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, rolled her eyes. “Woah. Be still, my heart.” Pressing her mouth into Rio’s shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>She said it like a joke, knowing damn well every time Rio’s pinky reached for hers it felt like her heart was halfway up her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back just far enough to catch her face, a smile on her mouth. “I happen to think it was romantic.”</p><p> </p><p>“We were pussies,” Agatha shot back, no venom in it. She only wanted to hear how Rio would counter her.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” Rio said, licking her lips- something Agatha clocked instantly, because why wouldn’t she? “I get it, at the end of the day we dropped the ball- <em>spectacularly</em>. But even then, I think we were doing our best to be careful with each other. Even when we got it wrong, the effort was there. That’s important.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could probably rattle off a thousand examples of how they’d managed the exact opposite. But she didn’t. The fact Rio could look at all that shit, and still see two people trying to take care of each other… that alone burned warm in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad we figured it out,” Agatha said, though she felt the wind knocked out of her a bit. She leaned in, letting her forehead rest against Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile widened, her forehead pressing firmer against Agatha’s. “Me too. Took us long enough.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” was all Agatha could manage. Rio’s hand found her cheek, easing her back from where their foreheads touched. Agatha knew it wasn’t about moving her- it was about seeing her. And she didn’t mind. She wanted to look at Rio too. Wanted to memorize the way her face went soft, the way she looked like she was seconds away from letting herself drown.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio murmured, her thumb stroking slowly across her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha loved it when Rio said her name. Ironic, considering she’d spent her whole life despising it. But Rio had ruined that for her too- always saying it just to say it, like the sound of her name alone was worth loving.</p><p> </p><p>She opened her mouth to tell Rio to say her name again.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” came out instead.</p><p> </p><p>...Well. About nearly two decades late, but better than never, Agatha supposed.</p><p> </p><p>She wouldn’t take it back- not even with Rio staring at her now, frozen, like she couldn’t have possibly heard Agatha right.</p><p> </p><p>Because she still meant it. She’d meant it for years. Every day she carried it, and every day she kept it to herself was a mistake. She should’ve said it the first time she felt it- back when Rio caught her staring and asked what was wrong with her face. She should’ve said it then, and every day after. She should’ve never let Rio spend a single moment not knowing.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve- uh,” Agatha started, breathless. She tried again. “I’ve swallowed that sentence more times than I can count.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand was suddenly at her mouth, trembling fingers brushing against Agatha’s lips as if the touch could prove she hadn’t imagined what she’d just heard.</p><p> </p><p>“Say it again,” Rio whispered, the word breaking like a plea, her gaze locked on Agatha’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you… so much, Rio,” Agatha said. Her voice shook, because she needed Rio to believe her. She needed her to hear it the way she meant it.</p><p> </p><p>“You do?” Rio asked, so soft it almost disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>“I do,” Agatha said, nodding quickly. “I always have.” </p><p> </p><p>And then Rio was kissing her, and Agatha could taste it everywhere- on Rio’s lips, on her tongue, in her breath, in the way every pause between kisses carried the same desperate confession. Each break was another insistence, another vow, love pressed into Agatha’s mouth over and over: <em>I love you, I love you, I’ve only ever loved you. </em></p><p> </p><p>And in her chest, Agatha felt the garden she’d tried so long to ignore- sprawling, insistent, every root reaching for Rio. All of it planted by her, tended by her, grown wild under her green thumb. Under all of that, Agatha was grateful. Grateful she would never again have to wonder, never again have to dream about what Rio’s voice might sound like saying those words. She had them now, real and alive, blooming from her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” Rio told her again, like she finally understood she could spend a lifetime saying it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could live a lifetime on nothing else.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>if you don't remember Agatha thinking about Rio asking what was wrong with her face- it's in the last chapter if you need a recap.</p>
<p>i'm thinking probably two chapters left *very sad*... i thought that i might write a dedicated flashback chapter, but i don't know if i will. for multiple reasons, the main two being : 1. i don't think that i could stomach it- it would be too painful. 2. i have no impulse control and would inevitably make them dry hump even though, per this entire fic, they didn’t do shit back then.</p>
<p>fun fact any tv show/movie i mention in this- it's what i have on as background noise while i write. and i will say this with my entire chest- julia louis-dreyfus deserved every single one of those six consecutive emmy wins for veep.</p>

<p>Chapter Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Howdy, partners. It’s been a minute.</p>
<p>The last two+ months have been busy as fuck, but since my last update I’ve spent more time writing than not. So fear not- this fic always was, and still is, taking up entirely too much space in my head. And after being away for so long, this is the chapter I’m giving you. Fair warning: it’s an extremely long one. Take your time with it. I certainly did.</p>
<p>More good news, maybe- I didn’t want to post this chapter without the next one being mostly finished, so that one should be up in a few days… hopefully. For better or worse, it carries on in much the same vein.</p>
<p>You’ll also notice the chapter count still isn’t updated. There are chapters left. How many? Still unclear. Maybe three? I’m known to lie about these things. I don't know.</p>
<p>Lastly, for anyone (if any of you) who saw Let’s Love! on Nov. 4th- surprise? You were in the same room as Aubrey Plaza and the night shift author. Happy reading!</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Reasonable.</em></p><p> </p><p>Defined as, according to the internet, <em>as much as is appropriate or fair; moderate</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha understood the concept. Her execution, however, was a bit questionable. </p><p> </p><p>Reasonable people followed events in the correct order. They let things settle. They exercised patience.They did not rearrange their lives around another human being simply because that human laughed a certain way, or had an infuriatingly specific gap between her teeth, or looked at them like they were already home.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spent a significant portion of her life learning how to look like one of them. Reasonable, she’d discovered, was less a feeling and more a presentation.You paused before responding.You didn’t say the first thing that came to mind.You waited an acceptable amount of time before wanting something too much.</p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal was Agatha’s girlfriend now. That part mattered.Enough that Agatha had decided -very firmly, very maturely- that she would behave accordingly, <em>reasonably</em>. She would apply logic. She would pace herself. She would treat this like something that required care rather than speed. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha would believe, with every fiber of her being, that all of this was manageable. Moderation, Agatha decided, would now be her way of life.</p><p> </p><p>It was an attractive theory. Entirely incompatible with Agatha’s reality.</p><p> </p><p>Because reason, in Agatha’s experience, had always been a flexible concept. One that bent under pressure and collapsed entirely when confronted with feeling. She could be reasonable in emergencies. She could be reasonable when lives were on the line. She could be reasonable when exhaustion hollowed her out and left her running on instinct alone.</p><p> </p><p>Love, unfortunately, had never responded well to Agatha’s reason.</p><p> </p><p>And the more Agatha tried to convince herself that she could do this correctly -<em>slowly, in the proper sequence</em>- the more obvious it became that she was already rearranging herself around Rio in ways she pretended not to notice. Thinking in advance. Adjusting without being asked. Accounting for another person in every decision that used to belong solely to her.</p><p> </p><p>This, Agatha suspected, was the part where reasonable people would have paused.</p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha did not pause.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha told herself a lot of things.</p><p> </p><p>She told herself she was fine.That this was normal.That wanting someone this much did not automatically mean she would ruin it. That intensity was not the same thing as recklessness.That she could love deeply without consuming the object of her affection whole.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha told herself a lot of things.</p><p> </p><p>And she told them convincingly enough that, for a while, they almost sounded true.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was currently at work, assigned to one micro-preemie- a 1:1 ratio that every nurse in a hospital setting knew was code for <em>this kid is in deep shit. </em></p><p> </p><p>A twenty-three-week micro-preemie, furious at being forced into the world before his body was even close to ready. His skin was translucent, his organs were still undecided on whether they wanted to participate at all, and every breath taken was absolutely a threat. He was tiny, pissed off, and completely unwilling to tolerate any of it.</p><p> </p><p>And honestly, Agatha respected the hell out of that. She’d been born pissed off too, and thirty-eight years later, her mood hadn’t improved much.</p><p> </p><p>What absolutely made things worse was the pharmacist on the phone, who appeared determined to make life harder for Agatha and the fetus she was, at this very moment, trying to keep alive.</p><p> </p><p>Every time he muttered, <em>“I don’t know what you want me to do about it,”</em> Agatha felt her own fucking blood pressure spike. And she was one more useless non-answer away from dropping the whole act of being reasonable and reminding everyone within earshot that <em>reasonable</em> was a department she’d never once staffed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled one long, pointedly inconvenienced breath through her nose, angled directly into the phone, making sure the pharmacist heard every single second of her irritation before she spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going to tell you one more time,” Agatha warned. “And I’m going to speak very slowly so you understand. Verify the surfactant order so I can pull it from the Pyxis. It isn’t complicated.”</p><p> </p><p>“I already told you. The patient’s weight has to be entered in the chart before I can do that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha yanked the hospital-issued smartphone from her ear, gripping it with both hands. She closed her eyes, silently mouthing <em>oh my fucking god</em> while resisting the urge to bash herself in the head with it just to see if she could knock her own IQ down to match this pharmacist’s.</p><p> </p><p>After another slow, murderous inhale, she pressed it back to her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m literally staring at the chart,” Agatha said, her laugh cracking close to manic. “The weight is in there. Five hundred sixty-two grams. Entered. Documented. Done. What exactly is your PhD for if you can’t manage to read what’s on a fucking screen?”</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me?” the pharmacist said, scandalized.</p><p> </p><p>“Look, <em>buddy</em>,” Agatha snapped, “I’d love nothing more than to come down there and personally point out this kid’s weight until it’s fully burned into your retinas. But as it stands, he’s busy trying to die, and my hands are full.So tell me what I can possibly do to make this easier for you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I need you to enter the patient’s weight into the chart,” the pharmacist repeated  for what felt like the hundredth fucking time.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s in the chart!” Agatha roared. “Five hundred and sixty two grams! Right here, in front of me! Stop telling me it isn’t there!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest heaved, her eyes burning holes through the computer monitor as she stared at the patient’s weight, glowing in the chart exactly where it had been the entire fucking time.</p><p> </p><p>Silence stretched on the other end of the phone in the wake of her shouting, broken only by a single cleared throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. There it is. Must’ve been a delay. I’ll verify it now.”</p><p> </p><p><em>A delay. </em></p><p> </p><p>The baby had been born before shift change. There was no delay. The man -like every other useless man who thought the burden of his incompetence should be hers- was just a miserable, fucking dumbass.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you!” Agatha barked into the phone.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I get your name? You’ve been entirely disrespect-”</p><p> </p><p>She hung up before he could finish, and slammed the phone down on the desk.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time since Agatha had made that stupid call, she let herself look away from the monitor. A few nurses, a couple of RTs- every one of them was staring at her. </p><p> </p><p>“Pharmacy,” Agatha said flatly.</p><p> </p><p>The room broke into groans of recognition, a chorus of “ohhhhs.” Someone actually muttered, “That makes sense.” Another shook their head and apologized on behalf of the poor bastard who had been on the other end.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone did it eventually. Nurses screamed at doctors, doctors screamed at nurses. Agatha wasn’t the first to lose her shit, and she as fuck wouldn’t be the last. The difference was, she didn’t care. There was no shame burning in her cheeks, no worry about who had heard. Just the raw, bitter satisfaction of knowing she’d been right.</p><p> </p><p>If the Pyxis gave her even a hint of trouble tonight, she was ready to put her head through the damn thing and rip the surfactant out herself. Thankfully, for everyone involved, it didn’t. The drawers slid open without protest, and she moved on, her blood pressure still through the fucking roof, and the preemie still wanting to play patty cake with the Woman Upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had both arms in the isolette with Sherry, the RT, helping draw up a blood gas when the familiar rumble of x-ray wheels cut into the pod, and without meaning to- Agatha looked up.</p><p> </p><p><em>Rio</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Her girlfriend of exactly one day- well… one day officially acknowledged out loud for the first time instead of implied. She was steering that big, clunky portable x-ray machine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snapped her focus back to the baby, because the last thing she needed was to look like an idiot caught drooling. She listened like a hawk while Rio parked the portable in the neighboring bedspace next to hers. God forbid she have to murder one of her own coworkers for thinking it was acceptable to so much as <em>look</em> at Rio the wrong way.</p><p> </p><p>Not that Agatha had screamed it through the hospital intercom or anything- but it should be understood. Branded into everyone’s skulls. The infamous “<em>bad boy of x-ray” </em>-a stupid fucking nickname, if Agatha had anything to say about it- was officially off the market… Permanently. </p><p><br/><br/></p><p>“Well, if it isn’t my favorite x-ray tech,” Sheryl screeched, her voice far too high pitched for how close she was standing. She was directly across from Agatha, both of them with their arms in the isolette, the preemie between them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit down on the inside of her lip and focused on her own patient. She steadied the baby’s heel between her fingers, quick with the lancet, then guided the drop of blood into a capillary tube. She handed it off to Yelena- also an RT lingering at her bedspace, probably under the pretense of supervising but more likely making sure Agatha didn’t blow up at Sheryl. Which, to be fair, Agatha appreciated.</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” Shirley said, voice still fucking piercing even at a whisper. Agatha flicked her eyes up briefly to show she was listening while she blotted the baby’s heel with gauze. “When you first started working here, Rio told me she had a crush on you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh?” It came out strangled, and Agatha cleared her throat, eyes cutting right back to the baby. </p><p> </p><p>Yelena laughed -too entertained for Agatha’s liking- and earned herself a glare.</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t that sweet?” Sharlene added cheerfully, fucking beaming.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced a shrug, the best she could manage with both arms buried in the portholes of an isolette. “Yeah,” she muttered, clearing her throat again. “Sure. Cool.”</p><p> </p><p>“Did you know?”</p><p> </p><p>“Did I know what?” Agatha asked flatly, eyes fixed on the baby, not on Sharon.</p><p> </p><p>“That Rio has a crush on you?”</p><p> </p><p>It was too easy- the opening, the stupidity of the question.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha muttered, “Judging by the noises she was making this morning when my tongue was halfway to her cervix, I had my suspicions.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence followed.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena cut through it with a loud, unapologetic laugh. Agatha smirked, eyes flicking up to Shelly, whose face had gone pale white, her horror written plainly across it.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha…” Sheila swallowed hard, voice shaky. “Is there something clinically wrong with your head, dear?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s smile tightened. “Oh… So much.”</p><p> </p><p>She heard the clunk of the portable’s tube head closing, followed by the janky rumble of its wheels turning in their direction. Agatha realized -annoyingly late- that she had started holding her breath. She forced herself to exhale and keep her eyes on the baby.</p><p> </p><p>“Yelena,” came Rio’s voice as she parked the portable at Agatha’s bedspace.</p><p> </p><p>From across the isolette, Sherry’s grating whisper, “You being nervous around her is very endearing, dear.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glared, daring Sheryl to keep talking.</p><p> </p><p>“How are you?” Rio asked Yelena, oblivious- or maybe pretending to be.</p><p> </p><p>“Annoyed,” Yelena replied, her accent flattening the word.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry?” Rio’s laugh followed, soft and genuine, and Agatha could see the exact face she was making without looking- the faint crease between her brows, the small smile tugging at her mouth, the flash of that damn gap between her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell your sister she’s the reason,” Yelena said.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing would make me happier,” Rio shot back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. They did this every time Sage’s name came up, and Agatha knew it was a bunch of bullshit. Both of them adored Sage, even if they pretended otherwise. Yelena went soft the second she was mentioned, and Rio always played along like she didn’t sound proud every time she said her sister’s name.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, suddenly right beside Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Shit-” Agatha startled, jerking slightly before snapping her eyes toward Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile was easy, teasing. She held up the small plate, ready to slide it into the isolette’s tray. “You ready?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said, too dumb. Her mouth had gone dry, and her words weren’t exactly cooperating, which was inconvenient considering the literal infant in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded toward the tray, and it took Agatha a second to realize she hadn’t moved, her arms still inside the isolette portholes, blocking the slot.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.” Agatha exhaled a quiet laugh, stepping back. “Right. Sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Her ears were on fucking fire.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re good,” Rio said, still smiling- soft and unfairly kind.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to reach out and cover that smile with her hand, like maybe that would muffle the <em>I love you</em> sitting on her own tongue, insistent and stupidly new despite already being said. Instead, forced her eyes away, and caught Shannon staring. </p><p> </p><p>The woman looked seconds from passing out, hand to her chest like she was watching a goddamn proposal instead of the baby currently plotting to extubate himself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha mouthed a clear <em>don’t,</em> then lifted a gloved hand and dragged it slowly across her throat for emphasis. Sherri only laughed, waving Agatha off. “Oh, don’t be ridiculous.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head turned toward Agatha, brows raised in question.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha only shrugged, expression flat. “She’s got dementia.”</p><p> </p><p>“That right?” Rio said, and Agatha sure as fuck didn’t miss the way brown eyes flicked down to her mouth before she turned back to the portable. She lifted a lead apron from the cart, gave it a shake, and held it out in front of Agatha. Without thinking, Agatha stepped forward, sliding her arms through the loops while Rio moved the heavy fabric over her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>“Gotta protect those loins, you know?” Rio said under her breath, the smile in her voice impossible to miss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She couldn’t. Her throat had gone tight, and she could feel the heat crawling up her neck, spreading fast.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned to Sheryl, offering her the second apron. </p><p> </p><p>Sharlene declined in that overly polite tone she used when she wanted to sound gracious, and for reasons Agatha didn’t care to think about, it made her want to bite the woman’s head off. </p><p> </p><p>Probably because Agatha still remembered that very first night Rio had shown up in this NICU and Sherry had gone on a fucking tangent about the importance of radiation safety. The hypocrisy was fucking blinding.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced the thought away and refocused on the baby, steadying her hands as she and Sheryl positioned his tiny body for the image. Rio and Yelena fell into easy conversation as they worked. The exposure was made; the image was done. And Rio was gone.</p><p> </p><p>The whole interaction had felt like it lasted forever and ended all in the same breath. She and Shandra adjusted the baby’s position, waited for him to settle, and by the time the monitors finally evened out, Agatha had almost convinced herself she was fine- until she turned back to her workstation.</p><p> </p><p>A single pink flower sat on her keyboard. No stem. Just the bloom.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it, a stupid lump forming in her throat, and she wondered how she’d ever gone so long without this- without <em>her</em>. Because now, even the idea of a life without Rio felt inconceivable.</p><p> </p><p>She slid the flower behind the computer monitor where it would be safe until she could tuck it away properly, and pulled her phone from her pocket. An unread text waited, sent a few minutes earlier.</p><p> </p><p><em>Rio: i love you</em></p><p> </p><p>Jesus Christ, could they not go five fucking minutes without being sappy lesbians? Agatha huffed, thumbs already moving. </p><p> </p><p><em>I love you too. </em></p><p> </p><p>Safe to say Agatha’s 4 a.m. lunch break was spent with her tongue down Rio’s throat at their usual smoking spot.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks for coming with me tonight,” Rio said, reaching for Agatha’s hand as they crossed the parking lot.</p><p> </p><p>“You should feel honored. This is a big deal for me, you know. Goes against my core values.” Agatha said, tangling their fingers together.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced over, smiling. “Because of the names?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped walking, dragging Rio to a halt. “Do you realize,” she began, “this town has two rec centers? <em>Two</em>, Rio.” Agatha paused for effect. “Both proudly bearing names so offensively fucking bland that I can only assume a roomful of men were involved.” She then stared at the sign on the building, appalled.</p><p> </p><p><b><em>Westview Recreation Center.</em></b></p><p> </p><p>Or that was the intent, once. Now the white neon letters flickered, a few letters completely burnt out. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted a hand toward the flickering sign. “Wetview Recratio enter,” she read, then tilted her head. “Where hope goes to die.”</p><p> </p><p>Across town sat its equally uninspired counterpart, <em>Westview Community Center- </em>identical brick, identical fucking mediocrity.</p><p> </p><p>So on the drive over, Agatha had done what any reasonable woman would do when confronted with incompetence… She looked up who was in charge of Westview’s Department of Parks and Recreation.</p><p> </p><p>The search led her to a woman named Leslie Knope, and Agatha immediately began drafting a strongly worded email about the town’s chronic lack of creativity in naming public buildings and how the matter needed to be corrected… immediately.</p><p> </p><p>She made a mental note to take a picture of the sign later and attach it to the email for emphasis.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha couldn’t exactly explain why she’d worked herself up over something as trivial as the names of two buildings- only that it begged the question of why she’d been at this shithole in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>The answer, of course, was her girlfriend. </p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal. </p><p> </p><p>The only person on earth who could convince Agatha to spend a Wednesday night in a gym that smelled like sweat and despair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, as it turned out, played on a recreational basketball team that started up every fall. She had, apparently, been doing this for years. The details were unimportant. What mattered -at least what Agatha could bring to herself to care about- was that tonight was the team’s first practice of the semester…  Or maybe the quarter. Agatha didn’t fucking know, and she had no interest in finding out.</p><p> </p><p>What Agatha <em>did</em> know, with unsettling clarity, was that Rio had asked if she wanted to come along, and Agatha had said yes with absolutely no follow up questions. Which was <em>genuinely </em>concerning but unfortunately, not the point.</p><p> </p><p>The point was that Rio playing basketball gave Agatha a socially acceptable reason to yell at strangers. That it also involved Rio in a uniform was just… one of the more aggressively difficult facts to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>Short gym shorts that left nothing to the imagination. A bright red jersey with <em>Pistol Shrimps</em> stamped across the chest in bold, white lettering. A black sports bra visible beneath it, knee high socks, white sneakers, her hair pulled into a messy bun that looked like it was seconds from falling out, with a gym bag slung over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha -despite her many, <em>many </em>strengths- was powerless against this level of visual attack.</p><p> </p><p>Before they’d even left Rio’s apartment, Agatha had insisted -no, demanded- that Rio stand still long enough for her to take photos. “For humiliation purposes,” she’d claimed, though her attempt at indifference was betrayed by the way her smile kept threatening to show itself. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took far too many pictures, all while trying not to look directly at Rio’s legs or the way that stupid jersey hung off her shoulders, because if Agatha did, she might accidentally reveal that the real humiliation wasn’t Rio’s at all- it was hers.</p><p> </p><p>“You realize most people don’t care about that kind of stuff, right?” Rio’s voice pulled Agatha out of her thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha blinked, finally tearing her eyes from the blinding white neon letters in front of her. “Sorry, I think I disassociated somewhere between looking at this place and losing my will to live.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed, and Agatha smiled, because she never could seem to help it when Rio did. She liked being close enough to hear it- liked knowing she’d done something, however small, that made the world sound like that laugh for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>“I suppose that’s valid,” Rio said, turning her head to take in the full atrocity before them.</p><p> </p><p>And truthfully, besides the sign, it wasn’t even <em>that</em> bad. The building was aggressively mediocre at best, absolutely. But Agatha knew she was overreacting. The problem, she knew, wasn’t the brick or the lighting. </p><p> </p><p>She’d been restless for days, unable to sit still in her own skin, working herself into frenzies over nothing. For no reason in particular, she told herself. Definitely not because she was now <em>officially dating</em> Rio Vidal, which was, objectively speaking, the most disorienting joy she’d ever experienced.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha loved Rio, was stupidly, irrevocably in love with her, and there wasn’t a force in the world -or any of its minor bureaucratic failures- that could convince her she wasn’t meant to spend the rest of her life with this woman. But still, sometimes loving Rio seemed to flip some manic switch inside herself, like her heart didn’t quite know how to handle getting what it wanted.</p><p> </p><p>That’s what Agatha told herself, anyway. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to come to this stuff if you don’t want to, you know. I don’t want you to feel obligated,” Rio said after a moment, squeezing her hand gently.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, a bit insulted. </p><p> </p><p><em>Obligation</em>, Agatha thought. </p><p> </p><p>As if Agatha had ever thought of Rio as an obligation<em>.</em> If anything, Rio should’ve known by now that Agatha would endure much worse than a night trapped in a stinky rec center if meant being near Rio at all. </p><p> </p><p>Seventeen years of loving Rio in every iteration -friend, stranger, friend again, almost, finally- should’ve made it obvious there wasn’t much Agatha wouldn’t do just for proximity- but Agatha, as always, digressed.</p><p> </p><p>“And let you parade around unsupervised in that?” Agatha asked, gesturing at Rio’s uniform. It was the least nauseatingly romantic response she could manage. “Fuck no.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio only smiled- gap toothed and annoyingly charming, which was frankly offensive given the circumstances. Then she shook her head, cheeks pink even in the dim parking lot light, and Agatha felt a sudden rush of affection crash through her chest.</p><p> </p><p>She tugged at Rio’s hand with a little more force than necessary -she couldn’t wait another second- and when Rio stumbled into her space, looking pleased and unsuspecting, Agatha kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>It was soft. Unbearably soft, considering the velocity of Agatha’s feelings behind it. Her hand came up to Rio’s face automatically, as if her palm knew better than the rest of her how to cradle something precious. And for a moment, Rio didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel it -Rio’s surprise- could feel it in the way her eyelashes brushed against her own, the way her mouth stayed still under Agatha’s like she was holding very, very still inside the center of a daydream.</p><p> </p><p>And then, waking into it, Rio kissed her back.</p><p> </p><p>Just the smallest pressure, the smallest exhale against Agatha’s mouth, the gentle weight of a hand curling around the back of Agatha’s neck, a thumb brushing along the hinge of her jaw.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled away first, enough to catch her breath, her forehead resting against Rio’s. She stayed there for a moment before leaning back in, pressing another soft kiss to Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“You think I need supervision, huh?” Rio said, voice teasing in a way that didn’t match the shapes of hearts currently bulging out of her eyeballs at all. She slid her arms around Agatha’s waist, pulling her in until their bodies met.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed as she went. She wrapped her arms around Rio’s shoulders, her nose brushing against Rio’s cheek. “No,” she said. “I just needed an excuse to stare.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed a laugh and leaned back slightly, her smile so sweet Agatha felt it in her teeth. “I love you,” Rio said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>There they were again- the words Agatha had heard a hundred times in the short time they’d been saying them, and she still wasn’t remotely close to being desensitized to it. </p><p> </p><p>Every time Rio said them, something in Agatha’s chest went bright, and all she could think about was getting Rio to say them again- once, twice, forever. </p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” Agatha said, because she did- helplessly endless.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her once more, smiling against her mouth. “We should go in,” she murmured. “I’m gonna be late.” She pressed another kiss to the corner of Agatha’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grumbled, but she didn’t resist when Rio’s fingers found hers. She let herself be tugged toward the rec center, pretending it wasn’t exactly where she wanted to go. </p><p> </p><p>Inside, the rec center was bigger than Agatha had expected. The smell hit her before anything else, heavy with chlorine instead of the sweat she’d braced for. Long hallways stretched out in every direction, signs pointing toward Gyms A through D, racquetball courts, and something optimistically labeled <em>Wellness Studio.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha was willing to bet that it was a front for a pyramid scheme, judging by the eight hundred bottles of pressed juice lined up behind the glass window.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand stayed in hers as they walked past the racquetball courts- players inside lunging at the walls with a level of enthusiasm Agatha could only describe as deeply concerning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught the shift in Rio’s shoulders, the way her steps picked up pace. She glanced to look at Agatha, teeth bared in a grin that was all nerves and excitement, eyebrows lifting like she could barely contain herself.</p><p> </p><p>The doors to Gym C were propped open, and the smell hit her immediately- sweat, wood polish, the tang of metal from the bleachers. Agatha grimaced, pressing her fingers to the bridge of her nose. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s like Eau de Adolescent Boy in here,” Agatha muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed under her breath and nodded toward the bleachers lining the far wall, where a few people had already gathered. “See you when it’s over,” she said, giving Agatha’s hand one last squeeze before letting go.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed in acknowledgment and scanned the stands, spotting Jen almost immediately, waving Agatha over. With a resigned sigh, she made her way across the court.</p><p> </p><p>She climbed the bleachers to where Jen was sitting and dropped down beside her with another sigh. “Jennifer.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen elbowed her lightly, a grin tugging at her mouth. “Sooo,” she sing songed, “how are you and your <em>girlfriend</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>She had filled Jen in on everything at work a few days ago. Gave her shit for keeping Rio from moving to Chicago, called her a meddling pain in the ass, and Jen, naturally, wore it like a badge of honor. Said it all worked out, didn’t it? </p><p> </p><p>And it had. Agatha hated admitting it but thanked her anyway- for knowing her better than she knew herself most days. She’d even let Jen pull her into a hug she absolutely did not start. Jen had squeezed her back, and whispered, <em>I’m glad y’all figured it out. You deserve to be happy. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha had rolled her eyes then too, her only reliable defense against sentiment. Still, the words had stuck with her, echoing in the places she didn’t usually like to visit for too long. </p><p> </p><p>Now, sitting beside Jen, watching Rio across the court, she felt that same ridiculous warmth climb up her throat again, and promptly shoved it down before it could get too comfortable. </p><p> </p><p>Sappiness was overrated anyway, and Rio looked unfairly fucking hot in red.</p><p> </p><p>“Still dating her. Still haven’t murdered her. Progress.”</p><p> </p><p>The word <em>dating</em> made Agatha’s eye twitch a little. Felt too small for what they’d gotten themselves into.</p><p> </p><p>Jen scoffed. “Oh, come on. Don’t act like you haven’t been waiting seventeen years for this.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave her a sideways glance. “Don’t make it sound so pathetic.”</p><p> </p><p>“It is pathetic,” Jen stated as a matter of fact. “But also romantic.” A pause. “You know, if you ignore the part where you married another woman and fled the state for a decade.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped her head toward her best friend. “Thank you very much for the reminder, Jennifer. But I’d argue that only makes it <em>more </em>romantic.” She didn’t give Jen time to gloat. “How long do these things last?” she asked, watching as Sage and Yelena stepped through the gym doors- Sage veering toward the team clustered at the far end of the bleachers, Yelena heading their way.</p><p> </p><p>“Usually about an hour,” Jen said.</p><p> </p><p>“An hour? Jen, that’s sixty minutes of marinating in this smell. Seriously, the fumes are literally touching my brain.”</p><p> </p><p>“That actually makes a lot of sense,” Jen muttered, eyeing Agatha a little weirdly. “Also, practice doesn’t start for another thirty minutes, so... good luck surviving it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thirty minutes?” she repeated, staring at Jen.  </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s words from the parking lot replayed in Agatha’s head- <em>we’re going to be late. </em>Thirty minutes wasn’t fucking late. Thirty minutes only counted as late if you were Rio Vidal. Agatha knew that. Had always known that. </p><p> </p><p>And if Agatha had bothered to use her fucking brain and connect even the most obvious dots, she would’ve realized they had a full half hour to spare.More than enough time to suggest a quickie in the car- an offer Rio had never once managed to refuse Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose. “I’m going to kill her.”</p><p> </p><p>Yelena made her way up the bleachers. “Good evening, ladies,” she said, settling onto the row above them. </p><p> </p><p dir="ltr">Jen looked up and smiled. Agatha grunted, still nursing the irritation of a missed opportunity.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, it’s good to see you here,” Yelena said, resting both hands on Agatha’s shoulders. “Welcome to WAGs.” The blonde gave her shoulders a quick, enthusiastic shake, both in greeting and silently apologizing for what Agatha was about to endure.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha twisted to look at Yelena. “WAGs?”</p><p> </p><p>“Wives and girlfriends of professional athletes,” Jen explained.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snarled. The acronym alone was enough to make her want to set something on fire, though she decided not to unpack why it got under her skin as much as it did. Her eyes drifted across the gym, landing on John Walker who worked in the ED at St. Rita’s, ambling over with a grinning baby perched on his hip while his wife, Olivia, headed for the players.</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t even make sense,” Agatha muttered. “There are men here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Walker!” Yelena called across the gym. “Would you consider yourself a WAG?”</p><p> </p><p>John didn’t even pretend to think about it. The baby on his hip was shrieking with laughter, tiny fists in his shirt, and Agatha caught sight of Rio crossing the court toward them, hands already reaching out.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t give a shit what I am,” John said, handing his baby off to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“You know, it’s always refreshing to see you, John. You’ve got this rare, natural talent for sucking the life out of any space you enter. It’s honestly impressive,” Yelena said, smiling sweetly at him.</p><p> </p><p>The baby let out a delighted squeal as Rio took him, small hands immediately grabbing at her jersey. </p><p> </p><p>“See?” Yelena said, pointing triumphantly toward the baby. “Even your son agrees with me.”</p><p> </p><p>John gave her the finger without missing a beat and turned back to Rio. He dropped the diaper bag and sat down on the first row of bleachers. Rio laughed at something he said, adjusting the baby easily against her hip as she sat down next to him.</p><p> </p><p>From where Agatha sat, she could only see her side profile, and the baby staring up at her like he’d been waiting his whole short life to find her face.</p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m gonna be sick,” Agatha whispered, staring in horror. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” Jen asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. For the second time in her life, she was fairly certain something hormonal was happening to her. It felt biological in the very worst way- like her own anatomy had turned against her, whispering <em>that</em>. <em>That’s what you want.</em> Which was absurd. Agatha was a grown woman with a fully functioning prefrontal cortex; she didn’t fall apart over maternal displays and Rio’s naked biceps. </p><p> </p><p>Rio must’ve been doing something dumb with her face- judging by how hard the baby was laughing. He had both fists clutching her jersey, leaning back far enough to build suspense before crashing forward into her chest and tucking his head there like he meant to hug her. Then he pulled back, checking for her reaction, clearly pleased with himself, and did it again.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio laughed, one hand coming up to cradle the back of his head as she said something to John. The baby pulled away just to check her face again- pure joy, waiting for more.</p><p> </p><p>“She can’t keep getting away with this,” Agatha whispered, unable to tear her gaze away from her girlfriend holding a baby. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you good?” Jen asked, loud enough to yank her back to earth.</p><p> </p><p>“No, Jennifer,” Agatha said in a harsh whisper. “Someone needs to get that thing away from her before I do something incredibly humiliating and irreversible.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you talking about the baby?” Jen asked carefully, which was a mistake because careful meant concerned, and concerned meant Agatha might actually have to explain herself. Jen’s eyes flicked toward Rio- still holding the baby. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha bit out. “Get it away from her.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you calling him <em>it</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“Get <em>him</em> away from her. Does that help?”</p><p> </p><p>Yelena leaned forward. “Agatha,” she began, “are you feeling… how do you say this- womb ache?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze.Her head turned slowly, mechanically, until her gaze met Yelena’s. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she said slowly, every syllable wrapped in the effort of not committing homicide.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena’s eyes widened. “Yes,” she said, nodding as though she’d solved an equation. “This is what that seems to be.”</p><p> </p><p>She watched Yelena stand, brushing invisible dust from her jeans before making her way down the bleachers with the self importance of someone who’d just declared herself part of the solution. </p><p> </p><p>“Hello, little baby! I would like to hold you now,” Yelena announced.</p><p> </p><p>Rio passed the baby over easily, still talking to John.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her lungs expand. Air. Actual oxygen. </p><p> </p><p>It lasted about two seconds before she turned to find Jen watching her- elbows on her knees, lips pressed together, like she was sitting on top of a small volcano made entirely of commentary.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her brows- a warning. “I would appreciate it if we didn’t turn this into a whole thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen lifted her hands, a picture of innocence, though the effort it took not to laugh was written all over her face. “No clue what you’re talking about.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good,” Agatha said, because that was the sort of thing a composed adult said when her girlfriend was sitting at the bottom of the bleachers actively conspiring against her sanity. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had stopped pretending to listen to John and Yelena entirely, turned halfway in her seat, tongue in her cheek, watching Agatha like she already knew exactly what was happening in her head.</p><p> </p><p>It was the look she always got followed by Rio saying something outrageous- typically like <em>“you want me to put a baby in you so bad,”</em> delivered with the confidence of someone who’d never once considered the emotional consequences of her own mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and mouthed, <em>Don’t. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio only smiled wider, clasped her hands like she was praying, closed her eyes, and- shaking her hands with desperation, mouthed, <em>“Please, let me put a baby in you.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha was already ripping off her shoe, fully prepared to it hurl at Rio’s face, when a whistled blared, signaling the start of practice, saving them both from public spectacle and probable assault charges.</p><p> </p><p>She sank back onto the bleachers, exhaled slowly, and told herself she was fine. </p><p> </p><p>Totally, completely fine.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Today, Agatha was irritable, and not in any fun, productive way. Nothing had technically gone wrong; if anything, the morning had started exceptionally well. She’d woken to the feeling of Rio’s mouth at her neck, soft and lazy, followed by the progression of kissing, touching, humping, and inevitably, sex.</p><p> </p><p>Morning sex had, somewhat against Agatha’s better judgment, become her favorite kind of sex with Rio. The irony wasn’t lost on her. When she and Rio had first started sleeping together -months and months and what felt like several lifetimes ago- the whole concept had made her vaguely uneasy. There was something too exposed about it, too honest. It left her with nowhere to hide. And Agatha, <em>historically</em>, did not handle that sort of honesty well.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio, as usual, had ruined that preference by existing. Rio’s voice was always rough then, her face unguarded and a little puffy from sleep, her laugh quiet and sincere in a way it never was once the world was awake. And the way she looked at Agatha in the middle of it -like she’d been waiting her whole life to memorize this exact version of her- was just another insultingly perfect detail.</p><p> </p><p>It was, by all accounts, the best possible start to her morning- if Agatha had any authority over such matters. </p><p> </p><p>Now, she sat at her kitchen counter in a white tank top and underwear, camera off, enduring a virtual unit meeting that could have been said in an email.</p><p> </p><p>Across the kitchen, Rio was making an increasingly personal enemy of her espresso machine. Agatha watched her fiddle with buttons, mutter under her breath, and glare at it.</p><p> </p><p>The machine had only ended up in Agatha’s kitchen because well- Agatha had stolen it. An impulsive act of pettiness Agatha had justified on the grounds of Agatha fucking wanted to. Rio, ever trusting and far too in love with Agatha for her own good, hadn’t noticed a thing. Not until the drive to Agatha’s after basketball practice, when the blanket wrapped evidence started clinking around in the trunk.</p><p> </p><p>Every time Rio’s head whipped back toward the noise, Agatha had kept her lips pressed together, staring out the passenger window like a woman with absolutely nothing to hide. By the time they’d pulled into the driveway, the sound had become a full blown percussion, and Agatha was seconds away from bursting into laughter.</p><p> </p><p>Now, watching Rio stand over the same machine- hair a mess, brow furrowed, muttering about something Agatha wouldn’t even pretend to understand. She couldn’t help the smile that was clearly on her face. Rio looked ridiculously domestic: too beautiful, too comfortable in Agatha’s space, too unaware that <em>she </em>was the stolen thing Agatha could never bring herself to give back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha figured this was about the time her day had officially taken a turn for the worse- or, more accurately, her mood had. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s phone sat on the counter beside hers, close enough that the corner of the screen caught her peripheral vision. It pinged with an email- one innocent, unassuming sound. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had never pretended not to be nosy. The subject line might as well have been highlighted in the same neon that was the rec center’s pathetic sign.</p><p> </p><p><b>Lease Renewal - Apartment 69 (Tenant: Rio Vidal)</b></p><p><em>This is a courtesy reminder that your current lease term is set to expire in thirty (30) days. To continue your tenancy, please complete the renewal documentation via your resident portal or contact the leasing office directly.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the words longer than her ability to reason allowed. Her rational mind reminded her that it was just an email. Her irrational mind -how often she tripped over Rio’s shoes, or how much of Rio’s clothes had found their way into <em>her</em> laundry- wanted to throw the phone straight out the fucking window.</p><p> </p><p>Rio cursed softly at the espresso machine, unaware of the fucking existential crisis she’d unintentionally just triggered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her for a long moment, affection rising first, then hurt, and then an anger that covered both.</p><p> </p><p>Because of course Rio -her girlfriend of exactly one week today- had a lease waiting to be renewed.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha -a fully grown, reasonable adult- was unreasonably, spectacularly fucking irritated about it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes drifted to the kitchen window- specifically, to the sill just past where Rio stood, still tinkering with the espresso machine that didn’t belong to Agatha. A neat row of plants lined up along the sill- also not Agatha’s. Not at first. She couldn’t even pinpoint when they’d arrived- only that one morning they existed, and now Agatha watered them as if they’d always been there. It had just… happened. The slow invasion of Rio Vidal, one houseplant and stolen thing at a time.</p><p> </p><p>So really, it wasn’t <em>that</em> insane to think about asking Rio to move in. It would almost be efficient at this point. Except- no. That thought was insane. Completely diabolical. Because even if they were basically living together already, that didn’t mean they should make it official. And even if they did, it implied something Agatha hadn’t fully allowed herself to consider: that Rio would <em>want</em> to move in <em>with Agatha.</em> Into <em>Agatha’s </em>house. Into <em>Agatha’s</em> world.</p><p> </p><p>That would mean Rio giving up her own place- the apartment Rio had built piece by piece until it finally felt like a home she felt settled in. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha loved Rio’s apartment. Loved the smell that lingered in the walls, the sound of her record player, the way every surface looked touched by Rio’s hands. It was Rio’s in every sense, and maybe that was the point. Rio had made her own corner of the world, and Agatha was sitting here trying to absorb it into hers like some sort of emotional tax.</p><p> </p><p>She snapped her laptop shut with a violent slap that felt more satisfying than it should have. It wasn’t a solution, but it was something to hit- and at the moment, that counted as progress.</p><p> </p><p>“Everything okay over there?” Rio asked without looking over, finally shoving the portafilter into the espresso machine. </p><p> </p><p>“Peachy!” Agatha replied, her voice a few decibels too bright to be believable. “Need a cigarette.” She didn’t wait for a response. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, Agatha grabbed Rio’s pack of American Spirits off the counter, along with the purple Zippo that, at this point, belonged more to Rio than it ever had to herself.</p><p> </p><p>Passing the couch on her way to the back door, Agatha snagged Rio’s hoodie- a soft dark green one Rio had either left or Agatha had stolen. She couldn’t remember anymore. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled the hoodie over her head, marched down the hall, and went to wrench open the back door- only for her foot to collide with something solid. Pain shot through her toes as she stumbled forward, catching herself against the door with one hand.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha barked. She twisted awkwardly, still clutching the cigarettes and lighter, and looked down.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s black Converse.</p><p> </p><p>Of course. At Rio’s apartment, Rio’s shoes were always lined up in perfect rows. But here? They spawned in front of every single exit of her house. The front door. The back door. The goddamn garage. Always one shoe, never a pair.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it for a long moment, breath catching in her throat. It was silly, really- how something so small could feel like a message. Like Rio was leaving reminders scattered through her house that said <em>I was here.</em> Or worse, <em>Don’t forget me when you go.</em> </p><p> </p><p>It made Agatha feel violently fucking ill. </p><p> </p><p>She exhaled hard, made a sound between a growl and a sigh, and kicked the shoe aside just to prove a point she couldn’t quite articulate. And if Agatha stayed still for another second, she’d start crying or yelling or both, and neither option felt reasonable.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha swallowed it down, yanked the back door open, and slammed it behind her hard enough to feel the vibration run up her arm.</p><p> </p><p>The air was colder than she expected, biting at her bare legs. Early fall in New Jersey- too warm for frost, too cold to be outside in underwear, not that that stopped her. The boards beneath her feet were rough and chilled, and every step sent another shiver up her spine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bent into the flame, the heat brushing her fingers as she lit a cigarette. “Un-fucking-believable,” she muttered, dragging on it. The smoke hit her lungs too hot, too harsh, but she didn’t stop. She exhaled through her teeth, furious at the air, at the sky, at the fucking concept of thirty days.</p><p> </p><p>She tossed the lighter onto the table. The cigarette burned low between her fingers, each drag harsher than the last- smoke scraping her throat, stinging her eyes, doing absolutely nothing to calm her. Her hand found the back of the patio chair,  cigarette still between her fingers, knuckles whitening as she tried to breathe through it. One breath. Two- </p><p> </p><p>“THIRTY DAYS!” Agatha screamed, voice cracking as she ripped the chair off the ground and <em>launched</em> it. It skidded across the patio with a violent, echoing crash.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!” She pressed the heels of her hands into her eyes, cigarette still clutched between her fingers, the embers flaring dangerously close to her skin.</p><p> </p><p>After a moment, she dropped her hands and glared at the patio chair. “Courtesy reminder, my ass,” she snapped to no one, flicking ash at the fallen chair. “You’re fine, Agatha,” she muttered. “Totally. Completely.” She shoved the cigarette back between her lips. “Fucking fine.”</p><p> </p><p>She crouched, grabbing the bent leg of the chair, metal scraping against the wood as she hauled it upright again. It wobbled, uneven, like it was mocking her, and she gave it a hard shove back into place anyway. Then Agatha stubbed the cigarette out in the ashtray, grinding it down until nothing but ash and filter left. After that was finished, Agatha straightened, smoothed her hair with a shaky hand, and turned back toward the house.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stormed through the backdoor and immediately tripped over Rio’s fucking shoe- <em>again</em>. This time without breaking stride, she went straight to the front door. She yanked it open, stomped down the porch steps, and crossed the sidewalk. </p><p> </p><p>The rolled-up <em>Westview Weekly</em> newspaper sat at the edge of her yard, wrapped in its usual plastic sleeve. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snatched it up, shaking it for good measure. “They need to change the fucking name of this goddamn newspaper,” she muttered. She turned on her heel, marched back inside, and slammed the door behind her. </p><p> </p><p>She stood in the entryway for one long, furious breath, trying to find her composure and coming up empty. Then she went straight back into the kitchen, didn’t look at Rio, and dropped into the barstool again. </p><p> </p><p>The still bagged newspaper hit the counter with a wet slap. Agatha shoved her laptop a few inches across the counter. When she looked up, Rio was still exactly where she’d left her but now she was leaning against the counter,  watching her with a look that wasn’t quite concern but close enough to piss Agatha off anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t seem peachy,” Rio said, and there wasn’t any judgment in it, just observation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stilled, her hand tightening around the plastic of the newspaper. “No?” she asked, voice flat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth tightened. “Considering the assault on the patio chair, I’m going to take a wild guess and say no. But maybe I’m reading it wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her chin, one finger raised in threat. “You <em>are</em> reading it wrong. I’m fine. Fantastic. Mentally stable, emotionally thriving.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, even nodded. Her gaze flicked down to the newspaper, then back up again. “Yeah. Totally. Though maybe hold off on the crossword.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?”</p><p> </p><p>“Because you love the crossword,” Rio said. “And right now, you seem a bit homicidal,” she shrugged, “Maybe just give it an hour.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and pulled the newspaper toward her. “No, I don’t think I will.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Agatha,” Rio said, unbothered. She turned away, reaching for the mug on the counter before she crossed the kitchen and set it down in front of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Rio opened a drawer to her right, pulled out a pen, and held it out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snatched it from her. “Thank you,” she bit, slamming it down on the counter. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re very welcome, my love.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze. For a second, she almost felt bad about the general shittiness of her mood, then she remembered the lease renewal sitting in Rio’s inbox, unsigned and waiting, and her sympathy went out the fucking window.</p><p> </p><p>Rio still hadn’t mentioned the email to Agatha. Therefore, Rio must hate Agatha. Simple math.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ripped the plastic sleeve open. When she looked up, Rio was still standing there, just watching her.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re being weird,” Agatha said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned forward, elbows braced on the counter like she was settling in. “Am I?” she asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha snapped, glaring at her. “And you’re terrible at hiding it.”</p><p> </p><p>“So are you.” Rio tilted her head, studying her. “Want to tell me what that crash out on the patio was about?” </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t,” Agatha said, snapping the paper open with a crisp flick and flattened it against the counter with her palms. “But thank you for your concern.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t respond but Agatha could feel her eyes on her while she flipped through the paper. “Something you want to tell me?” Agatha asked without looking up.</p><p> </p><p>“Not really.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed out a breath and turned another page. When she reached the crossword section, she stopped, brow furrowing. She looked up from the paper, catching the hint of a smirk that had no business existing. “Why are you still staring at me?” she asked, taking the pen from Rio was holding out to her again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look away. “You’re very pretty.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt a smile tug at her mouth before she could think better of it. For one brief second, she forgot what she was so worked up about. </p><p> </p><p>She cleared her throat, glanced back at the crossword. The first clue blurred in front of her, words refusing to arrange themselves into anything legible while those brown eyes kept searing into her face.</p><p> </p><p> Agatha read it again. And again. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you mind?” Agatha snapped, flicking her gaze up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio only smiled, huffed a laugh as she shook her head. The gap between her teeth flashed before her tongue swept over her lips, hiding it again, and Agatha had the sudden, irrational urge to throw the pen at Rio for such crimes.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you hungry?” Rio asked, voice honey sweet. “Let me make you breakfast.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could only stare at her. Rio’s tongue pressed into her cheek again, eyes locked on hers like they were in some kind of fucking staring contest.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio broke it with a lazy slap against the counter, straightening. “I’ll make you breakfast,” she said, already turning away, hands busying themselves with drawers and cupboards.</p><p> </p><p>Only then did Agatha turn back to the crossword, feigning focus while her mind tripped over her girlfriend’s inexplicable behavior and that goddamned email she still hadn’t mentioned to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>By the time Agatha was nearly done with the crossword, the kitchen had settled into something nearly bearable. Breakfast helped. They’d ended up sharing it off the same plate, which now sat pushed to the side. Rio was next to her on the barstool, turned slightly so she was facing Agatha, elbow propped on the counter. One knee was pressed into  the side of Agatha’s thigh, the other tucked beneath her. She hadn’t said anything in awhile, wasn’t even pretending to be helpful. Her eyes were fixed on Agatha like she was the only thing worth looking at.</p><p> </p><p>The hand Agatha had resting on Rio’s bare thigh went still, her thumb halting as she read the second to last clue.</p><p> </p><p><em>Form a complete question by writing the following answers in order.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowned, reread it twice. It was oddly theatrical for a crossword puzzle. She tracked down each word, one by one, filling them into a blank space below the grid. The longer she wrote, the faster her heart went, thudding unevenly in her chest like it knew something she didn’t want to let herself admit yet. By the time she got to the last one -a fucking dash- she realized she’d been holding her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand stayed exactly where it was on Rio’s thigh. If anything, her grip had tightened, nails digging into skin to make a point. She refused to look at her girlfriend, refused to think, refused to acknowledge the heat creeping up her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally forced herself to look at the very last clue.</p><p> </p><p><em>55-Down: first initial of the crossword’s author</em></p><p> </p><p>Slowly, Agatha dragged her gaze to the bottom corner of the grid, where the byline was printed.</p><p> </p><p>   <em><strong>R. Vidal</strong></em></p><p> </p><p>And Agatha just sat there, staring at the question spelled out in her own handwriting. Her pen clattered onto the counter as she blinked at it.</p><p> </p><p><em>Is it too soon to ask you if you want to live together? -R </em></p><p> </p><p>Without a word, Agatha leaned forward, her elbow hitting the counter as her hand dragged down her face and landed on her mouth. She stared at the page, shaking her head in disbelief, a quiet, broken laugh slipping from her mouth before she could stop it.</p><p> </p><p>The sheer audacity of it -of <em>Rio</em>- would’ve been funny if it didn’t make Agatha suddenly want to cry.</p><p> </p><p>She turned her head, eyes finding Rio beside her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio scrunched her nose, like she might be a little embarrassed. Her fingers found Agatha’s hand that still rested on her thigh, fidgeting with them as she spoke. “My lease is up soon,” she said softly. “Didn’t really plan for you to find that information out via my email. Or your, uh… spirited reaction to it.” Her lips pulled inward, a nervous huff leaving her nose. Her other hand picked at the corner of the newspaper before she glanced back at Agatha. “I meant it to be sweet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked back down at the crossword, still fucking stunned- and doing her best not to think about the part where she’d launched a patio chair over an email reminding Rio to renew her lease.</p><p> </p><p>“How did you even-”</p><p> </p><p>“Lil knows the guy who does them every month,” Rio cut in. “The issue was already printed, but he agreed to make me a single copy with this crossword in it. Probably because he’s in love with my mother, which genuinely makes me nauseous but worked out in my favor,” she shrugged, “Then I roped Sage into picking it up and swapping it out before we woke up.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gawked at her. “You did all that- for this?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio only shrugged, small and sheepish. “You love the crossword.”</p><p> </p><p>“But you love your apartment-”</p><p> </p><p>“I love <em>you</em>,” Rio said, cutting Agatha off softly. “The rest is just where I put my shoes.”</p><p> </p><p>First, Agatha’s brain tried to do what it always did- intervene, rationalize, build a case against her own happiness. Maybe if she were a better person, she’d argue. She’d remind Rio of everything she’d built, how hard she’d fought to make that apartment hers, how unfair it was to give up something so carefully crafted. But the truth was, Agatha had waited a long fucking time for this- for Rio. <em>Only Rio. </em>And she wasn’t about to logic Rio -or herself, for that matter- out of it.</p><p> </p><p>Then her body caught up- slowly, as if trying to process every syllable Rio had given her. Her breath stuttered out, gasped and shaky, like laughter that had lost its way. Her heart did what it always did- answered to Rio like it had no say in the matter. And if it were possible to reach in, to pull the thing out and hand it over, Agatha would’ve. Because somewhere along the way, it had stopped belonging to Agatha anyway. </p><p> </p><p>But instead of emptying herself into words -because if she started, it would turn into a dissertation on everything she’d never learned how to say- Agatha chose the mercy of brevity.</p><p> </p><p>“The rest is just where you put your shoes, huh?” she said softly. She exhaled through her nose, trying to steady herself before she did something stupid, like cry. “That why they’re always scattered across my floor?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile broke first- gap showing, infuriating, perfect, always leaving Agatha with the humiliating urge to roll onto her back and show her belly like a pathetic animal. Whatever. She didn’t want to think too hard about it.  </p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” Rio said, tongue dragging across her lower lip before she leaned in, voice dropping to a whisper, conspiratorial. “Or maybe my timing’s always been shit, and you’ve got fast feet. If you’re tripping over something, it’s buying me a few extra seconds.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brows rose, fingers tightening on Rio’s thigh as she leaned in, close enough that her words brushed against Rio’s lips. “You think I’m gonna run again, Vidal?” she asked quietly, eyes flicking to Rio’s mouth and back. </p><p> </p><p>“No, I know you’re not,” Rio said, her smirk slipping into something sweeter. Her eyes flicked down to Agatha’s mouth before. “I just like keeping the odds stacked in my favor.”</p><p> </p><p>“And how’s that working out for you?” Agatha murmured, eyes fully fixed on Rio’s mouth now.</p><p> </p><p>“Ask me again in a minute,” Rio said, and leaned in.</p><p> </p><p>There was nothing careful about the way Rio kissed her. And Agatha didn’t hesitate- didn’t feign composure or pretend this was anything less than everything she’d wanted. She met Rio halfway, lips already parted in invitation. The first brush was soft, tasting of coffee, before Rio deepened it- tilting her head, pressing in until Agatha felt the edge of the counter pressing into her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand moved to settle at the side of her neck, thumb tracing the edge of her jaw, coaxing her closer until Agatha melted against her. Agatha’s hand slid up, fingers curling around Rio’s wrist to feel Rio’s pulse beneath her touch.</p><p> </p><p>Her tongue traced the backs of Agatha’s teeth, the roof of her mouth, the tender insides of her cheeks. And when Agatha offered her own tongue, jaw fully slackened, pliant- Rio focused all of her attention on it. She lapped at it in firm, devastating strokes. It wasn’t teasing. It wasn’t passive. It was <em>thorough. </em></p><p> </p><p>The whimper that escaped Agatha was caught and swallowed the moment it left her mouth. The ache gathering in Agatha’s lungs demanded a pause. She pulled back to breathe, lips still parted, her forehead brushing Rio’s as they hovered there.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was flushed, chest rising and falling in the same rhythm as Agatha’s. Her lips were swollen from all their work but still fighting to curl into a smile. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to speak, but Rio beat her to it.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you so much,” Rio said, like the words were a weight she needed Agatha to feel.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t entirely sure she’d managed to say it first since the night they’d first told each other. A mildly inconvenient pattern, given that Agatha didn’t like losing at anything. Not that it was a competition. She knew that. Rio wasn’t competing, she simply couldn’t help herself- it demanded air, insisted on being said. And Agatha couldn’t exactly fault her for that. She loved hearing it. Loved saying it. Loved the permanence of it- regardless of who got there first.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed. “I love you too.”</p><p> </p><p>Probably more. Definitely more. Though she knew Rio would never concede that, and Agatha had no real desire to win.</p><p> </p><p>“You never answered my question,” Rio said quietly, tucking a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>“Is it too soon?” Agatha asked, breathless, as Rio leaned in to steal another kiss.</p><p> </p><p>A kiss that existed for no reason other than the fact that it could.</p><p> </p><p>She felt Rio smile against her lips, felt the hum of Rio’s answer vibrate against both their mouths. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally drew back, Agatha caught herself smiling too, lips still warm, watching Rio’s shoulders relax like she’d just done something as simple as breathing.</p><p> </p><p>“Probably,” Agatha finished, still a little dazed, though the reason wasn’t exactly a mystery. It was just Rio existing in Agatha’s immediate vicinity.<em> Always Rio.</em> The beginning, the middle, the problem, the answer. Every possible reason began and ended there. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brows lifted as she leaned back in her chair, lips twitching. “Okay, word,” she said, already reaching for her phone. “So I’ll just go ahead and open that email and-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was up before Rio could finish, reaching across the counter. Rio’s hand was already on her phone, so Agatha’s fingers closed around both. She had the advantage now, standing over her, and she didn’t waste it. Her grip tightened to emphasize her point.</p><p> </p><p>“You will not,” Agatha warned, eyes locked on brown.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so hot when you threaten me,” Rio said, looking up at her, not bothering to move her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared down at her, unimpressed. “You’re an idiot.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched Rio poke her tongue into her cheek, and her stomach sank. It was the prelude to something stupid- something that would either piss Agatha off or steal the breath from her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>“An idiot who’s already halfway moved in- really, this is just a formality.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply. She released Rio’s hand only to catch her chin instead, tilting her head back until Rio was forced to look up at her. Her fingers pressed hard into the soft give of Rio’s cheek- a reminder that Rio only got away with this because Agatha let her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin only widened, of course. She leaned into the hold, arms looping around Agatha’s waist like she couldn’t help herself.</p><p> </p><p>“You think asking to move in with me is a joke?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p> “No,” Rio said, eyes bright. “I think it’s overdue.”</p><p> </p><p>Good to know Agatha wasn’t the only one who thought that. </p><p> </p><p>She hummed, thumb dragging over the corner of Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Predictably, the grin fell. Rio’s hands faltered at the hem of her hoodie and the tank top beneath it, fingers twitching like she didn’t know what to do with them now that Agatha was looking at her like that.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned down until her breath brushed Rio’s lips. From this close she could see the moment Rio’s pupils dilated, her mouth part.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re pathetic,” Agatha whispered, and let go of her chin.</p><p> </p><p>“Only where you’re concerned.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t argue; she never would when Rio said things like that. She only caught the hem of Rio’s shirt and gave it a small tug. Rio lifted her arms without question, and Agatha pulled the fabric over her head, leaving her hair a mess. She took a step back to admire her handiwork.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just sat there, bare chested, breathing unevenly, eyes fixed on Agatha like she was waiting for an opinion.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head. She sighed.</p><p> </p><p><em>Boobs.</em></p><p> </p><p>Then she turned on her heel and started toward the living room.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey-” Rio called after her, smiling, already scrambling out of the stool.</p><p> </p><p>“House rules,” Agatha said over her shoulder. “You’re not allowed to wear shirts. I find it improves morale.” </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah? Then I’m adding one.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had just made it into the living room when Rio caught her from behind, hands sliding around her waist and pulling her back flush against Rio’s front.</p><p> </p><p>“If I’m not allowed to wear shirts then you’re not allowed to wear pants. Or underwear. I find it improves <em>my</em> morale,” Rio murmured, her mouth brushing Agatha’s ear. “And also…” Her hand moved lower, cupping Agatha firmly between the thighs; the press of it pulled her further back into Rio’s chest. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped.</p><p> </p><p>“Easy access,” Rio smiled, catching the gold hoop in Agatha’s earlobe between her teeth and giving it a gentle tug.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ground her ass into Rio’s front. Rio’s moan came soft against her ear- predictable, delicious. She smiled and tilted her head, baring her neck. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio didn’t need any more than that. Her mouth was there instantly, hot and open, dragging wet kisses along Agatha’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>“Sounds like you’re lining up a very specific outcome… My asshole, I assume,” Agatha said, her lashes fluttering as Rio dragged her tongue up the length of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand slid down to cover Rio’s, pushing it harder against herself- grinding into the pressure, eager for more. </p><p> </p><p>“Guilty,” Rio murmured, teeth sinking into her neck as she dug the heel of her palm into Agatha’s clit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped out a choked, startled sound. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re sick,” Agatha managed, moving her head until her smile brushed against Rio’s cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“You love it,” Rio breathed against her skin, the words curling hot into the corner of Agatha’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p><em>Yeah</em>- Agatha really fucking did. </p><p> </p><p>She turned her head until their mouths met. The kiss landed crooked -messy, uncoordinated- but Rio caught her lips anyway, smiling into it like she had been expecting the loss of control. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the sound Rio made when she pushed back harder, a quiet, breathless thing that sent heat spiraling low in her belly.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio’s hand was moving, slipping beneath the hem of her hoodie and tank top, dragging up over her stomach. Her fingers spread wide across the warmth of her skin until she cupped Agatha’s breast and squeezed, thumb grazing her nipple.</p><p> </p><p>She trailed open mouthed kisses along Agatha’s cheek, each one wetter, hungrier, until she reached her earlobe and caught it gently between her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha exhaled. Everything else went quiet. Her mind emptied out to make space for it.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me you don’t think about it,” Rio murmured, her breath warm against the shell of Agatha’s ear. Then her hands were gone. </p><p> </p><p>The sob that escaped Agatha was disgraceful, even by her standards. She would’ve mocked herself for it -god knows she would have- if Rio’s hands hadn’t already slipped beneath her sweatshirt. Agatha lifted her arms, offering herself up, and Rio peeled the fabric away in a single, impatient motion. Her tank top immediately followed, leaving her in only her underwear. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s bare chest pressed to Agatha’s back, fever warm, as always.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha squeaked- actually squeaked, to her own horror- the second she felt Rio’s hardened nipples press against her bare back.</p><p> </p><p>An arm wound around her waist, possessive. And Rio’s mouth -always so fucking certain- found its way back to her neck, her jaw, her shoulder. Anywhere she could get a taste, as if she’d been starving and Agatha was the only thing that ever fed her right. Rio’s hands slid up, cupping her breasts again. She squeezed, kneaded, palms full, thumbs teasing until her fingers caught Agatha’s nipples- rolling, tugging, pinching. </p><p> </p><p>Every pulse in Agatha’s body seemed to converge south, her clit throbbed like it was begging for mercy.</p><p> </p><p>“Go on,” Rio murmured, smug enough to make Agatha want to elbow her in the ribs. “Lie to me.”</p><p> </p><p>“If you’re referring to that little fantasy of yours-” Agatha hissed, faltering when Rio’s fingers twisted at her nipple. “-that I’d ever let you inside my asshole,” she managed, ragged.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed against her throat, mouth latched onto the side of her neck. A goddamn hickey, Agatha realized distantly, and still, she tilted her head to give Rio more room.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t flatter yourself,” Agatha bit out, or meant to. The tremor in her voice made it sound perilously close to begging.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally released her neck with a soft, obscene pop. “Okay, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>The sound of her own name in that tone- drawled, knowing. She could hear the smile in Rio’s voice, and it made Agatha want to claw it right off her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunted, because it was either that or moan.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands left her breasts, tracing down her ribs, around the curve of her waist until they settled at her back. Agatha let her own hands fall to her sides, hands clenching and unclenching like she didn’t know what to do with them. She shifted her weight, chin tilted up like she was bored, though her pulse was thrumming against her throat. </p><p> </p><p>Every nerve in her body felt wired and overexposed. Her underwear was soaked, sticking uncomfortably to her skin, and she was panting like an overheated fucking dog. </p><p> </p><p>“You know what?” Agatha managed, voice a little hoarse. “I’ll let you in my ass once you get my name tattooed on yours. Seems like a good trade off, don’t you think?” As she said it, she was already letting Rio guide her forward- bent over the couch, elbows braced against the cushions. Her breath hitched as she shifted to get comfortable.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed. “You talk a lot shit for someone who keeps letting me do whatever I want to you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t start thinking that means anything.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course not,” Rio murmured. Her voice was lazy, distracted. </p><p> </p><p>Even without turning around, Agatha could feel Rio’s gaze tracing her body, patient and hungry. Fingers found the waistband of Agatha’s underwear, ghosting over the curve of her hips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled, mouthing a silent <em>oh my god</em> as her eyes squeezed shut. Her body had other ideas entirely, itching for any kind of friction. She shifted in place, an awkward little twist that was supposed to look like indifference but probably looked exactly like what it was- a woman trying very fucking hard not to hump the furniture.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut. For a long moment, she didn’t trust herself to speak. Her mind scrambled for something scathing, something that would put Rio back in her place- </p><p> </p><p>“Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sank to her knees, fingers catching the waistband of Agatha’s underwear. She didn’t rush it, just eased them down, inch by inch, over the curve of her ass. The fabric clung stubbornly, damp and indecent, before it peeled away. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her fist to her mouth and bit down.</p><p> </p><p>The air changed when the fabric finally slipped down, the last bit of cotton pulling free from where it had clung, soaked. Agatha didn’t have to look to know what Rio saw. She could <em>feel</em> it: how wet- stretching, breaking, dripping.</p><p> </p><p>It would have been humiliating if she weren’t seconds from losing her fucking mind. If her clit weren’t throbbing so violently she could feel it in ears. If she hadn’t long since surrendered the illusion of composure whenever Rio was involved.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made the mistake of imagining it- Rio’s face tilted up, brown eyes gone darker, pupils blown wide. Her mouth parted slightly, lips glistening where she’d licked them, like she was figuring out where to start.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her head might explode. She felt the tug of her underwear slide all the way down her legs until it pooled around her ankles. She stepped out of them carefully.</p><p> </p><p>She heard Rio inhale just before her hands found their way to Agatha’s ass. Agatha bit down hard on her lip, eyes squeezed shut, refusing to make a sound. She would not whimper at the feeling of Rio’s thumbs spreading her ass cheeks open. </p><p> </p><p>It felt more indecent than usual. Rio had always loved looking, had been obsessively enamored with her asshole- but this was different. The way her gaze burned now, fixed on it, made Agatha clench around nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d make an entire day of it, Agatha,” Rio murmured, standing up, her hands settling on Agatha’s hips.</p><p> </p><p>And reasonably, Agatha froze. “An entire day?” she repeated.</p><p> </p><p>The kind of thing Rio said with stupid confidence and absolutely no supporting evidence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, thumbs stroking lazy circles into Agatha’s skin. “Have you ever done anal, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha spits over her shoulder, shooting Rio a wild look. Her face burned- out of anger, she insisted. “Have you?” Angrier.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips pull into a tight smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Who the-”</p><p> </p><p>Whatever Agatha was about to say brakes into a strangled sound as Rio moved one hand from her hip and slid two fingers easily inside her cunt.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha gasped, her hips jolting forward into the couch before instinct drags her back again, pressing herself into Rio’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move. Just held herself there, fingers buried deep inside of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Have you let someone-” Agatha forced out through clenched teeth, not sure which was worse- the way Rio’s fingers stayed perfectly, cruelly still, or the searing need to know if someone else had ever fucked Rio’s asshole. </p><p> </p><p>How fucking humiliating- to feel a spike of irrational jealousy over the thought of someone else ever having been that close to Rio. And for what? Rio had told her she’d stopped letting women fuck her ages ago.</p><p> </p><p>So the thought shouldn’t matter. But it did. Because Agatha’s brain insisted on running comparative theology at the worst possible time. Not that Rio’s a Mormon, but some Mormons think “soaking” doesn’t count as sex. Semantics. Convenient delusion-</p><p> </p><p>“Have I what, Agatha?” Rio asked, pulling her fingers out of Agatha slowly. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha whined, and it doesn’t sound like her at all. It’s disgraceful- too high, too desperate. If she had any composure left, she’d sneer at herself for it. But Rio’s fingers are gone, and the loss -simple as it is- felt fucking brutal.</p><p> </p><p>She sucked in a breath when she felt the warmth, the slickness of her own mess on Rio’s fingers pressing into her hip again.</p><p> </p><p>“If you’ve let anyone-” Agatha started, but her voice cuts off when Rio thrusts forward suddenly, her hips meeting Agatha’s ass with a wet, solid sound that tears the rest of the sentence away from her. Her breath stuttered, eyes squeezing shut.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you asking,” Rio said. “if I’ve ever let someone fuck my ass?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes rolled back when Rio reached around to cup her front and drove her hips forward again. The sound that leaves Agatha is something between a gasp and a sob.</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm?” Rio hummed, prompting her to answer whatever question she’s already forgotten.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha licked her lips, tried to force her eyes open. “Yeah,” she breathed. </p><p> </p><p>She’d really meant to threaten Rio, completely ignoring the fact they hadn’t always been together like this. But at the moment, every inch of her was working against her mouth- fighting not to sound like someone begging for something she swore she didn’t want. </p><p> </p><p>“Would it piss you off if I said I have?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said, small and pathetic. </p><p> </p><p>Her chest tightened, and for one awful second, she thought she might actually cry. Because that’s not fair. Not at all. Rio was <em>hers.</em> Always. And it was frankly fucking devastating that someone else was ever allowed anywhere near Rio’s asshole in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stilled. “I haven’t,” she said quickly. Then, fumbling, “I mean- I haven’t received, but- ”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to know the rest,” Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>She was grateful, truly, that at some point Rio had decided to keep herself off limits to anyone who wasn’t Agatha. As for the rest- well, murder would have to do.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha would simply be strapping up and correcting this particular historical injustice herself- by shoving her own dick so far up Rio’s ass it would come out of her fucking mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“You sure?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head enough to glare at Rio. “Positive. Now, if you’re done emotionally devastating me, do go on about how you plan on destroying my asshole.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grins. “I want you pliant.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head snapped forward before she could stop herself. She can’t look at Rio. Not like that. Not when every nerve in her body already felt tuned to Rio’s hands. She was pathetic enough as it was; there was no sense in embarrassing herself any further.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand moved from cupping her center to sliding around and under, fingers dragging through her folds.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha exhaled.</p><p> </p><p>“We’d start small. Ease you into it until you could take my entire dick.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach tightened. Her head fell forward, forehead sinking into the couch cushion as her lashes fluttered. Of course. Rio was trying to kill her- slowly, beautifully.</p><p> </p><p>“How?” Agatha asked, She wanted the specifics laid out in excruciating detail. </p><p> </p><p>Not because she needed to know -certainly not that- but because Rio was an unrepentant deviant and someone had to keep her from drifting too far into her own imagination.</p><p> </p><p>And if that meant pretending she wasn’t already entirely inside Rio’s fantasy herself- well. Agatha had survived worse forms of self delusion.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s fingers were circling at her entrance like she was testing the limits of Agatha’s sanity. And Agatha, for one, was doing everything in her considerable power not to come.</p><p> </p><p>“I want you to admit that you want it,” Rio said softly. </p><p> </p><p><em>Sweet voice. Dumb request.</em></p><p> </p><p><em>Not fucking happening. </em></p><p> </p><p>“I do,” Agatha heard herself sob.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rewarded her honesty with two fingers, only the tips. Agatha twisted awkwardly against the couch, her breath coming in small bursts.</p><p> </p><p>“Fingers first,” Rio murmured, keeping them still. “See if you like it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mouth?” Agatha, brain completely smooth, meant to ask if Rio would use her mouth too- not just anything that counted as penetration. She wanted <em>all</em> of it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, infuriatingly, understood.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” Rio whispered, curling her fingers just enough to make Agatha’s knees tremble. “Anything you want, my love.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her arm to keep from crying out.</p><p> </p><p>“Would want you stretched and ready for me.” Rio’s voice had gone even softer, distracted. Her hips rolled forward once, catching against Agatha’s ass like she was fighting her own body not to fuck Agatha senseless right there.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio-”</p><p> </p><p>“Would you wear one for me?” Rio gasped. Her other hand slid under, palm flattening against Agatha’s stomach, pressing her in place.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s vision was starting to blur- oxygen deprivation, probably. Or euphoria. Hard to tell the difference when every part of her brain felt fucked senseless by Rio- fingers prying at its wrinkles, working her open until her tongue felt too heavy.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” was all Agatha got out.  </p><p> </p><p><em>Brilliant.</em></p><p> </p><p>“A butt plug,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned- loud, embarrassingly loud. Pathetic, really, given how little Rio was actually giving her.</p><p> </p><p>“Could I-” Rio’s breath hitched as her fingers pushed in, all the way this time, like she couldn’t stop herself. Her hips moved forward, thrusting against Agatha’s ass. “I want to put it in you,” Rio said, pleading now, her hand trembling where it pressed Agatha’s stomach. “Please- let me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brow drew tight, her mouth fell open, the sound leaving her throat unrecognizable. She was nodding, frantic and so ridiculously eager.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s rhythm picked up its pace, hips snapping against Agatha’s ass in a wild, uneven cadence, and the words started spilling out of her mouth like a dam broken.</p><p> </p><p>“You’d wear it for me -fuck- keep it in so I can slide my dick into you the second we get home. Want you so full for me- want you to wear it until you can’t fucking think. I want you to walk around with it, remembering I’m the one who did that to you. You’d feel it when you bend, when you breathe-”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Rio- yes, yes, please- I want- God, do it, please,” Agatha gasped, the words tumbling out of her in a desperate, breathless chant.</p><p> </p><p>The instant Rio drove her thumb against that sensitive strip of skin between Agatha’s ass and her cunt -pressing, grinding- Agatha came apart. The sound that tore from her throat was raw, a gasp that broke into a cry. Her body arched violently, slamming back into Rio’s hips, desperate to keep her there- to feel every pulse, every spasm, every frantic flutter of her cunt around Rio’s fingers as her orgasm tore through her.</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, she could hear Rio’s little, broken grunts, front pressing and grinding hard against the curve of Agatha’s ass.</p><p> </p><p>And when Agatha’s fogged, overstimulated brain finally caught up- finally understood that Rio had come just from fucking her and talking about taking her ass- something in her body misfired. She gasped, choking on a sound as her body seized again, and the release hit the floor in a hot, startling rush.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s answering moan was filthy, and it sent another tremor racing through Agatha until a smaller gush followed.</p><p> </p><p>Then the world seemed to stop. Agatha went utterly still, cunt still pulsing weakly around Rio’s fingers. Her eyes flew open, unfocused, her chest heaving as the full, mortifying horror of what had just happened began to sink in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached back blindly until her fingers found Rio’s wrist, and pulled her hand free. Then Agatha turned, fast, catching Rio by the throat and driving her back until her shoulders hit the wall with a thud. </p><p> </p><p>She told herself she’s pissed off. She <em>should</em> be pissed off. That’s the only emotion that makes sense after something like that- after she’d just made a mess of herself all over the goddamn floor. She should want to bite, to snap, to claw back a little dignity.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio’s hand rose, wrapping around Agatha’s wrist. She tilted her chin up, baring her throat to the pressure like she wanted to feel it deeper. Her eyes were lidded, dazed, chest rising and falling too fast, and there was a shaky smile on her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop staring at her left hand around Rio’s throat- or the one Rio kept around her wrist, slick with the evidence of what Agatha had done. The air between them smelled like Agatha, heady and warm.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand tightened once before she realized how bare it looked there- pale fingers against the tan column of Rio’s throat, unadorned, unclaimed. The thought crossed Agatha’s mind before she could stop it: how much better it would look if-</p><p> </p><p><em>No.</em></p><p> </p><p>Absolutely not. Too much, too soon, and Agatha was still a rational woman, wasn’t she? A reasonable one.</p><p> </p><p>“You drive me fucking insane,” Agatha said instead. She forced her gaze upward, away from her own hand, away the pulse hammering beneath her thumb. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was already staring back at her- eyes dark and glazed, pupils swallowing brown. There was no defense there, no irony- just unfiltered devotion, too open to be anything but sincere. It was disarming. Annoying, really, how easily Rio could look at her like that.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re perfect,” Rio said softly.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could think, her hand left Rio’s throat. The other joined it, sliding up to cradle her face. Rio’s hair was stuck to her temples, damp from sweat, and Agatha brushed it back with shaking fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looped her arms around Agatha’s waist and pulled her close until they’re flush. They both gasped at the contact.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” Agatha said. The words come easily now -too easily, maybe- and she bit down on her tongue before the rest could follow.</p><p> </p><p><em>And I want more. Fuck being reasonable. Let’s just get-</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her chin up, smiling. “I love you more,” she said. </p><p> </p><p>“Doubt it,” Agatha managed, right before Rio’s mouth found hers. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled Rio’s mouth closer, greedy, desperate. Her fingers dug into Rio’s hair, nails scraping against sweat-damp scalp, and she felt Rio’s moan vibrate straight down her spine. </p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t remember the last time something had felt this <em>real.</em></p><p> </p><p>It was stupid, genuinely- how impossible this used to seem. How Agatha had convinced herself that she didn’t get this, that the universe had already decided she’d spend the rest of her life missing someone she wasn’t supposed to have. Seventeen years of wanting it, of pretending she could live without it, and now here she was- tongue-tied, gasping, kissing the one person who’s haunted every thought, every breath, every restless, sleepless corner of her heart for the last two decades. </p><p> </p><p>All Agatha had to do now was survive her own impulses. Not open her mouth and turn a perfect moment into a question that would make Rio look at her differently. </p><p> </p><p><em>Easy, right?</em></p><p> </p><p>“Can I bring up the fact you literally squirted at the <em>idea</em> of anal?”</p><p> </p><p><em>Yeah. Easy.</em></p><p> </p><p>“Shut the fuck up,” Agatha muttered, already kissing her way down Rio’s throat, her chest, lower- until she was on her knees, mouth finding its way home.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s laugh broke off into a moan the second Agatha’s mouth touched her cunt.</p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha is rational to a fault. Extremely level headed. The kind of woman who shouldn’t be thinking about marriage at all -certainly not to her best friend that she’s only just started calling her girlfriend, her girlfriend who hadn’t even moved in yet- especially not while she’s on her knees for her.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The Witches’ Road was crowded tonight, but Agatha spotted Teen immediately at their usual high top, waving her and Jen over. She took the empty seat beside him as he launched into a story she was, frankly, not prepared for.</p><p> </p><p>Something about a boy named Eddie. Or Eddie’s friend. Or Eddie’s friend’s dog- Teen’s storytelling was, as always, optimistic at best. He jumped between topics faster than she could keep up with. Still, Agatha nodded along anyway, trying to look informed instead of overwhelmed by the speed of his delivery.</p><p> </p><p>The sharp clink of glass on the table rescued her from the rest of that conversation. </p><p> </p><p>Jen had returned from the bar, setting her whiskey in front of her without a word.  Agatha grabbed it right away and drank. The burn helped- if nothing else, it bought her a moment to regroup.</p><p> </p><p>Jen hoisted herself onto the stool beside her. “You hear about that RT on day shift who got fired?” she asked. “Apparently he fell asleep in a parent lounger <em>during</em> a bedside surgery.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed into her drink. “Who hasn’t? It’s been the only thing anyone’s talked about since it happened.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Teen cut in. “A <em>bedside surgery</em>? And he <em>napped</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“Insane, right?” Jen said, shaking her head. “Can you imagine?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said automatically; she hadn’t imagined anything except for her own problems all day. Her mind had been miles away since this morning, chewing itself to pieces. And before she could stop herself, she blurted, “Rio’s moving in with me.”</p><p> </p><p>Ever since Rio had asked her, Agatha had been buzzing with the information- restless in a way that made every normal interaction feel slightly psychotic. </p><p> </p><p>At the gym, she’d almost told the kid at the front desk simply because he’d handed her back her membership card and the pause afterward felt like an invitation. At the dentist, she’d nearly tried to spit out a butchered version of it around a piece of plastic clearly designed by a fucking sadist, just because the hygienist had asked her if she had any plans for the weekend. And at the grocery store, she’d come absurdly close to telling a cashier she’d never once spoken to- because the silence between them felt like an opening. </p><p> </p><p>And then the Uber ride with Jen had been its own particular form of torture. She’d swallowed the news down so hard her throat hurt, trying to look normal, reasonable, like a person who wasn’t vibrating out of her skin. Jen had been right there beside her- someone she actually <em>could</em> tell, someone who might look at her and confirm whether this was as insane as it sounded in her head. Because it <em>was</em> insane. Rio had asked her yesterday. They’d only been officially dating for a week. A week. No sane person would move that fast. No sane person would even consider it.</p><p> </p><p>So when the sentence finally exploded out of Agatha, she turned straight to Jen, pulse hammering.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes stayed fixed on Jen’s face, waiting for a reaction, for someone to tell her she’d actually lost her fucking mind. But Jen only arched a brow, the corner of her mouth twitching over the rim of her glass.</p><p> </p><p>As if Agatha hadn’t just dropped a goddamn bomb in her lap.</p><p> </p><p>As if it weren’t Jen’s turn to say something- <em>anything</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“You seem relaxed,” Agatha said, trying not to sound as rude as she suddenly felt like being. “Usually at this point you’re either complaining loudly or freaking out loudly.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m thinking,” Jen shot back.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh!” Agatha feigned surprise. “About what?”</p><p> </p><p>“About why you sound like you’re waiting for me to tell you it’s a terrible idea,” Jen said.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait- hold on.” Teen leaned forward, eyes wide. “Rio’s <em>moving in</em> with you? That’s- wow. Splitting rent in this economy? Genius. I didn’t even know you guys were <em>friends</em> like that!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped her head toward him, fully fucking offended that he’d even put the word <em>friends</em> anywhere near her and Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“You serious?” Jen asked.</p><p> </p><p>Billy’s grin faltered. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha and Rio have been in love for, like, twenty years, dude. It’s kind of their whole thing. How did you miss that?” Jen asked, incredulous. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know! You guys bicker a lot! I mean, sure, I figured there was some unresolved sexual tension there, but I didn’t think you were actually- you know…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was now staring at him completely dumbfounded. Billy, apparently determined to make it worse, added, “I mean, I haven’t seen you at Lilia’s dinners, and we’re friends. That seems like important information that you’d tell a friend!”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re a <em>teenager,</em>” Agatha snapped. “I’m not detailing my sex life to-”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m twenty-three!”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, they’re <em>dating,</em>” Jen cut in, sounding bored. “Congratulations, you’re officially the last to know.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Dating.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha grimaced. </p><p> </p><p>As if that covered even a fraction of it. As if that wasn’t laughably insufficient for what she wanted. She tossed back the rest of her whiskey before her thumb could drift toward her ring finger in a moment of stupid curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>Billy slumped back in his seat, rubbing at his eyebrow like he could physically scrub the embarrassment out of his body. “God. Okay. Yeah. That one’s on me. I’m grabbing another drink. You two want anything?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen said no. Agatha barked a very harsh, “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think it’s a bad idea, by the way,” Jen told Agatha quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha set her glass down with a scoff. “It’s an insane idea. We’re moving at, like, terminal velocity.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen shrugged, unbothered. “Then don’t live together.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you out of your mind,” Agatha asked, baffled. “Why would you even suggest that?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen laughed. “See? You want this. Why are you fishing for reasons not to do it?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha snapped, folding forward onto her elbows and shoving her hands into her hair. </p><p> </p><p>Which was true. In a technical, superficial, doesn’t-touch-the-real-problem way. No one was talking her out of living with Rio. Of course they weren’t. That part was already decided. It was happening. Even if Agatha had to pack every one of Rio’s belongings into boxes and carry them to their… Agatha’s house herself.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t about wanting an out. Agatha just needed someone to look her in the eye and say,<em> ‘Yes, you’re batshit insane.’</em> Because that’s what it felt like. Like her common sense had been slowly dissolving for a week straight- on edge and feral and so stupidly in love she could barely trust her own judgment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had asked Agatha if she wanted to live together. And fine -yes- that should have been enough. Any reasonable person would have called it a day.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha’s heart wanted more of Rio than was reasonable, tugging at her with a force that didn’t match the briefness of their time together as an official couple. Especially strange, considering she’d only just learned to say <em>I love you</em> without feeling like she was peeling off a layer of her own skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dragged her hands over her face. “I just- my brain keeps trying to regulate all of this and it’s losing.”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” Jen pressed. And Agatha heard it, but she kept her gaze fixed anywhere else. She exhaled through her nose and traced the rim of her empty glass.</p><p> </p><p>“It means,” Agatha started slowly, “living together feels like the bare minimum and I hate that it feels like that because it sounds insane, I know it sounds insane, and I’m trying really, <em>really </em>hard not to act like someone who should be restrained for her own safety.” She risked a glance at Jen -defensive, embarrassed even- and immediately looked away again.</p><p> </p><p>Jen let out a soft, almost amused breath. “That’s not insane. It’s… honest. Uncharacteristically honest, for you, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t make me regret opening my mouth.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Jen said, giving Agatha’s arm a brief, comforting squeeze. “Look- you don’t have to say it out loud for me to get the picture. I’m not pushing you.”</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha hadn’t been hanging on the rest of that sentence, she might have pointed out how wildly un-Jen that sounded.</p><p> </p><p>Jen continued, “And I’m going to phrase this in the least inflammatory way I can manage: Rio is not afraid of the pace that’s worrying you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know that,” Agatha snapped, now wanting absolutely nothing to do with this conversation.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s all I’m saying,” Jen said, hands up in a surrender. “You underestimate how far that woman would go for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “She’s obsessed with me,” she said, right as Teen returned and placed her drink in front of her. She thanked him with a tight smile before turning back to Jen, hoping the interruption would kill the conversation.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Jen took one look at her face and scoffed. “Oh, she’s absolutely obsessed. And also, really fucking in love with you. If she caught even a whiff of what you’re dancing around, she’d shit herself from sheer glee.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach lurched at that. “It’s unreasonable,” she muttered, eyes on her drink. “All of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“And?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled. “And I’m stubborn,” she said. “So if someone’s going to say something insane first… it sure as fuck won’t be me.”</p><p> </p><p>Before Jen could say anything even more unhelpful in response to Agatha. Teen piped up- “So what did I miss?” he asked, leaning in with both hands braced on the table like he genuinely expected a debrief.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha and Jen answered in unison.</p><p> </p><p>And right on cue, Yelena walked up- Agatha’s accidental guardian angel these days, always there when the circumstances needed diverting before Agatha set herself on fire.</p><p> </p><p>Billy lit up at the sight of her, practically leaping out of his chair. He met her halfway, threw an arm around her shoulders in a lopsided hug, muttered something excitedly, and guided her toward the table.</p><p> </p><p>In an uncharacteristic display of generosity, he offered her his seat beside Agatha and moved to sit next to Jen.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, aren’t you being charitable,” Agatha said dryly, nodding toward the seat he’d surrendered.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s because I’m secure in our friendship,” Billy announced with a bright smile. Then he leaned toward Yelena. “Quick question- did you know about Agatha and Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>Yelena didn’t blink. “Duh.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy’s smile fell immediately. “Because you’re dating Sage and she told you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Uhhh, no,” Yelena drawled in her thick Russian accent, like Billy was being purposefully dense. “Because I have eyes.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy gasped dramatically and pointed at the chair Yelena was now occupying. “Okay, give me back my chair.”</p><p> </p><p>Yelena widened her eyes in offensively fake innocence. “But you offered it so sweetly.”</p><p> </p><p>He rolled his eyes but didn’t make a move to reclaim the seat- partly because Jen immediately distracted him with a question, mostly because the chair only mattered in his ongoing competition with Sage over who was Agatha’s favorite.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>Not that she’d ever admit it, but she had a soft spot for both of them, annoying as they were.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena looked around with a frown. “Hooligans not here yet? Usually they beat everyone to the bar.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alice is on the way,” Jen offered. </p><p> </p><p>“I assume Dumb and Dumber got distracted by something stupid,” Yelena asked as she peeled off her jacket. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a short, involuntary laugh. “That’s likely.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had gone to brunch with Alice and Sage, then called Agatha afterward to say she and Sage were headed to start packing up her apartment.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had no objections. If anything, she was running out of patience waiting for the rest of it to follow. Because if the majority of Rio’s belongings weren’t packed, loaded, and in Agatha’s house within the next three to five business days, Agatha was going to have some words. The blunt, unforgiving variety.</p><p> </p><p>Jen glanced at her like she could smell the impatience seeping out of her pores. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha ignored it. Her knee was already bouncing under the high top- a constant, useless discharge of building agitation she hadn’t been able to shake all week. She tipped back the last of her whiskey, not feeling so much as a hint of a fucking buzz for her trouble.</p><p> </p><p>Not ten minutes later, Alice walked in- and Agatha nearly gagged when Jen leaned over to kiss her hello. Couldn’t be her. Not again. She was not desperate enough to remarry this soon. She didn’t even know how long she’d been divorced at this point. Who the fuck kept track of that kind of thing anyway?</p><p> </p><p>“Your girlfriend should be on the way,” Alice said, nodding at Agatha. Then she looked at Yelena. “With yours glued to her side.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek and looked away for a moment, if only to avoid having a full blown fit over a word that need not be mentioned again. She dropped her eyes to her bare ring finger, the place she kept pretending wasn’t taunting her. She brushed her thumb along the inside of it once, quick, private, then forced her eyes back to Alice.</p><p> </p><p>“And she couldn’t tell me that herself?” Agatha asked, somehow sounding bored instead of homicidal. A small miracle.</p><p> </p><p>Alice smirked. “She tried. You don’t check your phone. She asked me to mention it when I got here.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh. How fucking considerate.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha leveled Alice with a razor sharp glare and tore her phone out of her back pocket. “A picture of her tits for my trouble?” she asked the disgustingly happy married couple, brows raised.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh… probably not?” Alice said, glancing at Jen for context.</p><p> </p><p>Jen tapped a calming hand against Alice’s cheek- gentle, domestic, fucking repulsive. “I’ll explain later.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and unlocked her phone. One missed call, seven texts. All from Rio. Which wasn’t nearly as alarming as it looked- Rio always texted in clusters when one message could’ve done the job.</p><p> </p><p><em>Rio : i ordered a butt plug.</em></p><p><em>kidding! haha! … unless 👀 ?</em></p><p><em>if you don’t want it up your butt that’s totally fine! no pressure! i have a perfectly good butt. very team player of me!!! </em></p><p><em>i’m extremely open minded about this. in fact- i volunteer!! i volunteer as tribute!</em></p><p><em>do whatever you want to me. you’re so hot.</em></p><p><em>running late. almost done here.</em></p><p><em>see you very soon, sweetheart. i love you.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s face didn’t move. Not a single muscle twitched as she stared at her phone, but everything under her skin lurched violently. Her stomach dropped, her neck flushed hot, and she could feel a prickle of heat flow to the tips of her ears.</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh, she wanted to climb Rio like a fucking tree.</em></p><p> </p><p>Furious about it, obviously. Righteously indignant. The kind of anger that definitely justified shoving -whether it was a butt plug or her own dick- so far up Rio’s ass it’d be threatening to come out of her mouth. And Rio would take it. Happily. She’d go soft and sweet and desperate for Agatha, open in every way a woman could be open, begging with that ridiculous devotion that made Agatha feel ten feet tall and on top of the fucking world. </p><p> </p><p>And then her brain took it a step too far.  </p><p> </p><p>Suddenly Agatha was thinking about Rio’s hands instead of her own.</p><p> </p><p><em>Rio</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Rio easing silicone into her slowly, talking her through every inch in that voice that made Agatha’s brain just a little bit smoother. Agatha walking around this godforsaken bar with a fucking butt plug in her asshole… Placed there by Rio- every shift of Agatha’s hips, every inhale, every fucking heartbeat pulsing in her body nothing but <em>Rio’s</em>. <em>Hers. </em></p><p> </p><p>The force of how desperately Agatha wanted to beg hit her so abruptly it was dizzying.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you feeling okay? You look very red. Like a tomato.”</p><p> </p><p>Yelena’s voice slammed into Agatha at full volume, snapping her back so unexpectedly she jolted in her chair.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat- tried to, anyway. “I’m fi-” Her voice cracked. <em>Humiliating</em>. She tried again. “I’m fine.”</p><p> </p><p>She fired a quick text back to Rio before she could think better of it-</p><p> </p><p><em>Material</em>?</p><p> </p><p>Because she would quite literally set something on fire -definitely herself- before letting anyone put <em>stainless steel</em> anywhere near her asshole under the guise of “multi-hour prep.”</p><p> </p><p>Not that Agatha hadn’t done her own research. She had. The night before, actually. Very angrily, immediately after Rio fell asleep. It was meant to be proof that Agatha was above this sort of nonsense. But she’d gone down the rabbit hole anyway, glaring at her phone, muttering insults at strangers in the comment sections, and scrolling far longer than she could defend- especially once she started imagining it.</p><p> </p><p>“Everything okay with Rio?” Jen asked carefully.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s fine!” Agatha barked, far too quickly. “Everything is fine! She’s just a very mentally unwell woman-” She tugged at the collar of her shirt because it felt like she was sitting directly under a heat lamp in this dingy fucking bar.</p><p> </p><p>“A match made in heaven,” Alice chirped just as Jen leaned in, eyes going wide.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Jen breathed, looking at Agatha like she was <em>weirdly proud</em>. “She sexted you-”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said immediately, cutting her off. “Absolutely not. She- she was being inappropriate. As usual. She’s disgusting.”</p><p> </p><p>“And you <em>love </em>it,” Jen said.</p><p> </p><p>“I tolerate it,” Agatha corrected. “With grace. Like a fucking saint.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed a fucking drink. And her fucking girlfriend.</p><p> </p><p>Her girlfriend, who she’d kissed for the first time in the filthy alley next to this very bar. The same woman who literally just had Agatha thinking about anal toys going exactly where anal toys go. The same woman who, months ago -when they weren’t even technically <em>together</em>- had said, <em>“I would’ve married you yesterday if I’d known you’d let me.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Which, frankly, begged the question: who the fuck was stopping Rio? Certainly not Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Not that any of it mattered. None of it mattered- until right now, when Agatha glanced toward the door and saw Rio -<em>her girlfriend</em>- finally making her grand fucking entrance.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio looked… well, like Rio. She looked hot -obnoxiously, effortlessly hot- and Agatha had no desire to dwell on it. In fact, the second her gaze met Rio’s beaming, toothy, unbearably smug smile, Agatha’s eyes darted toward the bar at rainbow fairy lights strung across the ceiling instead.</p><p> </p><p>Time to put on the performance of her fucking life.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could do this. She could sit here like a rational woman, spine straight and smile fixed, while reason itself packed its bags and fled the moment Rio walked in.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was already at the table. Told Yelena her sister was at the bar, a high-five for Alice, something clever tossed at Jen that made her laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, voice soft but far too close, and Agatha’s nose was instantly assaulted by her perfume. Addictive. She could’ve snorted it straight and still not gotten enough.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head, forced a tight smile. “Sup.”</p><p> </p><p>The second it left Agatha’s mouth, she wanted to die.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena slid down a seat to make room, and Rio took the one beside Agatha. As she sat, she adjusted- fingers pulling the lapel of her black jean jacket open before she leaned back in her chair, settling in like she owned the fucking place.</p><p> </p><p>Brown eyes found Agatha’s and stayed there. “Silicone,” Rio said, but she didn’t look away until Agatha had no choice but to hear her. Then she was looking toward Jen and Alice, pretending to be fascinated by their conversation. </p><p> </p><p>“Help me!” Sage shouted over the noise, approaching with two beers in one hand and a whiskey in the other. Agatha didn’t have to wonder who the whiskey was for. That had Rio written all over it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was already turned in her seat before Sage even reached them, plucking the whiskey straight from her hand. “I’ve got it,” she said, offering the glass to Agatha with that small, smug smile, then reaching for her beer as Sage made her escape toward Yelena and Billy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha accepted the glass, locking eyes with Rio. Rio’s fingers lingered during the hand off- of course they did. She set the glass down, blue never leaving brown.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of their friends were busy with Nat’s arrival. Agatha didn’t care. All she could see was Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in slightly, a knowing smirk on her mouth that made Agatha’s pulse tick slightly faster. Her fingers started that impatient drumming against the table the way they always did when she was restless for Agatha’s attention. It was usually the prelude to something idiotic, or hot, or both in the exact proportion that made Agatha want to strangle her. And then, right on cue, Rio opened her stupid, beautiful mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re flushed,” Rio said. “What were you thinking about?” Her gaze dropped to Agatha’s mouth before dragging back up to blue. Then she tilted her chin up slightly, the way she did when she already knew the answer and wanted to watch Agatha try to lie anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dug her thumbnail into the side of her ring finger, tongue pressing against her cheek as she looked away trying to buy herself a second to come up with something that wasn’t the truth. When she looked back, Rio was biting her lip, eyes bright, practically vibrating in her seat like she could will the words out of Agatha’s mouth by force of sheer enthusiasm.</p><p> </p><p>“I was thinking,” Agatha said slowly, each word measured within an inch of its life, “that if you don’t behave yourself, you’ll be scheduling an appointment with a proctologist very soon.” The smile she gave Rio wasn’t sweet. She tilted her head, scrunched her nose in excitement, as if to say <em>doesn’t that sound delightful</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio clearly hadn’t been expecting it. Her gaze dropped fast, chin tipping toward her chest as a laugh slipped out. She ran her tongue over her bottom lip, like she was trying to tame the smile threatening to give her away.</p><p> </p><p>“Totally worth it,” Rio said easily. “You’d go with me anyway. Hold my hand through the whole thing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Pity’s a powerful motivator,” Agatha shot back, lifting her glass. The whiskey burned going down. </p><p> </p><p>Not nearly enough.</p><p> </p><p>“Guess I better start stretching now, huh?” Rio murmured, as her eyes fell to Agatha’s mouth again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flew wide, burning a hole straight through Rio’s stupidly perfect face. Her fingers tightened around her glass, knuckles white. She exhaled slowly, trying not to make a sound at the sight of Rio practically drooling over her.</p><p> </p><p>Somewhere down the table, Teen shouted, “Are you two flirting or fighting?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha and Rio said at the same time without looking away from each other, which earned a chorus of groans and laughter from their friends. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha ignored Rio’s prior comment entirely. “Why were you late?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, a little breathless, teeth flashing with a beaming smile. “You didn’t hear? I’m moving in with the love of my life. Spent all day trying to pack my shit. Big step, huh?”</p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck it.</em></p><p> </p><p>“Jen!” Agatha barked, already out of her chair. Her hand shot out, fisting the lapel of Rio’s denim jacket, and she yanked her out of her seat.</p><p> </p><p>“Fifteen minutes, perverts!” Jen called after them like it was standard protocol.</p><p> </p><p>And it was. That was the beauty of their friendship. It had bred efficiency. Someone would start a timer, assign a designated door-banger, and make sure the rest of the evening wasn’t completely derailed by two idiots who had no concept of shame.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look back. She tore through the crowd with purpose, one hand hooked tight in the collar of Rio’s jacket, until -by some absurd stroke of luck- the bathroom door came into view, unlocked and waiting like it had been expecting them.</p><p> </p><p>The door had barely clicked shut before Agatha was on her. She drove Rio back hard, the impact echoing through the small bathroom as Rio’s spine met the door with a loud thud, causing her to grunt against Agatha’s mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth opened, and Agatha didn’t wait- she tore into it, tongue and teeth. Every sound Rio made, she took, swallowed, devoured to keep for herself. She barely registered the lock clicking before Rio’s hands were on her, and they were stumbling back into the opposite wall with a force that nearly sent them both crashing into the trash can.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands clawed up into Rio’s hair, dragging her mouth closer, greedy for more- <em>always more</em>. The baseball cap Rio had been wearing was gone. Agatha didn’t waste another thought on it. She was too busy testing how far her tongue could reasonably go before Rio was gagging on it.</p><p> </p><p>She pushed against Rio, slamming her into a wall- maybe the door again, maybe a different wall; at this point, spatial awareness wasn’t something Agatha was very concerned about. Her tongue was still in Rio’s mouth, lapping at her molars when she hooked her foot between Rio’s legs and kicked, urging Rio to spread them. </p><p> </p><p>Rio, ever obedient, moved instantly. Agatha slid her thigh between her legs, pressing up hard. The sound Rio poured into her mouth was loud, obscene, and harsh enough for Agatha to feel it vibrate against her own teeth. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tore her mouth from Rio’s, desperate to hear it again- unmuffled this time, unfiltered by her own mouth. One hand stayed tangled in Rio’s hair, the other dropped to her shoulder, pressing down hard, urging Rio to move. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio started to grind down against her thigh, Agatha was grateful. She couldn’t speak; she could barely breathe. Her eyes were locked on the place where her thigh met Rio’s denim covered cunt.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t moan the way Agatha wanted her to. She just breathed- ragged, uneven breaths that came hot against Agatha’s face. </p><p> </p><p>The silence was pissing Agatha off. Rio’s jeans were pissing her off. The lack of Rio’s usual frantic babbling was <em>really</em> pissing her off. Everything about the situation -the layers, the fact Agatha’s fingers weren’t actively inside of Rio- felt like one long, deliberate insult.</p><p> </p><p>“How fast do you think you can come?” Agatha rasped. She looked up, ready to see Rio wrecked, ready to gloat, but then promptly forgot what air was.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face was flushed to the point of delirium, her chest heaving like she’d run a marathon. Her mouth was raw and swollen from the insistence of Agatha’s mouth. Her eyes were heavy, glassy, completely fixed on Agatha- like she couldn’t look anywhere else even if she tried.</p><p> </p><p>“The second you tell me to,” Rio breathed, still chasing her breath. “I love you,” she added in the same exhale. It came out sweet and warm, carrying the smallest break, and it felt almost like a cry.</p><p> </p><p>That was new, Agatha thought. Certainly not the words themselves, but the sound of them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had memorized every <em>I love you</em> Rio had ever given her so far. Every pitch, every texture, every tiny inflection Rio gave those three syllables.</p><p> </p><p>The soft, drowsy hum of <em>I love you</em> that came right before sleep took them. The scratchy <em>I love you </em>in the morning that followed, when Rio’s voice was still gravel and honey. The trembling <em>I love you</em> that caught on the second word like it was still learning to be said out loud. The quiet <em>I love you</em> that followed, spoken again for no reason except that it finally had somewhere safe it could live.</p><p> </p><p>Every time, it sounded a little different. Seventeen years of imagining it hadn’t prepared her for the noise of it- for how it invaded her ears and spread through her limbs, rearranging her insides, her heart shifting to catch each one. </p><p> </p><p>Her body already knew; her left hand pressed into Rio’s shoulder, ring finger twitching like it was trying to hold onto the sound of forever.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you more,” Agatha said, easily. It wasn’t thoughtless, just something her heart had finally taught her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>She suspected it would always feel that way now, words and feeling fused so tightly that it would surely outlive her body.</p><p> </p><p>“Not likely,” Rio whispered, trying to sound teasing- but she could tell Rio had noticed the sudden change in Agatha’s demeanor.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha looked anything like she felt, it was probably like a woman seconds away from heaving her heart up and out of her throat and into Rio’s waiting hands. </p><p> </p><p>Not exactly an unfamiliar sensation for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>She could’ve argued. She should’ve argued. But the realization hit her- <em>here, of all places</em>. A grimy bar where they’d had their first kiss outside. In a bathroom that smelled like piss and spilled bleach. Rio’s hands shoved down the back of her jeans, gripping her ass checks <em>over </em>her underwear (deeply lame). Only minutes ago, Agatha had wanted to see how fast Rio could come from nothing but the grind of her palm against denim. </p><p> </p><p>All because Rio had rage baited her with the idea of a butt plug that had Agatha seeing red over how badly she wanted it- wanted to feel it nestled inside of her as proof of how far she’d fallen, how she’d stepped into that fall with her eyes open, unafraid to let Rio see her stripped of respect and standing there anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Leave it to Agatha to feel like this now- at what was, objectively, the worst possible time, and somehow, in an even worse place.</p><p> </p><p>Leave it to Agatha to stand on the precipice of saying something that would make Rio look at her differently. Something unreasonable, in an already catastrophically unreasonable place. Because of course it wouldn’t happen anywhere else in the world that might’ve made slightly more sense.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha didn’t say what she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>Not that silence was new to Agatha. She’d had seventeen years of practice- of biting her tongue until it bled, of swallowing words that had clawed their way up her throat with bloody nails. You’d think it would stop hurting after that long. It didn’t. Or maybe it just hurt differently now- because the words were no longer unsaid out of fear, but fucking <em>reason</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes began to sting anyway. Not from sadness, exactly, but from the pure frustration of it all. Of standing in a bathroom that smelled more like piss than it did bleach. Of knowing she was one wrong word away from throwing a fucking fit. Of realizing that the universe really did have an unrivaled sense of humor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel her mouth starting to twist- petulant, childish, as if she were being told “no” again by something cosmic and cruel. She huffed out a pitiful breath.</p><p> </p><p>It’s fine. She’d blame it on being drunk.</p><p> </p><p>Too bad she wasn’t. Maybe she could pass for tipsy, given how absurdly weepy she suddenly felt.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, it’s okay. What’s-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice came soft, hesitant. She’d started to pull her hands from the inside of Agatha’s jeans, froze halfway through, then slipped them around her waist instead. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha understood the pause- Rio’s first instinct had been to touch her face, to cradle her cheeks, but she’d stopped herself, always so thoughtful, so careful about not putting dirty hands on Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>And somehow that gentleness, that goddamn consideration, made Agatha’s throat tighten- akin to swallowing a rock.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s wrong?” Rio murmured, fingers curling into the back of her shirt.</p><p> </p><p>A tear fell before Agatha could stop it. She hated that it did. Hated that even now, even through her blurred vision, she could see the crease form in between Rio’s eyebrows when she worried. Hated that it was so stupidly endearing. Hated that if she had been even a little braver, she would’ve married Rio yesterday.</p><p> </p><p>“Did I do something wrong?” Rio asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said, shaking her head, willing her eyes not to blink to keep more tears from falling. “It just smells like <em>fucking </em>piss in here.”</p><p> </p><p>Technically not a lie, which was the best she could offer at the moment.</p><p> </p><p>“We can leave, if you want,” Rio said softly. Her voice was careful, worried, her eyes flicking toward the sink.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t care if Rio thought her hands were dirty. She wanted them. Needed them. She reached for Rio’s wrists, tugged her arms upward, and placed them firmly against her own face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze for half a second, then softened, her thumbs brushing along Agatha’s cheeks catching what tears they could. Rio cradled her face with such tenderness that Agatha let out a shaky exhale- and kept her fingers tight around Rio’s wrists, pressing into the skin in search of Rio’s pulse.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s shirt did not accommodate Agatha's usual thing- pressing her face to Rio’s boobs, listening to <em>her </em>heart’s heartbeat until she found her footing again. A pretty fucking unreasonable choice of shirt, really, given the circumstances.</p><p> </p><p>“Please talk to me,” Rio whispered, begging.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said, even though she sounded anything but. “I’m just- so fucking in love with you, and this bathroom smells like piss, and it’s overwhelming.”</p><p> </p><p>More tears fell. She refused to think about how ridiculous she must look: crying over love and piss soaked linoleum. She dropped Rio’s wrists and rubbed her face with her own hands- filthy fingers, be damned.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you so much,” Rio said, rushing the words out. “Let’s be in love with each other <em>outside</em> of the bathroom that smells like piss, please. Seeing you like this is torture.”</p><p> </p><p>“No! I want to stand in this piss soaked bathroom and <em>feel ashamed</em> about standing in this piss soaked bathroom like a reasonable adult!” Agatha bit out, though her voice trembling, beyond fucking serious. “Don’t steal my struggle,” she shouted, incredulous, pulling away from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked at Agatha, confused, affectionate. “Okay?” she offered cautiously, stepping closer anyway- closing the space Agatha had tried to create. Which, to be fair, was absolutely the correct decision if Agatha had anything to say about it.</p><p> </p><p>“I, um-” Rio started, voice still gently confused. “I got something for you today. Well- it’s not exactly-” </p><p> </p><p>“Will it make me feel better?” Agatha interrupted, wiping her face with the back of her hand, sniffing hard. She lifted her chin, reasserting pride even through her own mess.</p><p> </p><p>“I hope so?” Rio whispered, visibly second guessing herself the instant the words left her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “You don’t sound sure.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, now I’m <em>not!</em>” Rio blurted, panicked. “Now I’m worried it’s going to make everything worse, and I’m still a little lost here!”</p><p> </p><p>“Now you have to show me,” Agatha said, crossing her arms in challenge. “Because if you don’t, I’ll cry again, and that will be <em>your</em> fault.”</p><p> </p><p>Immediately, Rio turned around, facing away from her. There was the sound of a zipper, metal teeth parting, and Agatha frowned.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha demanded. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer. She shoved her jeans and underwear down in one motion, and Agatha instinctively leaned back so she could stare.<em> Sue her.</em> Her girlfriend had her pants around her ankles, and her ass was on display for Agatha. Of course she was going to stare.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio straightened, lifting her shirt and jacket out of the way.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p> </p><p>Her name -<em>Agatha</em>- was there in delicate, black cursive, still gleaming beneath a fresh layer of Saniderm. The skin around it faintly pink. Thin lines. Beautiful script. Not crude. <em>Insanely intimate</em>, actually. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her throat tighten- akin to swallowing a second, even more jagged rock. </p><p> </p><p>Rio -Agatha’s endlessly exasperating, breathtakingly sincere Rio- had gotten Agatha’s name tattooed across her lower back. Not even on her ass. <em>Worse</em>. </p><p> </p><p>A tramp stamp. A stunning, elegant, <em>fucking tramp stamp. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha was fairly certain no subject of poetry had ever been more thoroughly outmatched.</p><p> </p><p>“You-” Agatha’s voice cracked, utterly defeated. “You got that so you could put your dick in my butt?” It came out pitifully, she was almost on the verge of tears again. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head snapped back so fast it startled Agatha. She was still holding her shirt and jacket bunched in her fists, spine twisted awkwardly, eyes wide. If Agatha hadn’t been so dangerously close to crying again, she might’ve laughed at how <em>horrified</em> Rio looked.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio gasped, baffled. “No!”</p><p> </p><p>The word tore out of Rio. She let the fabric go, the shirt and jacket dropping back over her hips, and stumbled to pull her jeans up halfway before waddling across the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha- oh my God, <em>no</em>,” Rio said, breathless. One hand landed on Agatha’s shoulder, the other came up to the side of her neck. “I didn’t do it for that. I did it because it’s not something you’d think I’d go through with-” Her sentence died. Agatha could see the exact moment Rio’s footing slipped- her mouth parting, closing, trying to chase the rest of her explanation.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio wasn’t wrong. If anyone had ever asked Agatha whether Rio Vidal would willingly let something permanent touch her skin, she would’ve bet every dollar she had on- <em>absolutely the fuck not.</em> </p><p> </p><p>Tattoos were impulsive by definition, according to Rio. They were permanent, too- another thing Rio’s brain struggled to trust. She hadn’t trusted permanence in places, in people, and definitely not in ink that claimed it could last forever.</p><p> </p><p>And yet- here they were.</p><p> </p><p>“I wanted to show you I wasn’t- I don’t know-” Rio said, swallowing hard. “That I’ve never been this certain about anything in my life. I love you, Agatha. I’ve loved you forever. And that <em>never </em>changes for me. That much I know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio-” Agatha started. </p><p> </p><p>But apparently, Agatha’s breakdown had opened the floodgates, because Rio’s brain clearly decided it was her turn to completely fucking lose it. </p><p> </p><p>“And I know it’s just a tattoo and it’s… stupid, or whatever. I just-” Rio stepped back, palms pressing to her forehead. She exhaled a frustrated laugh, shaking her head. “God, I sound <em>fucking</em> crazy!” she snapped at herself. “You hate it,” she breathed out, eyes going wide in horror, absolutely sure of a conclusion she’d built from nothing. “Which is fine-” her hands shot up like she needed Agatha to know that part was also true, “That’s totally fine! I don’t regret getting it. I just- fuck, I didn’t realize I’d take it this personally-”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t hate it!” Agatha snapped, cutting Rio off. It sounded defensive, but only because it was. “You think I’d hate that you got a <em>sexy tramp stamp</em> of my name? No, Rio, this is so much <em>worse!</em>”</p><p> </p><p>A fist banged against the bathroom door, startling them both.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Fuck off!</em>” Agatha yelled at the door at the exact same time Rio shouted, “<em>Not now!</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Longest fifteen minutes of Agatha’s life. Easily.</p><p> </p><p>“Worse?” Rio echoed, voice cracking. Mortified. “This made you feel <em>worse</em>?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes!” Agatha shouted, throwing her hands up. “So much worse! Because now I have to stand in a bathroom that smells like piss and be overwhelmed by both the smell <em>and</em> how much I love you <em>and</em> your stupid sexy fucking tramp stamp!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio only stared at her, blinking, lips tight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jabbed a finger toward her. “Don’t you dare laugh at me! I am <em>not</em> being funny- that is an unreasonable number of emotions to process at once!”</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, um… guys?” Teen’s voice floated through the door, wary. “I was told to come get-”</p><p> </p><p>“Give us a <em>fucking</em> minute!” Agatha barked just as Rio screamed, “Go away!”</p><p> </p><p>They both stood there, breathing hard, staring at each other.</p><p> </p><p>From outside the bathroom door, Teen shouted, “Should I- like… go get someone?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio, in unison: “NO!”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. Reset,” Rio said, palms up, eyes flicking to the floor like she could find their sanity somewhere near the floor drain. “You’re overwhelmed. I’m overwhelmed. And the fumes in here are <em>clearly </em>poisoning us.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. Fine. Sure. She’d take that excuse. It was easier than admitting the truth- that she’d spiraled because she wanted something she absolutely could not ask. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t drunk. Two whiskeys and a sip didn’t justify the way her brain had launched itself off a cliff. She could blame the idea of ass play. She could blame her conversation with Jen. She could blame the bar bathroom. She could pretend she was still “reasonable,” still following some imaginary responsible timeline she owed the universe.</p><p> </p><p>Now she was in an actual relationship with Rio. Now Rio was moving in with her. Now Rio had Agatha’s <em>name</em> tattooed on her lower back. And Agatha had waited seventeen years for this. She should be savoring it. Letting it be enough. </p><p> </p><p>But even while she acted sane, she was hoping Rio would beat her to it, because this whole <em>‘I’m totally reasonable’</em> performance was paper fucking thin and burning fast.</p><p> </p><p>“My love-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, and suddenly Rio was in front of her, palms soft against her cheeks again. </p><p> </p><p>One touch, and everything in Agatha fell back into place, like Rio had slipped her fingers into the folds of her brain and pressed the hidden reset switch only Rio knew existed.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm?” Agatha managed, slightly disoriented. Rio should call her that more often- <em>Never stop calling me that</em>, Agatha thought…</p><p> </p><p>…The fumes in this piss hole were absolutely frying the fuck out of her brain.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we kiss and make up? Want to be in love with you outside the piss smelling bathroom.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s first instinct was to scream, <em>Get me out of here! </em>She didn’t. She swallowed, steadied herself, and managed one word:</p><p> </p><p>“Please.”</p><p> </p><p>They fell into each other's mouths. It was warm and slow and it melted Agatha into mush. Rio’s tongue brushed against hers -gentle, searching- and Agatha couldn’t suppress the small, satisfied sound it pulled from her.</p><p> </p><p>A faint taste of cigarette smoke lingered on Rio’s mouth, something Agatha hadn’t noticed earlier. She chased it now, sucking softly at Rio’s tongue, greedy for more. Rio gasped into her mouth, a sweet, startled little sound-</p><p> </p><p>And the bathroom door creaked open.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard it immediately.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, meanwhile, was still kissing Agatha like absolutely nothing was happening. </p><p> </p><p>She reached for Rio’s wrists and tried to pull back. </p><p> </p><p>Rio chased her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was going to kill whoever walked in. No fucking question.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha mumbled against her lips, easing Rio back. There was a thin line of spit stretching between their mouths, a detail Agatha would’ve deeply fucking appreciated if it hadn’t just been absolutely fucking ruined.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” Rio blinked, confused.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a tight, almost polite smile to her girlfriend and let out a shaky huff, wiping the spit from her own lips with her thumb before she jerked her head toward the door.</p><p> </p><p>Sage was on her knees, Rio’s NY Liberty hat turned backward on her head, a bobby pin pinched between her fingers, post breaking and entering. Her face was twisted in absolute horror. Teen hovered behind her, eyes wide- but nowhere near as traumatized. He blinked and shook himself out of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh… hey guys,” he said, giving a weak wave, shifting awkwardly on his feet. </p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m going to throw up,” Sage muttered. Then she turned, slowly, murderously, toward Billy. “And I’m going to kill you.” </p><p> </p><p>“I was worried! There was shouting, and then the shouting stopped, and I thought-”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop talking,” Sage snapped, climbing to her feet. She spared one more glance toward Agatha and Rio, her face contorting. “And it smells like piss in here, you sick fucks,” she said before storming off down the hall. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm.” Agatha looked back at Rio. “You teach her how to do that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was the reason Agatha could break into Rio’s very first apartment in under fifteen seconds. She used to time Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s an important skill to have,” Rio said, smiling as she zipped and buttoned her pants. She leaned in and gave Agatha a quick kiss. </p><p> </p><p>“And how do you feel about that now?” Agatha asked, turning to wash her hands, teeth biting down on the inside of her cheek to keep her smile in check.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged. “I’d say a little silly.” Her eyes stayed on Agatha through the mirror, waiting her turn at the sink.</p><p> </p><p>“I think it’s really cool,” Billy offered from the hallway, still standing there.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you mind?” Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>He flinched. “Oh! Yeah- sorry!” And Agatha watched him literally <em>scamper </em>off.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed, flicked the water off her hands, and reached for paper towels. As she stepped aside for Rio, she said, “I lied earlier about the proctologist comment.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio dispensed soap into her palms. “Oh yeah?” She shot Agatha a quick sideways look and rinsed her hands. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha dried her hands, voice flat and offhand. “I was imagining walking around the bar with a butt plug you put in my ass.” She tossed the paper towel in the trash. “And how full I’d feel with your dick there afterward.” Then she walked toward the open door.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait-hang on-” Rio shut off the faucet and tore a handful of paper towels free, drying her hands with the speed and panic of someone fighting for their life. “Agatha, what the hell- are you serious?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was already in the hallway, her girlfriend practically tripping over herself trying to catch up.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” Rio called, breathless.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped, turned, and caught Rio’s hand as she reached her. She laced their fingers together, face perfectly blank.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha asked, pure innocence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio squeezed her hand. “You know I have limits, right? I’m a human being. And you know how your asshole affects my cognitive abilities. So I need us to stop-” She broke off, tugging Agatha to a halt in the middle of the bar.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned, eyebrows raised, waiting for the rest.</p><p> </p><p>“And you,” Rio continued, gripping Agatha’s hand tighter, “need to repeat every single word you just said to me in that bathroom. Slowly! I want to watch your mouth move while you say it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed. “Absolutely not.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then just tell me if you meant it,” Rio rushed out. </p><p> </p><p>“Meant what?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned closer, lowering her voice. “Do you actually want me to do that to you?”</p><p> </p><p><em>Stupid question. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Desperately,” Agatha answered. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s entire face drained of color. She whispered, monotone, “This is the best day of my entire life.” Agatha watched in real time as Rio’s stare went unfocused, watched her entire body sway before her eyes rolled back and her knees gave out. She sagged forward straight into Agatha’s arms.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught her, grunting under the sudden weight of a fully grown woman rendered unconscious by her enthusiasm over anal sex with Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>A nearby woman took a step forward, reaching out instinctively to help. </p><p> </p><p>“Back off,” Agatha barked. She kept Rio propped against her side with one arm while fending off the stranger with the other. “She’s fine. She just gets overly excited about my asshole.” Then, quieter, grumbling, “And probably inhaled too much ammonia.”</p><p> </p><p>By the time Agatha finished defending the love of her life’s honor, Rio had already regained consciousness and was standing on her own. She looked dazed, but not in a medical way anymore- more staring at the ceiling like she was silently thanking a higher power for delivering her the greatest gift of her life.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, wrap it up,” Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tugged her closer, euphoric. “I think I just saw the face of God.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Over anal.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m easily moved,” Rio murmured, kissing the corner of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at her, trying not to smile. “Come on. Before our friends start applauding or doing something equally fucking stupid.”</p><p> </p><p>They made their way back to the table. Agatha slid into her seat while Sage hovered beside Jen, still looking vaguely violated. Rio didn’t bother sitting. She rounded the table with purpose, zeroing in on her sister.</p><p> </p><p>Sage spotted her approaching and immediately threw up a hand as if that would stop anything. “No. Absolutely not. Get away from me, you’re disgusting,” she declared, clutching her beer but not actually moving an inch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio ignored her and wrapped her in a hug anyway, tucking Sage’s head against  her chest in a suffocating embrace. “Awwww, is baby sister upset?” She cooed.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not upset, I’m horrified!”</p><p> </p><p>“Grow up,” Rio said. “And hug me back, you bitch!”</p><p> </p><p>Sage muttered under her breath but complied with a stiff, defeated pat. Rio plucked her hat off Sage’s head, ruffled her hair with unnecessary enthusiasm, and said, “Thank you for keeping it safe.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha liked this version of Rio- this easy, irritatingly natural big sister thing she had going on. The one who bossed and bickered and hovered like she’d been doing it her whole life. And, sure- Agatha had that old familiar pinch of <em>Fuck, I should’ve been there for that.</em> She’d wished Rio had told her, wished she’d seen it happen instead of hearing about it after the fact.</p><p> </p><p>But watching them now… it didn’t feel the same way it had before. It didn’t hurt. It just felt like something she got to walk into instead of something she’d been locked out of.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had grown into someone steadier, someone tethered, and instead of spiraling over the years she’d missed, Agatha found herself -annoyingly- looking forward. To what this could be. To being part of it. To all of their friends. To Lilia. </p><p> </p><p>Her chest tightened -full, dangerously close to sentimental- and before anything embarrassing could fall out of Agatha’s mouth, something mortifying like <em>I love you idiots,</em> she knocked back a swig of whiskey.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was just getting home from work, which would’ve been fine if it weren’t 9:30 in the goddamn morning. Night shift was one thing. Night shift followed by a required Delivery team meeting was another. Everyone on nights hated those morning meetings; they never lined up with anyone’s sleep schedule, and they turned a long shift into a stupidly long one.</p><p> </p><p>It was also exactly why she and Rio drove separately. Rio had offered -four times- to just wait for her, said she didn’t mind hanging around until Agatha was done. But Agatha shut that down immediately. She wasn’t making Rio sit through the two and a half hours between shift change and mandatory bullshit just because Agatha had to.</p><p> </p><p>Walking through the door, Agatha’s body did the usual automatic brace for tripping over one of Rio’s shoes. Except her foot didn’t snag on anything. That alone was strange enough to make her pause.</p><p> </p><p>The shoes. Every pair -hers and Rio’s- tucked perfectly into the cubby space under the entryway hall tree. Not half in or kicked to the side, but pushed all the way back, toes aligned, nothing out of place. No rogue shoe lying in wait the way there always, <em>always </em>was. Even Rio’s backpack was sitting on the bench above them, not dropped or slumped, but set down intentionally. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t dramatic, but it was enough to tell Agatha something was off.</p><p> </p><p>She slipped off her own shoes, tucked them into the nearest open slot. Her bag hit the bench with a soft thud as she headed for the laundry room, already peeling off the night, and pulled on her robe before heading upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>Their bedroom door was cracked open. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost corrected herself -<em>her</em> bedroom- for half a second before letting that thought die out. Rio hadn’t moved all her things in yet, and they still had an unfinished list of what they needed to sort through, what to toss, what would get swapped out for Rio’s stuff. But none of that mattered. This house hadn’t felt like just Agatha’s in months. It was theirs- no question. Even if the logistics hadn’t caught up yet.</p><p> </p><p>She eased the door open and heard a frustrated jostling from inside. Agatha went still for a moment. She didn’t need to see Rio to understand what she’d walked in on; she knew this particular sound, the way it meant Rio’s attention had snagged on something small and wouldn’t let go. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slipped deeper into the room, angled herself just enough to peek around the corner. And there she was -wearing one of Agatha’s Westview U sweatshirts, a pair of Agatha’s pinstripe boxers, and her own white crew socks- kneeling on the rug, one knee down, one foot braced, shoulders tight as she tried to shove the nightstand drawer back onto its track.</p><p> </p><p>The drawer’s contents sat on the floor beside her. Not spilled. Not messy. Laid out with a purposeful order that made Agatha’s stomach tighten. An extra charger. Rio’s weed pen. An unopened pack of cigrettes. The purple Zippo. A handful of individually wrapped Warheads she kept for sour candy cravings. A couple of pictures. Even the framed photo of them, the lamp, and the alarm clock she only ever used to keep track of time had been unplugged and lined up beside each other.</p><p> </p><p>The only thing out of place was the screwdriver, abandoned right next to Rio’s knee.</p><p> </p><p>“Fucking stupid thing,” Rio muttered, frustration slipping through each word as she fought the drawer back into place.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart just… dropped. If she’d been paying attention, she swore she would’ve heard it shatter against the hardwood. She hadn’t seen Rio like this in well over a decade, and trying to remember the last time only made her want to projectile vomit. Most of those memories were forgotten on purpose; Agatha had stopped keeping track back when things between them had gotten messy in ways it was never meant to. Back when every attempt to help had seemed to only make things worse.</p><p> </p><p>Every instinct Agatha had told her to move carefully, to not crowd Rio, to not step right back into the same stupid mistakes she made years ago. She’d spent so long being terrified of doing the wrong thing with Rio -saying the wrong thing, stepping in too fast, stepping in <em>at all</em>- that her body wanted to freeze in place just to avoid repeating history.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha hated that. She fucking hated that the first thing that hit her wasn’t compassion or clarity but that old, rotten fucking fear that she hadn’t felt in years. </p><p> </p><p>But doing nothing wasn’t an option, and no amount of fear-mongering Agatha’s brain tried to throw at her stood a chance against the sight of Rio on the floor, trying to hold herself together over a drawer that refused to cooperate.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped around the corner and leaned her shoulder against it. “Hey,” she said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head snapped back toward her. She opened her mouth, closed it, then turned right back to the drawer like it hadn’t happened. “How was your meeting?” she asked, voice too bright, jostling the drawer hard enough that the wood thunked.</p><p> </p><p>“Definitely could’ve been an email,” Agatha said, easing her way into the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha nodded, even though Rio wasn’t looking. “Was the drawer acting up?”</p><p> </p><p>“Screws were loose,” Rio muttered. “Sounded like it was gonna fall off the tracks every time I opened it.” She paused, like she expected Agatha to argue, then added, “Sorry the room’s a mess.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded again. Rio still wasn’t meeting her eyes. And none of what she said made sense. The drawer didn’t make that noise. The room wasn’t a mess. Everything was lined up so neatly it made Agatha’s chest hurt.</p><p> </p><p>“No worries,” Agatha said instead. She stepped around the neatly arranged pile, careful not to nudge anything out of place, and sank onto the floor behind Rio, her back braced against the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“This isn’t what it looks like,” Rio said over her shoulder- too fast, too defensive, the same tone she used years ago when she was trying way too hard to pretend she was fine.</p><p> </p><p>“Looks like you’re fixing a drawer,” Agatha said softly, giving a small shrug. Her fingers drifted toward her own hand, picking at a bit of skin around her nails. “Did you eat when you got home?” she asked, trying to sound casual.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” like the word had gotten stuck around something in Rio’s throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to make something?” Agatha asked quietly, her chest tightening at the sight of her heart on the floor, fighting a drawer. </p><p> </p><p>Rio only gave the tiniest shake of her head. She yanked the drawer free, sat back on her knees, and twisted around looking for the screwdriver. </p><p> </p><p>Before she could work herself up over not finding it, Agatha reached for it and held it out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand hovered for a beat before she took it without meeting Agatha’s eyes and started working on the tracks, loosening each screw.</p><p> </p><p>“How was work?” Agatha asked after a moment, not pushing, just giving Rio something to talk about if she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>“Shit,” Rio said immediately. “Forgot my badge at the house and it went downhill from there. The list was 23 patients each between the three of us. Trauma after trauma came in. The Ortho resident working was a giant dick. It just… never let up.” Her voice wobbled on the last word, and when she blinked, a tear clung to the bottom of her lash, refusing to fall.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to set the fucking hospital on fire. Or the nightstand. Or anything that had piled onto Rio’s night and pushed her over the edge.</p><p> </p><p>“That sounds like hell,” Agatha said instead.</p><p> </p><p>One tear escaped; Rio swiped it away like it offended her. “It wasn’t-” Rio shook her head, jaw tight. “It’s stupid. I’m just tired.” She finally set the screwdriver down.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was crying, and every instinct in Agatha’s body demanded a target. She curled her hands into fists, reminding herself to stay still. She wasn’t twenty-four anymore; she didn’t need to let the flood of “fix it” impulses run her ragged. The urge to destroy something was just her oldest reflex, not her only one.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not stupid,” Agatha whispered. She swallowed hard, steadying her voice so Rio wouldn’t hear the wobble in it.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want you to think I’m… I don’t know.” Rio sniffed hard, swiping at her face again like she was double-checking for evidence.</p><p> </p><p>“I think you had a shit night,” Agatha said gently, eyes flicking across the perfectly placed items on the floor. “And I think you’re fixing the nightstand.”</p><p> </p><p>Not accusing. Not pretending. Just opening the door enough for Rio to walk through if she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>She wouldn’t hold it against Rio. She’d play along, let Rio keep her walls up where she needed them. Rio hadn’t mentioned the therapy or her OCD diagnosis- not to Agatha, anyway. Lilia had been the one to tell Agatha. And she knew Rio wasn’t hiding it; this was just the sort of thing Rio had never known how to hand over. She’d struggled with it long before they were ever in each other’s lives.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha understood that. Rio would come to her when she was ready. And Agatha would be there when she did.</p><p> </p><p>Still, if Agatha could’ve taken the nightstand outside and beaten it to splinters on Rio’s behalf, she absolutely fucking would have.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally looked over at her, but not at Agatha’s face. Her eyes landed on Agatha’s legs first, tongue pressed into her cheek like she was deciding whether to walk through the door or not. When Rio finally lifted her gaze, it was brutal. Those big, sad brown eyes. It should’ve been illegal for Rio to look at Agatha like that. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha picked at a loose thread in the rug, anything to keep her hands busy. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” she whispered. “Let me get you some water. Or I can run a bath for us, if you want. I-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head immediately, reaching for the screwdriver again. “We have work tonight,” she muttered, moving to loosen the last screw holding the track. “I don’t want to keep you up. I think I just… tightened it too much.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t care about work. I care about you,” Agatha whispered- a reminder that the two of them -in any order- come before everything else.</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed once, tapped the drawer still resting in her lap, and nodded toward the nightstand. “Can you help me get it back on the tracks?”</p><p> </p><p><em>Relief. </em></p><p> </p><p>A choice Rio made toward her, not away.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha exhaled, shifting closer, gently taking the screwdriver from Rio’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t mean to break it,” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t break anything,” Agatha promised. “They’re just fucking ancient. I found them at a thrift store, and one of the drawers slid off the tracks before I even got them out of the car. I spent two hours trying the jam-it-until-it-submits method.”</p><p> </p><p>“How’d you fix it?” Rio asked, absently thumbing the corner of the drawer balanced against her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“I couldn’t,” Agatha huffed a breath that nearly turned into a laugh. “I was two minutes away from throwing both nightstands out the window, but they’re too gorgeous to destroy, unfortunately. I called Jen and Alice.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think you’re supposed to line it up with the frame,” Agatha went on. “and then you push, lift a little, and drop it in. Or something like that. Alice tried to teach me. She and Jen spent forever wrestling with it until Alice got pissed and just… did whatever she did. Isn’t that stupid?”</p><p> </p><p>“My mom told me you two talked about my OCD,” Rio muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head snapped toward her immediately, searching her face. Rio didn’t look back- her eyes stayed fixed on the drawer in her lap.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you upset with me?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p> </p><p>“Not at all. I just… I couldn’t handle talking about it back then. It controlled every inch of my life. I already knew I was fucked up in the head- I didn’t need anyone confirming it. I hated it. I still hate it- I hate how much space it takes up, how loud it gets, how small it makes me feel. I worried myself fucking sick over everything and none of it touched the shit that actually happened.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted up onto her knees and shoved the drawer in the way Agatha had shown her earlier. It hit the track with a rough jolt before catching, clicking into place and sliding the rest of the way on its own. She stared at it for a long beat -long enough that Agatha knew she wasn’t really looking at the drawer at all- then pulled it open again and reached for the little piles she’d arranged on the floor. Her hand went to the photos first.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched Rio thumb through them, counting under her breath, checking that every single one was there. Then Rio reached the last two pictures. Rio as a baby in her parents arms. And the one of just her parents. The two photos that had lived in Rio’s bedside drawer at Lilia’s for nearly thirty years.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the breath catch in her throat but forced herself not to react. She watched Rio place them in the back of the drawer. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re one of the few people who’s never looked at the way my mind works like it’s a flaw or like there’s something’s wrong with me. I think I leaned on that too much.” Rio picked up the extra charger, wrapped the cord around her hand, and set it in the drawer. She continued, “I let your patience be the reason I kept avoiding the conversation. That’s on me.” She adjusted the charger again. “It was selfish. And I’m sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>A lot about this conversation felt strange to Agatha. First, anyone using the word <em>patience</em> in relation to her. Second, Rio actually saying any of this out loud. </p><p> </p><p>It was one of those things that had stayed unspoken between them, the way so much else had. But this was different. It had never been a secret, and it certainly wasn’t something Agatha had ever failed to see. </p><p> </p><p>And if Agatha was being honest, this was the one thing she never wanted an apology for. She’d watched Rio fight it at its worst. She knew how difficult it was  for Rio just to make peace with herself, let alone say anything out loud. An apology felt misplaced. Unnecessary. Almost painful in its own way.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio-”</p><p> </p><p>“You shouldn’t have to come home to this,” Rio said, cutting in. She reached for the unopened pack of cigarettes and set it in the drawer. “I feel stupid. I feel exposed. And it feels like I misled you- like I made you think this part of me was over, and now you’re stuck with me sitting here crying over nothing when we both have work tonight.” She picked up the Zippo and placed it beside the cigarettes. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said, watching Rio slide the pen into the drawer like it might bite her. “You didn’t mislead me. I know you, Rio. I know everything about you. I’m not ‘stuck’ with you.” She breathed out slowly. “Feeling overwhelmed isn’t stupid. Struggling isn’t stupid. And it’s never a burden when you let me see it.”</p><p> </p><p>“But I’m better,” Rio said. She swiped at another tear, reaching for the handful of Warheads. “You weren’t supposed to see me get like this again.”</p><p> </p><p>“You <em>are</em>,” Agatha agreed. “I’m also aware that you’re not a miracle worker. You can’t erase something you’ve lived with your whole life just because you’ve put in the work. I don’t expect you to.” She watched Rio fuss with the drawer- straightening things, readjusting them, touching everything. Agatha’s voice dropped to a whisper, “Rio… please. Talk to me. Did- Tell me what’s bothering you.”</p><p> </p><p>That was what finally made Rio still. She let the drawer close and she sat back on her heels. “I made a joke to Jen last night. About her being your emergency contact.” Rio’s fingers twitched against her thighs, eyes flickering away, then forcing them to Agatha’s. “She got confused. Told me she wasn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt an unpleasant sort of clarity. She’d tucked that particular decision away ages ago, right next to the other things she pretended didn’t exist. Further, even, labeled in some folder marked <em>Do Not Touch Unless You Want Problems.</em></p><p> </p><p>“You’re worried about who my emergency contact is?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, but not confidently- more like she was admitting something she wished she didn’t feel. “I was already having a terrible night. And when Jen said it I couldn’t unhear it. And then traumas kept rolling in, and my brain… it just went there. It convinced me that something awful was going to happen to you, and I’d be the last to know.”</p><p> </p><p>If Rio hadn’t been so upset by it, Agatha might’ve laughed. She absolutely did not do that. </p><p> </p><p>“Is it still Wanda?” Rio’s voice cracked on her ex-wife’s name. She didn’t seem angry or jealous- not in a petty way, at least. She looked nauseated, like having to speak it aloud made her sick. “I don’t like the idea of something happening to you and me being completely shut out.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh</em>. </p><p> </p><p><em>Of course. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s dread made perfect, miserable sense. It definitely wasn’t jealousy talking. Rio had every right to worry about that.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s Lilia,” Agatha said, entirely truthful. “And you’re listed as my secondary. Even when I was in Chicago it was- ... I never changed it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t blind to the implications of it. She knew that, by anyone’s standards, keeping the people she trusted closest while she was married to someone else wasn’t exactly admirable. It painted her in a horrible light -selfish, careless, probably evil- and she never pretended otherwise. </p><p> </p><p>More importantly, Agatha didn’t give a fuck. She didn’t care how it looked or what it said about her that she’d arranged things to ensure they would always be notified, always know, always be the first ones called into the room if the worst ever happened. She just needed the assurance that the people who loved her would never be left in the dark.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh.” Rio nodded slowly- absorbing it, holding it, letting it change something inside her.. “I… okay.”</p><p> </p><p>And it struck Agatha that the relief she offered Rio ran deeper, reached farther- like it found some version of Rio from years ago where that same fear had its hand wrapped around her neck.</p><p> </p><p>“You know now,” Agatha murmured, hoping it gave Rio a little more ground to stand on.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to the floor. Her brow furrowed, her mouth opened and closed, her head gave the smallest shake- too many thoughts were ricocheting around her skull, Agatha knew.</p><p> </p><p>“How did you get away with that in Chicago?”</p><p> </p><p>“Very intentionally,” Agatha said, her voice soft but sure. “And with absolutely no guilt.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a breathy, disbelieving laugh, and the sound was the prettiest thing Agatha thinks she’s ever heard. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached up, tucking a loose piece of hair behind Rio’s ear, letting her fingers trail along the line of her jaw. “Tell me what else you need,” she murmured. “Whatever it is, I’ll give it to you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s forehead fell against hers, eyes fluttering shut. “I- I don’t know,” she exhaled. “I’m exhausted.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s okay,” Agatha whispered, sliding her hand to the back of Rio’s neck and guiding her just a little closer. She pressed a soft kiss to the corner of Rio’s mouth. “Come lie down with me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. They stood up from the floor, and Agatha saw her reach for the lamp, the alarm clock, the picture frame of the two of them in their twenties- needing to fix the rest before she could breathe. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped in, touching the middle of her back. “Rio. Honey. Leave it. Just lie down- I’ll take care of it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze, shoulders tight, looking like she wanted to crawl straight out of her skin. But she didn’t argue.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gathered everything herself, setting each piece back on the nightstand, plugging in the lamp and alarm clock, placing Rio’s phone on to the charger. She took care of it too fast for Rio to think about stepping in again. She climbed into bed when she was done, adjusting the pillows and settling back against them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She tugged a pillow over to Agatha’s hip, slipped further under the covers, and pressed in close- her head settling on the pillow beside Agatha, her arm sliding across Agatha’s thighs, her whole body curling toward Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>That felt… nice. . Rio curling into her side without flinching.</p><p> </p><p>Back then -before everything went to hell, in that brief stretch when Agatha really had made things better- getting Rio to settle afterward had still been a battle. Even teary and wrung out, she wouldn’t let herself lean into Agatha’s comfort without tensing first, like letting herself have it meant giving something away. Agatha never knew exactly what that meant.</p><p> </p><p>But she remembered the way it always ended: the two of them on Rio’s old couch, Real Housewives of New York playing on the TV, Agatha gently pulling Rio’s head into her lap, fingers stroking her scalp until Rio’s breathing finally eased.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for the remote and placed it in Rio’s hand. They were older now, different, and Agatha didn’t want to risk turning on RHONY herself only to learn it reminded Rio of a time that hadn’t been good for her. Even if, for Agatha, the memory carried a comfort she had never allowed herself to look too closely at.</p><p> </p><p>She let her fingers drift through Rio’s hair and the sigh it pulled from Rio settled straight into her bones. “Are you hungry?” Agatha murmured. “I can order food.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, and Agatha wasn’t surprised. She never wanted food after; pressing the issue had never helped. She watched Rio take over the scrolling, flicking through shows until she stopped on Real Housewives- a small mercy Agatha hadn’t expected to receive.</p><p> </p><p>Proof that some part of what she’d tried to give Rio back then had landed in the way she’d hoped, even if neither of them could hold onto it at the time.</p><p> </p><p>“Are <em>you</em> hungry?” Rio asked quietly. She set the remote on the far side of Agatha and reached for the hand resting idle in Agatha’s lap. Her fingers fidgeted gently with Agatha’s- tracing her knuckles.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said, honest about it. She’d eaten the lunch Rio packed for her later in her shift.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her head back on the pillow until she could look up at her. Agatha was already staring down at her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio whispered. A tear had slipped across the bridge of her nose and was sliding down her other cheek. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha eased her hand out of Rio’s fidgeting hold and used her thumb to sweep the tear from her cheek. “You have nothing to apologize for,” she said, and Agatha meant it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth trembled, her eyes darting away. “I’m embarrassed,” she whispered. </p><p> </p><p>“You shouldn’t be. It wasn’t an unreasonable thing to worry about.” Agatha let her hand fall back to her own lap, watching as Rio’s fingers immediately resumed their fidgeting. “But for the next time you’re determined to fix something to feel better, there’s a drawer in the guest bathroom begging for your attention. It sticks. And unlike the nightstand, it won’t punish you for your good intentions.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked up at her, letting out a quiet, flustered little huff. The smile that followed was small but real, tugging at the corner of her mouth like she couldn’t stop it even if she wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved the hand still threaded through Rio’s hair, letting her knuckles graze the curve of her cheek before cupping it, brushing her thumb across the skin. Rio leaned into her touch.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re allowed to lose your shit, you know,” Agatha said quietly, looking down at her. “There’s nothing wrong with that. I lose my shit constantly and you still look at me like I’m doing great.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio ducked her head, laughing under her breath. Her smile this time was crooked, guilty. She tugged lightly at Agatha’s fingers. “I like when you do,” she said. “It’s one of my favorite things about you. It’s…” She hesitated, her mouth twisting. “It's a lot less endearing when I do it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha would have to disagree with that. Rio wasn’t being dramatic; she’d spent an entire night tearing herself up over something as painfully earnest as who Agatha’s emergency contact was. The concern itself was sweet. But <em>Rio</em> wasn’t the problem. And what she was dealing with now was nothing like before. </p><p> </p><p>Just as Agatha drew a breath to tell her exactly what she thought, Rio spoke first.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want you walking through the door after a twelve-hour shift and finding me like that,” Rio said quietly. “You shouldn’t have to shoulder it.”</p><p> </p><p>“If you think I want to be spared from any part of you, you’re wrong,” Agatha said. “The most wrong you’ve ever been in your life, actually.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze started to flick away, and Agatha caught it with her thumb brushing at her cheek before it could stray completely. </p><p> </p><p>“I love you, Rio,” Agatha said, utterly unashamed. “All of you. And I want to walk through that door and find <em>you</em>. However that looks. If it’s easy, great. If it’s a disaster, even better. I want all of it. Taking care of you isn’t a burden, it’s… it’s the thing I didn’t get to do the way I wanted to before. But we’re here now, and I can. I <em>want</em> to. So you’re going to let me.”</p><p> </p><p>Brown eyes stared up at her, lips parted- which, conveniently, was when Agatha noticed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio fidgeting with Agatha’s left hand. Rio’s fingers. Agatha’s fingers. More specifically- Rio’s thumb. More specifically still- Rio’s thumb on Agatha’s ring finger.</p><p> </p><p>Dragging up. Pushing down. Proximal phalanx. Pausing. Pressure. </p><p> </p><p>An exquisite ache, really. One that made Agatha want to crack open her sternum, pull her own heart out, and lay it at Rio’s feet like an offering.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever you want, my love,” Rio murmured, nodding, no fight left in her- except for the pressure of her thumb pressing into Agatha’s finger. “You have all of me.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Perfect. Fantastic. Get it the fuck together. </em></p><p> </p><p>She reminded herself -rather aggressively- that this was about Rio, not about Agatha’s insatiable, catastrophically ill timed desire to marry Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, tried her best to sound reasonable. “Good. I’m- …” She cut herself off, sniffed, looked anywhere but at those soft, hazy brown eyes. “I’m gonna hold you now.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, her voice soft, “And kiss me,” while tugging Agatha closer as she eased herself lower into the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“And kiss you,” Agatha echoed, because the alternative was inconceivable. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha brushed a strand of hair away from Rio’s cheek, letting her fingertips trail along her jaw. Rio’s eyes followed the movement, heavy lidded, and Agatha felt herself soften instinctively. When Rio tipped her head the slightest bit, meeting her halfway, Agatha leaned in and let her lips skim Rio’s in a soft, testing brush.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her hand, her fingers grazing Agatha’s cheek before they slid into Agatha’s hair, guiding her mouth closer. When Rio exhaled into the kiss -a small, trembling huff she didn’t seem aware she’d made- Agatha caught it like it was something precious and impossibly important.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t long before Rio ended up curled into her, knocked out cold with her face tucked into Agatha’s neck. One of Rio’s hands had slipped inside Agatha’s robe and settled on her ribs, and once Agatha was sure Rio was fully out, she very carefully reached for her phone. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha logged into the hospital portal, changed her emergency contact from Lilia to Rio, then swapped the secondary to Jen. Lilia was getting old anyway; Agatha figured it was time to stop giving her responsibilities that involved, you know, being alive and alert. </p><p> </p><p>She woke up before Rio. Neither of them had budged an inch. Rio was still fitted against her, desperately clinging to Agatha despite being unconscious. Agatha, meanwhile, was overheating to a truly offensive degree because Rio ran unreasonably hot and had the audacity to be sweaty about it. </p><p> </p><p>None of that stopped Agatha from lying there for fifteen whole minutes more, staring at the ceiling and letting herself enjoy it because she could… and because she wanted Rio more than she wanted to escape Rio’s heat.</p><p> </p><p>After nearly cooking herself alive, Agatha eased herself out of bed and went downstairs, where she googled a six minute instructional video on how to operate Rio’s espresso machine. By the third minute she was questioning why any rational adult would voluntarily choose such a machine, but she committed and managed to make something that resembled coffee. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha came back upstairs, she set the cup on the nightstand and sat on the edge of the bed, leaning in to press a soft kiss to the corner of Rio’s mouth. When Rio’s lashes finally lifted, there was that warm, unfocused look that Agatha always  pretended she wasn’t waiting for. Sleep still clung to brown eyes, Rio’s hair was an absolute wreck, and her skin was on fucking fire. Rio reached for Agatha automatically, hands pushing into Agatha’s robe, arms sliding around Agatha’s waist.</p><p> </p><p>Rio drank about half the coffee before her eyes narrowed over the rim at Agatha. She pulled the mug away, held a mouthful far longer than anyone with even a shred of decorum would, let it fall back into the cup, and handed it over as if it were simply the natural order of things- which, unfortunately, it was. </p><p> </p><p>Naturally, Agatha took the coffee. Naturally, Agatha drank the coffee. Naturally, Agatha didn’t look away from Rio- she never would. Naturally, the very thing Agatha pretended she wasn’t stupidly invested in earning every single time followed: the gap between Rio’s teeth.</p><p> </p><p>And naturally, that was how Agatha discovered the coffee she’d made tasted like absolute dog shit.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>To be clear, Agatha was very aware she was compensating for something.</p><p> </p><p>There had been a wildly impractical idea circling her brain like a hungry fucking vulture, getting louder and more obnoxious by the day. And since ignoring it wasn’t working, she’d done what she always did- picked a direction and committed. Even if that direction had taken a rather dramatic left turn that she was annoyingly, very enthusiastic about.</p><p> </p><p>The whole thing had started innocently enough. Rio mentioned in passing that there was a new exhibition at the Eastview Museum of Art she wanted to see. Spoken as barely a blip in the conversation. But Agatha heard it, and given even the smallest opening, decided she wanted to take Rio on a date.</p><p> </p><p>Conveniently, it also served as a distraction. A distraction she had thrown herself into the logistics of, hoping momentum could drown out the louder, more intrusive parts of Agatha’s heart.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha had planned this date with an almost alarming level of enthusiasm. Tickets? Purchased immediately. Schedules? Cleared. And because she was leaning into the whole romantic gesture thing, she’d even insisted on taking public transportation- the same route they used in their twenties, when the museum was just one of the places they both liked enough to keep going back to. It had been easy, familiar, and one of the few things that felt right no matter how complicated the two of them managed to be.</p><p> </p><p>The artist being exhibited was known for sculptures and paintings of flowers that looked like… well, flowers, but only in the loosest, most vaginal sense. Close enough to botany to count, and close enough to pussies to feel intentional. Which given their most recent change in plans seemed to turn the idea of cute museum date into the territory of curated lesbian debauchery- tastefully framed, of course.</p><p> </p><p>The worst part was that Agatha had no one to blame but herself. Because she was the one who opened Rio’s package yesterday -the second she read the label- only to confirm, with her own depraved eyes, that Rio had ordered a set of silicone butt plugs. Dark green. Same shape. Three different sizes. And because Agatha was completely normal and well adjusted, she’d immediately pretended to be irritated by the fact that it was an odd number.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had obviously been staring at them -would even compare it to plotting a premeditated crime, only stuck on deciding who would be the first victim- when Rio walked in and caught her. Agatha, panicking in the way only she could, promptly barked, “Clean them properly,” like she hadn’t just been caught rehearsing the exact lie she planned to tell herself before letting them anywhere near her asshole.</p><p> </p><p>Which Agatha couldn’t do anymore. Lie to herself, she meant. At least not with the shameless efficiency she used to. She’d actually spent the last twenty-four hours trying to think of anything <em>but </em>-pun fully intended- and had failed with spectacular consistency.</p><p> </p><p>Why? A reasonable person might ask.</p><p> </p><p>Well, Agatha had set her alarm long before Rio would wake up, because she had… prep to do. Private, undignified prep. Prep Agatha would sooner commit a felony than let Rio witness. </p><p> </p><p>And as if she hadn’t already dug herself an early grave out of pure shame, she was now exerting an almost heroic level of self control to keep from dry humping her girlfriend awake- <em>after </em>doing all of her humiliating prep and taking a shower to recover from it. Her brain refused to cooperate, replaying two equally disastrous thoughts on a loop- floral art that looked like pussies, and the inescapable reality that she was about to walk around a museum with a butt plug shoved up her ass.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her breath the moment Rio’s alarm went off. Held it again when Rio shifted in her arms. Only let herself relax when Rio kissed her and murmured a sleepy “good morning” against her cheek- stupidly casual for someone who had no idea that Agatha was one intrusive thought away from spreading her own ass cheeks open and begging Rio to do whatever she pleased.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of their morning was offensively normal.</p><p> </p><p>Rio made a light breakfast. Agatha pretended she wasn’t hyperaware of every inch of her body. Pretended she wasn’t sitting there already uncomfortable in her underwear and pretending even harder that she was a sane person with sane thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>Upstairs, it only got worse.</p><p> </p><p>By the time Rio was brushing her teeth, Agatha had reached her limit. Her thoughts had been spiraling since yesterday and she was done pretending she had any grip on her own sanity.</p><p> </p><p>She busted through the bathroom door- unapologetically naked, holding the smallest toy from the set in one hand and the bottle of lube in the other. Small being relative, and frankly misleading, but that wasn’t the point.</p><p> </p><p>The point was that Rio’s eyes went wide the second she saw her. Fresh from the shower, towel tucked around her chest, toothbrush frozen in her mouth. Then she blinked, finished brushing, spit, and rinsed her mouth quickly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for instruction. She didn’t need to. She placed the lube and plug on the counter without a word, then leaned forward, naked and already fucking blushing, and held still- waiting, spine taut, as Rio calmly turned back on the faucet to wash her hands.</p><p> </p><p>The only sound echoing off the walls of their fucking bathroom was running water. She was already close to panting- preposterous for this early in the morning, if she hadn’t spent the last twenty-four hours edged by nothing but her own thoughts, and determined not to make it worse. So she didn’t let herself look at Rio. Not until she felt two hands settle at her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>And the second her eyes found Rio’s through the mirror, everything in Agatha reacted instantly.</p><p> </p><p>Her body loosened entirely, sinking into Rio’s touch as her hands moved in a slow path down her sides. Rio watched her in the mirror, eyes dark, and Agatha swore it felt like those hands were coaxing the breath right out of her with every inch they covered.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you get yourself ready for me, like we said?”</p><p> </p><p>An unfortunate reminder of how detailed yesterday’s conversation had been- and how perfectly everything so far had followed it.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha breathed, her mouth suddenly dry, gaze locked on Rio’s through the mirror.</p><p> </p><p>A soft flush warmed Rio’s cheeks. “You’re already this responsive to me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t pretend to fight it. She couldn’t. Every inch of her felt tuned to Rio and the plan they’d agreed on. She wanted this so fucking badly she could feel the heat pooling between her thighs- and they hadn’t even made it out of the damn house.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t help it,” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blew out a slow breath, nodding once to the counter.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>The first touch was cool and careful- just lube, nothing else. Then a single finger, tracing. Not pressing in yet. Just circling. Agatha sucked in a breath and let her hips shift back, just slightly, offering more. Rio pressed in slowly, shallowly, watching Agatha’s face in the mirror. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha's knees nearly buckled. The second finger came with a little more resistance, but Agatha took it -like she’d wanted to, like she’d meant to- and Rio gave her time. Fingers curling, scissoring, coaxing her body to remember exactly what it had been promised.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled her fingers out gently. She grabbed the plug with one hand and the lube with the other. Agatha didn’t move. Didn’t dare. She watched Rio through the mirror like it might give her more information than touch alone could. The way Rio's throat bobbed. The slight tremble in her exhale.</p><p> </p><p>“Hold still,” Rio murmured, lining up the plug.</p><p> </p><p>The plug pressed in slow, and Agatha felt her body give way around it, inch by inch, everything inside her tightening and softening at once. Rio didn’t rush. Just worked it in steady, smooth, Agatha's mouth dropped open. Her legs locked. The stretch was perfect and awful and when it seated fully with a soft, final push, her whole body sagged forward.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha breathed, eyes fluttering shut.</p><p> </p><p>She felt Rio move back a step. “You’re perfect,” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flew open.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t looking at her body or the way Agatha had responded. She was looking at Agatha- like she was some impossible thing Rio couldn’t believe she got to touch. Like Agatha had personally hung every star Rio had ever wished on.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could gather a single thought, Rio asked, “How do you feel?”</p><p> </p><p>“Great,” Agatha managed, the word coming out on a shaky breath. A smile tugging at her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile broke instantly, cheeks still flushed, the gap between her teeth making an appearance. “Good,” she said, nodding. “That’s really good.” Her gaze flicked downward -almost shy- and then she turned back to the sink. The sound of running water filled the bathroom again as she washed her hands.</p><p> </p><p>She rose carefully from where she’d been braced against the counter, her body readjusting around the butt plug with a shiver.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had always prided herself on her ability to adapt. Her asshole, disturbingly enough, only confirmed it.</p><p> </p><p>The sensation wasn’t intrusive anymore- it was intimate. Designed. Something that belonged there, like her body had been rewired to accommodate this particular promise and had adjusted accordingly.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio turned back toward her, hands clean, Agatha reached without thinking. She tugged the towel loose from Rio’s chest, letting it fall to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, made the fatal mistake of looking. <em>Boobs</em>. She forced her eyes upward, unwilling to get lost there.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I put it on you?” Agatha asked, glancing toward the black leather harness and the silicone already waiting on the other side of the sink. </p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t asking because she’d lost her mind- though the butt plug currently sitting inside her certainly wasn’t improving her brain’s function. She was asking because she knew Rio was meant to be packing on their date, and there was no universe in which Agatha let her wander off and handle that alone.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha was going to shuffle around a museum with silicone lodged where the sun didn’t shine, then Rio could damn well let Agatha be the one to strap her into the harness. </p><p> </p><p><em>Fair was fucking fair. </em></p><p> </p><p>She caught the way Rio’s throat moved at her question and dragged her eyes back to Rio’s face, only to find Rio staring at her lips and nodding.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded and reached across the sink for the harness and the dildo. Smaller than the one Rio usually wore. Agatha had almost argued on principle, that irritating strike of pride insisting she could take anything Rio offered. But Agatha wasn’t delusional, and she certainly wasn’t interested in her asshole being torn apart for the sake of ego. The size made sense.</p><p> </p><p>She secured the dildo through the ring. She paused. “Underwear?” she asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>The answer hit her as she was trying -failing- to keep her hands steady. She snapped her head toward Rio, brows lifting though she had no idea why it surprised her. Rio skipped underwear more often than not -Agatha knew that better than anyone- but doing it under leather for hours was different. That was a choice. A very specific one. Rio wanted to feel everything directly, nothing dulling the pinch and pull of it against her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha suddenly felt the silicone inside her with startling clarity, her cunt tightening around nothing. She breathed out a soft, “You’re so hot.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t laugh- Agatha assumed that was because she was already sinking to her knees. She guided Rio’s legs through the harness, pulled it up slowly, adjusting the straps along her hips until they sat exactly where they were supposed to. Her fingers skimmed the inside of Rio’s thighs, and the moment she registered how wet Rio already was, Agatha had to bite down on her own tongue to keep quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Once the harness was secure, Agatha let her thumb sweep through the slick gathered high on Rio’s inner thigh. She brought it to her mouth without thinking. A sound escaped her throat- whined, stupid, absolutely mortifying.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio choked out, folding forward immediately- one hand catching the counter, the other shifting the dildo aside before it could nudge dangerously close to Agatha’s face. Agatha supposed that was considerate; she did, in fact, appreciate not starting their date with an eye injury.</p><p> </p><p>Rio drew in a breath and pushed her hair back. “We, um- should probably finish getting ready.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a noise that was supposed to be agreement.</p><p> </p><p>Rio offered both hands. Agatha scowled at her, took them anyway.</p><p> </p><p>The second Agatha shifted her weight, the butt plug in her ass reminded her it existed again, and she had to grab Rio’s shoulders to keep from moaning.</p><p> </p><p>“You good?” Rio asked, breath warm against her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed. “Thriving.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, then gently turned her toward the bedroom. “Clothes,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced her body to cooperate and walked, acutely aware of every step.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s peace lasted all of five seconds before Rio called out from the closet, where she was taking far too long choosing an outfit- </p><p> </p><p>“Do you think you’ll squirt?”</p><p> </p><p>“I better not!” Agatha shouted, all bark and no genuine bite.</p><p> </p><p>“You better!” Rio shouted back, also all bark and no genuine bite.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha maintained that the real accomplishment of the day was managing to leave the house at all. They’d both gotten dressed like well behaved adults instead of the two idiots who nearly ended up back in bed multiple times. She’d thrown on a rust colored blouse, high waisted jeans that made her ass look phenomenal, and an oversized autumn toned plaid shirt/jacket thing. Rio had decided on black jeans, a black I Love Women’s Sports t-shirt, a black corduroy jacket, and a baby blue cap.</p><p> </p><p>The decision to take the train was, in hindsight, a catastrophic lapse in judgment on Agatha’s part.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped inside, took one look at the alternating shades of orange seats -an aesthetic choice that did an impressive job of showcasing just how underfunded the city's public transportation system truly was, a topic Agatha refused to indulge in today- and regret shot down her spine and crashed directly into the very full feeling occupying her ass.</p><p> </p><p>As if the seats weren’t enough, the nostalgia blindsided her next- rude, entirely unasked for. She could picture their younger selves here far too easily: both stubborn, both pretending not to be in love, both convinced the timing would sort itself out someday.</p><p> </p><p>And look at them now- Agatha would’ve bet good money that her younger self would have passed out cold  at the idea that her once-best friend turned heartbreak then eventual lover would someday be trying to help an older, sexier Agatha into a train seat forged in the depths of poor decision making.</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, that was the moment Agatha contemplated hurling herself in front of a moving train- Rio reaching out with a look of concern like she was lowering an elderly relative into a rocking chair. It made Agatha’s teeth ache with the urge to bite something, preferably her girlfriend.</p><p> </p><p>“Do not,” Agatha snapped, steadying herself on the back of a forward facing seat as she lowered herself into one of the side seats that faced the aisle, and silently thanked a god she had zero faith in that the train was practically empty- four riders at most, all safely dispersed across the train car.</p><p> </p><p>“Do what?” Rio asked, sounding way too brick-like for someone who’d shoved something up her ass an hour ago.</p><p> </p><p>“Treat me like I’m a senior citizen,” Agatha hissed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed under her breath and dropped into the seat beside her. She shifted closer without hesitation, angling her whole body toward Agatha. Placing her hand casually on Agatha’s thigh. “And here I was imagining us racing walkers down the hallway someday. My bad.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head snapped toward Rio, a retort already sitting on her tongue-  something insane about how if Rio wanted to grow old with her in a nursing home, she could start by letting Agatha marry her.</p><p> </p><p>Before the thought could escape -whether by divine intervention or the universe’s favorite brand of torture- the train lurched to life.</p><p> </p><p>The lurch sent the plug tilting slightly upward, a sudden, concentrated pressure against a spot that wasn’t expecting it. Heat shot through Agatha’s stomach. Her inhale broke into a ridiculous little gasp she had to smother in Rio’s shoulder, hand flying to clutch Rio’s on her thigh with a grip that betrayed exactly how intensely she felt that shift.</p><p> </p><p>Once Agatha managed to gather herself -meaning she no longer felt in imminent danger of impalement- she lifted her mouth away from Rio’s shoulder. Rio was already watching her, eyes half lidded, cheeks unfairly flushed, like she was the one with something inside of her asshole. </p><p> </p><p>“You were gonna to say?” Rio asked, her nails digging into the denim at Agatha’s thigh. Not fucking helping.</p><p> </p><p>“I forgot,” Agatha whispered back.</p><p> </p><p><em>Lie</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Immediate, blatant lie. The truth sat hot behind her teeth, and she wasn’t suicidal enough to let it out on a public train.</p><p> </p><p>Rio made a quiet sound of acknowledgment that she did whenever Agatha refused to play along. Instead of calling her on it, Rio leaned in and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned into it instantly, eyes fluttering shut in a way she absolutely did not authorize.</p><p> </p><p>“I like doing this with you,” Rio murmured, pulling back just enough for her breath to still warm Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced her eyes open, throat tightening. She tried for sarcasm but only managed a breathless whisper, “Exhibitionism?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a small huff through her nose, shook her head, then shrugged. Her eyes flicked briefly to the side before returning to Agatha with a teasing honesty. “I mean… sure, if that’s part of it,” she said. “But I was talking about the date. Being with you like this.” Another shrug, smaller this time. “Big difference from all the other times we rode the train to Eastview.”</p><p> </p><p>“I like being with you like this too,” then, with a soft strain born only from how much truth it held, “You make me really happy, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes were big, brown, warm enough to melt steel. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, biting her lip as her forehead dipped to Rio’s for a single second before she pulled back to meet brown again.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you so much,” Rio told her, fast, almost startled at the urgency she felt to say it. </p><p> </p><p>“You two make the most darling couple!” a voice trilled from across the aisle.</p><p> </p><p>An older woman sat three seats down, hands clasped over her purse like she’d been waiting her entire life to announce her observation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was seconds away from verbally mauling the woman when Rio jumped in first.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you! I’d say I lucked out,” Rio practically sang, giving Agatha’s thigh an excited squeeze before turning that brain scrambling fucking smile on Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t irritated anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio was still looking at her -wide eyed, delighted, completely unaware of how beautiful she was- and Agatha felt it hit her again, that violent rush of love that made her whole chest feel too full.</p><p> </p><p>Like her heart wasn’t content staying where it belonged and was actively trying to break out of her ribcage to get to Rio-</p><p> </p><p>The train lurched to an abrupt stop.</p><p> </p><p>The butt plug she’d managed to forget for a glorious two seconds reminded her -sharply- that her body was very much participating in this day, too. Agatha let out a tiny helpless whimper as her mouth dropped onto Rio’s shoulder again.</p><p> </p><p>The woman wished them a good day, and Rio echoed it.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha pulled her head up, she found Rio biting her lip, legs kicking out once in pure, unfiltered delight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother fighting the urge this time.</p><p> </p><p>She bit down on Rio’s shoulder, hard, and Rio yelped- thrilled, shocked, and still too excited under Agatha’s teeth.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio was at the guest information counter doing what only Rio could do- holding a guest information clerk hostage with earnest questions about who the fuck knew. Agatha certainly didn’t. She had tried -breifly- to care. She really did. But her brain had tapped out the second they walked through the doors and Rio’s jacket shifted enough to remind her of the secrets she was carrying under it.</p><p> </p><p>A quick look. That’s all Agatha wanted. A small, selfish moment.</p><p> </p><p>So she slipped in behind Rio, gave one quick sweep of the room to confirm no one was close enough to witness her impending lapse in judgment, and lifted the back of Rio’s jacket and shirt. Then, keeping her movements small and criminally casual, she hooked a single finger into the waistband of Rio’s jeans and tugged.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s spine arched a fraction in response, but not enough to break her conversation.</p><p> </p><p>The harness was in the way. Of course it was. So she pulled it back with the finger still hooked in Rio’s jeans.</p><p> </p><p>And there it was.</p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Inked across the small of Rio’s back like the museum had hidden its most exquisite piece under layers of denim and leather.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scrunched her nose and bit her lip, excitement buzzing under her skin. She loved it. Loved Rio. Loved the fact that she was openly staring at a tramp stamp of her own name tattooed across Rio’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>Apparently the fun police arrived, because in the middle of her girlfriend’s conversation with the employee, Rio’s hand reached back blindly, found Agatha’s wrist, and tugged her away from the view she was unapologetically admiring.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in and whispered, “You’re no fun.”</p><p> </p><p>When the employee turned to grab a brochure, Rio angled just enough toward Agatha and said under her breath, “Cut it out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes dramatically, then slid to Rio’s side and propped herself against the counter- careful, painfully careful, not to shift the butt plug inside her. “What?” she muttered. “You gonna punish me or something?” Her gaze drifted to the employee, who was taking approximately nine geological eras to find a single brochure. The boredom alone justified misbehavior. That’s what Agatha told herself, anyway.</p><p> </p><p>She let her hand drift down, brushing lightly along the front of Rio’s jeans. Bold, too bold, absolutely intentional. Her fingers found the outline of the dildo beneath the denim, and she traced up the length of it in a slow, lazy sweep that made her grin even before she saw Rio react.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hips pressed into her touch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha yanked her hand back just as the employee turned around.</p><p> </p><p>“Here it is!” he said brightly, holding out the pamphlet to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you so much!” Rio rushed out, grabbing the pamphlet and towing Agatha like a misbehaving dog she adored too much to return.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kept her eyes forward, but the very tips of her ears were pink.</p><p> </p><p>That was new. That was <em>special</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slipped free to take Rio’s hand properly.</p><p> </p><p>The second they were out of earshot, Rio muttered, “There is something deeply wrong with you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha beamed. “Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked at her, shook her head, then said, “We’re going to the second floor.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nudged her shoulder into Rio’s. “You felt nice.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio immediately picked up speed, dragging Agatha with her, muttering under her breath, “God. You’re so hot. You’re so fucking hot.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had to laugh.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t laughing anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Mostly because none of this was remotely amusing.</p><p> </p><p>She’d walked into this flower pussy exhibit under the impression she’d be the one in control. In Agatha’s head, this was supposed to be effortless: wander through some artsy, oversexualized flower art, make Rio blush a few times, maybe lean in close and whisper something that would turn Rio’s brain into warm mush- and simply not think about the foreign object lodged in her asshole. </p><p> </p><p>And for the first thirty minutes, that’s exactly how it went: The conversation was easy, Rio was warm and attentive, and Agatha managed to feel like a functioning adult.</p><p> </p><p>That was an hour ago.</p><p> </p><p>After a dozen sculptures and twice as many paintings, the entire gallery felt as if someone had designed it specifically to dismantle the composure of already horny lesbian couples. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept telling herself she was imagining it, that there were no pheromone diffusers hidden in the vents, but the longer they walked, the less convinced she became.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, none of that compared to the real problem: the butt plug inside her. She had been valiantly pretending she didn’t feel it, that she could stroll through this exhibit unaffected, but the constant pressure had become impossible to outrun. Every step, every shift of her spine, every accidental sway of her hips reminded her exactly what she was holding inside herself. She could feel heat pooling low in her stomach, could feel her pulse in places she did not want to publicly acknowledge.</p><p> </p><p>And then she made the single biggest mistake of the afternoon- she looked at Rio. Not her face, not her hands, not anything safe. She glanced down and caught the subtle movement of Rio’s jeans, the slight bulge beneath the denim shifting as she walked.</p><p> </p><p>From that moment on, Agatha knew she wasn’t in charge of anything. Not her breathing, not her thoughts, and certainly not the state of her already ruined underwear.</p><p> </p><p>She had the terrible suspicion Rio had started to notice. Maybe it was the way Agatha’s nostrils kept flaring every time Rio drifted too close, or the way her eyes kept following Rio’s mouth- tracking every smile, every word, every unconscious flick of her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know exactly what had given her away; she only knew she was one more second from embarrassing herself in a public museum.</p><p> </p><p>She needed distance. She needed to look at literally anything that wasn’t her girlfriend. Thankfully, the room had thinned out.</p><p> </p><p>Apparently, there weren’t hordes of people clamoring to spend their Monday afternoon analyzing hypersexualized floral anatomy, which for once worked in Agatha’s favor.</p><p> </p><p>She was pretending to study the painting in front of her, though there wasn’t much to “study.” It was a pussy. A very committed, unapologetic pussy. Like the last seven hundred art pieces she’d been subjected to stare at today. If she ever met this artist, she’d congratulate them on their thematic consistency and then maybe slap them.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you think the artist started on first?” Rio asked, suddenly right behind her- so close the whisper of her perfume hit Agatha and caused her eyes to flutter shut on instinct.</p><p> </p><p><em>Perfect</em>. Exactly what she needed. More sensory sabotage.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t know,” Agatha murmured, barely trusting her mouth to form the sounds.</p><p> </p><p>“I think the petals,” Rio said, maddeningly thoughtful. “Work from the outside in. Seems like the smarter approach, doesn’t it?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha answered. She wasn’t about to validate Rio’s faux artistic analysis of a painting that was, very visibly, a pussy- nor was she handing Rio the satisfaction of pretending that line wasn’t a blatant set up.</p><p> </p><p>“Interesting,” Rio murmured. “Then what would you start with?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried focusing on the canvas again, but the painting blurred, and all she could register was Rio’s presence at her back.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha let out on a breath that could almost pass for a laugh, if it had any strength behind it at all, but she was too busy being completely in love with whatever Rio was doing to her mind.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t know,” Rio repeated softly. “Hm.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned… pathetically.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m just enjoying the art, baby.”</p><p> </p><p>“That-” Agatha’s voice caught, embarrassing and shaky. She swallowed, cheeks burning. “That’s not what you’re enjoying.”</p><p> </p><p>“And whose fault is that?” Rio asked, voice dipping into an exaggerated tease Agatha could hear clear as day.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck-,” and because Agatha was passed the point of pretending anyway- she let herself lean back into Rio, “-you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, pleased. Her hands slid around her waist immediately, firm and sure, and the press of the bulge in her jeans against Agatha’s ass made her knees go soft.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tipped her head toward Rio’s, their temples touching.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed a kiss to Agatha’s cheek- gentle, affectionate, utterly at odds with the obscene thing she was doing with her hips.</p><p> </p><p>They both pretended to be contemplating the very serious, very academic pussy art in front of them.</p><p> </p><p>Then, in the same tone someone might use to comment on museum hours, Rio asked, “How wet are you right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“More than I should be in public,” Agatha whispered. “You?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fucking soaked,” Rio said in this lilting, taunting sing song. She rocked up onto her tiptoes, hips pressing firmer into Agatha- pulling a quiet whimper out of her before she could swallow it. “Uber’s on the way. We’re leaving.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly sagged. “Oh, thank fucking god,” she breathed- relief flooding her at the thought of not suffering through public transit and, more importantly, of getting home faster.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The front door had barely shut before Rio pinned her there, mouth crashing into Agatha’s like she’d been starving for hours. Agatha opened for her instantly, letting Rio’s tongue in without hesitation, and the hit of the door against her back jarred the plug inside her, and she groaned straight into Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>They tore at each other’s coats without looking, without breathing, without caring where anything landed. Agatha shoved the cap off Rio’s head and dragged both hands into her hair, pulling her closer, deeper, desperate to swallow Rio’s tongue whole.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands were already at her waist. She didn’t bother with unthreading Agatha’s belt after she worked the buckle open, popped the button, tore the zipper down with zero patience. And then her hand was inside Agatha’s underwear, fingers sliding through heat, spreading her open.</p><p> </p><p>The moment Rio felt the mess Agatha had been walking around with, she made a sound unlike anything Agatha had ever heard before- high and breathless and thrilled, pitched enough it nearly broke into a scream. Her knees dipped with it, her mouth dragging down Agatha’s, thrown off course by her own excitement before she surged back up, kissing Agatha harder, deeper.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s knees gave out at the sound Rio made- at the relief of finally being touched after starving for it all day. She sputtered against Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio dragged her mouth from Agatha’s lips to her cheek, her jaw, lower-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her eyes roll back. Her head hit the door with a dull thud before tipping to the side, offering Rio every inch she wanted access to. “Rio-” It slipped out on a gasp the second teeth latched onto her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Her brain went smooth, wiped clean by the bite of Rio’s teeth and the greedy way she sucked at Agatha’s skin. “Rio, please-” She could hear herself begging and couldn’t stop, couldn’t slow it down, couldn’t be embarrassed even if she tried. “Please… please… please…”</p><p> </p><p>She pulled her hand out of Agatha’s underwear and Rio moved her mouth away from her neck, and the only thing Agatha managed in response was a pathetic, breathless huff in protest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say a word. She reached up and caught Agatha’s jaw, bringing her face down with a terrifying confidence that made Agatha’s stomach drop. And when Agatha met her eyes, Rio was already lifting her other hand- fingers slick, shining, dripping down to her fucking knuckles.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth fell open instantly. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked down and her thumb pressed firmer into Agatha’s jaw- angling Agatha exactly how she wanted her to take them. She pushed her fingers into Agatha’s mouth, her hand at the back of Agatha’s head guiding the pace, the depth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips closed around Rio’s fingers, a soft, helpless whimper vibrating in her throat as she tasted herself.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t look away from Rio’s face- felt impossible. She watched, almost in disbelief, as Rio’s eyes narrowed, tracking every inch of the way Agatha’s mouth moved around her fingers. She saw the faint slack in Rio’s jaw as if Agatha’s eagerness had surprised her. And then came the smallest pull at the corner of Rio’s mouth, a flicker of something startlingly close to pride, like Agatha had just done something extraordinary.</p><p> </p><p>The hand in Agatha’s hair tightened, guiding her steadily downward, and Agatha followed the pressure without thinking, taking her fingers deeper, letting herself choke around them. Rio tightened her grip in Agatha’s hair and guided her off her fingers, and the second Agatha’s mouth was free, Rio claimed it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned into the kiss, the sound swallowed. Rio kissed her like she was easing her back into her own body, her tongue lapping into Agatha’s mouth over and over again.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally broke the kiss, Agatha chased her, lips still parted, hungry for more. Always more. Rio caught her face in both hands before she could get close, holding her still. Her smile was small, barely there, twitching at the corners. “Want to take my time with you,” Rio whispered, pressing a soft kiss to the corner of Agatha’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, leaning in again, but Rio’s thumbs held her in place.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio-”</p><p> </p><p>“Not here,” Rio breathed, shaking her head. “Guest bedroom.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowned, still trying to mold her brain back into the wrinkled shape that allows her to think and form words. Right now she didn’t give a fuck where Rio fucked her -against the wall, on the floor, in the damn doorway- so long as Rio was doing it. But the guest bedroom was oddly specific-</p><p> </p><p>Oh.</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh</em>. </p><p> </p><p>The mirror. The full length fucking mirror in the guest bedroom- angled perfectly to face the bed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha understood then- Rio genuinely meant to kill her. Honestly, there was no other explanation for this level of intention. And Agatha, being the rational adult she definitely was, wanted to marry her. Violently. Desperately. Fucking immediately.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re fucking insane,” Agatha breathed the first full sentence she’d managed since they walked through the door.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just grinned and nodded, her eyebrows lifting in a quick, excited arc like she fully owned the accusation and was delighted by it.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness would sooner be burned alive than explain how she’d ended up like this. If anyone ever asked, she would lie straight through her fucking teeth and move on with her life. She was certainly not going to admit that the moment she and Rio crossed the threshold of the bedroom, her knees had hit the floor with embarrassing speed, or that she had desperately begged for Rio’s dick to be in her mouth. And that Rio, who had never possessed anything resembling a spine when it came to denying Agatha anything, had agreed immediately.</p><p> </p><p>Which was, admittedly, a mercy. Because if Rio had tried to say no, even for a second, Agatha knew exactly what would’ve happened. She would’ve gone straight past pride and dignity and cried real, mortifying tears just to get her mouth on Rio…  Agatha was absolutely not interested in living with that particular truth.</p><p> </p><p>If questioned, she would also deny how every one of Rio’s instructions had been met with an embarrassingly immediate yes, and Agatha didn’t even have the strength to resent it.</p><p> </p><p>The only thing Agatha bothered arguing about was the overhead lighting. Even in her most pathetic state, she had standards. Ambiance and mood lighting were non-negotiable. And Rio, in her infinite understanding of Agatha’s priorities, switched on three lamps instead. Warm pools of light that made it literally impossible to hide from anything.</p><p> </p><p>Which is how Agatha now found herself very naked in the middle of the guest bedroom bed in the house she and her girlfriend now shared- knees digging into the mattress, braced on her hands.</p><p> </p><p>She definitely wouldn’t mention the full length mirror that Rio had hauled out of the corner and propped against the dresser, positioned directly in front of the bed so they could look at each other.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha especially wouldn’t mention what had happened right before she got into this position- Rio standing in front of her, inches away from her face, calmly working lube over her dick while Agatha was already on the bed positioned like <em>an obedient little bitch</em>. Just told her to stay still and watch, which had been its own exquisite form of torture.</p><p> </p><p>The reflection currently staring back at Agatha was extremely offensive in its accuracy. She was flushed everywhere, chest rising too fast, lips swollen, hair that did not read as “effortlessly tousled” so much as “recently mauled.” The panting didn’t help. She looked like someone who had absolutely begged for this, which was deeply irritating because she had absolutely begged for this.</p><p> </p><p>One more second of staring at her own flushed, panting, pathetic reflection and she was going to faint or die or both. So she let her gaze climb higher in the mirror, away from her own, to where Rio was positioned behind her on the bed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio- on her knees, settled between Agatha’s thighs like she’d been waiting her entire life for this moment. Her thumbs spreading Agatha’s ass cheeks open to admire the butt plug still sitting perfectly snug where Rio had left it.</p><p> </p><p>And then there was Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t smirking or gloating. It was worse- far worse. Rio was looking at her asshole like Agatha had spent six full days creating the world solely to place it in Rio’s hands. </p><p> </p><p>And if this counted as Agatha’s seventh day -a supposed day of rest- she couldn’t pretend she hadn’t chosen it. She was here because she wanted to be here: on her knees, opened up for Rio, heart hammering in her chest and ready to do it all again if asked.</p><p> </p><p>It sure as hell wasn’t restful by any traditional sense, sure. But scripture, Agatha decided, always did have a way of missing the fucking point entirely.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed- whined, really, a pathetic noise she wished she could swallow back down.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes cut to hers in the mirror immediately like she’d just heard her favorite sound. She released her grip on Agatha’s ass, dragged a flat hand down Agatha’s spine- the glide of her hand making Agatha arch back just enough for the strap to nudge her ass cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it, baby?” Rio asked, in a voice that made heat pool in Agatha’s gut.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha licked her lips, forcing herself to meet Rio’s brown eyes instead of staring at the wall like she wanted to. “You’re killing me here.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, my love,” Rio murmured, giving her a theatrical little pout. Before Agatha could fire back -before she could even blink- Rio’s hand slid between her thighs, confident and unhurried, fingers catching the slick running messily down the inside of her leg. “Who got you this worked up, huh?” she teased, voice sweet enough to make Agatha want to scream.</p><p> </p><p>She was already embarrassingly close to coming.</p><p> </p><p>“I-” Agatha tried, dragging in a shaky breath. “Rio, I need-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed and used one hand to spread her ass cheeks open again. “You spent all day remembering me with every step you took. You kept yourself exactly the way I wanted you. Even begged me to leave it in you because you wanted to feel full while I fucked your throat.” She pressed her thumb against the butt plug.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped, fists curling in the blanket to keep from jerking forward.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes widened in playful, wicked surprise at her reaction. “How many times did you think about me pulling it out and replacing it with my cock, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t even dignify that with a response. She swallowed hard and tore her gaze away from Rio, only to catch her own reflection in the mirror again. Her gaze drifted down the length of her body before she could stop it- and from her position, the mirror gave Agatha a clear view of what exactly was happening between her legs.</p><p> </p><p><em>Immediate mistake</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She noticed it instantly- her arousal spilling from her cunt in slow, repeated drips, her inner thighs already slick with more. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s body- showing off for Rio before Agatha had even felt the first press of Rio’s dick.</p><p> </p><p>The sight of herself like that sent a violent flutter through her cunt, clutching at empty air like it was calling for Rio. That along with the sudden heat that tore through her belly stole the air from her lungs. Her head dropped under the force of it, or so Agatha would claim. Her fingers stayed curled into the blanket, knuckles tight as she dragged breath back into her chest- also an explanation Agatha preferred.</p><p> </p><p>It sounded far more reasonable than admitting the mattress was easier to face. That Agatha was already edging toward coming completely untouched.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me what you need, Agatha,” Rio said softly, her hand gliding up the length of Agatha’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw at the trail of goosebumps Rio’s touch left behind, at the brush of Rio’s fingers reaching the nape of her neck and pushing into the hair at the base of her skull. Rio’s grip tightened there, guiding Agatha’s head back until she was looking at her- and tearing a moan straight from Agatha’s throat.</p><p> </p><p>She met Rio’s stare through the mirror without flinching.</p><p> </p><p>And for a moment, Agatha thought she might actually say it- might give voice to a word, a vulture starved and waiting suddenly fed.</p><p> </p><p><em>Forever</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Her mind clawed for it- with a bloody hand scraping through her chest cavity, sliced open, searching for Rio’s grip. Agatha needed it. Needed Rio to have her for the rest of her life, needed Rio to say Agatha’s name like it was a death sentence.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha managed, voice barely making it past her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll give you everything,” Rio’s eyes were locked on Agatha’s, unblinking, pupils blown wide. She wasn’t just flushed; she looked ruined by how much she meant it, chest rising too fast, like her body was struggling to regulate the weight of her own honesty. Then Rio said it again, quieter -maybe for herself- “I can give you everything,” as her hand slid from Agatha’s hair, only to drag it down her back again.</p><p> </p><p>And in a moment Agatha couldn’t honestly pin on any single thing -whether it was the softness in Rio’s voice, the certainty in her eyes, or simply that Agatha’s body had long since remade itself around Rio’s touch- her cunt clenched so hard she could feel it braid into her spine.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha squeaked, her head giving a tiny nod in its wake. Her eyes stayed locked on Rio’s. She could feel the vein in her forehead throbbing with the effort not to let petals and promises blooming wild in her chest pour out- rooted in Rio, reaching toward her, aching to be caught in Rio’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>Even love drunk on Rio, Agatha knew better than to bring up forever right now. Not in the exact moment she was handing over her asshole’s virginity to the woman she loved.</p><p> </p><p>And far too honestly- not when she was giving Rio a part of herself she’d never given anyone. A first she’d never planned to offer to anyone and hadn’t expected the depth of it- the sheer, disarming intimacy of being seen exactly like this.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t risk it. Couldn’t risk how it would land, or how easily it could be assumed that she was speaking on clouded judgement. And the thought alone was enough to piss her off, because she’d never felt more… clarity… <em>Unfortunately</em>.</p><p> </p><p>And of course that clarity had her brushing up against forever. Close enough to taste it, which was exactly why Agatha had to keep her mouth fucking shut. The last thing she needed was for this moment to come off impulsive, or worse- like she’d blurted something she didn’t mean.</p><p> </p><p>She meant it too deeply for her own comfort. That was just how her brain worked these days, ever since Rio became… well, her Rio. And that, frankly, was the actual problem.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio touched her, and suddenly Agatha felt every wrinkle in her brain iron itself flat.</p><p> </p><p>The tip of the strap slid through Agatha’s slick with a precision that made Agatha grit her teeth, because it was slow, purposeful, unbearably attentive. And Rio’s other hand pressed at the small of her back to keep Agatha from grinding herself down onto her cock in the humiliating way her body was actively trying to do.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt herself picking up speed toward something she absolutely had no business being this close to. Her body kept answering on its own- tightening, releasing, then tightening again. She could feel the plug with every small spasm, uncontrollable, tugging inward, persistent and needy, until it felt like even her cunt was panting for Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio-” Agatha startled. “Gonna com- you’re gonna make me-”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you dare,” Rio spoke desperately, nudging the tip of the strap inside Agatha. “Want to feel you come around my cock.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh</em>, Agatha <em>was fucked</em>. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was, without question, attempting to murder Agatha- weapons of choice: her cock and an anal accessory. Agatha briefly considered protesting, found she lacked both the strength and the will, and let it go. If this was how she died, she could live with that decision.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was already nodding, entirely complicit, unable to stop herself. “Please don’t leave me empty,” she pleaded, the words humiliating in their need.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, Rio’s hands had settled on Agatha’s waist, guiding Agatha back onto the strap inch by inch. Every bit of movement dragged a slow, rising burn up her spine. She felt Rio’s cock stretching her open, felt the plug in her ass press deeper, heavier, with every inch like it was grinding straight into the center of her.</p><p> </p><p>The pressure, front and back, met in the same throbbing low point in her pelvis. It was Rio everywhere, occupying space Agatha hadn’t known how to name, let alone offer. Every narrow, hidden place felt claimed, filled so completely it bordered on dizzying. There was nowhere left to retreat to, no untouched inch of her that didn’t feel accounted for. Agatha couldn’t think past it. Couldn’t breathe through it. There was only Rio.</p><p> </p><p><em>Always Rio.</em></p><p> </p><p>By the time Rio’s hips met flush against hers, Agatha’s jaw had gone slack. Her forehead nearly dropped to the mattress again. All of her energy being spent on not coming the second Rio bottomed out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio watched her in the mirror. “How do you feel?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha attempted to command her brain to articulate anything at all. It took effort. A lot of effort. “Full,” she gasped, the word jagged, scraping through her throat. “So fucking full, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“You look so fucking beautiful like this,” Rio breathed, her voice reaching Agatha’s ear on a vine that twisted and wound its way up her spin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands stayed firm on her hips as she guided Agatha- easing her forward, then drawing her back again, Agatha’s cunt sliding along the length of Rio’s cock. Rio picked up her pace with every pull. Agatha heard her own small, helpless grunts with each backward drag, wet slaps when her ass met Rio’s front. </p><p> </p><p>Pressure built behind Agatha’s eyes, so intense it felt like flowers pushing out through her eye sockets, opening into full bloom. “Fuck-” she choked.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so fucking wet,” Rio mewled, and Agatha had the fleeting thought that it might be the sound that killed her.</p><p> </p><p>She could only nod- kept nodding.</p><p> </p><p>Rio eased out of her. Letting Agatha feel the drag, the slip, the stretch as her body clung to Rio. Her grip fluttered, desperate, trying to keep her, but Rio kept going, kept sliding out until nothing but the tip of her cock sat at Agatha’s entrance, barely inside, tormentingly shallow. Then she drew Agatha back toward her until Agatha’s ass met her pelvis with a loud, wet sound- completely flush. Rio pressed forward, hips already fitted tight to Agatha’s, the blunt tip of her dick pushing as deep as it could possibly go.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lungs forgot their purpose.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze was locked so intently onto own that Agatha thought their brains must have met someone where in the middle of all this, thought she could hear Rio's thoughts on a repeating loop- <em>Agatha, Agatha, Agatha, Agatha</em></p><p> </p><p>“Come for me, please. I- I need to see you, Agatha. Please let me see you, Agatha. Show me.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Her body heard. Her body answered. Made for Rio. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her cunt cinch around Rio’s cock, felt the plug rock against every pull, felt the world fall to its knees at the sound of Rio’s mouth wrapped around Agatha’s name. Agatha stayed still. Perfectly, helplessly still. She didn’t make a sound- didn’t moan or scream out in pleasure. Her facial expression took the brunt of it- mouth parted on a breath that never fully formed, lashes fluttering in quick, featherless beats. Her brow was pulled tight, drawn by the sheer intensity ripping through her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m coming,” Agatha said softly, her voice sounding the closest to normal it had all night.</p><p> </p><p>Her orgasm rolled through her insistently, tightening around Rio in climbing throbs. Each one drawing her tighter around Rio’s cock until she could feel every inch of it, feel herself grip and release and grip and release again and again in a way that made Agatha feel like her cunt was trying to swallow Rio whole.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched how Rio was also physically panting, how Rio fought to keep her hips from driving up, holding Agatha flush to her like she refused to let even a moment of Agatha’s pleasure go unfelt.</p><p> </p><p>“I see you,” Rio said, nodding. And the way she looked at Agatha…. Her eyes. They were a problem. Too honest. Too full. Like her heart was trying to make itself visible just for Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio- I’m coming.” A little louder this time, shaking, carrying nothing but the need for Rio to hear her. To see her. To feel exactly who she was in that second.</p><p> </p><p>The peak of Agatha’s orgasm crested and ebbed, leaving her breathing hard, her thighs still trembling. The aftershocks were softer, slower, but they kept catching her- little reflexive clutches around Rio that she couldn’t control but wasn’t drowning in anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha- baby, I felt you. I can feel every-  You’re-” Rio stammered, just as the last of Agatha’s aftershocks fluttered through her, now faint as a heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>“Milking your dick. Yeah- I know,” Agatha cut in, her lips twitching into a powerless smirk that she didn’t bother to hide. She shifted down onto her elbows, slow and a little wobbly, while Rio gently eased the strap out of her- leaving Agatha with the grounding fullness of the plug still in place.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lowered herself onto her stomach at the same time Rio shifted back on her knees to give her room.</p><p> </p><p>Anticipation curled in her belly the moment she saw Rio take the bait- eyes sparking, that wicked grin tugging at Rio’s mouth exactly the way it always did when Agatha handed her something insane without the slightest hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hid her shit eating grin in the crook of her folded arms.</p><p> </p><p>“Right. Milking my dick is exactly how I’d describe it,” Rio said, cheeks flushed, the smile on her mouth refusing to shrink. She pressed a lingering kiss to Agatha’s lower back. “You should be more careful with your words,” she murmured against Agatha’s skin, then an opened mouth kiss pressed to Agatha’s ass cheek.</p><p> </p><p>The moment Rio disappeared from Agatha’s view in the mirror, Agatha let her head drop. She turned her cheek against her arms, breath catching as she lifted her hips the barest inch to push into Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Or I’m gonna start making assumptions,” Rio finished, right before her teeth sunk into the meat of Agatha’s ass.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped, her hips jolting around the plug still seated inside her. Rio lingered there, softened it with a few drags of her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>The bite faded into a warm throb under Rio’s mouth, and Agatha finally pushed herself up enough to turn onto her back. Rio followed her without hesitation, settling over her.</p><p> </p><p>“If you’re only just now assuming, that’s on you,” Agatha murmured against Rio’s lips the moment she leaned down to kiss Agatha. Rio pulled back, and Agatha dug her nails into the back of Rio's thighs. “Maybe keep up.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s answering laugh made Agatha’s heart do something of a somersault in her chest. Rio shifted back bracketing her hips, where Agatha’s hands now found the side of Rio’s thighs. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha flicked her eyes over Rio’s body with no attempt to hide it -first the dick she was still wearing, then <em>boobs</em>, the hickys scattered across her chest, old and new- before finally dragging back up to Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I’m keeping up,” Rio said, her eyes trailing down over Agatha’s still flushed skin.</p><p> </p><p><em>Great minds, </em>Agatha thought as Rio’s fingers started toying with her nipple.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze flicked back up, mouth curved. “You want me to knock you up that badly, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, decided maybe in her tenth lapse in judgement of the day and on the tail end of her breath-</p><p> </p><p>“You know I do.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is still compensating. Maybe backwards. A thinly veiled joke, if that’s what it has to be.</p><p> </p><p>Thinly veiled? <em>Yes</em>. Joke?<em> Not really</em>. Marriage proposal? <em>Definitely not that.</em> A safer not-so-secret extreme? <em>Unfortunately</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s shit eating grin twitched at Agatha’s outrageous mouth-honesty problem. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha refused to let the moment escalate into anything soft. She raised her brow, tipped her chin up, and planted her metaphorical feet where she meant to stand all along- “Think you can handle that? Or is your brain too far up my asshole to follow?”</p><p> </p><p>And Rio was looking at her oddly- too intent, too focused, like she was holding her heart up to the light, trying to see how much of it she could hand over without drowning Agatha in everything it felt. Then her tongue slid into her cheek, followed by those tiny nods Agatha knew she did whenever she chose a direction and committed to it.</p><p> </p><p>Without a word, Rio leaned over her, close enough for Agatha to feel her breath, one hand sinking into the mattress beside her head as she hovered above Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her breath while Rio studied every inch of her face. Agatha didn’t look away. Agatha wouldn’t. She didn’t even notice her own hand had been gripping Rio’s thigh hard enough that Rio had to pry her fingers free, her nails leaving crescents dented into tan skin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio brought that hand up between them, and at some point all of Agatha’s fingers but one were folded down. How Rio managed that with only one free hand was a mystery Agatha immediately refused to engage with.</p><p> </p><p><em>A coincidence. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha decided it <em>had </em>to be coincidence that Rio was holding her left hand- her ring finger conveniently the only one left extended. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s tongue traced slowly up that finger until she reached the tip and took it fully into her mouth. Her lips closed around the base, then slid up toward the tip and back down again- eyes locked to Agatha’s the whole time. She did it again. And again before letting the finger go with a soft pop.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could dissect it to death -much less burn the image into whatever parts of her brain stored Rio-specific porn- Rio pinned Agatha’s wrist above her head.</p><p> </p><p>“You know I can,” Rio finally said, so fucking sure of herself. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her mouth was parted, her lips twitching toward a disbelieving smile.</p><p> </p><p>There were two ways Agatha could go about this.</p><p> </p><p>She could let her mind take over- interrogate the implications of what Rio had done to her left hand, to her ring finger, to the future Agatha kept pretending she wasn’t constantly thinking about. She could start classifying herself as reasonable or unreasonable or whatever category she tended to occupy on any given day.</p><p> </p><p>Or Agatha could do the sensible thing. The adult thing. The thing that didn’t involve self sabotage or risk making her look like an emotionally unstable lunatic -even if she felt anything but- all while she currently had a butt plug shoved up her ass, like that wasn’t compromising enough on its own.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chose the latter. Because frankly, she was far too impressed -and still entirely too turned on- to dissect anything with even a shred of objectivity.</p><p> </p><p>Impressed, because her stomach did that treacherous little flip it always did when Rio matched her insanity without blinking. As if everything Agatha weaponized- her sharpness, her teasing, her bait -was something Rio could catch and throw right back at her with better aim. No one had ever matched her the way Rio did. No one had ever come close. </p><p> </p><p>Turned on, because Rio had just taken Agatha’s own ring finger into her mouth and fucked her throat with it like she <em>knew</em> what she was doing. Like she <em>understood </em>Agatha in every unspoken, unruly way Agatha craved to be understood.</p><p> </p><p>“Was that supposed to impress me?” Agatha whispered, eyes flicking between the warm brown of Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>“A little,” Rio whispered back. Her eyes cut briefly to both sides of Agatha’s face before returning to her eyes. “And judging by how pink your ears are,” Rio added, “I’m guessing it worked.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the rush of more heat climb her neck and hated how easily her skin betrayed her. It had been worse when she was younger. Now that she was older, competent to the point of arrogance, and armed with an attitude that usually kept it more at bay.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re making it worse,” Agatha muttered- almost without thinking. Not that thinking helped; she’d already made the conscious choice to let herself drown.</p><p> </p><p>“I love it,” Rio said, as instant as it was soft. Her hand slipped from Agatha’s wrist and rose to brush a few stray strands of hair back from Agatha’s face. Rio let her hand settle there, thumb brushing the shell of Agatha’s ear before trailing down to her earlobe, where she idly toyed with one of Agatha’s piercings.</p><p> </p><p>Of course it prompted Agatha to glance at Rio’s earlobes- at the jewelry she was wearing now. Different from the ones Agatha had pierced her ears with all those months ago. Still black, still with that sleek style Agatha liked on her, just a nicer pair. They were something Agatha had seen, thought <em>Rio,</em> and couldn’t walk away from.</p><p> </p><p>“I could pick the color of your blush out of a lineup,” Rio continued, pulling Agatha from her thoughts. “Been able to since the first night I met you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes because that was easier than admitting Rio had just sent her heart tripping over itself with absolutely no effort- <em>again</em>. Still, she couldn’t bite back the smile tugging at her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>And because some questions just lived under Agatha’s tongue- </p><p> </p><p>“How do you feel about letting me put more holes in your ears?” Agatha murmured, lifting her hand to Rio’s ear, to the spot just above the earring she was already wearing. She rolled the soft flesh of Rio’s upper lobe gently between her thumb and forefinger. “Maybe up here, next time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do anything you want to me,” Rio nodded, small and earnest, “I want you to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt something dark and pleased unfurl in her chest. Rio had always moved like this toward her, like whatever Agatha reached for was already hers to take. Agatha liked that far more than was reasonable. Thrived on it.</p><p> </p><p>She brought her other hand to Rio’s face, threading both through Rio’s hair and sweeping it back with a possessive care. Agatha needed to see her without a single loose strand getting in the way of her view- needed to see the exact moment Rio processed what Agatha was about to say.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been stuffed all day, getting myself ready for <em>you </em>so your cock wouldn’t have to wait.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw the change in Rio’s face- the immediate snap from soft to razor focused seriousness.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m aware,” Rio said, tone too controlled to be casual.</p><p> </p><p>“Then you should probably do something about that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Anal?” Rio whispered- the world’s prettiest brick making sure the other brick meant what she’d just said.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Agatha begged.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my fucking god,” Rio breathed, as if Agatha had siphoned the life straight from her chest- forehead dropped to Agatha’s, breathing right against Agatha’s mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand was on Agatha’s cheek now.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her eyes fall shut and allowed Rio to set the pace. There was something satisfying about giving Rio that control, about surrendering the moment and letting herself be steered. </p><p> </p><p>The anticipation that gathered low in Agatha’s stomach was fucking decadent.</p><p> </p><p>The way Rio’s lips were approaching Agatha certainly carried the intention of a kiss that might rewrite something fundamental, which was stupid, but Agatha could feel it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>The smallest tremor of Rio’s breath hit Agatha’s mouth. Rio’s mouth just barely brushed hers. It knocked a quietest gasp out of Agatha’s mouth and directly into Rio’s. Rio pressed in again, a slighty firmer brush, then pulled back enough for Agatha to want more.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nosed into the space next to Rio’s nose, lifted her chin again, and closed the distance.</p><p> </p><p>Rio melted into her mouth, Agatha inhaled against hers. And they kissed in fragments -touch, break, touch again- soft, quick presses of their lips turning slow and open and wet. Mouths angling, breathing into each other, tiny sounds trading back and forth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a whined huff the second Rio’s tongue pressed against her lip in the faintest testing touch.</p><p> </p><p>Stupid, actually- especially considering how often they played tonsil hockey for no reason other than the pleasure of kissing each other.</p><p> </p><p>Rio would kiss Agatha like <em>this,</em> the first touch was always soft, overly cautious. Then the tip of Rio’s tongue would sneak a press to Agatha’s lip- to signal what she wanted. </p><p> </p><p>Then- came the next pass of Rio’s tongue, slower and firmer, licking across Agatha’s bottom lip like it must be tasted intentionally before she let herself kiss Agatha deeper.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s tongue slipped past Agatha’s lips. And then deep, greedy strokes, licking into Agatha’s mouth over and over like she was trying to memorize the flavor, running her tongue across every place she could reach, and returning again like she hadn’t gotten enough the first time.</p><p> </p><p>And each time Agatha would give Rio as much of her mouth as she could.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was unhurried everywhere else. She knew how to build Agatha up slowly, how to use more of her tongue and her hands in all the right ways. She licked up along Agatha’s throat, lapped at Agatha’s nipples in slow indulgent passes, always taking her time choosing where to leave proof of her mouth on Agatha’s body.</p><p> </p><p>Everything felt warm and humid and fused.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had her mouth latched onto the spot below Agatha’s ear- right where skin dips soft before it becomes jaw. Agatha’s thighs were bracketing Rio’s hips, feet planted into the mattress.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand was buried in Rio’s hair -damp, thick at the roots- tightening every time Rio’s teeth worried the fresh bruise blooming there. Agatha’s other hand scraped down Rio’s shoulder, nails biting hard enough to leave marks she’d feel later- penance for pushing Agatha to the verge of completely losing her fucking mind.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was rocking into Agatha’s hips- the length of Rio’s cock grinding up against her slit over and over. It was relentless fucking friction.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, Agatha was barely functioning at this point- every continuous rock of Rio’s hips were forcing out these weak, breathy whimpers of Agatha. There were so many of them, so many noises, and Agatha couldn’t stop a single one. She was embarrassingly close to tears with a butt plug still sitting inside her doing absolutely nothing except reminding her that s<em>omething else </em>should be fucking happening.</p><p> </p><p>The pressure spiked each time Rio rocked against her, not because the plug shifted because her body kept trying to drag it <em>deeper</em>, to pull at something that wasn’t giving her any relief. Agatha’s brain was chewing itself alive over it. She couldn’t stop squeezing around it like maybe that would change something, but it didn’t. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio -fuck, Rio- was clearly getting off on it. Fucking getting off on Agatha squirming, spread open, stuffed full, whining into Rio’s ear like she didn’t know what to do with herself… </p><p> </p><p>It made Agatha melt.</p><p> </p><p>The second she felt Rio’s hand shift lower, Agatha moved for her. Thighs spreading more, back arching, hips tilting- offering herself up to Rio. If Rio was going there, Agatha wanted to make it easy. Wanted to be good for it.</p><p> </p><p>Two of Rio’s fingers traced up and down through the slick drowning Agatha’s cunt before slipping down further until they reached the butt plug still sitting inside Agatha’s asshole. Rio didn’t press. Didn’t push. Just brushed over it, like she was <em>reminding</em> Agatha it was still there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted tight.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in then, tongue dragging up the entirety of Agatha’s jaw. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw, her eyes going unfocused for a second when her tongue reached the fresh bruise Rio had sucked there again. Then Rio’s mouth pressed to her ear, voice sweet enough to burn Agatha’s already overheated skin- </p><p> </p><p>“I’m so proud of you.”</p><p> </p><p>The words hadn’t even finished leaving Rio’s mouth before Agatha moaned- loud, full body ruin. She didn’t care how loud it was. Didn’t care how desperate she sounded. Her whole body fucking lit up. <em>Proud</em>. She’d do anything to hear it again.</p><p> </p><p>“You want my dick so badly and you’re still letting me keep that plug inside you because you want to hear me tell you how perfect you are.” Rio pulled back as she said it, mouth swollen from kissing, chin shiny from saliva, breathing shallow.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha should’ve resented the way Rio was looking at her now- biting her lip, eyes soft and proud, like Agatha was something cherished. But instead, it made her hand slip from Rio’s back, the other still locked in her hair as she cupped Rio’s jaw, blue eyes begging brown.</p><p> </p><p>“My love,” Agatha whispered, pleading.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned and pressed her thumb against the base of the plug.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Agatha gasped, nodding. “I’m ready. I’ve been ready.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio eased her fingers inside of Agatha, twisting enough to take some pressure off the stretch. “Oh- still so tight around it,” she said, eyes widening in feigned surprise.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a breath that would’ve been a laugh if her body weren’t busy processing the sensation of Rio’s fingers and silicone moving at the same time. Her mouth dropped open, eyes fluttering shut as her pleasure lapped up her spine. </p><p> </p><p>“Perv,” Agatha got out, because Rio looked wildly proud of herself with two fingers stuffed in Agatha’s asshole. And Agatha loved her so fucking much it fried her common sense.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed and kissed the corner of Agatha’s mouth. Agatha turned instantly, chasing her kiss, and Rio met her, brief but soothing enough.</p><p> </p><p>“You’d take anything I gave you right now, wouldn’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>There was no option but honesty. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, unashamed. Only because it was true. Rio could open her mouth right now -tell her to come- and Agatha fucking would. Because Rio learned her body fast, learned it like she had something to prove, like loving Agatha meant memorizing every place she could come undone. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio had Agatha standing on a cliff now, waiting, perfectly balanced on an edge Agatha would only jump off once Rio said the word.</p><p> </p><p>So she gave Rio the rest of the truth.</p><p> </p><p>“Take it out. I want <em>you</em>. I want to feel you instead,” Agatha whispered desperately, cradling Rio’s face, her thumb brushing along her bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, Agatha,” Rio said, looking struck by the fact that Agatha really wanted her like this. Like it meant something. Like it would always mean something. </p><p> </p><p>Rio eased the plug the rest of the way out- slow enough that Agatha felt the slide, the abrupt absence, her asshole clench reflexivly, searching for pressure that wasn’t there anymore. The loss was immediate and annoyingly depressing. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to flip over?” Rio asked, already tossing the plug somewhere across the room as she shifted onto her knees.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard it bounce against the wall somewhere across the room- didn’t care.  Rio’s question was too awful. So awful Agatha blurted- </p><p> </p><p>“No!” scrambling to get Rio’s face back in front of her. “Fuck no!” Agatha was mortified at the thought of Rio’s face not being within inches of hers and even more mortified by how obvious it was- she continued, “I want-,” Immediately trailed off. Her ears burned, but she didn’t look away; Agatha refused to slide back into the habit of pretending things mattered less than they did. “I want us like this. Just like this.” </p><p> </p><p>And yes- doing anal for the first time while practically nose to nose with Rio felt absurdly intimate. Idiotic, maybe. But at the very least, <em>honest</em>. And Agatha sure as fuck wasn’t going to miss out on that opportunity.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked dizzy at Agatha’s honesty. And Agatha would’ve teased her for it, but she was too desperate for Rio and her cock to pretend anything was funny.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you, Agatha,” Rio said, quiet but extremely clear, and it snapped Agatha’s gaze up immediately. She wasn’t prepared for it- not while helping Rio guide the strap to line up to her asshole. </p><p> </p><p>That left Agatha with a visual of Rio’s heart leaving her mouth and landing squarely in Agatha’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” Agatha said back, and briefly thought she should probably be more concerned about how nothing in her life had ever come out more honest than those three words do when they’re meant for Rio. But she wasn’t worried. Not even a little. </p><p> </p><p>She guided Rio’s forehead to hers, wrapped a leg around Rio’s waist, holding her there, wanting her close while Rio circled her asshole with the head of the strap- so slowly that Agatha could feel her body anticipate the pressure. None of it felt careless; not the way Rio touched her, not the way Agatha held Rio’s face in front of her own because eye contact wasn’t optional, not with Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted her hips and finally pushed in. The head of the strap pressed inside of her, and Agatha felt her body take it- opening around the dildo as Rio kept easing forward. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck-” Agatha choked out.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me if it’s too much.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not,” Agatha promised, her fingers digging into the back of Rio’s shoulder. She brought her other leg up around Rio’s waist, tightening her hold. “Keep going,” she murmured, brushing her nose along Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt herself take the depth easily, already softened from the plug she’d worn most of the day. What hit her instead was the gradual fullness easing into her. </p><p> </p><p>A startled sound slipped from Agatha when Rio reached the point where their hips met. “Stay,” Agatha whispered, tightening her legs around Rio’s waist.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had imagined a dozen versions of how Rio might look at her during this- none of them came close to its reality. Which was fucking dumb, considering Agatha was sure they had already reached the absolute ceiling of intimacy one could wring out of something as ridiculous as anal sex.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio wasn’t panting. She wasn’t flushed. She wasn’t even trembling the way Agatha half expected. She just looked at Agatha- directly, unblinking, devastatingly present. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t have a comparison for it; there wasn’t one that didn’t feel insulting in its inadequacy. All she knew was that she was caught by it -snared- her body tightening around the fullness inside her. She felt herself clench, felt her cunt tense uselessly, and the involuntary shock of it cut her breath in half.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I kiss you?” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p><em>Stupid question.</em></p><p> </p><p>“Of course you can,” Agatha said- though it came out too humiliatingly close to a squeak. </p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her- sweetly, unmoving, her hips kept as still as possible beneath the locked hold of Agatha’s legs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her entire body vibrate on a frequency that she thought should be regulated by law. Emotionally, it was catastrophic. Her stomach dropped out, hollowing like a trapdoor opening. Her ass tightened around Rio’s cock- and that tightening just intensified the sensation. Her cunt tightened in another useless squeeze around emptiness. </p><p> </p><p>The fullness inside of her asshole wasn’t even moving, wasn’t shifting; it was simply there, seated so deep that her muscles stayed wrapped around it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio angled her mouth just slightly, deepened the pressure of her kiss, and Agatha broke. </p><p> </p><p>The pulsing didn’t stop. It layered. Tightened. Built.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m-” Agatha muttered against Rio’s mouth, barely getting it out, “I’m coming.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth left hers with a soft pop, and Agatha just stared up at her- caught completely off guard by the reality that she had actually come from a kiss. Just Rio’s mouth on hers. That was what did it, fucking insane as it sounded.</p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t been big -not satisfying, not enough to soften anything building in her- but her thighs still shook, her stomach still dropped, and those tight internal contractions still rolled through her in quick, involuntary pulses.</p><p> </p><p>“You came?” Rio whispered, soft- startled awe wrapped in it like she also couldn’t quite believe it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha supposed she deserved to be looked at like that.</p><p> </p><p>She nodded, throat working, wanting to look away from how exposed she felt but she didn’t- Agatha stayed present, locked into Rio’s gaze, because breaking eye contact would have implied uncertainty. So she slid her hands down to Rio’s ass, both hands full. Her fingers gripping Rio’s ass cheeks with purpose, holding Rio exactly where she was, communicating clearly that Rio was not to move or pull out. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted more, needed more, needed the stretch to deepen and settle and feel like something she could chase rather than just accept.</p><p> </p><p>Rio understood immediately; the smallest forward grind, barely a movement at all, enough to drag pressure against where it mattered. Agatha whimpered as Rio’s pelvis ground into her clit. </p><p> </p><p>“Tell me what it was that made you come,” Rio whispered, voice stupidly patient. “Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t think about deflecting. There was no urge to roll her eyes, no instinct to lace it with sarcasm. </p><p> </p><p>“Your mouth,” she said, lifting her chin enough to meet her mouth. She kissed Rio once, a warm and wet press of lips that bordered on possessive. “It was your mouth.” Another kiss. Her hands slid up, threading into Rio’s hair, nails digging into the back of Rio’s skull. “Of course it was your mouth.” Another kiss.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Rio asked into Agatha’s mouth, as she gave the tiniest answering grind. The base of the strap dragged against Agatha, the contact against her clit sharper this time because Agatha was already wound so tight from the admission. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha managed. </p><p> </p><p>And she had no definitive answer for the feeling that followed- only the sudden, brutally rational certainty that no one else would ever know what Rio’s mouth felt like- not now, not later, not together, not apart, not dead or alive or any version in between.</p><p> </p><p><em>Only Agatha. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio belonged to Agatha in every way imaginable- physically, emotionally, universally, across every single fucking timeline. </p><p> </p><p><em>Only Agatha. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Tell-” Agatha tried, but by then Rio’s tiny grinds had shifted into these short little thrusts- hitting the same spot over and over again, and Agatha’s body welcomed it, tightened for it, wanted more of it. She tried again. “Tell me I ruined you,” she rasped.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kept her hips working, and her mouth parted- drinking in the words, tasting them, swallowing.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing ever felt right since… say it,” Agatha whispered, her body catching with each controlled thrust of Rio’s hips, feeding Rio the truth she wanted to hear herself. But the second it left her mouth, the words tasted too honest.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had felt that way long before they had ever touched like this- back when they were only friends and it made no sense to feel that way at all. It settled in the pit of her stomach, something time kept turning over instead of breaking down. She tried to force it out, to shake it loose, to treat it like a feeling she could expel if she was stubborn enough. It never worked.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed, holding Rio’s eyes, craving the way Rio always seemed to hand herself over the moment Agatha said something like this out loud. “Tell me I’m the reason you stopped believing anyone else could satisfy you,” Agatha urged softly, selfishly. “Say it. Tell me it’s always been me.”</p><p> </p><p>“My body knew the difference. Before we-” Rio’s words fell off as her hips shifted into longer strokes, slower but deeper in their path. Every pass dragged sensation through her, and Agatha whimpered with each one, nails biting harder into the back of Rio’s scalp. </p><p> </p><p>“My fucking body knew, Agatha,” Rio rasped. “You did that to me. You ruined me for anyone else. <em>Completely</em>. Changed the way I fucking breathe.” Her voice was breath heavy, words hitting Agatha’s mouth. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. She could feel it swelling in her chest, pressure rising like air trapped under ribs, begging for a release. Her stomach dipped, her body braced, that edge approaching again- familiar but bigger this time, not cliff-like, but freefall out of a plane-adjacent.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s you,” Rio demanded into Agatha’s mouth. “It’s always been you. It’s only ever going to be you, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>“Made for me,” Agatha breathed, nodding, tilting her chin up to catch Rio’s mouth between thrusts, the kiss messy from the rhythm of Rio’s hips. She barely got the next part out. “Made fo-”</p><p> </p><p>“I was made for you,” Rio cut in. She kissed Agatha clumsy, wet with need, then her forehead dropped back to Agatha’s. “Only you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio-” Agatha choked, breath ripped apart as Rio drove into her again. She could feel the stretch, the way her asshole opened around Rio’s cock and then closed- tight, flexing, sucking Rio in every time she pushed forward.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t ever want anyone else,” Rio whimpered, her warm brown locked into Agatha's blue, as if it were already decided that Rio must drown there. “Not made for anyone else. Only you,” as if there was zero alternative she could stomach, “Only Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s chest was rising fast, and a bead of sweat fell from the bridge of her nose. </p><p> </p><p>It landed on Agatha’s upper lip, and she caught it with her tongue. What Rio gave was hers to take. It belonged to Agatha. </p><p> </p><p><em>Only Agatha.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned at the taste of salt and effort of Rio Vidal's ruin, and it made Agatha want more. She had to have more.</p><p> </p><p><em>All of it. Greedy. Inside. Every drop. Nothing wasted. Nothing left behind.</em></p><p> </p><p>A single directive: <em>take</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She tugged on Rio’s head, drawing her closer, and she felt Rio assume -reasonably- that Agatha’s mouth was aimed for a kiss. One hand firm at the side of Rio’s neck while the other tightened in her hair- Agatha angled Rio’s mouth away from her own.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s tongue was already reaching, dragging upward of Rio’s jaw, and along the entire side of Rio’s face- tasting more heat and more salt and more evidence of Rio’s hard work.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha,” Rio moaned, and pressed her face firmer into the contact of Agatha’s tongue without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whined at the way Rio offered herself, how willing she was to feed Agatha’s hunger. There was nothing cautious in it, nothing held back. Rio let herself be taken like it was her first instinct above all else. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha’s senses were flooded- fed. The taste of Rio, the smell of Rio, the sound of Rio, the utter existence of Rio-</p><p> </p><p><em>Rio, Rio, Rio, Rio-</em></p><p> </p><p>Crashed into Agatha’s soul. She lost herself, tongue lapping again and again along the side of Rio’s face, hungry and unchecked, driven entirely by need.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wrenched away only to turn her head, giving Agatha the other side of her face. Agatha’s tongue followed immediately. </p><p> </p><p>Loving Rio had always meant needing to swallow Rio whole- to take until there was not a single inch of Rio left unclaimed.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio breathed, hovering over her now, eyes dark as she took Agatha in. Her brow tightened as she adjusted, hips pressing forward with intent, and with her hand still between them she pushed her fingers into Agatha. “Let me feel you, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Her cunt opened around Rio’s fingers, every muscle in Agatha was pulling her deeper. Her ass stayed tight around Rio’s cock, full to the deepest place her body could hold. Both sensations met in the middle of her- two points of pressure that came from the same person, working in opposing directions. She existed only in fullness- front and back, beginning and end written into every inch of her flesh.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was clutching at Rio’s hair, shoving her fingers through the sweat-damp strands, unable to keep her grip steady. “Rio- I’m gon- Gonna make a mess.” She wasn’t trying to spare the fucking bed. She simply needed Rio's response when she said it.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said. Her fingers curled deeper, her thumb pressing against Agatha’s clit. “Agatha- please. Let me have it. On me. I’m right here. Please, Agatha.” </p><p> </p><p><em>Well, fuck. </em></p><p> </p><p>The sound that left Agatha wasn’t even recognizable- it was raw, something forced out by the force of what overtook her. She came hard, wet gushing out of her without a buildup, soaking the inside of her thighs, coating Rio’s hand, spewing  across Rio’s hips. She was clawing at Rio’s back before she even realized her hands had left Rio’s hair.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck- Agatha,” Rio choked, her forehead falling until it rested against Agatha’s, voice shaky. “I’m coming. God-”</p><p> </p><p>The way Rio said it landed directly in Agatha’s chest, everything was hot, and another rush spilled out of Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“More, Agatha,” Rio breathed- a death sentence.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered, her stomach pulling tight as another rush of release spilled from her and into Rio’s waiting hand.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio eased Agatha through the rest of it, whispering against her mouth, kissing her like she was meant to soften every sharp aftershock still flickering through Agatha’s body. She let Agatha hold on -fistfuls of hair, face pressed close- until the last tremor faded. </p><p> </p><p>They stayed like that for a while, letting their breathing find a steadier pace, their bodies flushed and slick and connected, trading slow kisses and softer words. </p><p> </p><p>At some point, they finally peeled themselves apart, both deciding they wanted to end the night in their own bed upstairs. Rio sat up first, and Agatha followed when Rio reached for her hand. Getting up was clumsy; Agatha’s legs still hadn’t remembered what standing was supposed to feel like. Rio wasn’t any better. They both wobbled, stumbled, nearly collapsed back into the mattress, laughing. They left the guest room in its ruin -sheets a disaster, air still humid, bed still imprinted with the shape of them- and went upstairs without bothering to cover a single inch of skin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s touch never once left Agatha on their way upstairs. A hand at her hip, fingers grazing along her ribs, the back of her knuckles sweeping the dimples at the bottom of Agatha’s spine, like even a single inch of skin wasn’t meant to be left untouched. Agatha didn’t pretend she minded.</p><p> </p><p>In their bedroom, Rio steered Agatha into the bathroom, guiding her to sit down onto the closed toilet lid while she turned on the shower. The shower warmed; steam fogged the mirror. When they stepped inside, Rio moved behind her like she had already decided Agatha wouldn’t be lifting a single finger. </p><p> </p><p>Hands slid into Agatha’s hair, fingers working shampoo into her scalp in a way that made Agatha’s eyes roll into the back of her head. Rio rinsed it out, repeated the same with conditioner, combing through strands with her fingers, smoothing them down Agatha’s back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t fight being taken care of; the night had left her somewhere between pliable and completely useless, and Rio seemed perfectly committed to handling that. Her girlfriend was extremely thorough about it- down to coating Agatha in Rio’s bodywash having clearly noticed that Agatha always reached for that one instead of her own. And Agatha didn’t know why she’d kept buying her own bodywash at all, because nothing about it sank into her skin the way Rio’s did. She doubted she’d bother after tonight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha returned the favor despite Rio half heartedly trying to protest. Rio muttered something about her being <em>“Not being medically cleared for things involving fine motor skills after being properly fucked through a mattress,” </em>which would’ve been more convincing if she hadn’t sounded so proud about it. Rio surrendered the moment Agatha insisted with teeth biting sinking into the flesh of Rio’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t stay awake much longer after that. Real Housewives was playing on the TV, the familiar chorus of arguments and confessionals humming in the background. Their conversation drifted into soft pointless threads- nothing that mattered, everything that did.</p><p> </p><p>Rio dragged her hand through Agatha’s now-dry hair while Agatha lay across her bare chest, ear pressed to the heartbeat she used to pretend she could live without.</p><p> </p><p>Every beat was proof she’d only been lying to herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her thoughts drift back to those earlier years when her eyes would fixate on the spot along Rio’s neck where her pulse beat visibly beneath her skin. She’d always imagine leaning forward, dragging her tongue up that line- something stranger than lust, deeper. A craving to experience Rio with all five senses because watching had been the only thing Agatha could do. </p><p> </p><p>So Agatha watched. Memorized the rhythm of that spot on her neck, the pace of Rio’s breath awake, the slower cadence of it when dreams softened Rio’s face- held on to those details like stolen property, collected and hidden.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was grateful she didn’t have to want from a distance anymore. All the detours, the bad timing, the wrong exits they took on purpose or by mistake- somehow they still ended here. </p><p> </p><p>Her head on Rio’s chest, and she could feel sleep approaching Rio just from the way her breath had evened, from the slight change in the rhythm of her heartbeat beneath her ear. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t have to chase that pulse with her eyes anymore; she could feel it directly. Didn’t have to imagine the taste of it; she could press her lips there and find it. Didn’t have to dream of what its song might sound like; she knew it by heart.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m so in love with you,” Rio murmured, voice softened by the pull of sleep.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha told Rio the same. She pressed a kiss into the warm spot beneath her cheek before settling again. Her hand drifted down to where Rio’s left was resting on her stomach. She toyed with Rio’s ring finger- slipping her own pointer finger under it, sliding her thumb along the length of skin that was far too bare. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha also told herself she was reasonable, that there was no urgency, that wanting something visibly permanent there didn’t mean she needed it now. That she could wait.</p><p> </p><p>But her thumb kept sweeping that same stretch of bare finger, pretending patience was a quality she possessed. And just before sleep took her, she tried convincing herself of it again- that she wasn’t the type to rush, wasn’t irrational. That she could wait.</p><p> </p><p>She was halfway through convincing herself when sleep stepped in, answering on her behalf.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>The next morning, she allowed Jen to ambush her morning run at the park- and by allowed, Agatha obviously meant she’d texted Jen first, which technically counted as an invitation. Rio had gone back to her apartment to collect some more of her belongings, which left Agatha mildly offended that the universe didn’t see fit to teleport it all into her house overnight. Truly, a fucking disappointment. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was also only slightly offended that they still had to do this in sequence: dating and moving boxes, before they could skip to the part where they stood in front of each other, promising forever- like two extremely rational adults. Honestly, Agatha was fucking thrilled with rationality. Ecstatic, even.</p><p> </p><p><em>Anyway. </em></p><p> </p><p>What should have been a run turned into a limp-adjacent walk in which Agatha attempted -heroically- to pretend her body wasn’t protesting yesterday’s enthusiasm. She would argue she sold it perfectly, up until the moment she stepped out of her car and Jen, without greeting, asked why she was moving like she’d recently been tackled by a linebacker.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha answered Jen’s question with the slam of her car door and a look that made it clear she wasn’t interested in elaborating. She headed for the trail without waiting, posture steady enough to suggest she was fine, even though every step reminded her she very much was not.</p><p> </p><p>The sun was out, warming her shoulders just enough to make the weather feel tolerable. She had on leggings, a sweatshirt layered over a long sleeve top, her hair pulled into a ponytail, and a fleece headband to keep her ears protected from the wind. It was enough for the fall chill that she didn’t regret not layering more.</p><p> </p><p>Jen fell into step beside her, undeterred by Agatha’s commitment to not acknowledging the obvious -because god forbid her best friend let Agatha limp in peace- and within seconds said, “Alright- given the way you’re walking, I honestly don’t know whether I should be concerned or impressed.” </p><p> </p><p>“You sound bitter, Jennifer,” Agatha said, eyes forward. “I suggest taking that up with Alice. Ideally before you start projecting it onto my gait.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen laughed. “I’ll be sure to let her know. But seriously- concerned or impressed? Because right now I’m leaning toward concerned.”</p><p> </p><p>“Be impressed. Concern sounds patronizing.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen hummed, considering it, then said casually, “If I didn’t know any better, I’d ask if backdoor activity was involved.”</p><p> </p><p>It should have rolled off Agatha. Should have dissolved into the air like every other ridiculous statement Jen lobbed at her. Instead, Agatha’s spine locked, her throat dried, and her very soul attempted to exit her body through the top of her skull.</p><p> </p><p>Jen noticed.  </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha- no wait.” Jen caught Agatha’s bicep, halting their pace before Agatha could walk away from it. “You actually let her-”</p><p> </p><p>“Jen!” Agatha screeched, a volume that startled even herself. Birds launched out of nearby branches fleeing the scene.</p><p> </p><p>Jen pressed a hand over her own chest. “I am so proud of you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do <em>not </em>congratulate me for that.”</p><p> </p><p>“So I'm not allowed to congratulate you on letting your ridiculously attractive girlfriend-”</p><p> </p><p>“Watch your mouth,” Agatha cut in. “You may be my best friend, but that does not exempt you from my raging jealousy and the questionable choices I’m willing to make involving your physical safety.” She pulled out of Jen’s hold and kept walking- only to immediately turn back around and point a finger in Jen’s face. “And do <em>not </em>let the limp fool you- I am still entirely capable of burying you on this trail.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen grinned. “Threaten me again, it’s oddly motivating.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ma’am, is this woman bothering you?” a stranger coming down the trail asked, glancing between them with concern.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her finger from Jen and turned it on him instead. “Why don’t you mind your own fucking business, buddy?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen immediately hooked her hand through Agatha’s elbow, pulling her forward before she could fire off anything else. She gave the man a bright, overly reassuring smile over her shoulder. “I’m fine! She’s totally harmless.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tore her arm free and spun, walking backward just to keep the stranger in her line of sight- still pointing at him, finger lifted high in very clear dispute.</p><p> </p><p>Jen groaned, grabbing her shoulders and physically turning her forward before she could trip over herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay- enough,” Jen said, finally getting Agatha to walk without doubling back. “Why are you picking fights with strangers? Did Rio leave her dick stuck up your ass or what?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not stuck,” Agatha snapped. “And he started it!” she yelled- at no one now, because the stranger was long gone.</p><p> </p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. “Agatha, come on,” she said. “You don’t invite anyone to run with you. You don’t even like people knowing you run. So if you dragged me into the wilderness for something other than terrorizing pedestrians, you need to spit it out.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped walking. “It was intimate.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen paused next to her, arms folding. “Are we referring to the anal sex with Rio, or did something else monumental occur that you failed to tell me about?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, anal sex with Rio,” Agatha bit out. “And maybe it would be easier if there was anything even remotely funny about it, but there wasn’t. It was the complete fucking opposite, Jennifer. It was intimate- like <em>sickeningly </em>intimate.” She exhaled hard. “And now I feel like one of those omegas from those fanfictions you used to read- where one night means biological imprinting and lifelong territorial attachment.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen stared at Agatha, dumbfounded. </p><p> </p><p><em>Fair. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha was aware of how insane she sounded, but what else was new. </p><p> </p><p>Jen blinked hard, opened her mouth, then closed it again, clearly trying to figure out where to begin.</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, she eventually landed on,</p><p> </p><p>“First of all, let’s not rewrite history. <em>You</em> introduced me to omegaverse fanfiction-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made an immediate attempt to sidestep her, but Jen stepped directly into her path, one finger raised.</p><p> </p><p>“Put the finger down, Jennifer.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t. If anything, her eyes narrowed- connecting dots Agatha definitely did not want connected.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Jen said slowly, “are we spiraling because you’re planning on proposing to her? Is that where this is going?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha choked on nothing- air, oxygen, reality. She laughed, brittle and entirely unconvincing, because of course Jen would leap there. </p><p> </p><p>“That-” Agatha forced out, tone wobbling between amusement and sheer fucking disbelief that Jen would say something like that out loud, “That is exactly what I am <em>not </em>going to do.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Jen asked.</p><p> </p><p><em>Stupid question. </em></p><p> </p><p>They had already very vaguely circled this topic at the bar last week -Agatha had presented the same crisis, Jen had responded with unhelpful reassurance- and for some reason Agatha thought trying again in daylight would yield better results. Which was objectively idiotic.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I-” Agatha’s mouth just… stalled.</p><p> </p><p>Jen looked at Agatha like that was the entire answer- like nothing else needed to be debated. Which only enraged Agatha further.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m trying to not behave like I’ve completely lost my fucking mind,” Agatha shouted, hands slicing through the air. “To at least <em>attempt</em> being a reasonable -functional- adult who follows events in the correct order like normal people do. And proposing right now would be fucking insane. Like- book-me-a-psych-evaluation insane.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen laughed- harder than the situation warranted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fixed her with a murderous stare. “Do you want to die? Because I’m pretty sure this counts as grounds for homicide.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen wiped her eyes, still amused. “I know. I know. I’m sorry. It’s just- can you name one time in your life where you have ever behaved like a reasonable person?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, ready to launch into a rebuttal- but nothing arrived.</p><p> </p><p>Silence. Damning. </p><p> </p><p>“Right,” Jen breathed, softer now, stepping into the space Agatha had accidentally left exposed. “You already know the ending to this,” she went on. “You’re not confused, Agatha. You’re not undecided. You’re just trying to rationalize something that has never responded to logic where the two of you are concerned. And waiting? It doesn’t protect you. It just gives you more time to pretend your hesitation is something other than you punishing yourself for wanting more.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away, jaw clenched, because Jen wasn’t entirely wrong and Agatha was fucking furious about it.</p><p> </p><p>“You also don’t make decisions like a normal person. You never have. You commit like someone jumping out of a moving vehicle. And for what it’s worth? Rio’s never once treated that as something you needed to change. None of us have.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen is right. Agatha doesn’t even argue it. But Jen’s words don’t soothe her the way they were meant to. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha has always been painfully aware of herself in ways most people never have to be. She knows she can be a lot- selfish in the ways she loves, irrational when she’s scared, unreasonable the second she allows her heart to get involved. She makes decisions already bracing for impact instead of just slowing down. She has never been the restful option; she has never been the version of love that conserves energy.</p><p> </p><p>And that… can drain a person.</p><p> </p><p>Jen is right- Rio has never once asked her to change any of it. But that almost makes it worse, because Rio stands in perfect contrast to every trait Agatha knows gets her dismissed as difficult. Rio is composed where she’s combustible, patient where she’s volatile, rooted where she’s restless.</p><p> </p><p>And if Rio is all the things Agatha has never managed to be, then Agatha’s fear becomes impossible to ignore: loving Agatha might feel less like partnership and more like weathering a storm that refuses to settle. When does her chaos stop being charming and start being a drain, when does asking for more become asking for too much, what if Rio gives so much of herself to Agatha that there’s nothing left?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha has zero interest in what those answers might be.</p><p> </p><p>Now, Agatha spotted her car waiting in the parking lot at the trailhead, something ordinary, and unmoved in a day that suddenly wasn’t. And it stirs her oldest, most primitive instinct now that she’s been shoved toward that familiar rush of panic where every thought turns into momentum, and protecting herself looks suspiciously like preparing to bolt.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, stepping just slightly out of Jen’s reach. “Well, Jenny, thank you for the motivational failure,” she said, inching backward instead of toward her car. “I regret to inform you that yet again your reassurance doesn’t actually resolve anything.” </p><p> </p><p>Jen opened her mouth, clearly about to soften the truth into something Agatha might be more willing to stomach, but Agatha was already shaking her head.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to screw this up with her again, Jen,” Agatha said, and the admission came out far more vulnerable than she intended. “I promise. I don’t want to do that.”</p><p> </p><p>“You won’t,” Jen answered, far too certain for anything that involved Agatha Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>“I just need to run a little longer, alright? Clear my head, yeah? Just- just- let me-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heel caught on the uneven ground, and the stumble propelled her into motion before she could reconsider. She turned away from Jen and started running- far faster than she should have been able to move after the way her body felt this morning- and she didn’t look back. </p><p> </p><p>Her legs burned and her lungs felt like sandpaper, but it didn’t slow her. She wasn’t running away from anything; she just couldn’t stay still. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew she would have to reckon with the reality that everything she ever felt for Rio always existed at a volume as disproportionate as Agatha felt she was as a person- too intense, too consuming, too much.</p><p> </p><p><em>“You come on too strong,” </em>her mother had said once, when Agatha asked why one kid in her class never wanted to hangout with her. </p><p> </p><p><em>“A leech,”</em> she’d been called another time- because she needed twenty dollars for a field trip.</p><p> </p><p><em>“You’re so goddamn exhausting,” </em>her mother snapped once, though Agatha had been needling her on purpose that day and almost thought she deserved it.</p><p> </p><p><em>“You’re too intense. There’s a way to make a point without steamrolling the entire conversation. It’s overwhelming,”</em> Wanda had told her once. They’d barely settled into Chicago- she’d launched into a tangent at one of Wanda’s coworkers about how shit the weather was there compared to Westview.</p><p> </p><p>All of it started playing on a loop in Agatha’s head. </p><p> </p><p>No one had ever taught her how to do this correctly. How to tend to something without killing it. How to love without saturating every inch of the person she loved. How to want without needing more. How to simply be without feeling like an excess of herself.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha <em>knew </em>she was capable of loving Rio correctly, she just didn’t seem to have the evidence she could sustain it.</p><p> </p><p>She worried that her own need would outpace what was fair to ask for, that she wouldn’t know when to stop reaching, that one day she’d turn around and find she had taken more than Rio ever intended to give. And then what? What would she possibly do with the version of herself left standing there- empty handed, still wanting more, and fully aware that she caused the emptiness?</p><p> </p><p>The thought gnawed at Agatha as she ran- until she finally slowed, lungs catching, vision clearing enough to recognize where she had ended up.</p><p> </p><p>Their house. Rio’s car in the driveway.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t an exit strategy or a hiding place or some metaphor for self sabotage. It was simply the place she had fled in a blind panic about taking too much, only to land at the one point in her life where she had never actually managed to do that. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt ridiculous even thinking it- that she subconsciously refused to sprint herself into isolation and instead dragged her back to the part of her world that had never dimmed under storm. If anything, her life somehow managed to grow brighter when she blew through it.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora Harkness had once told her that loving Agatha required stamina, that she took too much, demanded too much, wore people out. And Agatha realized, with a surge of disgust, that the words had stuck deeper than she ever intended to let them. Evanora didn’t deserve a second of reflection, let alone acknowledgment that she had ever managed to get inside Agatha’s head.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that was true. Maybe it wasn’t. Still, Evanora’s words didn’t survive contact with the evidence of Agatha’s actual life.</p><p> </p><p>Jen, who had witnessed Agatha at her absolute worst more times than either of them could count, wouldn’t have kept her around for over twenty years if Agatha’s presence siphoned the life out of her. Alice, who was partial to Rio in ways Agatha couldn’t fault her for, had never once looked at Agatha like deadweight Rio was forced to haul around. Not even on the days Agatha made everything harder than it needed to be.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena, who had gone out of her way more than once to keep Agatha from imploding. She didn’t do that out of pity. She didn’t act like it was a chore. She never looked at Agatha like stabilizing her was too much to manage. Billy, who was frankly <em>too</em> obsessed with Agatha for anyone’s comfort -Agatha’s especially- never treated her like someone who smothered a room. He hovered, he fixated, he asked too many questions, he followed her around. If she truly drained people, Billy would’ve burned out on her months ago. Instead, he only seemed to get worse.</p><p> </p><p>Sage, who had every reason to guard Rio from anyone capable of hurting her big sister, never acted like Agatha was a risk she needed to keep an eye on. She didn’t treat her with polite caution or stiff tolerance; she treated her like someone worth knowing. Because she wanted to- not because Rio asked her to.</p><p> </p><p>And Lilia… well, Lilia was the real test, wasn’t she? Because Lilia wouldn’t have let Agatha through her front door the first time, let alone welcome her back after everything went to shit, if she believed any of that about Agatha. Lilia didn’t hesitate, didn’t hedge, didn’t tolerate threats to her family. And she’d let Agatha in- <em>twice</em>.</p><p> </p><p>And beyond Lilia’s verdict, there was the proof that mattered most- Rio was in that house waiting for Agatha. Rio was inside that house choosing Agatha- not in theory, not in memory, but every single day. She knew every unreasonable corner Agatha tried to hide, every intensity she tried to mute, every demand Agatha feared was too much, and she never once turned any of it into something Agatha had to apologize for.</p><p> </p><p>That kind of consistency wasn't a coincidence. That amount of evidence didn’t lie. That many people couldn’t possibly misinterpret Agatha at the same time. Agatha wasn’t oblivious enough to ignore that. Well- she could be, if it suited her. It just happened that today, the facts were flattering.</p><p> </p><p>Her phone started vibrating hard against her ribs, interrupting whatever was left of her thoughts. Breathless, she dug a hand under her sweatshirt and long sleeve, fingertips fumbling inside the fabric of her sports bra until she got hold of it and pulled it free.</p><p> </p><p><em>Jen.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the screen, let the call ring, while she sent a short text to her saying that she was back home. She chose to ignore the part where she had apparently run six miles home without thinking about it.</p><p> </p><p>The second the ringing stopped, she didn’t wait for Jen to try again. She swiped through her contacts, thumb hovering only briefly before landing on the name she needed and pressed the phone to her ear.</p><p> </p><p>It rang twice before it was answered.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Love</em>,” Lilia answered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had never understood what about her warranted a nickname that gentle -never knew whether it came from habit or some unnerving clarity on Lilia’s part- but it disoriented Agatha every time. Her head tipped back, eyes closing for a beat choosing to let softness sit where it landed instead of pushing it away.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Lil.”</p><p> </p><p><em>“I swear I was just thinking about you. You sound winded. Tell me what’s wrong.”</em></p><p> </p><p>She lowered her head, swallowed hard, her fingers rubbing at her forehead.  “Nothing,” she breathed, absolutely still winded. “Nothing’s wrong.” She glanced back toward the house- the flowerbed, the evenly trimmed grass, the things Rio tended because she believed they were worth the trouble.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her heart might explode into petals. </p><p> </p><p><em>“Talk to me,”</em> Lilia said, soft but urging.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit down on the inside of her cheek. “I really love her, you know,” she whispered. </p><p> </p><p><em>“So much it scares you.”</em></p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha managed.</p><p> </p><p><em>“It’s meant to shake you a little. That’s how you know you’re doing it right.”</em></p><p> </p><p>“Feels like I’m doing it backwards,” Agatha said quietly.</p><p> </p><p><em>“If you end up in the right place, does it matter how you got there?” </em>Lilia asked.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha admitted. “I suppose it doesn’t.” </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t bother pushing the point- logic wasn’t why she called, and Lilia definitely knew that. Lilia always knew more than she should, which only made this worse.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Lilia said, and just her tone was enough.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed the phone to her forehead, resisting the urge to beat herself unconscious with it, then exhaled and brought it back to her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m trying to do this right,” Agatha muttered.</p><p> </p><p><em>“Oh, you don’t need my permission. But humor me. I want to hear you name what you want.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha blew out a frustrated breath, her lips sputtering with it. “You just want to hear me embarrass myself is what it is,” she mumbled, nudging her toe against the pavement.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia hummed. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “I’m calling to let you know I’m about to ask your daughter to marry me… so you don’t unleash whatever witchery you keep for those who forget to inform you.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia laughed, the sound bright with joy.</p><p> </p><p><em>“Don’t keep your heart waiting. You’re home, Agatha. Go on now- go inside. I love you, sweet girl.”</em></p><p> </p><p>“I love you too, Lil. I’ll call you after, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p><br/><em>“Of course,”</em> Lilia said<em>. “I’ll be here. I’ll be thinking of you. Bye now.”</em></p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>One might have expected Agatha to do something extremely reckless with a realization like this. That she’d tear through the front door with a fire lit under her ass and say too much and say it too fast- say something she could absolutely not take back. That she’d turn certainty into action before fear had the chance to ask her any inconvenient follow up questions.</p><p> </p><p>That had always been Agatha’s specialty. Feel first. Launch second. Then deal with the wreckage in whatever order it presents itself.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that was the plan when she walked into their house. Maybe not. Agatha wouldn’t know. Maybe she just <em>felt</em> like it was, which wasn’t the same thing. Rio had been right a couple weeks ago when she said Agatha had fast feet- too fast, sometimes, Agatha thought, for even herself to keep up with. So it wasn’t a stretch to admit that she had never been great at knowing when she <em>meant </em>to do something. Only that, by the time she noticed, she was already in the middle of it. </p><p> </p><p>Because really, she had nothing to show for it: no plan, no ring burning a hole in her pocket, no romantic speech waiting in the wings to ambush her common sense. Still, Agatha was aware, with an odd lack of urgency, that she was going to ask Rio to marry her today. Or rather, make it known that it wasn’t a question so much as a demand- and not one that was open to debate.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was stretched across the couch, watching that political comedy she liked- the one Agatha pretended not to follow but somehow always knew the plot of. She looked completely at ease, one arm draped along the back of the cushions, legs curled under her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped just inside the entryway to the living room, staring at Rio- abruptly aware of herself in every uncomfortable way: her heartbeat, the sweat cooling on her skin, the trail dirt covering her clothes, and the fact that Rio was now looking at her without the faintest idea she’d just run six miles home in what Agatha would eventually admit was a minor crash out.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, with a smile that was too sweet to be anything other than genuine. “You’re home.”</p><p> </p><p>That alone almost did it.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha knew, with absolute certainty, that Rio would not mind if Agatha burst through the house right now and proposed in exactly this state. Dirt and sweat would, if anything, be a bonus.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha wanted to shower. Wanted to get a handle on the physical buzz still humming through her, making everything in her body louder than it had any right to be. She wanted to be <em>in</em> the moment, not gasping for air because she’d decided to run six miles home.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha wouldn’t make a scene, she decided. Instead, she nodded, a small smile settling on her mouth- something she had started to notice happening more often lately. Something her face did, and seemed to save only for coming home to Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha breathed. “I am.”</p><p> </p><p>“I missed you,” Rio said, already reaching for Agatha. “Come kiss me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved like a fucking moth drawn helplessly to a flame.</p><p> </p><p>“I should probably go shower,” Agatha mumbled, even as she took Rio’s hand and let herself be guided to sit on the edge of the couch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, eyes flicking over Agatha with clear interest. “I’m not really seeing an issue,” she murmured, already close enough that her words brushed Agatha’s lips before she kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>A few more unhurried kisses were pressed onto Agatha’s lips, Rio still holding Agatha’s fingers, Rio’s thumb brushing over Agatha’s ring finger like it had a mind of its own, and Agatha was in no state to even privately acknowledge that she had noticed that.</p><p> </p><p>She only blinked, letting herself float in the wake of Rio’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>“You go roll around in the dirt before you come home to me, Agatha? You dog,” Rio said lightly, eyes bright and just a little wicked. Then, softer, closer- “I’m so fucking into you.” Stealing another kiss, catching Agatha’s lower lip between her teeth. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a sound that was supposed to be a laugh. It came out wrong -a moan- which felt rude, frankly. She put a hand on Rio’s chest and nudged her back, just enough to create the illusion of control. </p><p> </p><p>Rio let it happen, smiling at Agatha in a pleased way that suggested <em>Rio was not</em>, in fact, under any illusions at all.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna go shower,” Agatha said, standing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up at her, eyes still warm, still amused. “Am I invited?”</p><p> </p><p>Under any other circumstances, Agatha would have said yes- immediately and enthusiastically and with very little dignity. But this wasn’t a normal circumstance, and Agatha wasn’t reacting to it normally.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted this feeling, even if she didn’t entirely approve of it. There was anticipation in it, and something almost foolishly excited too- the thrill of knowing that she was going to ask a question that Rio was entirely unaware of.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, made a show of pretending to consider the invitation, and then very deliberately began backing away- careful not to trip over her own smile.</p><p> </p><p>Rio squinted at Agatha, her mouth parting as she watched- intrigued, slightly offended, maybe even a little impressed that Agatha hadn’t said yes immediately.</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” Agatha offered, stopping at the edge of the living room, “you should probably stay here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped and, instead of answering, she started crawling the length of the couch toward Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Why, my love?” Rio demanded.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach dipped at the sight of Rio on all fours, crawling toward her with an intention that felt unfairly persuasive. She crossed her arms, like that might stop the thing in her chest from screaming <em>yes, Rio</em> just because she had told herself <em>no. </em></p><p> </p><p>“You’re being dramatic,” Agatha said, because that part was true.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kept crawling. “I am being <em>wronged</em>,” she corrected- and Agatha’s heart, affronted in tandem, pitched a fit of its own in solidarity. “I deserve to know why.”</p><p> </p><p>“Consider it a consequence for violating house policy,” Agatha said, tipping her chin, and very pointedly flicking her eyes toward Rio’s shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped mid crawl and leaned back on her heels. “My sincerest apologies,” she said sweetly. “I forget how strict management is.” Then promptly tugged her hoodie up and over her head, letting it fall to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, pleased, as moved toward to the back of the L-shaped couch. Rio shifted forward to meet her, circling her arms around Agatha’s neck. Agatha’s hands slid over Rio’s bare back, dragging her nails down warm skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Is this satisfactory, or do I need to demonstrate further compliance?” Rio muttered, eyelashes fluttering as Agatha rested her mouth at Rio’s cheek. </p><p> </p><p>“Satisfactory? No,” Agatha said. Then she brushed her lips against a hickey under Rio’s jaw, kissed it gently, almost apologetically. “But I think I’m bored now.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio inhaled sharply and tilted her head, giving Agatha more access to her neck. “Bored?” she repeated, disbelieving. “Baby, don’t do this to me. Let me come shower with you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not happening,” Agatha said, dragging her tongue slowly up the full length of Rio’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned, then laughed under her breath, like she wasn’t sure whether to be offended or turned on. And Agatha pulled her head back from Rio’s neck to see her. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re being very strange,” Rio muttered, and she sounded like she meant it as a compliment.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly groaned. Rio knew her too well -like the back of her fucking hand too well- and in hindsight that probably should’ve been reason enough for Agatha not to linger like this. She should’ve gone straight upstairs to the bathroom, showered, and not let herself get distracted.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio had always been an expert at throwing her off course. And Agatha -despite her best efforts- was, in fact, thoroughly and fucking successfully distracted. So she blurted, “Let me cook dinner for you tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>“Date night?” Rio asked, a shit eating grin already taking over her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Agatha said, kissing the corner of Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, when you put it like that…” Rio said, leaning in and stealing a real kiss. “Maybe we should partake in anal sex more often.” She pulled back just enough to look at Agatha, eyes playfully narrowed. “It’s <em>clearly </em>turned you into a romantic.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, smiling. “Am I free to go shower now?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll hurry?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Obviously. You’ll be here when I get back?” Agatha asked, like she didn’t already know the answer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded immediately. “You couldn’t get rid of me if you tried.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a huff, suddenly breathless with how easy it was to love Rio Vidal, and how natural it felt to ask and be answered without doubt.</p><p> </p><p>“Kiss me before you go,” Rio said, theatrically, both hands cradling Agatha’s face. “It feels cruel to leave me here alone like this. I’ll suffer terribly.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll survive,” Agatha said flatly. She leaned in and kissed Rio anyway, because she was a hypocrite. Full of shit, truly. “You’re very brave.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile was lazy and lopsided and stupidly fucking sweet. “Thank you for believing in me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled away before that smile could talk her into jumping the gun.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>After a shower hot enough to leave her feeling newly skinned, Agatha behaved with an almost insulting level of normalcy.</p><p> </p><p>She sat on the bed with her back against the headboard, pillows stacked behind her, body wrapped in a towel with her hair wrapped in another. Phone in hand, she casually scrolled through county clerk websites, marriage license info, and appointment availability with the focus of someone preparing for a heist.</p><p> </p><p>And surprisingly, looking into these logistics was unexpectedly satisfying. It was new, it was hers, and it was about Rio, which made all the difference. Agatha hadn’t handled any of this in a previous marriage that shall not be named, and she took absolute pleasure in the fact that this particular effort had never been spent on anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>Across the bedroom, Rio had pushed the sleeves of her hoodie up and kept bumping her elbow against the doorframe every time she went back into the closet to rearrange something that did not, as far as Agatha could tell, require rearranging. </p><p> </p><p>Though she knew long before Rio ever moved in that her idea of “organized” and whatever Rio’s idea of it was were two completely different concepts. Agatha, who had never had a system beyond “wherever it lands,” was super weirdly into it.</p><p> </p><p>“I admire your confidence in assuming all of this is necessary,” Agatha said, mostly because she wanted to bother Rio and had grown tired of waiting for a better reason to do so.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s absolutely necessary,” Rio said. “You have the organizational skills of a toddler, and I love you too much to let you live like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head toward the nightstand and briefly considered a rebuttal that involved throwing the coffee mug sitting there directly at Rio’s head, but Rio cut in before she could commit. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re going to get sick of me being here all the time,” Rio said, her smile so blindingly pretty it could have burned Agatha’s retinas out if she let herself look at it for too long.</p><p> </p><p>“Highly unlikely,” Agatha muttered, mostly to herself, as she continued scrolling on her phone, which was open to the website listing available appointments for marriage licenses.</p><p> </p><p>Her thumb hovered over the screen when she saw the earliest available option.</p><p> </p><p><em>Tomorrow.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha immediately started scheming on how to convince Rio to take the next two weeks off of work- and whether she could do it within the next twelve hours without resorting to blackmail or throwing a fucking fit.</p><p> </p><p>Two weeks definitely felt excessive and completely unreasonable, which was how most of Agatha’s decisions tended to start. But not including time for just-married activities would be objectively fucking stupid, and Agatha had no intention of skipping that part. Which meant that before she could get attached to the idea of tomorrow, she had to Google it.</p><p> </p><p>There was, as it turned out, a waiting period.</p><p> </p><p>The state of New Jersey apparently required three full days between wanting to marry Rio Vidal (aquiring their marriage license) and actually being allowed to marry Rio Vidal. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha found that rude and irritating… Agatha booked the appointment. </p><p> </p><p>She read the confirmation screen twice before screenshotting the list of what they’d need to bring, pointedly not thinking about the fact that she’d just put herself on a fucking time crunch <em>or </em>that it required a conversation with Rio she had not yet had.</p><p> </p><p>This is how Agatha found herself opening her messages and composing multiple texts to Jen with the urgency of someone trying not to fucking scream.</p><p> </p><p>The first text was an apology only by definition- wildly unserious, excessively affectionate. She ended it in a dramatic declaration of love meant to retroactively excuse her hostility that morning and preemptively excuse the damage coming next.</p><p> </p><p>Since Jen was a charge nurse -by some merciful act of a god who had to be a woman given Agatha’s luck- she was conviently the one who handled scheduling for the entire NICU. </p><p> </p><p>So Agatha’s second text contained her first actual request- whether there was any universe in which Agatha’s scheduled shifts for the next two weeks could quietly be switched over to PTO. If not, could that universe be created? The details of the bribery that followed were unimportant. If that universe still refused to exist, the flu was imminent.</p><p> </p><p>The third text asked Jen to tell Alice to retrieve Agatha’s car from the park and bring it to the house, saving Agatha from the inconvenient questions of a beautiful woman who took entirely too much pleasure in asking them.</p><p> </p><p>Long story short, Jennifer Kale must be in love with Agatha Harkness, because Agatha secured the next two weeks off receiving only one very threatening text -that Agatha better provide the date and time of this mysterious event or face consequences she could not fathom- and one follow up question asking whether Jen would be needing to bring her professional camera.</p><p> </p><p>Only twenty minutes later, Agatha’s Ring app pinged. Someone was in the driveway. The grainy video showed her car parked neatly beside Rio’s, and Alice flipping off the camera with both hands, smiling proudly.</p><p> </p><p>It was annoying how safe that made Agatha feel. That she’d somehow surrounded herself with people who let her be strange and intense and treated it like a feature instead of a flaw.</p><p> </p><p><em>Anyway. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her messages again and found Lilia’s name.</p><p> </p><p>She typed something that tried very hard to sound normal- that no, she hadn’t asked yet, that yes, she was going to, that it would be tonight and that Lilia’s witchery was not to interfere under any circumstances. She stared at the text, added a period, deleted the period, substituted it with an <em>lol</em>, and sent it.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia replied almost immediately with a string of emojis that made absolutely no fucking sense, which answered exactly one question: Rio hadn’t gotten far in her long running attempt to convince her mother to stop texting exclusively in emojis.</p><p> </p><p>Rio knocked her elbow against the closet doorframe again, and the sound pulled Agatha’s attention back into the room, to the woman all of this was about.</p><p> </p><p>There was something exhilarating about watching Rio fold laundry and hang clothes and exist without the faintest idea that she was going to drop -what Agatha would consider- a small bomb into her lap tonight.</p><p> </p><p>That thrill followed Agatha to the grocery store.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabbed a basket and immediately detoured toward the display of twelve packs of Diet Coke by the entrance without checking whether they needed it, whether Agatha was out, or whether it was on the list at all, and Agatha felt her stomach swoop at the confidence of it- the assumption of continuity, of shared resources, of a shared life.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood behind her in a state of bliss, uncomfortably close to actually drooling, while Rio compared different boxes of pasta with an unsettling seriousness. The arousal Agatha felt -brought on by something this aggressively mundane- was irrational, and therefore deeply convincing.</p><p> </p><p>She watched Rio weigh ingredients for the dinner Agatha was allegedly responsible for tonight and caught herself thinking about the word <em>fiancée</em>- about how briefly she intended to be one, about how she didn’t have a ring and didn’t care, because choosing one with Rio would be better. Stupidly hotter, even.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced over her shoulder, smiling. “You’re staring,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged, entirely unapologetic. “You’re very stare-able.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed under her breath and turned back to the shelf. “I love you,” she said without turning around- certain, like she’d never known a version of that sentence that wasn’t attached to Agatha Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s increasingly urgent desire to marry that insufferable woman was obviously doing irreversible damage to her frontal lobe, because the next thing out of her mouth was, “I love you. And if you don’t let me put my mouth on you in the next two minutes, I’ll kill myself.”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t anyone’s business if Rio immediately dragged Agatha out to the car and they disappeared for twenty minutes. They came back like nothing happened- only to find their cart gone, their groceries reshelved by some overly helpful employee with no goddamn respect for spontaneous sexual activity. They had to start their grocery shopping all over.</p><p> </p><p>Though Agatha wanted to make it everyone’s business- that she got Rio off in under fifteen minutes, with nothing but Rio in her lap, rocking and gasping while Agatha kept her mouth locked to her chest, licking and sucking until her nipples were swollen and raw and Rio was nearly sobbing from it.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha was smug enough to enjoy the aftermath: watching Rio try to keep a straight face while her nipples stayed hard and visible beneath her sweatshirt- still overly sensitive, reacting to every shift of the fabric like they hadn’t realized Agatha’s mouth was gone.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>It went without saying that her offer to cook required Rio’s involvement; left unsupervised, Agatha could burn water and had set off more than her fair share of smoke alarms. Which meant that the level of complexity unfolding in front of her was now miles beyond whatever she’d imagined when she’d volunteered in the first place. In hindsight, she probably should’ve seen that coming. </p><p> </p><p>There was a sealed package of raw chicken sitting in the fridge with the implication that she would be asked to touch something she very strongly did not want to touch, along with more ingredients than she thought necessary, more steps than she had patience for, and a level of attention being applied to all of it that felt excessive for something that would be eaten in twenty minutes.</p><p> </p><p>And still, Agatha found that she wasn’t offended by any of it, which felt like a personal failing, because it meant she was enjoying this absolutely unhinged level of orchestration.</p><p> </p><p>She stood at the counter chopping vegetables while Rio was perched on it beside her; one foot tucked under her, the other swinging just enough to tap the cabinet, offering commentary that was either helpful or unnecessary depending on how charitable Agatha was feeling.</p><p> </p><p>Music was drifting into the kitchen from the living room- Hozier spinning on Rio’s record player, balanced on the battered stand Agatha had once watched Rio guard with her life the moment she laid eyes on it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pretended to find Rio’s music intolerable. Rio pretended to believe her. And as far as Agatha was concerned, she’d always keep that particular bit going. She liked the tiny tell Rio always gave when she knew Agatha wasn’t fooling anyone- brown eyes flicking away, teeth catching the inside of her cheek, a faint blush on her cheeks she could never stop.</p><p> </p><p>She moved to slap Rio’s hand away from the cutting board, only for Rio to dodge her- snatching another piece of bell pepper and shoving it into her mouth before Agatha could land the hit. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was still chewing, far too pleased with herself, when her phone pinged in her hand. With a mouth full, she managed a muffled, “Oh-” pointed at her phone and angled it toward Agatha in a wordless demand for her attention.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned the volume up and Sage’s voice came through, unsettlingly chipper at first- </p><p> </p><p><em>“Roo! Hey! I was just thinking about you -about how much joy you bring into my life- and that somehow made me think of that trip to Boston we took with Mom like two and a half years ago. Remember that? I bought that brown hoodie from the gift shop in the airport? You remember. Soft as hell, kind of oversized, and every time I wear it you make a point to call it ugly- which it’s not, by the way…</em></p><p> </p><p><em>I went to grab it this morning, because I was cold. And you’ll never guess what I found. Nothing. As in: I know you fucking took it because you’re a goddamn THIEF-”</em> The scream was sudden, explosive, loud enough that Agatha jerked her head back slightly. On the voice note, Sage inhaled. Loud, deliberate, through her whole ribcage to hold her rage in place, it seemed. <em>“You have twenty-four hours to return it. Or. Else. Love you. Bye.”</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio was currently grinning at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Correction: Rio was currently grinning at Agatha <em>while wearing the brown Boston hoodie.</em> The same one she’d had on when Agatha got home that morning. The same one she’d changed out of to go to the grocery store- and then changed <em>right back into</em> the second they got home.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at Rio for a second, set the knife down, then turned fully to her, lowering her voice as she played into it. “It’s actually a pretty nice hoodie.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a great hoodie. I’ve been trying to steal it since she got it,” Rio said softly, her mouth curving like she was enjoying this.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, I can’t blame you. The quality’s solid, the color works, and it has that overpriced airport gift shop energy. I’m sure it cost a stupid amount of money.”</p><p> </p><p>“It was like a hundred bucks,” Rio said under her breath, evidently still offended by the price. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “That’s- yeah- I mean that’s diabolical.”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said, pleased. “Now you see why I had to do it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached out then and caught her elbow, steering Agatha’s hand to rest on her thigh. Agatha stepped closer, easing Rio’s free leg off the counter so she could step between them, her fingers sliding up her legs, pushing under the leg openings of her boxers.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me ask you this,” Rio said. “Would you rather pay a hundred dollars for this hoodie… or pay a hundred dollars to have me deal with raw chicken so you never have to again?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, her nails digging into the sides of Rio’s thighs. “Stupid question. One of those purchases would resolve a lifelong inconvenience. The other is a hoodie.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pursed her lips, raised her brows, and gave one shoulder a little shrug- like she was trying not to chase the implications of the word <em>lifelong</em>. Brown skittered from blue to Agatha’s shoulder; she reached up and flicked a finger at something that wasn’t there.</p><p> </p><p>The emotional equivalent of darcyphilia, Agatha’s mind diagnosed- as she suddenly felt an exquisite ache as Rio’s thoracic cavity split open with a ceremonial violence, parting like cathedral doors to bare a heart sobbing itself hoarse over desires it feared was too soon to ask for. The sight was grotesque and gorgeous, curling low in Agatha’s stomach, and she couldn’t look away from it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes found Agatha’s again. Her fingers drifted from Agatha’s shoulder to the hair at the base of her skull, thumb pressing firmly into Agatha’s jaw, tipping her face up. </p><p> </p><p>“Stupid answer,” Rio muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated how easily her brain gave way to thinking with her dick when it came to Rio- how little effort Rio had to put into it. </p><p> </p><p>“You asked a question. I answered it,” Agatha breathed, her nails dragging slowly down Rio’s thighs.</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>“No?” Agatha asked, playing dumb.</p><p> </p><p>Rio dipped her head, and pressed a soft, teasing kiss to Agatha’s lips. “Try again,” she urged as she pulled back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she slid one hand between Rio’s thighs, pressing the knuckle of her pointer finger against Rio’s front. “I don’t care about the hoodie. And you’d handle the raw chicken for me for free because you’re severely unwell and obsessed with me. So I’m saving a hundred bucks either way.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a breathy huff and gently caught Agatha’s wrist between her legs, guiding her hand away and settling it back on her thigh.</p><p> </p><p><em>Uh oh. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Okay. No loopholes,” Rio said, chin tipping up. “You don’t get me for free. Now answer.”</p><p> </p><p>“I would bankrupt myself for you, baby,” Agatha pushed up on her toes, aiming for Rio’s mouth like a threat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back just out of reach, smiling like she’d just heard exactly what she wanted to hear. “That’s a very generous offer,” she said, spreading her legs wider as she moved Agatha’s hand back between her thighs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wished she wasn’t so affected by the whole ‘being rewarded for good behavior’ thing, but her stomach soared anyway. </p><p> </p><p>She brushed her knuckle up and down Rio’s front and tried to look down, tried to watch herself touch Rio- but Rio stopped her. Her thumb resisted the movement of Agatha’s head, keeping her gaze where Rio wanted it.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m a very generous person,” Agatha murmured, trying to sell it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes down at Agatha, clearly trying to focus despite what Agatha was doing to her, her lips pressing into a flat line. “Hm,” was all she gave. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha might have been thinking with her dick with Rio sitting in front of her like this, but she was capable of more than one thought at a time- her priorities were still very much in order, “Think it’s my turn to ask you a question,” she said, pressing her knuckle firmly into Rio’s clit beneath the fabric.</p><p> </p><p>Rio puffed out a breath and her body tipped forward. “Shoot,” she squeaked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved her hand away from Rio’s front. She rested both palms on Rio’s thighs again, standing at the edge of something that felt a lot like jumping without knowing if there was a net.</p><p> </p><p>“Dance with me,” Agatha said softly.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the question that had been pressing at the back of her teeth across what felt like several lifetimes, across several universes- but maybe that was the point.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was, and always had been, particularly vulnerable to romance- and Agatha knew that. Agatha knew everything about Rio-</p><p> </p><p>So when she watched Rio’s face soften and the color fade from it, as if that one request had touched her more intimately than Agatha’s hands ever could have, Agatha was not surprised.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Rio’s voice pitched, her mouth left parted in the wake of it, as if her body didn’t know whether Agatha had asked her to dance or slipped two fingers inside of her and curled them just right.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed. “Do you want to?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes didn’t leave her face. “You know I do.”</p><p> </p><p>“Cool,” Agatha whispered, nodding- and then realized, belatedly, Rio had nowhere to go with Agatha still standing between her and the floor. She cleared her throat, stepped back, and held out a hand to help Rio down, managing a tight smile that did nothing to soothe the burn in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Then they were in the middle of the kitchen staring at each other.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha noted that this was, objectively, an extremely gay fucking situation- slow dancing in a kitchen with the woman she was in love with while fucking Hozier droned on in the background. </p><p> </p><p><em>Mortifying.</em></p><p> </p><p>She stepped closer anyway, let their chests brush- and then paused, caught between wanting this and not knowing how to exist inside it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio helped her out, bringing one hand to the nape of Agatha’s neck and Agatha felt herself soften into it. She let out a slow breath and slid her arm around Rio’s waist, fingers fidgeting with the hem of the hoodie before easing her hand beneath it to find the comfort of Rio’s skin. Their other hands found each other off to the side.</p><p> </p><p>“I-” Agatha cut herself off with a breath that almost turned into a laugh, her eyes skittering uselessly before landing on the record player against the wall in the living room. </p><p> </p><p>Then, because avoidance had never actually worked for her, she looked back to the brown that hadn’t once stopped boring into her soul the moment they started swaying. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m feeling a bit awkward.” </p><p> </p><p>There it was- that new and deeply inconvenient development where Agatha’s mouth had started reporting directly to her heart.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, meanwhile, looked like she felt the opposite of awkward. She looked… undone by all of this. Soft. Like she was actively in love, like she was standing in the middle of it and not even trying to hide. Like she would cross seven seas and rewrite maps just to arrive breathless in front of Agatha, exactly like this. </p><p> </p><p>It was unfair. It was terrifying. It made Agatha’s own awkwardness feel survivable. It was everything.</p><p> </p><p>“I love this. I love <em>you</em>,” Rio said, simply. Her hand squeezed Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Me too,” Agatha whispered, and the truth of it felt warm and frightening- loving this, loving Rio, loving even the foolishness of standing here swaying, absolutely drunk in the name of love and not pretending to be anything else.</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” Rio started, her voice slipping into a light, playful lilt as they swayed together, “I noticed something peculiar this morning.” </p><p> </p><p>“It’s peculiar that you’re using the word <em>peculiar</em>,” Agatha replied, trying very hard to sound dry. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. It was really bizarre, actually,” Rio went on, like she was thinking out loud. “Let me set the scene for you, my love,” she continued. “My very beautiful <em>girlfriend</em>-”</p><p> </p><p>Instead of taking issue with how criminally undersized that word felt, Agatha let herself feel the irritating rush of warmth it sent under her sternum- reassured only by the fact it was on borrowed time.</p><p> </p><p>“ -came home from her run absolutely filthy- which was unexpected and also <em>extremely attractive</em>. Then she went to shower.” A pause. “Without me.” Rio sighed theatrically. “So, wounded and abandoned, I took the trash out. And when I got to the driveway…” She lifted her brows. “Your car was missing.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh.” Agatha pressed her tongue into her cheek -a small, unconscious echo of the woman she was dancing with- and she didn’t look away from Rio, she didn’t want to. “You’re right. That is very peculiar.”</p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t it?” Rio said, indulging Agatha’s ignorance with a knowing smile. “But,” she added pointedly, “things only grew more peculiar from there, you see.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh?” Agatha drawled. “You’re being terribly suggestive and I find myself hanging on to your every word. Please- do go on.”</p><p> </p><p>“We go to leave for the grocery store, and what do you know- your car has, somehow, miraculously appeared in the driveway.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped. “It cannot be!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, but it must be,” Rio replied gravely, putting on a face like she’d just delivered terrible news.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t tell me,” Agatha said, winding herself up, “that someone stole it, and in the time it took me to shower and for us to leave for the grocery store, you tracked down this car thief, and then killed them in my honor.” She dragged her nails across the small of Rio’s back. “Oh, my love! My hero-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio cut her off with a kiss, catching Agatha’s mouth mid act. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha, hopeless and helpless in her love, melted immediately into it, their bodies never quite stopping their gentle sway.</p><p> </p><p>When their lips parted, Rio stayed there, forehead pressed to Agatha’s and rubbing gently against hers like a cat who’d decided it needed affection.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, predictably, was left a little dazed. Rio’s mouth tended to have that effect. </p><p> </p><p>Rio stole one more soft kiss from Agatha’s mouth before pulling back, still holding her hand. Still swaying. She swallowed, her thumb brushing against Agatha’s neck. And Agatha knew she was working herself up to something. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to, you know,” Rio whispered, like they were sharing secrets now. “I just want to make sure you’re not hurting and trying to deal with it alone.”</p><p> </p><p>It made Agatha want to pout. Cry too, if she were being honest. But only from the way Rio Vidal made space to care for her quietly and beautifully, and how that made Agatha feel extremely seen and known and loved. She was so goddamn sweet it fucking hurt.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged instead. “I invited Jen to go on my run with me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, slow and thoughtful, and Agatha could hear the gears in her head turning. </p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha liked to run alone. Because she didn’t talk about it. Because there were precisely two people who understood that without needing it explained.</p><p> </p><p>“You invited Jen,” Rio said carefully.</p><p> </p><p>“Terrible idea,” Agatha muttered, leaning in like she was letting Rio in on a secret that was already painfully obvious.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed. “I can imagine,” she said, still choosing not to press.</p><p> </p><p>“I might’ve had what one would generously call a minor crashout,” Agatha said, like it wasn’t a big deal. It wasn’t a big deal- not anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“And Jen prompted this minor crashout?” Rio asked, reasonably a little confused.</p><p> </p><p>“Jen didn’t tell me what I wanted to hear,” Agatha corrected.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth went openly toothy with a playful wince. “Amateur. She’s clearly not as well versed in how Agatha Harkness works as I am.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a breath of a laugh. “No. She’s not,” she agreed. “Not like you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled like she’d just been given a gold star and fully intended to keep it. </p><p> </p><p>And the natural consequence for the indecent display of the gap between Rio’s teeth- Agatha stole a kiss from her. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha pulled away, she took a deep breath before adding quietly, “I got in my head about us. Freaked out a little.”</p><p> </p><p>The embarrassment that followed wasn’t really about the admission- it was about how strange it felt now. This morning’s version of Agatha and the one currently swaying in her kitchen with the love of her life were not the same woman, and she felt it showed.</p><p> </p><p>“You ran,” Rio said softly, naming the obvious at last.</p><p> </p><p>“I ran,” Agatha repeated, not shying away from it. “I panicked and I ran without thinking about a direction or a motive or the consequences. I didn’t think at all. I just kept moving- and when I stopped, I was standing in our front yard.” She exhaled, and in the same breath said, “Ran six miles home.”</p><p> </p><p>“Six point three miles,” Rio corrected quietly, a crooked little smile on her mouth- impressed enough to be precise, not concerned enough to think it was a problem.</p><p> </p><p>“I ran home to you,” Agatha further corrected, because she wanted to. Because there was no reason not to.</p><p> </p><p>“Great instincts,” Rio murmured, so fully and hopelessly in love with Agatha Harkness that Agatha felt it seeping from her pores.</p><p> </p><p>“The best,” Agatha added, another consequence, another stolen kiss- this time for the look on Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“Thank you for telling me,” Rio whispered against her mouth. She sealed it with another kiss. Then pulling back enough to speak, she went on to say, “Though I wouldn’t have let you get very far.” Another press of Rio’s lips followed it. </p><p> </p><p>“No?” Agatha asked into Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“You-” Rio began. Agatha kissed her. “Agatha-” Rio kept going, her smile curling against Agatha’s mouth. Agatha kissed her again, firmer this time. “-are very hard to resist.” That earned Rio another. “And I am-” But Agatha silenced her with one more kiss, longer than the last. Because she could. Because she wanted to. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally pulled back, her breath brushing against Rio’s lips as she waited to hear the rest.</p><p> </p><p>“And I’m extremely committed to annoying you,” Rio finally finished, breathless, grinning. “Which means I will chase you into the sun if need be.”</p><p> </p><p>“And if you fall into the sea like Icarus,” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>“That depends,” Rio stated simply. “Is this a fatal fall or a narrative one? Because if I’m dying, I need to be appropriately poetic about it, and if I’m not dying, then I get to be much more annoyingly devoted to you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could only stare at her. </p><p> </p><p>She suspected this explained a great many of her recent decisions. None of which she regretted. She was entirely at this freak’s mercy- and far too in love to mind.</p><p> </p><p>“I take your questions <em>very</em> seriously,” Rio added, lowering her chin into what was apparently her serious face- which was, annoyingly, very endearing.</p><p> </p><p>“You are not built correctly.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m built around <em>you</em>,” Rio said, without apology.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck?” Agatha whispered, disgustingly impressed.</p><p> </p><p>This was getting out of hand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was supposed to be the one leading this. She’d come in with a plan, or at least a direction. But then Rio opened her mouth -said a bunch of romantic bullshit only she could get away with- like none of this was hard. Like she wasn’t making it impossible for Agatha to think.</p><p> </p><p>And fuck. Agatha wanted it. She wanted this -<em>this</em>- for the rest of her life. This exact, ordinary thing- Rio’s hand in hers, the warmth of her smile, the way everything about her felt so easy now. Like they hadn’t spent years pretending not to feel it. Like this had never been complicated. </p><p> </p><p>Like Agatha hadn’t spent <em>years </em>trying not to want Rio like this.</p><p> </p><p>She’d wanted Rio forever.</p><p> </p><p>And now here they were- seventeen years later, and Agatha was more in love with Rio than she'd ever been in her life. And if <em>Rio </em>said one more stupidly romantic thing, Agatha was going to drop dead before she got the damn words out.</p><p> </p><p>“You have to stop being so fucking good at this,” Agatha whispered. “I love you so fucking much I can’t stand it, Rio. And I need thirty seconds where I’m not the one falling apart over you. So just let me...  Rio, you <em>have </em>to let me have this.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” Rio said, barely above a whisper. She nodded, swallowing hard, her gaze locked on Agatha’s, stunned and too focused. “Whatever you need.”</p><p> </p><p>“What song is this?” Agatha stalled as the next track began, soft guitar unfurling into something aching and romantic.</p><p> </p><p>“Like Real People Do,” Rio told her, a tiny furrow between her brows.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s pretty,” Agatha said. She leaned in and kissed the corner of Rio’s mouth. Rio turned her head to catch it properly, but Agatha didn’t let her.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s- yeah. It’s really romantic.” Rio shook her head- probably trying to clear it. A pause. “Agatha,” she breathed, her lips twitching like she meant to smile but couldn’t quite get there. “You’re being very strange.”</p><p> </p><p>It was the second time Rio had said it that day, still meant as a compliment, but this time it came out quieter. Fonder.</p><p> </p><p>“You love it,” Agatha said gently, squeezing her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, fast, and her hand slid from Agatha’s neck to her chest, over Agatha’s heart. “I do,” she said, pressing her palm there like she was afraid Agatha might miss it. “Of course I do,” tumbled out of Rio in a whispery rush, like she couldn’t hold them back, and was trying to pour everything she felt straight into Agatha’s chest and leave it there. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s words were too on the nose. She nodded and covered Rio’s hand where it rested over her heart, hoping that Rio understood- that <em>yes</em>, Agatha felt it too. That the sheer magnitude of this thing between them lived in her just as wildly as it lived in Rio. Felt it so deeply it would turn her bones into a garden that would keep blooming even when she was no longer there to feel it.</p><p> </p><p>“This is what the rest of my life looks like, okay?” Agatha whispered, the confession brushing against Rio’s lips. “I <em>want </em>you for the rest of my life. I <em>need </em>you in it. I can’t- there’s nothing-” The sentence tangled and knotted in her mouth, and she had to stop, drag in a breath before she could keep going. “I can’t come back from this. There is no version of me that exists that walks away from you and survives it, not as anything I recognize as myself. I’m certain of that. I’ve seen who I am without you, and I barely survived it.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha’s heart stuttered because Rio was looking at her differently- and suddenly it felt like something in her had been peeled back. Flayed. Every layer torn open and her insides left exposed, twitching as cool air touched it for the first time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands were cradling Agatha’s face now, Agatha reached to hold on to Rio’s wrists.</p><p> </p><p>“And I can’t- I can’t fucking water this down anymore,” Agatha continued, her voice roughened by honesty and fear and everything in between. “I don’t want to make myself smaller, or make you smaller, just so it feels safer. I want you. All of you. I’ve always wanted every single part of you.” The next breath she took shattered whatever composure she had left, and the plea came out stripped of every last defense. “So please, Rio,” she whispered. She felt her lips tremble, her nails dig into Rio’s wrists.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was nodding -had been, really- small, frantic movements repeating over and over, like she couldn’t say yes fast enough. Tears were streaming down her face, and Agatha hadn’t even reached the bravest part of herself yet.</p><p> </p><p>“Marry me,” Agatha said quietly, steady despite the tears in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Rio said, pushing through her tears like she had to fight for air. The rest came out of her in a rush she didn’t seem able to stop. “Agatha, you have to marry me. I’ll die if you don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>All Agatha could hear was the sound of her own heart detonating in her chest around those words. It broke out of her as a wet, startled laugh- wild and disbelieving and so full of relief it hurt, and then Rio was surging forward, kissing her.</p><p> </p><p>Her back hit the counter between Rio’s forward momentum and her own pull- cabinet doors knocked, drawers shuddered. They were tearing into each other: mouths, tongues, teeth biting, the uncoordinated hunger of it.</p><p> </p><p>She kissed Rio- trying to expel the heart lodged in her mouth and force it into her -bloody and exposed- so that when she would pull away she’d see chunks of it stuck in Rio’s teeth.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio kissed her back with the same intensity, the same openness, like she understood exactly what Agatha was trying to give her and was willing to take it- all of it.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha pulled away, she caught the thin string of spit still tethering their mouths, her eyes tracing it back to Rio’s lips- parted, swollen, tinged red from where Agatha must’ve bitten her hard enough to draw blood.</p><p> </p><p>She huffed a tiny whine, her fingers catching at Rio's jaw, tilting her face where she wanted it- right as Rio’s hand rose to the back of her head and drew Agatha forward in recognition.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha licked at it, slow at first, then deeper, rougher, greedy as the taste of iron on Rio’s mouth was something meant for her. She wanted it on her tongue. She wanted it in between her teeth. Maybe that would be enough. Enough to quiet the ravenous, feral thing Rio had awoken inside her.</p><p> </p><p>The moan that tore from Rio cracked at the edge of a scream, and Agatha met it with her entire mouth, swallowing it. A shared and chosen ferocity moved through them both, a hunger that devoured as much as it fed- met with open mouths and unflinching tongues and a certainty that whatever this was, it was exactly what they meant to be doing to each other.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled away first. Their foreheads pressed together, mouths still brushing, not kissing anymore but not really stopping either. They were both trembling, both trying to catch their breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clawed at the back of Rio’s hoodie, and Rio knew what Agatha needed before she could say it. She caught the hem of the hoodie and started to pull it up. Agatha’s hands were there instantly, helping her pull it over her head.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio’s chest was bare and bruised with Agatha’s mouth- because Agatha required it that way. </p><p> </p><p>From the moment they started this, she had needed to leave something of herself behind on Rio’s skin, some visible evidence that she had been there, that she had mattered there. It was constant, and it was one of the only urges she never tried to soften or justify, the only one she allowed herself without argument. And Rio -being her Rio- never once denied Agatha that. </p><p> </p><p>It was for every reason she could name and several Agatha refused to, for possession and for proof, for closeness and for continuity, for the need to be remembered and the need not to be left behind, for the unreasonable thrill of knowing that Rio Vidal would not pass through a single day without carrying Agatha Harkness with her, stitched into her thinking <em>and </em>her flesh. </p><p> </p><p>Expiation, Agatha’s mouth sought, for the simple fact that from the moment they had met seventeen years ago, there had never once been a single day Agatha did not think of Rio Vidal. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for her own sweatshirt now, and Rio helped, tugging it up and off her arms. The moment it was gone, Rio pressed into her. Agatha wrapped her arms around her instinctively, pulling her close, chest to chest, skin to skin. </p><p> </p><p>They stood like that for a while, arms locked around each other, breathing the same air, neither of them moving. Agatha let herself breathe. Let herself feel Rio’s weight against her. Let herself believe this was real.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio spoke first, her voice muffled slightly against Agatha’s hair. “I love you, Agatha. I love you so much. I don’t know how to do anything else. I don’t think I’m meant to.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then you’d better not,” Agatha murmured. “I’ve grown pretty attached to the way you love me.” She slid her hand into Rio’s hair and drew her back, needing to see her. When brown met her blue, she said, very simply, “I love you too.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed a soft, helpless laugh and pressed her forehead to Agatha’s. “We’re actually doing this,” she whispered, like she had to hear herself say it.</p><p> </p><p>“I already made the appointment for us. We file to get our marriage license tomorrow,” Agatha muttered, trying unsuccessfully to keep her smile in check. </p><p> </p><p>Rio drew her forehead back slowly, the brown of her eyes a shade darker than before. “Are you fucking with me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not at all.”</p><p> </p><p>“And when exactly did you decide that you were going to marry me, Agatha Harkness?”</p><p> </p><p>“That depends,” Agatha said, tipping her chin up, her eyes flicking briefly down to Rio’s boobs before returning to brown. “Do you want me poetic about it… or annoyingly devoted?”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be a dick,” Rio said -quiet, close, extremely fucking seductive- Agatha noted. </p><p> </p><p>“I called Lilia to warn her that I was going to ask her daughter to marry me, walked in the door covered in dirt, and booked the appointment after you insulted my organizational skills- because I don’t enjoy losing arguments. Especially not to you,” Agatha said, as Rio smirked, tongue in her cheek, nodding along- her eyes fixed on Agatha’s mouth, savoring every word.</p><p> </p><p>“We weren’t arguing,” Rio pointed out, inconveniently. She glanced up, locking eyes with Agatha.“That’s why you wanted to dance with me. You were buttering me up before you sprung forever on me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t want it to feel careless,” Agatha admitted. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio drawled, voice syrupy and kind of terrifying. “You absolute fucking romantic. I want to eat you alive,” she rushed out, thrilled. “Rings?” she added, eyes wild with what Agatha recognized to be a particular spark she got when Agatha was being… aggressively competent about her feelings.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t already have a ring for me?” Agatha asked, lifting her eyebrows. “Really? Because months ago you told me- hang on, let me get this right…” She tilted her head, pretending to dig for it. “<em>I would have married you yesterday if I knew you’d let me.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth dropped open like Agatha had just confessed to something scandalous. “So you remember that, huh?” she said, smiling.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes dropped to Rio’s mouth before she could stop it. Then up to Rio’s eyes. Then back down to her mouth. “Hard to forget, given the nauseating level of confidence you delivered it with.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio inhaled- rose onto her tiptoes, then dropped back down, biting down on her teeth like that might keep her from climbing Agatha like a fucking tree. “I was giving you time to stop lying to yourself,” she said, pointed and too close. Her head tilted, chasing Agatha’s retreating gaze. “And for the record? I was going to look at rings next Thursday.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach swooped. “You’re disgusting,” she breathed. “We’ll be married by then.”</p><p> </p><p>“After the appointment tomorrow then,” Rio decided, lifting Agatha’s hand and kissing her ring finger- open mouthed, just shy of filthy. She lingered there a second too long, then looked up. “Unless you somehow slipped out of the shower while I was tracking down and killing this mysterious car thief in your honor, and you managed to buy a ring behind my back.” A pause. “No?” she asked, tilting her head… “Not even a placeholder?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m so sorry, my love,” Agatha said sweetly. “I was too busy in the shower, touching myself over the fact that you’ll legally belong to me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha Harkness, you seem to forget that I pay <em>very </em>close attention to you,” Rio said, brushing a kiss to the corner of her mouth. When Agatha turned to meet it, Rio’s head pulled back an inch- she was fucking grinning. “Or how invested I am in trying to catch you in the act.”</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck does that mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“It means I’ve listened outside your bathroom door for far less incentive than that,” Rio said, tilting her head, watching Agatha's reaction like it was owed to her. She started rolling Agatha’s left nipple between her fingers. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply. “And is this some new post-cohabitation quirk, or have you always been this fucking depraved?” As in- <em>was this happening during that long, tortuously platonic stretch of our lives?</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips pressed together, not denying it, looking almost faintly ashamed as she lowered herself to her knees for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“You were never quiet,” Rio said, looking up at her. “And I- I couldn’t ignore it. I tried, Agatha. But it was unbearable.”</p><p> </p><p>They had been standing on opposite sides of the same door for years, she knew now. Rio holding herself back, Agatha pretending nothing was there. They were cruel to each other that way. They were cruel to themselves.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers threaded into Rio’s hair. Gently. Possessive. Her breath was coming in heavier. “Did you ever touch yourself?” she asked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Only over my underwear.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice broke into a delighted broken gasp meant to be a laugh. “God. You poor thing.” She leaned back, bracing herself on the counter, gathering Rio’s hair at the back of her head as Rio took her time, easing Agatha’s underwear down her legs. “How hard did you come for me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Harder than I ever did with anyone else.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so full of shit,” Agatha muttered as she let Rio pull one of her legs up over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not,” Rio shot back, her words almost bitten. “Agatha, you know I’m not.” She turned her head, pressing her face against the inside of Agatha’s thigh, and inhaled. Deep, like it hurt. Like the smell of Agatha was proof, atonement, everything Rio hadn’t let herself have then.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips followed, a kiss first -soft and open mouthed- and then her teeth, sinking into tender flesh of her thigh.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a sound that was just short of a thrilled scream.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed the spot she’d bitten, then licked over it repeatedly. Then she moved higher up, nosing against Agatha’s cunt like she was praying- or claiming a ghost behind a bathroom door. It was a kind of apology Agatha hadn’t known she needed. Her fingers curled tighter in Rio’s hair. </p><p> </p><p>“Say you believe me,” Rio whined there. “Please, baby. You have to.”</p><p> </p><p>“I believe you,” Agatha gasped, as Rio’s nose dragged against her. “Of course I believe you.” One hand slid over Rio’s head in a shaky, comforting stroke.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” Rio said, voice cracking- mouth dragging hot and open over Agatha’s cunt in a kiss. “Agatha- fuck- I love you,” she said again. Her tongue pressed into the next kiss. “Mine,” she groaned, voice muffled against her cunt. “I have to have you forever, Agatha, I can’t-” she panted, her breath catching as her tongue swept through Agatha. Another lap. Then another- faster, wetter, louder. “You’re marrying me and you taste like-”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my fucking god-” Agatha sobbed. Her knees buckled. Her head hit the cabinet behind her with a dull thud, but she didn’t feel it. She was too busy grinding down onto Rio’s mouth, chasing the next lap of her tongue. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio didn’t let up. Her mouth never left Agatha. She was making out with Agatha’s cunt like it was sacred and then filthy and then sacred again, like those things were interchangeable, like Rio didn’t know the difference anymore. Or didn’t want to.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha -who had spent years pretending she could live without this, without being <em>seen</em> like this- now had a woman on her knees, making love to her like she was the altar and the offering both. She felt the truth of it everywhere. In her cunt. In her ribs. In the part of her that had always, <em>always</em> held out hope that they’d find their way back to each other.</p><p> </p><p>It was better now- undeniably. Brighter. In ways Agatha hadn’t even known to ask for. Like Rio had promised her.</p><p> </p><p>“Love you,” Agatha whimpered, voice breaking as her body curled forward. One hand trembled as it stroked the top of Rio’s head in soft, shaky passes. “Rio- fuck- So good,” she gasped. “You’re so- Rio, you’re so good.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, her nose bumping against Agatha’s clit as she whined into her, and her tongue lost its pace entirely, lapping in messy, desperate strokes. “My wife,” Rio gasped into Agatha’s cunt. “You’re gonna to be my wife- my fucking wife-” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha screamed, the sound ripped from her like a laugh half swallowed by a sob. Her orgasm tore through her viciously unforgiving. She couldn’t control it, couldn’t soften the way her body moved- her hand locked at the nape of Rio’s neck, pushing harder into Rio’s mouth, grinding down, gasping, chasing every last inch of her own pleasure. </p><p> </p><p>And Rio had yet to come up for air. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>It went without saying that Agatha never cooked them dinner.</p><p> </p><p>That fantasy died sometime after her second orgasm. Probably right around the moment Rio bent her over the kitchen counter and fucked Agatha within an inch of her goddamn life. There might’ve been a thumb in her ass. She might’ve encouraged said thumb- enthusiastically, repeatedly, at volume. She might’ve rolled her hips into it while Rio had two fingers already inside her cunt. Hard to say, honestly. Her ego was still sorting through the specifics. </p><p> </p><p><em>Anyway. </em></p><p> </p><p>They’d managed to fuck their way through most of the square footage between the kitchen and the couch- pausing only when Rio collapsed onto it, still shaking, and ordered two pizzas with trembling hands and a smile that was doing barbaric things to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>That goddamn smile. That gap in her teeth- aimed straight at Agatha’s chest like a fucking rotary cannon. By morning, she would be slumped over, bleeding out- her heart shredded and dangling from the split seam of her ribcage, still beating like the stubborn thing it was. Arterial. Messy. Completely un-fucking-salvageable. And Agatha’s couch would be ruined. But maybe that was fair. It had witnessed something violent. Something worth bleeding for. She’d do it a thousand times over if it meant dying like that- staring into Rio’s mouth, slipping under, and losing herself in a void between teeth. </p><p> </p><p>At some point, they’d called Lilia. Rio had handled it, flushed to her ears, unable to stop grinning. Agatha watched her stumble over her words like she was sick with it, undone by how in love she was. One hand gripped the phone. The other stayed locked around Agatha’s thigh, unwilling to let go.</p><p> </p><p>Not that Agatha had helped. She stayed close- smug, silent, entirely naked, with no intention whatsoever of pretending she wasn’t the reason Rio kept blushing like that.</p><p> </p><p>Then Lilia, in true form, called her out. Said Agatha had called that morning with the intention of asking for permission- even if she pretended she was just giving Lilia a warning. Said Agatha didn’t need it. Never had. But if Agatha had needed to hear it -once, twice, a thousand times- Lilia would’ve said yes every single time. </p><p> </p><p>All of which meant, unfortunately, it was Agatha’s turn to fucking blush. Especially with Rio’s puppy dog eyes completely raw dogging her long melted icy blues like that was the most romantic thing she’d ever heard in her life.</p><p> </p><p>Lastly, because the universe had no sense of fucking decorum when it came to Agatha’s entitlement to privacy, mystery, or even a shred of emotional superiority- Lilia ended the call by announcing that everyone (herself, Alice, Jen, Yelena) now owed Sage a hundred bucks each. As Rio’s little sister had placed the only solo bet on <em>Agatha</em> being the first to cave. </p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha</em> -who was supposed to be the composed one, the cold one, the last to bend- was now naked, blushing, and bleeding out all over the fucking couch.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They’d drifted upstairs not long after. The sky had gone dark at some point without Agatha noticing. Across their bedroom, the TV was looping through its sleep screen- valleys fading into coral reefs, reefs into mountaintops, mountaintops into space. All of it serene. All of it enormous. None of it even remotely relevant to what was currently happening.</p><p> </p><p>The only sound in the room was Rio- her breathing thick and shaky, and the soft, broken sounds she tried to swallow down. Every now and then, one slipped- a whimper, a gasp, the start of a moan cut off.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a shaky laugh that dissolved almost instantly into another breathless sound. “Hey- okay, that one is absolutely going to show, Agatha,” she managed, her back slick with sweat where it was pressed to Agatha’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>With a short, annoyed grunt, Agatha released the bruise she’d been sucking into Rio’s neck with a wet pop. She pinched both of Rio’s nipples, pulled until the skin stretched taut, and didn’t let go. Only when Rio gasped, mouth parting around a shaky <em>oh</em>, did Agatha ease up.</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in close, lips brushing Rio’s jaw like a threat. “You never care if they show,” Agatha murmured. “Let me give you another.” Her teeth caught the bone just below Rio’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>“I- I don’t usually,” Rio stammered, her face turning to chase Agatha’s mouth as she pulled it away. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked and pressed a quick, wet kiss to Rio’s cheek, pleased with the way it made Rio shivered. Her attention dipped lower, down to Rio’s chest- where the evidence of her work stood out beautifully. Rio’s nipples were tight and sensitive, flushed raw, and gleaming with a slick shine. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers had been ruthless -brushing, circling, rolling, pinching, tugging- then she let her touch dip between Rio’s thighs, gathering wetness and stroking it over Rio’s nipples before returning to torment them.</p><p> </p><p>“I love what your mouth does to me,” Rio said quietly, honestly. “But I’m getting married in a few days. It’s gonna be this gorgeous little courthouse wedding-”</p><p> </p><p>“A gorgeous little courthouse wedding,” Agatha echoed, cutting her off as her hands slid between Rio’s bent knees. She raked her nails up the insides of her thighs, and watched Rio’s legs splay open for her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. Agatha heard her swallow hard, watched her tongue flick out to wet her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed. “Open casket, then?” A public thing- a ceremony where your loved ones were invited to come look.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. And I’ll be buried ass up so you’ve got somewhere to visit.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a breath that was almost a laugh and pressed her whole hand over Rio’s cunt- firm, possessive, hers. </p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned, the sound torn out of her as her body arched, the side of her face turning toward Agatha’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh." <em>Of all things</em>- Rio was offering her face. To <em>her.</em> To the rabid, depraved thing Agatha had become under the weight of wanting her for so long.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha licked a long, unbroken stripe up the side of Rio’s face- from her jaw to her cheekbone to the temple of her head, slow and unashamed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, then started panting, her hips grinding into Agatha’s palm. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved her free hand, cupped the opposite side of Rio’s face to keep her still, to hold her exactly where she wanted her. She licked her again. Over and over. Until Rio was letting out these grunted little cries as her hips worked in a desperate search of friction against Agatha’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>She slid her hand down to Rio’s throat, fingers wrapping around the slender column of it. She found Rio’s pulse right away- frantic and alive. Agatha brought her mouth to Rio’s ear, breath hitching as her body jerked with the motion of Rio’s hips bucking into her palm- “I’d fall to your grave and beg for you. I’d sob into the soil and fuck the earth raw until it had no choice but to give you back to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned, her head dropping back against Agatha’s shoulder. “I’d come back to you no matter what it took,” she swore, breath ragged. “I’d tear through the goddamn earth screaming for you.”</p><p> </p><p>“We’ll be buried together,” Agatha said against Rio’s mouth. “Rot in the same ground. So I never have to be without you again.” She tightened her grip around Rio’s throat. “Promise me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I promise.” Rio tilted her chin up, hand curling tight around Agatha’s wrist. “I’ll dig one grave big enough for both of us myself. Just me and you and the dirt, yeah?” she said, grinning like a fucking maniac, pushing Agatha’s hand harder into her throat. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned into Rio’s slack mouth, her breath hot and shaking as she pushed two fingers into her cunt until she was buried to the second knuckle. Then she pulled back, only to tease Rio’s entrance with faster, rougher circles that left Rio panting into her teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio whined- soft, shaky. “You’ll be opinionated when you pick a ring for me tomorrow? Please. I won’t fight you on a single thing.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll know it when I see it,” Agatha assured her, letting go of Rio’s throat to wrap her arm around her waist, pulling her closer into her chest. “I want it to be fucking perfect. You’ll wear it into the ground.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushed her fingers back into Rio’s cunt with more force. She held them completely still, buried deep, unmoving, the pressure of her arm around Rio’s waist pinning Rio’s hips in place when they instinctively tried to grind down.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned, the sound tipping into a rough, delighted scream.</p><p> </p><p>“I was thinking that hyphenating our last names might be a bit of a mouthful,” Agatha said, in the most casual tone she could fake. “Thoughts?”</p><p> </p><p>“What-” Rio gasped. Her head tipped back onto Agatha’s shoulder again, mouth open, trying to catch her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached up to smooth the hair away from Rio’s face. “You can have my last name, if you want it,” she said quietly, a small smile and a big pout shoving at each other for a place to land on her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>And without a word, Rio’s hand slipped between her legs, fingers curling around Agatha’s wrist. She guided Agatha’s fingers out of her cunt with a soft, slick sound. Her lashes fluttered at the loss.</p><p> </p><p>Rio peeled herself away from Agatha’s chest. And Agatha started to ask Rio what the fuck she thought she was doing… She didn’t get far. </p><p> </p><p>The second her mouth opened, Rio was turning around, climbing on top of Agatha, knees pressing into the mattress, bracketing Agatha’s hips.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lungs forgot their purpose. They stalled, uncertain what they were meant to take in. Oxygen? Rio? Agatha wasn’t sure she knew the difference anymore. Both felt impossible to live without.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand found Agatha’s chest, then came pressure of her palm against Agatha’s sternum, guiding her gently back until her shoulders met the headboard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched without speaking. A miracle, really. Rio reached down and wrapped her fingers around Agatha’s wrist -the same hand that she just had knuckle deep inside of Rio, Agatha felt it important to note- until it hovered between them. Two of her fingers were still slick, coated entirely in Rio’s arousal.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to Agatha’s hand briefly before lifting again like she was making sure Agatha was watching. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha was watching. She couldn’t fucking look anywhere else. </p><p> </p><p>Rio opened her mouth and took Agatha’s fingers between her lips, and moaned around them. Her eyes fluttered shut as her head tipped back slightly, and her hips started to move at the same time- rolling forward, slow and grinding, catching Agatha’s stomach with each pass.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” was all Agatha managed to get out.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha had a functioning brain, she might’ve done something useful. Maybe moved. Maybe spoken. Instead, she just sat there, slack jawed and a fucking mess, watching Rio fuck her own throat like she’d forgotten she had an audience.</p><p> </p><p>No. Her brain refused. If it had been worth anything, Agatha wouldn’t have made a sound when Rio gagged on her fingers. She definitely wouldn’t have fucking squeaked like goddamn idiot.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers slipped from Rio’s mouth with a loud pop. Her lips stayed parted, wet and slightly swollen. When she opened her eyes, they were heavy lidded and dark, she looked almost intoxicated. </p><p> </p><p>And then -because Rio clearly wanted her dead- she took Agatha’s hand and dragged it lower, until Agatha’s fingers hovered just under her cunt.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha felt Rio’s thumbnail dig into the soft flesh above her collarbone, her eyes snapped back to Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Three,” Rio said, her voice low, dark enough to make Agatha’s stomach drop.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so fucking sexy,” Agatha rushed out, embarassingly honest. Three fingers pointed up now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out an amused breath, her smile lazy and sitting easy on her lips like it had nowhere better to be. Without another word, she began to ease herself down onto Agatha’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>The pressure was immediate, thick heat pulling around Agatha’s hand as she eased in. The hand braced on Agatha’s shoulder clenched tight, nails digging in deeper the lower she sank, and Agatha welcomed the sting with a hiss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was watching- <em>watching</em> Rio’s cunt stretch around her fingers. And by the time Rio finally bottomed out, Agatha wasn’t sure if she’d been breathing at all. Her mouth fell to Rio’s chest, pulled there by the guiding pressure of Rio’s hand already at the back of her head. There was no gentleness to it- no real patience, either, as she latched onto Rio’s nipple like it might give her something back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s moan was fucking filthy, her back arching to press herself harder into Agatha’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>The taste hit Agatha immediately- Rio. The wetness she’d smeared there earlier, and the leftover trace of it now sent a noise tearing out of Agatha’s throat before she could stop it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped above her, body twitching forward slightly, while Agatha moved with a ravenous, glorious purpose.</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth worked sloppily, like the animal Rio’s tits turned her into. She didn’t care how it looked. She didn’t even notice how much she was drooling until it was dripping off Rio’s boob. She dragged her mouth across Rio’s chest, switching to the other nipple because Rio would want both to match- would want Agatha to treat them equally.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha only stopped when her lungs threatened to collapse. She finally lifted her head, she was flushed and panting, mouth covered in her own goddamn slobber, when Rio’s forehead fell to hers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes were shut, her breathing uneven, her mouth parted. The hand that had been tangled in Agatha’s hair slid down to cup her cheek, thumb stroking the edge of her jaw. Then Rio’s hips started to move- slow, long grinding rolls. Agatha nearly wailed when she felt the slick heat of her spilling down her wrist.</p><p> </p><p>“Wanna do this to your dick,” Rio muttered, voice hoarse.</p><p> </p><p>“You have to,” Agatha demanded, and her words stumbled out of her mouth like they were trying to beat her in a foot race to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath hit Agatha’s lips in a shaky exhale. Her eyes fluttered open slowly. Her thumb brushed over Agatha’s bottom lip. “Tell me again,” she pleaded.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to answer and her brain stalled completely as she clocked the way Rio’s hips shifted, the rolls growing a little faster, a little harder, something in between.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard, blinking up at Rio. “Huh?” she asked, soft and dumb and honest.</p><p> </p><p>“That I could have your last name. Please, Agatha. Please,” Rio panted against Agatha’s mouth. “Say it again before I lose my mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can have it,” Agatha said, voice shaking with how much she meant it. “I want you to.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Rio whined, grinding harder into Agatha’s hand. “Yours? Fuck- I’m yours?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mine,” Agatha answered. And then she was moving- no longer capable of being under Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She scrambled to get Rio onto her back, every part of her focused on getting on top of her. Her fingers never left Rio’s cunt, not for one second. If anything, they pressed deeper, curled harder, worked faster with the leverage. It wasn’t graceful, but Agatha was absurdly good at this- at knowing exactly how to keep contact through chaos. She was made for it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her fingers pumping up into her cunt as her mouth sealed over Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>She licked Rio’s mouth with a desperation of searching for Rio’s soul just to pull it into her own and keep it there. When she pushed her tongue deeper, far enough to find the back of Rio’s throat, she felt Rio gag around it. It only made Agatha groan, made her thrust her fingers harder into Rio.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio broke the kiss, she was breathless and flushed. “You-” she started, but the sentence died into a moan as Agatha’s fingers kept slamming back into her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hips jerked and her voice cracked, “You want me to take your-” Her words broke as Agatha curled her fingers just right. “Name,” Rio gasped, almost sobbing with it. “<em>Fuck</em>, Agatha- your <em>name.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>“I do,” Agatha said, chest pressed tight to hers. “I really fucking do. I want you to be mine. Forever. You’re mine.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whined through her teeth. “Fuck- fuck- fuck-” she chanted, her voice catching on each word, syncing to the rhythm of Agatha’s thrusts. “Gonna be your wife?” she cried, eyes glassy, body stuttering with each push.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, her voice breaking, “You’re gonna be my wife.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio came with a full body jolt, a sharp cry that only carried the shape of Agatha’s name broken on her tongue. Her legs clamped even tighter, trapping Agatha in place- and Agatha didn’t let up. She kept her fingers pumping. </p><p> </p><p>“More,” Agatha huffed against her cheek. “I want more, Rio. Give me more.”</p><p> </p><p>She felt Rio nodding, frantic and wild, and her cunt clamped down hard around Agatha’s fingers like she was trying to drag her deeper.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew what was coming. Felt the shift in Rio’s hips, the tight tremble of her thighs, the way she sucked in a breath like she was <em>choosing</em> this.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio gave it to her.</p><p> </p><p>Wetness surged out in a sudden, impossible gush, soaking Agatha’s hand, splashing hot between them. A broken sound tore out of Rio’s throat and Agatha nearly came herself just from hearing it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha drew her fingers out slowly, watching every twitch of Rio’s face. Rio bared her teeth in a wince, her hips jolting. Still, tilted her chin up, let Agatha kiss her- messy, open mouthed, letting Agatha take as much as she wanted- and when Agatha pulled back, Rio was already nodding.</p><p> </p><p>“Not too sensitive?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s whole body looked spent. Her thighs were still trembling, her chest heaving like she hadn’t quite come down yet. Agatha hovered over her, braced on both hands, her palms sinking into the mattress on either side of Rio’s head.</p><p> </p><p>Still, Rio shook her head, bent her knees, and planted her feet against the mattress. Her hands gripped at Agatha’s ass, she dragged Agatha forward until their bodies were pressed completely flush. The soaked heat of her cunt slotted against Agatha’s front with a slick, filthy sound, and Agatha thought she’d nearly passed out at the feeling of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Show me how you’re gonna use your dick on me when I’m your wife,” Rio said. “Show me now.” Staring up at Agatha, still flushed and ruined and so fucking sure of what she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>“Gonna fuck you stupid the second you take my last name,” Agatha moaned, head dropping to Rio’s shoulder. She dragged her cunt through the soaked mess of Rio’s, slick smearing across her folds, her thighs, all of it hot and wet and perfect.</p><p> </p><p>Rio spread her legs wider, pressing up into her, and Agatha felt the drag of their cunts rubbing together. The pressure against her clit made Agatha gasp. She did it again, grinding harder this time as one of Rio’s hands slid up to the back of Agatha’s head, fingers curling tight into her hair. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re gonna <em>make love</em> to me, Agatha.” Rio’s mouth- the barrel of a gun pressed to Agatha’s lips, daring her to open up and take it. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s what you think I’m going to do to you?” Like Agatha’s jaw wasn’t already unhinged and waiting for it. She slammed her hips forward, silently praying for its shot to be heard around the world.</p><p> </p><p>The wet slap of their cunts' meeting ricocheted off the walls and landed, perversely, in Rio’s open mouth- “You fucking better. Need to come all over your cock like your wife should,” she said straight into Agatha’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>It made Agatha’s rhythm falter. Her forehead slipped, chin hitting awkwardly against bone. She sank her teeth into Rio’s shoulder- the only reasonable response to being handed the one thing she'd spent seventeen years begging the universe for.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hissed, then moaned- loud, theatrical, soaked in thrill she was playing up just for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, briefly, thought she might end up on that show <em>Who the Fuck Did I Marry? </em>Then, with a little more honesty, she imagined Rio would probably be the one they’d be interviewing.</p><p> </p><p>Either way, they were made for each other in the same breath that sent wind crashing into a wildfire. And once Agatha stopped pretending they were anything less than that, they only intensified- driving and devouring, burning hotter and higher with every gust, endlessly more.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shoved up onto her hands, moving to straddle Rio properly, her thighs bracketing Rio’s hips. Then she rolled her hips forward, dragged her cunt across the ridge of Rio’s pubic bone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands flew to her waist, gripping hard, fingers digging in as she thrust upward to meet her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ground down harder, gasping at the pressure. She was wet enough to hear it, wet enough to smear across Rio’s skin, wet enough to feel it drip down her own thighs as she fucked herself on Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you going to wear when you marry me?” Agatha panted. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to picture it- Rio in white. Letting Agatha look. Letting her have it- have <em>her.</em> For real. For good. No more pretending that forever with Rio was something she could live without.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tried to smile up at her, but her breathing was just as fucked as Agatha’s own.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t know yet,” Rio got out, like it wasn’t a goddamn lie Agatha had clocked the moment it left her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Liar,” Agatha snapped, disgusted by Rio’s pathetic attempt at denial. As if the answer wasn’t Agatha’s. As if Rio had the right to keep anything from her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t deny it. Her eyes went wide, then caught fire- confusion, delight. Agatha could see Rio didn’t know whether the reaction had surprised her or thrilled her. It was both. Of course it was both. Agatha could’ve answered for her, if Rio needed help remembering.</p><p> </p><p>Nails dug into Agatha’s waist and Rio shoved her pelvis up, grinding into her cunt, flush against the ridge of her body. Agatha nearly choked on it. Insane, genuinely, how easy it was for Agatha to stay right there and take it. The angle was perfect. The pressure was perfect. Rio was perfect. Perfect and infuriating and unfair and so fucking good.</p><p> </p><p>“Liar,” Agatha whined this time, miserable now. It sounded pitiful. She didn’t give a single shit. She rocked harder into Rio. “You’ve thought about it. I know you have.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted a hand to her face, used her thumb to tip her chin downward. Agatha hated how easily she went. How much she needed it. Then Rio kissed her- soft, slow, soothing. </p><p> </p><p>“I think about it constantly,” Rio said, her breath brushing over Agatha’s lips. Her thumb swept at Agatha’s cheekbone, her touch far too gentle for how hard Agatha was grinding against her. Agatha watched Rio’s eyes flutter shut. Her smile turned crooked, shaky. “I’ll tell you, Agatha,” she said. “If you really want to know-”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t,” Agatha said, too fast, too true. She didn’t want to know. Not really. She wanted to be surprised. Destroyed. She wanted to fall to her knees when she saw Rio for the first time. Anything less would feel like theft, and she knew it.</p><p> </p><p>Restraint, Agatha found, was exquisite. Hell, maybe. Heaven, on a crueler day. Purgatory seemed most likely- if there was any place built for this kind of ache. Wanting and not taking. Having and not touching. It was a delicious torture. </p><p> </p><p>They’d be married by the end of the week. Seventeen years in the making. Agatha could survive a few more days without knowing whether Rio would show up in a suit or a dress.</p><p> </p><p>“My love,” Rio gasped, almost panicked.</p><p> </p><p>A warning. Agatha knew it instantly- knew it by the way Rio’s brow drew tight, by the tiny, broken puffs of breath spilling from her lips, by the way her body arched like her soul was being torn out of her and handed over for Agatha to keep.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha <em>would</em> fucking keep it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hips started moving faster, sloppier, more desperate. She just needed something. Anything. Something Rio had already given her. “You really want to take my last name? You’re okay with that?”</p><p> </p><p>She tipped herself right into the edge of her own orgasm, the first low burn of it sparking in her belly. She was already falling when Rio’s voice answered her, frantic and sure, nodding like her life depended on it.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re never getting it back.” </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck-,” Agatha came with a sob. Her cunt pulsed against Rio’s bone, grinding down to the rhythm of her own name in Rio’s mouth. The pressure was unbearable, a slow, seizing throb she could feel echo in her fucking <em>skull.</em> </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>She slumped forward with a grunt, buried her face in the crook of Rio’s neck, breathing hard. Beneath her, Rio dragged her nails slowly up and down Agatha’s back, sending goosebumps across her skin with every pass.</p><p> </p><p>They stayed like that for a while, quiet and tangled, their hearts finally began to settle. Eventually, Agatha nudged her nose against Rio’s throat, pressed a kiss there, and mumbled, “Odds you can take the next two weeks off work?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head and buried her face in Agatha’s hair, breathing in deep like she was trying to get high off it. She let out a pleased hum, and then, softer, she mumbled, “I’d quit if you asked me to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh against her throat, then shifted to lie beside her, head propped in one hand, the other tracing lazy shapes over Rio’s heart. “That easy, huh?” she whispered. “You used to act like missing work would kill you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Miracles. They happen.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed and raked her nail lightly down Rio’s sternum.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you believe me if I said I’ve been hoarding PTO for our eventual elopement?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “Not even a little. But I’ll give you points for creavity.”</p><p> </p><p>“It was worth a try.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was quiet for a moment, watching her finger move against Rio’s chest before she looked back up at her and said, “I was thinking… maybe we could go somewhere after we get married. It doesn’t have to be far.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile tugged crooked, sweet in a way that made Agatha’s teeth ache. And Agatha, no longer in the habit of denying herself anything where Rio was concerned, leaned in and kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back. Rio’s eyes fluttered open, her mouth still tipped up toward Agatha’s as she asked, “And would we be calling this a honeymoon?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, smiling despite the fire Rio had set burning in her cheeks. “Duh.”</p><p> </p><p>“Any ideas on a destination?” Rio asked, her voice hitting an embarrassingly high note.</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio could defend herself, Agatha mimicked her in a shrill falsetto, “<em>Any ideas on a destination?</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely had time to twist away before Rio’s fingers dug into her ribs, and she broke into breathless laughter before she could even glare. She was horribly ticklish- an unfortunate truth Rio had figured out long before they were anything close to what they were now.</p><p> </p><p>Within seconds, Rio had her on her back with wrists pinned above her head. Agatha was breathless, flushed, still fucking giggling.</p><p> </p><p>“God forbid a woman’s voice betray her while talking honeymoon logistics with her fiancée,” Rio bit out, breathless and far too pleased with herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach did an unhelpful little backflip at Rio’s disgustingly perfect choice of words- sweet enough to make Agatha blush, smug enough to make Agatha want to headbutt the shit out of her fiancée to see if it’d shrink her ballooning ego.</p><p> </p><p>“Now. Let me try that again,” Rio murmured, smirking at the rare sight of Agatha Harkness rendered fucking mute, “do you, Agatha Harkness, have any ideas for where you want to take your future wife on a honeymoon? Answer nicely… and use the word <em>honeymoon</em>, please<em>.</em> I’d like to watch the way your mouth moves when you say it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uhh,” was the first brilliant contribution Agatha managed, which she found impressive, considering it felt like Rio had reached straight into the folds of her brain and was rifling through her thoughts with the same casual disregard she used on Agatha’s mail.</p><p> </p><p>“Take your time, love,” Rio said, completely serious.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I <em>am</em> taking my time,” Agatha said, jerking up her head to make it look like she might do something about it. “It’s not easy making decisions when you’re fogging up my brain with your hot breath. I’m torn between biting you and headbutting you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, thrilled by the threat. “¿Por qué no los dos?” <em>Why not both</em>, she asked, fucking beaming.</p><p> </p><p>“You annoy the absolute fuck out of me,” Agatha whispered, cheeks aching from how much she’d been smiling.</p><p> </p><p>“And you’re about to commit to a lifetime of it. Sucks to suck,” Rio said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio -grinning like she’d won something- was still on top of Agatha, radiating warmth and chaos and that relentless, stupid joy that always caught Agatha off guard, no matter how much she braced for it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha breathed, “Kiss me before I start crying, please.”</p><p> </p><p>And Rio -predictably, wonderfully pathetic for Agatha- did.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, helpless against it now, kissed her back like she'd finally caught up to what her heart had decided ages ago.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
