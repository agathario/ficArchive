<h2>
    What a Night
   </h2>
<div>
<p>
     "So, a couple ground rules," Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     From the back seat, a chorus of groans rose from Pietro, Lenny, and Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     "Bachelor parties aren't really supposed to have rules," Lenny pointed out.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, mine does. Rule one, no strippers."
    </p>
<p>
     "But what if..."
    </p>
<p>
     "No, not even Janine. Rule two, no drugs."
    </p>
<p>
     "Not even a gummy?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes as Jen cackled in the passenger's seat.
    </p>
<p>
     "Look, Lenore, you're my sister. I love you. But so help me..."
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, okay. Fine. No drugs."
    </p>
<p>
     "How are you supposed to have any fun at your own bachelor party without any fun stuff?" Alice asked.
    </p>
<p>
     "Trust me, it is entirely possible to have fun without getting a lap dance or getting bombed."
    </p>
<p>
     "I am kinda curious," Jen piped up, "what sort of party we're having, exactly? I mean, none of the expected..."
    </p>
<p>
     "I booked a hotel suite and got an erotic cake," Rio said, starting the car.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     "Oh, honey, this is gonna be the best bachelorette party in the history of... What
     <u>
      is
     </u>
     the name of this little backwater you call home?"
    </p>
<p>
     "It's Westview, Aunt Jen."
    </p>
<p>
     "Right. Well, I took the liberty of booking us a party bus, and a hotel suite for after!"
    </p>
<p>
     Aunt Jen's current paramour, a girl she had picked up during some consulting work in Indiana, shifted uncomfortably on the couch and stared at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Jen told me you're a witch. Are you a witch?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I do practice a form of neopagan..." Agatha began.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can we do a blood ritual?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Uh..."
    </p>
<p>
     "April," Aunt Jen said, "let's save the blood rituals for later."
    </p>
<p>
     Choosing to ignore the entire exchange, Agatha went to the window and noticed Lilia's car just pulling into the driveway, followed shortly after by a car she did not immediately recognize.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, hey, more guests," Agatha said, excusing herself to answer the door.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, Agatha," Lilia crowed, "happy final weekend of freedom!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, Lilia. C'mon in, make yourself at home."
    </p>
<p>
     The driver of the other car emerged, and Agatha smiled to see her cousin Lily.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, stranger!" Lily called.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, stranger!" Agatha replied, and went to meet Lily halfway for a hug.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had actually been most looking forward to seeing her cousin. Some of her only happy early childhood memories revolved around getting to visit her dad's family and hanging out with Lily.
    </p>
<p>
     Lily's wife, Jordan, was just unfolding herself from the passenger's seat, and Agatha waved at her. They had only ever met twice, but Agatha liked her; she was funny, a little wild, and seemed perfect for Lily.
    </p>
<p>
     As they trooped into the house, Lily and Agatha were chatting up a storm, but they lapsed into silence as they entered the living room.
    </p>
<p>
     Aunt Jen was on her phone, having some sort of very heated, probably work related, argument. Lilia was trying to help herself to some of the available refreshments, but April had adopted some weird sort of dominance posture and was blocking every attempt.
    </p>
<p>
     "How do I know you're actually an invited guest?" April muttered.
    </p>
<p>
     "Young lady, I..."
    </p>
<p>
     "SILENCE, WENCH!"
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The suite was great: well-stocked minibar, massive TV with a high-end sound system, and there was a hot tub on the balcony.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course, Lenny and Alice had immediately commandeered said hot tub, and judging by the sounds, they were having a great time. Meanwhile, in the main room, a few more guests had trickled in.
    </p>
<p>
     Phil and Herb were arguing the merits of various fishing flies, while Norm was staring at the TV, struggling to order up an adult film or six. Rio, Jen, Pietro, and Ralph were having a deeply philosophical debate about sports â€” well, mostly they were verbally tearing each other's favorite teams apart.
    </p>
<p>
     When there was a knock at the door, Rio sighed, figuring it was management with a noise complaint. Hurrying over, they had excuses and promises all ready.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi, hey, look, I'll tell everyone to quiet..."
    </p>
<p>
     The words trailed off to a choked "huh" when they saw who was actually on the other side of the door.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi!" the bubbly blonde squeaked.
    </p>
<p>
     "Uh, Janine," Rio nodded, "you here to see Lenny and Alice?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hoped against hope that was the case.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, silly! It's your party, isn't it?"
    </p>
<p>
     Groaning, Rio stepped aside and let Janine into the suite. They liked this woman well enough, ever since Lenny and Alice had gotten serious about introducing her everywhere as "our little third" a few months back. Janine was sweet, kind, a little vague...
    </p>
<p>
     She was also a stripper, and from the look of things Lenny and Alice had invited her as entertainment for the party despite Rio making it clear even
     <u>
      before
     </u>
     tonight that it was not going to be that kind of party.
    </p>
<p>
     "Fuck," Rio muttered, shutting the door.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     When the "party bus" showed up, it turned out not to be quite what Aunt Jen had anticipated. It was nice, but Aunt Jen declared it "low-end" and "dinky looking" and started demanding a refund from the driver, who just shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     "Look, ladies, I just drive this thing. You in or out?"
    </p>
<p>
     Of course, they went ahead and boarded, and an hour and a half later, as the bus circled through downtown for what felt like the billionth time, even Aunt Jen seemed pleased.
    </p>
<p>
     Well, actually, she seemed more blasted out of her mind and highly entertained as she watched April do body shots off of Lilia. Everyone else was scattered around, drinking (Jordan and Monica) or dancing (Lily, Yelena, and Natasha) or hitting on the driver (Dottie) or barfing out the windows (Darcy).
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha found herself mostly just wanting to go home.
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Janine had started to dance, and some of the gang seemed quite pleased. Then Lenny reappeared from out on the balcony, dripping wet, and beckoned Janine away. Some of the guys had grumbled after that, but then Norm finally figured out the system, and now some softcore movie from the '90s was blasting away on the TV.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, the guy showed up with the cake.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a little less erotic than the pictures on the website had implied it would be, but hey, it was a cake!
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     The bus had pulled over just at the edge of town for what the driver insisted was "tire trouble." Why he needed Dottie to accompany him out back of the bus for said tire trouble was not made clear, but everyone could guess.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was really regretting doing this. Sure, it was great having a night out with friends and relatives, but a lot of her guests were talking about how this was her last chance to be free. They kept saying that after this, she would be "domesticated" and never have a chance to have fun again.
    </p>
<p>
     But she already felt domesticated, and she liked it. She liked being at home with Rio and the boys. She liked the most regular part of her social life being Sunday brunches or Tuesday lunches with Lilia, as well as coven gatherings.
    </p>
<p>
     She had not really expected this, but she liked her quiet life.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up to see Lily smiling at her. When she smiled back, her cousin sat down beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You don't look like you're having the best time," Lily said.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... I am. I mean, it's fun, but..."
    </p>
<p>
     "But it's kind of a lot?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah."
    </p>
<p>
     "Nervous about the wedding, or just overdosed on socializing?"
    </p>
<p>
     "The latter. Definitely the latter."
    </p>
<p>
     "Thought so. I remember when you'd visit when we were kids. You always seemed so nervous around large gatherings."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's not that I don't want to be sociable. It's just..."
    </p>
<p>
     "You like a quiet life at home?"
    </p>
<p>
     "What are you, a mind reader?"
    </p>
<p>
     Lily laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     "Just your cousin who knows you a little better than you might think. Can I tell you a secret?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Sure."
    </p>
<p>
     "Jordan and I almost skipped out on tonight.Â  Not that we don't love you, but..."
    </p>
<p>
     "I get it. You're not party people."
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, we can be. But lately, we've sort of circled the wagons, as it were, for a few reasons. Maybe things'll change again one day, but for now we like spending a lot of free time together, or with a very select circle of friends."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     "Guess you guys have it all figured out."
    </p>
<p>
     "Nope. We just work it out as we go along. And you can do that too. Sure, some people seem to think that you need to still be living wild at 25, but if that's not you, that's not you. And anyway, Rio's nearly 30, right?"
    </p>
<p>
     "28," Agatha nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, lots of people settle down by then."
    </p>
<p>
     "That's another thing. I'm not sure Rio's actually really into settling down."
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, please! I may not know Rio well, but from what I do know, and what you've told me, they seem excited as all get out to be settling down with you."
    </p>
<p>
     Lily took Agatha's hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "Would Rio have proposed if they weren't ready to settle down?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't know."
    </p>
<p>
     "I bet they wouldn't. Rio loves you, Agatha. Anyone who's ever seen you two together knows that."
    </p>
<hr/>
<p>
     Things had quieted down after the cake; even Lenny, Alice, and Janine had come in from the balcony and headed to the bedroom, passing out together in a pile. Everyone else was strewn around the suite, dozing off or half-watching some dumb shit on the TV or tossing obscene party favors at one another. Rio and Jen were the two most conscious and with-it, though Jen was developing what she called "the feminine urge to Sharpie a dick on Bohner's face" and Rio was feeling sort of sugar crashy.
    </p>
<p>
     From the sound of things, a boisterous party had taken over the suite next door at some point. It was getting pretty loud, and Rio scrambled to their feet.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm... I'm gonna go talk to 'em."
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio," Jen warned.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm gonna go talk to 'em!"
    </p>
<p>
     "And what? Get your ass kicked by probably a bunch of douchey frat bros? You wanna end up getting married at the hospital, in traction?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Just gonna tell 'em to quiet down."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shambled out the door, then paused a moment in the hall to get their bearings. The suite on the left was the loud one.
    </p>
<p>
     They had to knock on the door pretty loudly six different times. After the sixth, they leaned their forehead against the door, appreciating the coolness.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course, when the door opened, they nearly toppled into the room, only to end up braced by gentle arms.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha? Babe, are you... Is everything okay? How'd you get here?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Aunt Jen booked a party bus and then a suite."
    </p>
<p>
     "I am a GOD-DAMNED MIRACLE WORKER!" a voice called out from somewhere else in the suite.
    </p>
<p>
     "Fuck yeah you are," someone replied, a loud slap punctuating the comment.
    </p>
<p>
     "That would be Aunt Jen and her new lover April," Agatha said with a sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     "They sound... Intense."
    </p>
<p>
     "They took over the bedroom almost as soon as we got here."
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, good for them, I guess," Rio shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dragged Rio further inside and closed the door. Stepping over a passed out Natasha, the couple made their way to the center of the main room. It was kind of a wreck. Dottie was curled up in an armchair, snoring away, and Yelena was sitting against the wall, hugging a bottle of rum protectively. Monica and Darcy were all over the place, engaging in a raucous fencing match, using dildos as weapons.
    </p>
<p>
     "Lilia went in there with Aunt Jen and April," Agatha said, indicating the bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     "She okay?"

     "I checked in, and she was snoozing on the foot of the bed. The bed upon which my Aunt Jennifer is getting absolutely railed to next Christmas."
    </p>
<p>
     "Holy shit," Rio whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     "I thought about gouging my eyes out," Agatha said, "but I figured I'd still have to hear them, so I let it go."
    </p>
<p>
     Surveying the carnage, Rio saw one thing that looked okay. Agatha's cousin, Lily, was on the sofa, snuggled up in the lap of her wife Jordan. The two were talking quietly, kissing now and then, and seemed to only have eyes for each other.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... I want what they have," Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     "What, high pressure careers in Boston and a baby on the way?" Agatha teased.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean... I mean look. It's like for them there's no one here but them. That's how I feel when I'm with you; like we're the center of our own universe. I want us to stay like that."
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe we can."
    </p>
<p>
     Grabbing Agatha's hand, Rio squeezed it gently.
    </p>
<p>
     "Wanna go home?" they asked.
    </p>
<p>
     "What?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I know it's late, but Mrs. Hart probably won't mind if we swing by to pick up the boys and just take 'em home."
    </p>
<p>
     "But your party..."
    </p>
<p>
     "Is kinda dead. And it looks like yours is heading that way."
    </p>
<p>
     Turning to Agatha, Rio pulled her close and kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Look, at this point," they said, "we've got a little more than a day until the wedding. I wanna spend that time just... Just being with my family. With you and the kids..."
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't want to ruin your good time," Agatha said tearfully.
    </p>
<p>
     "You won't,
     <em>
      querida
     </em>
     . You never have. If you don't wanna go..."
    </p>
<p>
     "I do. I wanna go home so much."
    </p>
<p>
     "Then let's go."
    </p>
<p>
     Leaving word with Lily, and in the next suite over with Jen, Rio and Agatha ducked out.
